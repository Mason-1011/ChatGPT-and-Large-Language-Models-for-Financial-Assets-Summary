Business overview continued

We are well positioned for sustainable growth

Our five strategic 
growth pillars

Leader in 
the growing  
non-alcoholic  
ready-to-drink 
category
We are a leader in the growing 
and dynamic non-alcoholic-
ready-to-drink (NARTD) 
category. The CAGR1 of NARTD 
between 2024 and 2028 is 
expected to be 4-6%1.

Within NARTD, we are number 
one in the Sparkling category 
in 23 out of our 24 measured 
markets. Energy as a category 
continues to grow rapidly and 
we have a range of brands to 
appeal to different consumers 
across many price points.

The strongest, 
broadest portfolio 
of brands, 
anchored around 
an exceptional 
partnership with 
The Coca-Cola 
Company 
We have high-growth 
opportunities across high-value 
occasions and categories. 
Our flexible portfolio caters 
to a growing range of tastes 
and preferences, with a wider 
choice of both affordable and 
premium products, and a wide 
range of healthier options. 

Our Sparkling portfolio has 
evolved with the proliferation 
of zero-sugar and light variants, 
single-serve packs and broader 
innovation in flavours.

A diverse, 
balanced country 
portfolio with 
strong exposure 
to attractive 
growth markets
Our geographic footprint 
creates a diverse balance. 
We have exposure to fast-
growing Emerging and 
Developing markets as 
well as a strong foundation 
in Established markets. 

We also benefit from the 
portfolio effect of exposure 
to different economic cycles, 
and we are proven operators 
in managing risk in a variety 
of socio-economic conditions.

Strong capital 
allocation 
framework 
to drive growth, 
underpinned by 
relentless focus on 
cost and efficiency 
We have a strong track record 
of driving cost efficiencies and 
this remains an important part 
of our strategy. 

Digital plays an ever-increasing 
role in continuing to drive 
efficiencies in our supply chain. 
To ensure our business is fit for 
the future, we are transforming 
and digitalising many of our 
supply chain and sales execution 
processes, creating capacity 
to accelerate our growth.

A clear vision, 
strategy  
and targets
The beverage category 
continues to expand and we see 
strong growth opportunities 
within our evolving brand 
portfolio and the markets 
in which we operate. 

We have strong positions in, and 
a clear focus on, our strategic 
priority categories: Sparkling, 
Energy and Coffee.

Our growth strategy reflects 
our vision to be the leading 
24/7 beverage partner and 
deliver best-in-class financial 
returns. It is built on five 
key pillars of growth, each 
of which is a core strength

Chairman’s letter

Leadership for long-term success

I have great optimism for 
the years ahead, knowing we 
have built strong foundations 
through thoughtful investment, 
an adaptable culture and 
sustainability leadership.

I look forward to the moments 
that we will open up for all our 
people, customers, partners 
and wider stakeholders in 2024.”

The Group’s capital allocation framework follows 
clear priorities: organic investment in the business 
to drive delivery of our medium-term financial 
targets; paying a progressive dividend; strategic 
M&A; and additional capital returns. With these 
priorities in mind, the Board believed that the 
2023 share price undervalued future growth 
opportunities, and approved a share buyback 
programme aimed at returning up to €400 million 
to shareholders. This is a compelling opportunity 
to enhance value for shareholders, while 
continuing to invest in the business.

Looking ahead
Another record year in 2023 is evidence that our 
approach is the right one. We can be proud to be 
able to reward colleagues around the Group for 
their dedication and professionalism during often 
challenging times. Thanks, as always, to the Board 
for steering the ship in another productive year, 
and we look forward to the moments that we will 
open up for all our people, customers, partners 
and wider stakeholders in 2024. 

Anastassis G. David
Chairman of the Board

Dear Stakeholder,
Underpinned by a new, clear purpose and by 
consistently applying our 24/7 beverage strategy, 
Zoran and the executive team have delivered 
another year of strong operational and strategic 
progress and record financial results. 

Leading with purpose and responsibility
The Board has been proactive in representing 
the interests of all stakeholders on diverse issues, 
assisting the leadership team to make informed 
decisions on strategic investments, stretching 
goals and sustainability. 

At our investor day in Rome, Zoran, Ben, Naya and 
the team outlined how our Growth Story 2025 is 
driving revenue growth, margin improvements 
and sustained strong cash generation. I speak on 
behalf of the Board when I express great optimism 
for the years ahead, knowing we have built strong 
foundations through thoughtful investment, an 
adaptable culture and sustainability leadership.

Our new Board members
I was delighted to welcome two new Board 
members, Evguenia Stoichkova and George 
Pavlos Leventis, in 2023. They bring a wealth of 
experience from the beverage sector, and I am 
looking forward to working with them. 

Dividend growth and capital returns
The Board has maintained our progressive 
dividend, and for 2023 is proposing €0.93 per 
share, a 19% increase on the dividend per share 
versus the prior year, representing a 45% pay-out 
ratio, within our targeted range of 40% to 50% of 
comparable EPS. The consistent growth in our 
dividend is testament to our confidence in the 
strong fundamentals of our business, as well as 
our commitment to shareholders.

Chief Executive Officer’s letter 

A refreshing purpose

In 2023, we achieved a third 
consecutive year of double-digit 
growth and record profit while 
building on our Hellenic culture. 
I am deeply proud of all that our 
dedicated team achieved together 
and, more importantly, how we 
delivered it with our incredible 
team spirit. We look forward to all 
that we can achieve in 2024 as we 
build on our strong relationships 
with our partners and customers, 
creating value for all we serve.”

In 2023, we delivered strong results as we 
built on the momentum of the last few years, 
focusing on partnerships, our 24/7 portfolio 
and excellent execution. We invested in our 
people and capabilities and made steady progress 
towards a more sustainable future. All of this was 
underpinned by the definition of our purpose: 
Open up moments that refresh us all. This 
purpose is our North Star and draws on over 70 
years of history. It is based on our innate values 
and our hopes for our next chapter of growth 
as we open up many new opportunities with 
our customers, partners and communities.

Fundamentally, we aim to drive impact, operating 
always with a growth mindset and a belief in 
creating a better shared future. Our colleagues 
across all our markets have truly embraced our 
refreshed purpose, energised to be collaborative, 
more resilient, and more agile in how we do things.

After three challenging years, managing carefully 
through the COVID-19 pandemic, the war in 
Ukraine and the economic headwinds of high 
inflation and sometimes weaker consumer 
spending, 2023 came with new challenges which 
we were ready to adapt to. Our dedicated and 
talented team came together to deliver another 
year of strong growth, improving margins and 
record revenues and profit.

Strong partnerships, a 24/7 portfolio 
and unrivalled market execution
We believe that strong partnerships are 
fundamental to growth. With our vision to be 
the leading 24/7 beverage partner, we strive with 
determination to be the first choice and preferred 
partner for collaboration. Hand in hand with 
The Coca-Cola Company (TCCC), Monster, all our 
brand partners and suppliers, and alongside our 
customers, we are winning with agility, innovation 
and a future-focused approach.

Our priority categories of Sparkling, Energy 
and Coffee represent close to 80% of the 
revenue of the business, with significant 
headroom for growth, driven by increased 
consumer consumption and share gains, 
supported by innovation, strong customer 
relationships and unrivalled market execution. 

Our partnership with TCCC is at the heart of our 
24/7 portfolio success, starting with our core 
focus behind our wide range of excellent sparkling 
brands, which are loved across all our markets. 

Likewise, with Monster we are able to offer high- 
quality energy brands across the price point 
spectrum – from Predator and Monster to Burn. 

In 2023, our coffee strategy with Costa Coffee 
and Caffè Vergnano worked very well across the 
mass-premium and premium segments, with 
volume growth over 30%.

Chief Executive Officer’s letter continued

With our business 
developers in 
Greece

Building on our strong relationships with both 
TCCC and Brown-Forman, we were pleased to 
launch ready-to-drink Jack Daniels and Coca-Cola 
in several markets with more planned for 2024.

In Premium Spirits, our portfolio was enhanced 
with the acquisition of Finlandia. This highly 
regarded vodka brand paves the way for 
incremental growth for our core portfolio, through 
enhanced mixability and relevance in strategically 
important channels, such as HoReCa.

Opening up a more sustainable future 
In 2023, our global industry leadership in 
sustainability was confirmed when, for the 
seventh time, we were rated the world’s most 
sustainable beverage company by the Dow Jones 
Sustainability Indices (DJSI). We now have the 
highest scores and rankings in ten of the most-
recognised ESG ratings, including CDP Climate 
and Water, ISS ESG, MSCI ESG, Sustainalytics, 
FTSE4Good and Vigeo Eiris. 

Meeting colleagues 
at the opening of 
our new returnable 
glass bottling line in 
Austria 

Investing for growth
Throughout 2023, we invested in technology, 
innovation, partnerships, and in building our 
bespoke capabilities, undertaking more digital 
transformations and integrations than ever 
before. This will ensure we remain competitive, 
agile and ready for future growth.

We have one of the strongest sales teams in the 
industry thanks to consistent investment behind 
our comprehensive development programme, 
Sales Academy. We recognise that the capabilities 
of our sales teams are critical to our success and 
the success of our customers. 

Similarly, in 2023, our Data and Analytics Academy 
was rolled out across all business units and 
functions to accelerate a culture of data-driven 
and insight-led decision making. 

Throughout the year, we invested in 
programmes to simplify our business and 
make our colleagues’ lives easier. For example, 
Project Oxygen is reducing complexity to enable 
focus on value-adding activities, always having 
the customer experience in mind. 

Meanwhile, we continued to strengthen the 
diversity of our workforce through workplace 
inclusion activities and with steady progress 
towards gender balance. With employee 
engagement scores rising further in 2023, 
it is an encouraging sign that our approach 
to people and culture is on the right track.

Critically, we made great progress towards our 
Mission 2025 goals as well as our aim to achieve 
net zero emissions by 2040 and have a net positive 
impact on biodiversity in critical areas of our value 
chain. All this progress is the result of our clear 
vision and targets in sustainability, our bold and 
entrepreneurial mindset, and our strong belief 
that sustainability is a true creator of growth 
and value for our business, our partners and 
our customers. 

Reflecting on some highlights from 2023, 
Romania became our first market to have all 
three elements of plastic packaging circularity. 
With the introduction of a Deposit Return Scheme 
which we championed, collection rates will be 
significantly increased in the market. In 2023, 
we also invested in in-house recycling capability 
in Romania, building on similar investments in Italy 
and Poland. With the investment in Romania, we 
are able to produce 100% of our plastic bottles 
from recycled material. In this way, we close the 
circle so that the bottles we put into the market 
will be returned, recycled and given new life as a 
new bottle. This is just one example as, by the end 
of 2023, we had deposit return schemes in six of 
our markets and 42% of the plastic we used in our 
bottles across our EU and Swiss markets was rPET.

Chief Executive Officer’s letter continued 

We continue to drive innovations in 
sustainable packaging. For example, in 
Austria we commissioned a new returnable 
glass bottle line for both our universal 1 litre and 
new 400ml refillable bottles, and introduced 
an industry-leading, innovative paper solution 
to replace shrink plastic film on multi-packs 
of 1.5 litre PET bottles. Innovation is critical 
to developing new technologies and, for this 
reason, we became a partner in the $137.7 million 
Greycroft Coca-Cola System Sustainability Fund, 
with seven other bottlers and TCCC, focusing 
on developing innovative packaging and other 
carbon reduction solutions.

As I reflect on the scale of the challenge, I am 
encouraged that our continued investment 
in technology, innovation and partnerships 
alongside our culture of learning and trying 
new things will help us carve the path to a 
more sustainable future. 

In true Hellenic spirit, we continued to focus on 
making a positive impact on the communities 
in which we operate. Through our flagship 
community programme, #YouthEmpowered, 
we have supported young people with training 
and development, reaching almost 1 million 
individuals since 2017. 

Participating in a panel discussion 
at the opening of our rPET facility 
opening in Romania

I would like to close by thanking all my colleagues 
for their tireless efforts, for their commitment to 
our company vision, our customers and partners. 

I would also like to thank our customers, The 
Coca-Cola Company and all our partners for 
their ongoing trust and support throughout the 
year, which motivates us to keep raising the bar. 
Together, we have achieved great things; we 
have made a difference and created value for all 
we serve. I look forward to all that we will achieve 
together in 2024 as we open up moments that 
refresh us all.

Chief Executive Officer (CEO)

Bogdanovic, on how we opened up moments

We also played our part to help communities 
in need with product donations, volunteering 
initiatives and disaster relief activities. Building 
on our long-standing tradition of community 
action, in 2023 we announced the establishment 
of a charitable foundation – The Coca-Cola HBC 
Foundation – with an initial donation of €10 million, 
dedicated to supporting local communities. 
This will empower us to take action quickly 
where it is needed most. 

In 2023, we continued to support our colleagues 
and communities in Ukraine. Since the start of the 
war, more than $35 million has been committed 
together with the Coca-Cola System and The 
Coca-Cola Foundation to support those in need. 

Strong financial performance
Our clear purpose and vision, trusting 
partnerships, unbeatable portfolio, consistent 
investment, excellent market execution by a 
customer-focussed, talented and compassionate 
team have resulted in a third year of double-digit 
growth and record profits. This year, I am deeply 
proud of the team as together, we crossed a 
historic milestone exceeding for the first time 
€10 billion of revenue and €1 billion of comparable 
EBIT. In this year of strong financial performance, 
we launched a share buyback programme, further 
increasing our returns to shareholders.

Outlook for 2024 and beyond
Throughout 2023 and in recent years, we have 
built strong momentum and great resilience 
to overcome the challenges we face while 
growing the business the right way. Although 
we expect the macroeconomic and geopolitical 
environment to remain challenging in 2024, 
I am confident we have all the ingredients 
for continued growth and success. We will 
remain focused on premiumisation and 
affordability, leveraging our 24/7 portfolio and 
our partnerships. We will continue to listen to 
our customers and consumers, understanding 
market trends while investing in and deploying 
our bespoke capabilities.

Bringing our Culture Story to life continued

Our Culture Story builds 
on solid foundations from 
the past five years 

It is a story about who we are, our purpose, our vision, 
our values, how we need to evolve and the behaviours 
we commit to each other at Hellenic. 

Underpinning	our	new	purpose	are	our	values	that	underline	
our	culture	and	are	incorporated	in	our	new	leadership	model.	
Everything	we	do	drives	impact	–	turning	our	actions	into	results.

1.

We introduced our new 
leadership model at our 
Leadership Conference 
in Cairo in March. 
It	translates	our	values	into	
key behaviours,	clearly	stating	
how	we	do	things	in	Hellenic	
and	act	at	our	best.

CUSTOMER  
FIRST

We are always 
customer-centric. 
We believe in the 
power of listening 
to understand, 
always acting 
to exceed our 
customers’ 
expectations.

WE OVER I

MAKE IT  
SIMPLE

DELIVER  
SUSTAINABLY

We love smart 
people, but we 
believe the power 
of a team can 
achieve what 
an individual can 
only dream of.

We nurture 
curiosity and 
agility, and we 
believe that 
complexity can be 
reduced by having 
the discipline 
and courage to 
focus on what 
matters most.

We are built to 
last and believe 
in achieving 
sustainable 
results, creating 
and sharing value 
for our people, 
environment, 
shareholders and 
the communities 
we serve.

We set up townhall events 
to engage colleagues in our 
new purpose, values and 
Culture Story.
And	we	set	up	‘culture	labs’	to	
build	a	common	understanding	
across	the	business	and	for	
teams	to	embed	the	culture	
in the	everyday.	Our	business	
units	have	taken	the	Culture	
Story	forward	in	their	own	locally	
relevant	ways	–	from	internal	
roadshows	to	commercial	
events	–	linking	our	culture	to	our	
business	goals	and	priorities.	

We	have	listened	to	colleagues’	
thoughts	and	experiences	
around	our	Culture	Story,	starting	
with	our	culture	and	engagement	
survey	in September	2023.	

From	asking	the	question	
‘why?’	and	from	listening	to	our	
colleagues,	we	learned	that	our	
employees	feel	proud	to	be	part	
of	CCHBC,	they	feel	respected	

2.

and	work	in	a	safe	environment.	
They	believe	strongly	in	our	
strategic	priorities,	and	they	see	
the	link	between	these	priorities	
and	their	work.	Of	course,	we	
are	at	the	start	of	our	journey	in	
embedding	our	new	leadership	
model	and	our	values,	and	in	
2024	we	have	a	full	programme	
to	make	living	our	culture	a	
refreshing	part	of the	everyday.

1.	In	Serbia	and	Montenegro,	senior	leaders	
meet,	connecting	values	with	strategic	
business	unit	priorities	in	panel	discussions.

2.	Adria	(Bosnia	and	Herzegovina,	Croatia	
and	Slovenia):	one	of	the	culture	labs	bringing	
colleagues	together	from	across	the	
business	to	put	actionable	plans	into	place.

3.	To	support	the	roll-out	of	our	refined	
purpose,	a	new	culture	manifesto	is	being	
introduced,	along	with	a	new	leadership	model,	
during	the	Leadership Conference in Cairo.

4.	Greece	and	Cyprus:	internal	roadshows	
and	engagement	days to	manifest	our	
culture	and	boost	engagement.

professionals, preparing them for 
working in catering or tourism in 
their respective countries.

In	2023,	we	launched	an	innovative	packaging	
solution	for	1.5	litre	Coca-Cola,	Fanta	and	Sprite	
multipacks,	replacing	plastic	with	100%	recyclable	
paper,	in	Austria.	

Hug-IT	is	a	stretchable	paper	band	that	replaces	
plastic	film,	securely	holding	a	six-bottle	multi-
pack	during	transportation	from	customer	shelf	
to consumer’s	cupboard,	ensuring	it	stays	intact	
and	that	our	branding	looks	great.

We	worked	closely	with	paper	manufacturer	Mondi

In	2023,	we	stepped	up	our	ESG	conversations	
with	investors,	opening	up	a	two-way	dialogue	
on a	wide	range	of	topics.

The Company is clearly on the front foot 
when it comes to things like DRS, and 
people value the work with different 
stakeholders to nudge policy change. 
One area opened up for me in 2023, 
was understanding the sheer level 
of effort and resources that goes on 
behind the scenes on this – more than 
I anticipated.”

Market trends

We operate in fundamentally attractive categories, supported 
in the long-term by population growth, growing personal 
spending power and a product that opens up moments that

Non-alcoholic	ready-to-drink	(NARTD)	is	a	
large,	growing	and	resilient	category,	and	the	
same	characteristics	are	present	in	coffee,	
making	it	an	incredibly	attractive	opportunity	
for	us	as	well.	In	terms	of	the	industry	value,	we	
expect	further	strong	growth	in	demand	both	in	
NARTD	and	coffee.	Increased	demand	is	driven	
by	population	growth	in	many	of	our	markets,	
plus	category	expansion	–	the	propensity	for	
consumer	tastes	to change	and	expand	and	how	
we	both	spark	and	satisfy	demand.

We	measure	servings	per	capita	in	our	markets,	
and	can	see	where	there	is	headroom	to	
grow consumption.

We	also	look	at	purchasing	power	in	our	markets	
and	react	with	appropriate	offerings	to	address	
affordability	and	meet	consumer	needs.

	Based	on	internal	industry	estimates	and	UN	Population	1	July	2022,	
excluding	Russia	and	Ukraine.

While there are 
significant geopolitical 
and economic trends 
that can influence 
overall market growth, 
our focus is mainly on 
the following five areas: 
retail, consumer, digital, 
sustainability and 
regulatory. These areas 
are where we react 
dynamically and create 
long-term value for our 
customers, consumers 
and shareholders.

Retail

Trends within our portfolio
In	2023,	category	value	growth	grew	significantly,	
reflecting	inflation-related	price	increases	and	mix	
changes	with	a	greater	focus	on	single-serve	packs.	

Category	volume	increases	were	lower	than	in	
2022,	reflecting	tougher	comparatives	and	in	some	
markets	weaker	consumer	spending	power.	Weaker	
consumer	demand	also	impacted	volumes	in	hotels,	
restaurants	and	cafes,	although	value	growth	
remained	healthy.	

The	impact	of	private	label	in	our	categories	
remained	modest,	with	the	biggest	shifts	being	
seen in	the	less	differentiated	category	of	water.

How we are responding
We	sustained	our	focus	on	improving	our	single-
serve	mix	and	continued	driving	the	shift	from	multi-
serve	packs	to	single-serve	packs	across	all	markets,	
and	in	both	the	at-home	and	out-of-home	channels.	

We	continued	to	invest	in	digital	tools	and	our	
data,	insights	and	analytics	capability	to	ensure	we	
provided	retail	customers	with	relevant	insights	
to	maximise	their	value-added.	This	contributed	
to	an	improved	Net	Promoter	Score	(NPS),	further	
improvements	to	pack	mix,	and	value	and	volume	
share	gains	in	key	channels	and	most	major	markets.

Market trends continued

Consumer

Digital

Sustainability

Regulatory

Trends within our portfolio
Cost	of	living	remains	an	important	theme,	with	
sustained	high	levels	of	food	inflation	in	many	
markets	putting	consumers’	disposable	income	
under	pressure.	

As	a	result,	consumers	have	become	more	
sensitive	to	price	increases,	although	in	our	NARTD	
and	Sparkling	categories,	volumes	have	held	up	
remarkably	well.	While	affordability	remains	a	key	
theme,	premiumisation	opportunities	remain	as	
shoppers	seek	quality	and	small	treats	despite	
budget	pressures.

How we are responding
We	continue	to	adapt	our	portfolio	to	deliver	
both	affordable	offerings	as	well	as	premium	
products	presented	in	appropriate	packs	sizes	and	
combinations	to	offer	consumers	attractive	choice.	

To	support	category	growth,	we	have	focused	
on	a	wider	range	of	single-serve	offerings	–	and	
multi-packs	of	single	serves,	as	well	as	affordable	
multi-serve	options.	This	allows	us	to	compete	
at	attractive	price	points	for	the	consumer	and	
penetrate	smaller	baskets	in	a	more	effective	way.

Trends within our portfolio
2023	continued	the	global	digitalisation	trend.	
Consumers	have	become	much	more	comfortable	
and	familiar	with	e-commerce.	Technology	has	
advanced,	and	both	convenience	and	ease-of-use	of	
online	shopping	have	improved.	Companies	continue	
to	invest	in	digital	tools	to	improve	efficiency	of	
operations,	customer	service	and	the	effectiveness	
of	their	marketing	spend.	Artificial	Intelligence	(AI)	
was	the	story	of	2023,	with companies	embracing	AI	
tool	within	their	day-to-day	operations.

How we are responding
Our	investments	in	digital	focus	on	driving	higher	
customer	centricity	-	a	personalised	service	for	
every	outlet,	an	improved	employee	experience,	and	
increased	operational	productivity	-	all	delivering	
stronger	performance,	faster.	

We	have	been	investing	to	support	this	through	both	
building	talented	in-house	teams	as	well	as	working	
with	leading	technology	partners.	For	example,	our	
business-to-business	(B2B)	platform,	Customer	Portal,	
is	now	well	embedded	across	all	our	markets	and	
strengthens	our	customer	relationship	management.	

We	have	also	developed	eMarketplace	solutions	with	
SIRVIS,	to	address	a	growing	need	for	smaller	customers	
looking	for	effective	purchasing	aggregation.	We	are	
also	investing	in	smart	vending solutions.

We	are	also	embracing	AI	and	are	developing	in-
house	generative	AI	productivity	tools.

Trends within our portfolio
The	sustainability	landscape	is	changing	rapidly	and	
the	rate	of	increase	of	net-zero	commitments	by	
organisations	continues	to	grow.	We	see	increasing	
focus	on	nature	and	aspirations	to	shift	to	a	nature-
positive	world,	where	people	and	nature	can	thrive	
together,	requiring	a	holistic	approach	to	the	inter-
dependencies,	risks	and	impacts	across	ESG	areas.

Of	note	in	2023	was	COP	28	in	Dubai,	where	the	
first-ever	COP	decision	to	address	fossil	fuels	was	
adopted:	a	decision	calling	for	accelerated	short-term	
action	and	an	orderly	transition	away	from	fossil	fuels	
towards	climate-neutral	energy	systems.	It	signals	
the	‘beginning	of	the	end’	of	the	fossil	fuel	era,	which	
cannot	happen	without	just	and	equitable	transition,	
major	decarbonisation	and	scaled-up	finance.

How we are responding
We	are	keenly	aware	of	the	importance	of	delivering	
on	our	plans.	We	continue	to	decarbonise	our	value	
chain,	while	updating	our	net-zero	transition	plan	and	
developing	long-term	climate	scenarios.	We	are	also	
working	towards	our	bold	commitment	of	achieving	
a	net-positive	impact	on	biodiversity	by	2040,	
implementing	the	guidelines	of	the	Science	Based	
Targets	Network,	and	we	shifted	our	deforestation-
free	commitment	from	2030	to	2025.

We	continue	to	expand	our	partnerships	and	
seek	new	collaborations,	as	our	ambitious	goals	
and commitments	can	only	be	achieved	through	
collective	action.

Trends within our portfolio
In	2023,	policy	makers	introduced	several	measures	
to	offset	infationary	pressures	on	consumers,	
including	price	caps	in	specific	product	categories	
and	additional	tax	measures.	Sustainability	remained	
in	the	spotlight	in	the	EU,	with	the	Packaging	and	
Packaging	Waste	Regulation	(PPWR)	at	the	forefront,	
followed	by	proposals	on	consumer	protection	
from	greenwashing,	such	as	the	directives	for	
Empowering	Consumers	for	the	Green	Transition	
and	Green	Claims.	Significant	progress	was	made	
in	the	preparation	and	implementation	of	DRS	
in	several	European	countries.	Finally,	the	World	
Health	Organisation	continued	reviewing	non-sugar	
sweeteners	without	any	changes	in	the	status	of	
safety	approvals	from	food	safety	authorities.

How we are responding
We	remain	focused	on	collaborating	with	regulators	
and	governments	on	constructive	proposals,	which	
address	these	trends.	We	are	collaborating	closely	
with	governments	and	industry	partners	to	support	
the	launch	of	DRS	in	more	European	countries	and	
have	made	additional	progress	towards	making	our	
packaging	more	sustainable.	We	continue	to	grow	
our	low-	and	no-sugar	variants	to	meet	consumer	
and	regulatory	demands.	Our	Mission	2025	goals	
remain	our	compass	and	we	continue	to	play	an	
active	role	from	within	our	industry	associations	in	
supporting	the	sustainability	ambitions	of	the	EU.

Our capital resources

Human
Our	success	is	dependent	on	the	passion	and	
customer	focus	of	our	talented	people	–	our	secret	
ingredient.	We	empower	them	to	pursue	growth	
opportunities,	both	for	themselves	and	our	Company.

Natural
To	create	our	products,	we	use	natural	resources	
including	water,	energy	and	PET.	We	source	these	using	
sustainable	practices	and	seek	to	use	them	efficiently.

Social and relationships
Maintaining	the	trust	of	stakeholders	is	essential	to	our	
business.	Our	most	valuable	human	connections	and	
relationships	are	with	The	Coca-Cola	Company,	our	
people	and	the	communities	we	operate	in,	and	our	
customers,	suppliers,	governments	and	regulators.

Financial
Our	business	activities	require	financial	capital,	which	
we	allocate	efficiently.	This	capital	is	provided	by	our	
equity	and	debt	holders,	as	well	as	cash	flow	earned	
from	our	operations.

Intellectual
Innovation	is	embedded	in	our	culture.	The	intellectual	
property	from	innovation	includes	new	packaging	
know-how,	new	products	and	improvements	in	
manufacturing,	logistics	and	sales	execution.

A successful year
Our portfolio allows us to cater for the 
needs of consumers 24/7 through three 
strategic priorities: Sparkling, Energy 
and Coffee. They represent close to 
80% of the business, with significant 
headroom for growth. 

The success drivers of this growth pillar are market 
penetration and share, supported by continuous 
innovation, underpinned by our strong customer 
relationships and unrivalled market execution. 

A strong partnership with TCCC is at the heart 
of our success. Together with TCCC, we focus 
on consumer loyalty, strong innovation and 
marketing investment, particularly in Sparkling. 
In Coffee, our dual-brand strategy works well: 
TCCC’s COSTA Coffee gives us access to the 
mass-premium segment and our investment 
in Caffè Vergnano gives access to the premium 
segment (see our feature on page 31). Our close 
partnership with Monster Energy brings a broad 
portfolio of energy drinks, from affordable to 
premium brands. 

Alongside Sparkling, Energy and Coffee, 
we have a diverse offering of locally relevant 
brands where, together with TCCC, we prioritise 
country and category combinations based on the 
attractiveness of profitable revenue pools in each 
market. These include important growth enablers 
such as juices, ready-to-drink tea, enhanced 
and premium water, sport drinks brands such 
as Powerade, and premium spirits – the latter 
critical to our HoReCa offering.

Sparkling foundation
Sparkling is our key engine of growth and our 
foundation. Sparkling volumes grew overall by 
2.5% in 2023, on an organic basis. Excluding 
Russia, where we no longer sell any brands of 
TCCC, Trademark Coke brands grew 1.9%.

We have consistently invested in our core brands 
with zero-sugar formulations and new flavours. 
TCCC is critical in identifying the exact innovations 
that work for each market or channel. 

Recent innovation examples included Coca-
Cola Zero Sugar Zero Caffeine and new flavour 
creations within the Fanta and Schweppes brands. 

Indeed, we have introduced new zero formulations 
across all Sparkling brands, showing how constant 
innovation is keeping us at the forefront of 
consumer choice and customer preference.

Low- and no-sugar sparkling variants have grown 
significantly since 2019, driven by consumer 
demand, and now represent a material part of the 
Sparkling category. Coke Zero has played a leading 
role in this, driven by successful reformulation 
and targeted campaigns. And we will continue to 
build on the 2022 launch of Coke Zero Sugar Zero 
Caffeine, with focused marketing campaigns in 
2024.

We are continuing to increase the number of 
flavours within zero options, as well as limited-
edition Coke Creations, and there is further 
opportunity to expand our distribution and 
increase presence in emerging markets.

Our focus on growing zero formulations supports 
one of our sustainability targets within Mission 
2025, to reduce calories per 100ml, and you can 
read about this on page 27. 

There is more to come 
from zero-sugar formulations.”

Adult Sparkling
Adult Sparkling revenue per case is above 
the average for the Group and the work we are 
doing on mixability is critical here, as shown in our 
feature on page 29. Our Adult Sparkling portfolio 
benefitted from strong performance in the 
Established and Developing segments, following 
a tough consumer backdrop in the first half of 
the year. We continue to focus on Adult Sparkling 
activations, focused on socialising, particularly 
summer and festive occasions where mixability 
plays an important role. In 2023, we capitalised 
on consumer trends, expanding our range of 
‘pink drinks’, tonics and zero-sugar choices. 

Thanks to the 2022 acquisition of Three Cents, 
we have expanded our footprint into the super-
premium Adult Sparkling segment, targeted to 
mixologists and high-end hotel, restaurant and 
café outlets. We have begun distributing Three 
Cents in six markets where we currently operate, 
while continuing collaboration via distributors to 
develop further market opportunities.

Energy opens up new consumer groups 
Energy is one of the fastest-growing segments 
within NARTD. We have achieved double-
digit volume growth over the past eight years, 
averaging 32% in the last five years alone. In 
2023, Energy made up c.7% of Group revenue. 
This performance is the result of a well-defined 
strategy, with a complete brand portfolio 
that reflects diverse consumer needs with 
premium (Burn), mid-range (Monster), and more 
affordable (Predator, Ultra, BPM and Fury) brands. 
We launched Fury and Monster in our newest 
market of Egypt during 2023, and we continue to 
work closely with Monster Energy to help launch 
new flavours, expanding our consumer appeal 
across all of our energy brands.

Through disruptive marketing platforms and a 
range of flavours, we are giving consumers choice 
and enticing newcomers into the segment. 

We are excited about the potential of this 
category and are aiming for double-digit growth 
in contribution to Group revenue in the medium 
term through continuous expansion in per-capita 
consumption, further distribution expansion and 
broadening our reach to new markets. 

Born Ready:

Coffee – core to our 24/7 strategy
Coffee continued to make good progress in 
the year, with volumes up 31.5% versus 2022 and 
market share continuing to grow – see our feature 
on page 31. COSTA performed strongly across all 
markets and especially in the away-from-home 
segment, where we added 4,000 outlets to make a 
total of 11,000 outlets served (7,000 in 2022) in 20 
markets. COSTA continued to gain market share 
in the at-home market, as measured by market 
intelligence provider, Nielsen. We rolled out Caffè 
Vergnano to three more markets, bringing our 
total to 17. Over the past two years, we have 
already recruited over 2,000, mostly premium, 
HoReCa customers, including five-star hotels and 
other high-end coffee shops, bars and restaurants 
that want a premium coffee experience for 
their guests. Premium HoReCa, which currently 
represents more than 60% of our customer base, 
remains our top priority for Caffè Vergnano. 

Our Coffee Academy goes from strength to 
strength, training over 9,000 colleagues in 2023, 
both face-to-face and online, developing our 
capabilities as we continue our journey to scale 
and invest into this business. Overall, our aim is 
to reach a low- to mid-single-digit market share 
in Coffee over the mid-term.

Jack and Coke is a number one 
bar call in the world, and now, 
we are delighted to be able to 
bring it to consumers in a new 
ready-to-drink offering.”

Jonathan Scott, 
Coffee and Premium Spirits Business 
Director, Coca-Cola HBC Ireland and 
Northern Ireland

Two years ago, Jack Daniel’s, owned by one 
of our partners, Brown-Forman, and TCCC 
announced that they would be teaming up 
to provide consumers with the option to enjoy 
the drink inspired by one of the world’s most 
popular branded ‘bar calls’ – a cocktail ordered 
with specific brand names – in a convenient, 
ready-to-drink format. During the second 
quarter of 2023, we successfully launched 
Jack and Coke in Poland, Hungary and the 
island of Ireland. 

We are excited about the future of Jack 
and Coke and extending its reach into 
other markets.

Welcoming Finlandia to  
our Premium Spirits family

Having been associated with the distribution 
of Finlandia for 17 years in several markets, 
we were excited by the unique and regionally 
relevant opportunity to purchase the 
Finlandia Vodka brand from our long-term 
partner, Brown Forman, which completed 
in November. The acquisition supports the 
acceleration of our on-premise business 
across more of our markets. The proven 
complementarity of our Premium Spirits 
business with our strong NARTD portfolio 
enables us to offer solutions for a broad range 
of 24/7 consumption occasions, particularly 
socialising moments.

7 markets at acquisition 

11 

markets added since acquisition 

3more markets planned for 2024

We view this as an attractive 
investment and a natural evolution 
of our role as one of Finlandia’s 
distribution partners, further 
attesting to the strength of our 
time-tested and wide-ranging 
partnership with Brown-Forman. 
We appreciate the trust placed in 
us and look forward to creating 
more value for our partners and 
customers by capturing new 
opportunities with our well-
rounded beverage portfolio.”

Zoran Bogdanovic
CEO

Premium Spirits
In 2023, Premium Spirits delivered a strong 
performance, with volumes growing by 13.1% 
on an organic basis, driven by all segments. 

The acquisition of the Finlandia Vodka business 
from our long-standing partner, Brown-Forman, 
completed in November and is a unique 
opportunity with significant geographic overlap 
in our territories, enhancing our premium spirits 
credentials and opening incremental mixability 
opportunities for our NARTD portfolio (see case 
study to left).

In 2023, we were excited by the launch of Jack 
and Coke in three markets (see previous page), 
and performance exceeded our expectations.

We continue to exploit our bespoke capabilities 
of data, insights & analytics and digital commerce, 
to drive revenue generation in the category, and 
continue to train our business developers in our 
Premium Spirits Academy. We are on track to 
upskill more than 6,000 Business Developers 
by the end of 2025.

Still brands innovation
We made a number of innovations across our 
Still brands in 2023, such as FUZETEA and Cappy 
Lemonade flavour extensions, Cappy enhanced 
blends launch, a formula upgrade for Mono fruit 
nectars range, a new concept for Römerquelle 
Flavoured water (launched in Austria) and entering 
the enhanced waters segment by launching 
Vitaminwater in Switzerland. 

In 2023, Stills were exposed to a challenging 
market environment, However, we managed 
to deliver revenue growth across all categories, 
driven by price increases and good immediate 
consumption (or on-the-go consumption) and 
single-serve mix for Water and ready-to-drink Tea.

Focusing on profitable revenue growth for 
Water, we grew single-serve mix and selectively 
expanded into highly-accretive emerging 
segments such as functional and flavoured 
waters. We did, however, lose volume in the 
at-home multi-serve offering, leading to an 
overall Water volume drop of 5.9% versus 2022.

Helping consumers make the right 
choices for their diet and lifestyle
Our purpose is to open up moments that 
refresh us all, and in order to do this we listen to 
consumers and customers. First and foremost, 
consumers want drinks that taste good, and they 
increasingly demand drinks with less sugar and 
more nutritional benefits. You can read more 
about nutrition trends in Market trends on pages 
20 and 21 and in Earn our licence to operate on 
pages 53 to 68. As part of the Coca-Cola System, 
we are committed to satisfying both great taste 
and healthy and balanced diets. Our actions 
across the System fall within five pillars: 1) 
Less Sugar, More Choices, 2) New and Different 
Drinks, 3) Informed Decisions, 4) No Marketing 
Targeting Children, and 5) Promoting Low- No-
Sugar Choices. 

1) Less sugar, more choices
We support the recommendation of leading 
health authorities that individuals should 
consume no more than 10% of their total daily 
calories from added sugar. We have committed to 
reduce calories per 100ml of sparkling soft drinks 
by 25% between 2015 and 2025 across all our 
markets. You can read more about our Mission 
2025 performance in the Earn our licence to 
operate section on page 53 to 68. Through these 
efforts we are contributing to the European Soft 
Drinks Association’s (UNESDA’s) target to reduce 
added sugar in beverages by 10% by 2025 from 
a 2019 baseline.

2) New and different drinks – innovating and 
producing new and different drinks to boost 
consumer choice
From sparkling soft drinks, energy drinks, stills, 
coffee, and premium spirits, to juices and snacks, 
we offer drinks that meet consumers’ needs 
throughout the day. Many of our sparkling brands 
now have zero-sugar or low-sugar variants. 

3) Informed decisions – giving consumers 
clear and transparent information helping 
them make the right choices
We provide clear and transparent nutrition 
information about what’s inside our drinks, 
such as the Guideline Daily Amount (GDA) 
and traffic-light labels on our core sparkling 
drinks in 22 markets. 

4) No marketing targeting children
We strictly follow the Coca-Cola System 
policies for Global Responsible Marketing, the 
Global School Beverage Policy and the Global 
Responsible Alcohol Marketing Policy. 

Also, we follow the EU Code of Conduct for 
Responsible Business and Marketing Practices 
covering product reformulation, portion control 
and responsible marketing to tackle important 
public health issues, as well as to UNESDA’s 
pledges. We commit to not market any of our 
drinks directly to children under 13 and do not 
offer any soft drinks in primary schools. Every year, 
relevant employees and both direct and indirect 
distributors are made aware of The Coca-Cola 
Company’s Responsible Marketing Policies.

5) Promoting low- and no-sugar choices
We are taking actions to help people better 
manage their sugar intake from our drinks 
by reducing sugar in our beverages, innovating 
new low- and no-sugar drinks, offering small 
packs for portion control and promoting our 
low-and no-sugar beverage choices, including 
by promoting Coke Zero Sugar as our ‘hero’ 
in many marketing campaigns. 

Priorities in 2024
•  Continue to deliver on our strategic 

priorities of Sparkling, Energy and Coffee 

•  Continue to connect with consumers 
and their preferences through close 
partnership with TCCC

•  Focus on zeros, with increased marketing 

effort behind Coke Zero Zero and 
innovating to develop our range of 
zero flavours

•  Integrate Finlandia Vodka into our business 

and develop growth opportunities
•  Continue to focus on product quality, 

safety and integrity

•  Develop the capabilities of our people 
through our broad range of academies

UN Sustainable 
Development Goals
We serve our consumers with a broad range 
of high-quality products. In doing so, we 
create value by contributing to global goals 
for good health and wellbeing, innovation, 
responsible production and consumption 
as well as partnerships.

Ensuring fresh, quality products 
and reducing waste
Our low base of consumer complaints increased 
from 0.12 to 0.14 per million bottles sold in 2023 
compared with 2022, mainly due to consumer 
sensitivity to the introduction of tethered 
closures following new EU legislation, as well to 
the fluctuating natural colour range of orange 
juice concentrate. We continue to improve and 
modernise manufacturing processes and to focus 
on product quality, safety and integrity, within the 
context of external challenges.

In Croatia, we had an isolated, unfounded incident 
connected to one product. Once accurate and 
factual information was available, the authorities 
confirmed all our products safe for consumption. 
The local team worked diligently to protect 
our reputation in the market, while giving the 
authorities time to complete their investigation. 
As this year marks the 55th anniversary of our 
operations in Croatia, and 20 years of corporate 
sustainability reporting, it was an important 
reminder of upholding the highest quality 
standards that our consumers and customers 
can rely on. 

Our Supply Chain Academy has gone from 
strength to strength this year, with colleagues 
focusing on quality and logistics, and we continued 
to mark World Food Safety Day in June and World 
Quality Week in November.

We strive to minimise food loss and food waste in 
our operations as this helps us preserve water and 
other natural resources, avoid carbon emissions 
and mitigate the social and economic impacts 
of agriculture.

Adult Sparkling: a ‘big bet’ 
and growth accelerator

We are primed to chase significant revenue pools, while addressing 
premiumisation opportunities of our existing portfolio. Most current brands 
are specially formulated and marketed to adults, appealing to a wide range 
of moments that refresh.

  What’s the growth 
opportunity?

Opening up the right moment with premiumised, 
tailor-made and experiential solutions for bars

With 60% of the population in our territories 
over 25 years old, Adult Sparkling meets the 
needs of a wide range of consumers. And, with 
50% current value share in bitter mixers, we see 
significant headroom to grow our market share.

We are addressing premiumisation 
opportunities by: 

•  developing a super-premium segment 

in Sparkling Soft Drinks

•  driving the mix towards glass and  

single-serve beverages
•  accelerating growth in the 

HoReCa channel

brands that are relevant 
for my bar, and having

Waking up to 360o 
Coffee capability 

It seems there is no end to consumer demand for good coffee. With 
our impressive track record, route to market and coffee capability 
development, we are well positioned to win. Coffee is core to our 24/7 
strategy, with organic revenue up 37.5 % in 2023 versus the previous 
year and market share continuing to grow.

  What’s the growth 
opportunity?

Opening up the right moment for 
premium and mass premium segments

•  Double the revenue per case versus Sparkling.
•  Coffee strengthens our 24/7 beverage 
partner status across all sales channels.
•  It allows us to accelerate our direct-to-
consumer business such as vending. 
•  Coffee enables increased penetration of 

our non-alcoholic beverage portfolio at work.

•  Coffee accounts for approximately 65% of 

consumer spending at work.

Bespoke capabilities with 
exceptional people 
Our second growth pillar, win in 
the marketplace, encapsulates 
how we drive profitable revenue 
growth and anticipate or react to new 
challenges faster and smarter than our 
competition. Two elements underpin 
this pillar: our bespoke capabilities, 
which are critical for us to better 
understand the real and changing needs 
of both customers and consumers; and 
our talented salespeople, or business 
developers, who establish long-lasting 
winning partnerships with customers.

Our customers range from global supermarket 
brands and independent convenience stores to 
restaurants and e-retailers. Understanding the 
needs of these customers and their relationship 
with consumers is critical to our success. 
Targeting personalised execution for every outlet 
requires capabilities in data, insights & analytics 
(DIA), revenue growth management (RGM) and 
route to market (RTM). In 2023, we continued to 
invest in these bespoke capabilities, particularly 
DIA and digital commerce, enhancing tools that 
allow us to deliver best-in-class RGM, RTM and 
customer management. 

The power of our 24/7 portfolio and consistent 
investment in our capabilities has allowed us 
to make informed pricing decisions and offer 
a personalised mix of categories and package 
formats to customers. This data-driven approach 
has resulted in another year of strong revenue per 
case expansion and profit growth, enabling us to 
drive a further 110bps of value share expansion 
in NARTD in 2023, and an 80bps improvement 
in value share expansion in Sparkling.

We have adapted our ways of working, 
strengthened our supply chains, and proven 
the depth and breadth of our capabilities. This 
is particularly the case for RGM, where we have 
delivered robust price and mix improvements in 
the face of significant commodity inflation and, 
more recently, energy cost rises. We have been 
laser-focused and clear on the decisions we are 
making and what we expect these decisions 
to achieve.

Targeting personalised execution for every outlet 

At our investor day in May, we shared how our capabilities are driving 
personalised execution for every outlet. 

The six key capabilities are:

Revenue growth 
management
Industry-leading RGM enables 
us to drive smart affordability 
and premiumisation

Data, insights

Route-to-consumer through 
e-retail and delivery apps

I am so excited by the progress 
we have made in our bespoke 
capabilities, enabling a step change in 
our ability to win in the marketplace. 
It is the interconnection of 
route to market, data, insights 
& analytics, and revenue growth 
management, together with digital 
commerce, customer management 
and talent development, our 
lighthouse capability, which allows 
us to personalise execution for

Sirvis, our 24/7 multi-category, eB2B aggregator 
ordering platform for indirect route to market, was 
rolled out to more regions in Italy, and we prepared 
for expansion into three more countries for 2024. 
The platform connects out-of-home outlets to 
wholesale suppliers of goods, as well as service 
providers of relevant services. We continued 
to pilot direct-to-consumer platforms, including 
Home Delivery in Egypt.

Our Customer Portal e-business-to-business 
(eB2B) platform saw further growth. Our focus 
was on driving incremental revenue and expanding 
the omnichannel service tools. We enhanced 
Customer Portal’s reach and efficiency, which 
drove an increase in customer orders and revenue, 
particularly in small non-chain stores. It is now 
the main order-taking channel, representing 
10% of orders made, more than doubling the 
share of orders in 2022. Meanwhile, we scaled 
our business-to-business digital marketing 
capabilities, launching automated customer 
engagement journeys and piloting generative 
AI-powered marketing campaigns with promising 
first results – all using the size, scale and user 
friendliness of Customer Portal.

Our bespoke capabilities

At our investor day in May, we shared how 
our capabilities are driving personalised 
execution for every outlet. Over the 
next three pages, we describe these 
six capabilities in detail, starting with 
customer management at the bottom 
right-hand side, and working anti-
clockwise round the wheel on page 35.

Customer management
We are committed to creating value jointly with 
our customers and this is at the heart of our 
successful partnerships. Through our joint value 
creation strategies, we were once again the 
leading contributor to revenue growth in fast-
moving consumer goods (FMCG) across our 
retail customers, according to market researcher 
Nielsen. Innovations such as our new next-
generation customer relationship management 
(CRM) system support such success. The new 
system was rolled out in 18 markets during the 
year, strengthening our customer management 
capabilities that are directly linked to growing 
customer revenue. As well as supporting our 
core business, this has enabled us to accelerate 
our performance in new categories such as 
Coffee and Premium Spirits, as the system is 
able to consolidate customer leads efficiently and 
accurately for our sales team. Providing a stronger 
digital tool for communication drives better 
service and is another way for our salespeople to 
spend more time with our customers and provide 
them with data-driven analytics and insights.

We are committed to measuring and improving 
customer experience using the Net Promoter 
Score® metric applied through CustomerGauge 
‘voice of customer’ software, which enables 
instant feedback from customers. 

When a customer has an issue, the target for 
our sales teams is to ‘close the loop’ and resolve 
issues within 48 hours. In 2023, 83% of cases 
were resolved in 48 hours, up from 66% in 2022. 
This tool is now live in all our markets, with 
55% of our customers providing feedback on 
our performance.

We continue to support our customers through 
challenging periods of cost inflation and other 
economic pressures by offering a diverse portfolio 
and investing in engaging and relevant brand 
campaigns. This helped our customers generate 
top-line growth, whilst satisfying their shopper 
and customer needs. For example, at-home and 
out-of-home channels both delivered positive 
revenue growth in 2023, with more digital and 
physical at-home solutions and a wider out-of-
home portfolio offering.

Digital commerce
In 2023, we significantly invested in our digital 
commerce platforms and solutions, as part of 
our digital journey to enhance our capabilities 
using data-driven strategies and efficient online 
business platforms for growing revenue. Our 
collaboration with e-retailers and food delivery 
platforms to create unique omnichannel 
consumer experiences further intensified. Our 
strong online execution capabilities, with a focus 
on digital shelf execution and data-driven shopper 
activation, led to strong double-digit revenue 
growth online and growth in online market share. 
On food delivery platforms, we aim to sell a drink 
with a meal and this ‘beverage attachment’ rate 
improved slightly to 26% (excluding Russia).

Data, insights & analytics 
DIA is one of our prioritised growth capabilities 
and we see this as a competitive advantage. 
Everything we do in this space, primarily through 
prioritised use cases, is done with the customer 
in mind and to strengthen our RGM and RTM. 

Demand forecasting 
We continued to develop our AI-enabled 
forecasting for short- and long-term demand for 
our products. In Romania, for example, we saw 
a 10% improvement in our demand forecasting 
after putting these AI tools in place.

2023 was a pivotal year for the implementation of 
DIA capabilities. We stepped up our analytics and 
AI usage, with the ambition to become an industry 
leader and to set a global benchmark in these 
capabilities. We have four prioritised use cases:

Segmented execution 
In 2023, we scaled segmented execution so that 
all markets, including Egypt, now have advanced 
micro segmentation, the ability to predict the 
potential value of a single outlet from a single 
product category – see an example from Nigeria 
in our feature on page 39 and in the video from 
our investor day, link also on page 39. We also 
launched the next generation of segmented 
execution, which provides new capabilities 
that personalise what we sell, personalises 
how we serve and execute with our customers, 
and enables us to make strategic and 
profitable investments.

Promotion spend effectiveness 
In 2023, we continued to increase our use of 
advanced analytics algorithms to improve the 
return on promotion investments, as well as 
improve demand forecasting. The algorithms 
mean we can measure the effectiveness of 
every Euro of promotional spend, allowing us 
to ‘course-correct’ and allocate investment to 
higher return promotions. We have automated 
these algorithms so that we run promotion 
management measurement each quarter to be 
agile in taking actions, rather than having annual 
plans, as well as leveraging the insights to drive 
joint value creation with our customers. 

Improving retention of our business developers 
This gives us valuable insights into how to reduce 
churn and have consistency and longer tenure 
with better performance.

Our sales teams – and colleagues in wider 
functions – continue to benefit significantly 
from the Data and Analytics Academy. It is 
accelerating the culture of data-driven decision 
making, enabling us to upskill our colleagues. We 
now have over 1,200 colleagues involved in DIA 
academy courses. New for 2023 was a module on 
generative AI, which we introduced to equip our 
colleagues with the very latest skills to improve 
data literacy. 

Revenue growth management
In 2023, we leveraged our RGM capabilities 
to implement price increases across all 
our markets, as well as drive mix increases, 
balancing premiumisation and affordability 
in a highly inflationary environment. 

Enhanced data and analytics tools have allowed 
us to adapt to ever-changing price elasticities, 
making decisions that protect consumption and 
our competitive position. Our proactiveness and 
agility in adapting price moves or promotional 
strategies to the marketplace and the competitive 
landscape have been critical to deliver revenue 
growth from both pricing and mix, while growing 
market share. 

Ongoing high inflation reinforced our long-
standing focus on improving affordability. 
We launched new affordable pack formats in the 
Czech Republic and Slovakia where we replaced 
1.75 litre with 1.5 litre and 2.25 litre with 2 litre 
formats. We expanded affordable offerings 
in a segmented way, aiming at channels and 
regions most relevant to the target consumer. 
For example, in Egypt we scaled our returnable 
glass bottle offerings and 300ml PET, leveraging 
segmentation based on consumer disposable 
income. We continued the expansion of 300ml 
PET in Bulgaria and we expanded our 350ml 
returnable glass bottle offering in Nigeria. 

Promotions are another important part of 
affordability. In 2023, we used data and insights 
to improve return on investment, offer more 
value-add promotions and focus on profitability. 
This helped to maximise returns for us and our 
customers. Premiumisation remains relevant for 
certain consumer segments, and we continued 
to increase our range of premium packs – in 
Austria launching a 400ml glass bottle and 
expanding our 1 litre glass bottle into flavours. 
We also increased our focus on premium multi-
packs of mini cans in our Established markets. 
Our focus on single-serve packs increased 
at-home channel sales. Due to our ongoing 
focus on HoReCa, we improved the percentage 
of sales from the out-of-home channel in Europe. 

We have more customer interaction than before 
due to our physical and digital route to market

Route to market
We have a vast route to market. Each day, 
around 15,000 business developers in sales 
teams across our countries service two million 
customers – in fact, we have more customer 
interactions than ever before due to our 
physical and digital RTM. And, with 1.4 million 
coolers (refrigerators) owned on our customers’ 
premises, we have multiple RTM models with 
different sales force roles, different last-mile 
models and different execution strategies. A 
24/7 dynamic sales and distribution model seeks 
to maximise profitable growth through data- 
driven execution excellence. We are constantly 
upgrading our physical RTM fundamentals to 
adapt to the digital transformation, and we are 
incorporating data and analytics to make it even 
more efficient. 

We continue to invest in new coolers as they 
help to drive single-serve mix and revenue 
growth. We increased the number of coolers 
by 9,3001 in 2023, led by Italy, to a total of 
1.4 million coolers on customer premises. 
More than half now have online connections, 
up 6pp, which improves their profitability by 
providing volume data for better execution. 
We have focused on using data to increase our 
profitable cooler coverage and in 2023 reached 
90%1 coverage of our top customer outlets. 
We also continued upgrading our physical RTM 
to adapt to the digital transformation and we 
now have 91,000 active digital customers, 
up 46% from 2022.

 Excluding Russia, Egypt, Ukraine, Moldova and Armenia.

Image recognition tools are now operational 
in most of our markets. These tools help us 
understand in a precise and efficient way the 
quality of our execution at the point of sale, and 
to drive the needed corrective actions. We are 
also supporting our indirect distribution partners 
by connecting them through a bespoke CCH 
integration tool. Finally, we are expanding our 
digital coverage enabled by our eB2B platforms. 

In 2023, we expanded our physical coverage 
of outlets to support our out-of-home channel 
development. We increased our sales force in 
Italy, Croatia, Czech Republic and Slovakia and as 
a result we now visit two-thirds of our customers 
in person. We are enhancing our physical coverage 
by using dynamic routing tools, which optimise 
travel times and allow our sales force to spend 
more time with customers. It is this combination 
of in-person visits with data-driven insights and 
digital execution that is the foundation of our 
RTM success.

Talent development
Investing in our people and their development 
remains our ‘lighthouse capability’. We aim 
to make our company an irresistible place to 
work – where our employees feel heard, valued, 
supported and motivated to realise their full 
potential. We strive to ensure that we recruit 
and retain the best talent, providing unique and 
personalised development as a reason to join, 
grow, stay and best serve our customers. We 
have numerous development tools in place like 
fast-track development programmes for our 
high-potential colleagues. We develop critical 
sales and supply chain capabilities by offering a 
suite of academies, and our learning culture is 
embedded by making learning accessible through 
technology-enabled solutions. You can read more

Personalisation depends on data, 
insights & analytics 

From years of experience, we know there is no one-size-fits-all when it comes 
to beverage preferences. We aim for personalised execution for every outlet 
and capabilities in data, insights and analytics are critical to delivering this.

  What’s the growth 
opportunity?
Integrated intelligence across 
all channels.
Irrespective of the channel, we offer 
personalised and relevant assortment 
recommendations in every customer touch 
point in all our markets on a weekly basis:

•  Suggested orders for business developers 
when they visit the customer and they 
place an order in person

•  Smart orders in Customer Portal – online 
portal where customers can order 24/7

•  Suggested orders for Call centre when the 

customer calls in to place an order

Opening up moments  
for personalisation
For example in Nigeria...
•  Algorithms help find the right product 
in the right pack size at the right time. 

•  We bring intelligence that sophisticated 
retailers have to our more than 200,000 
fragmented customers (traditional ‘mom 
and pop’ stores), segmenting them into 
80 microsegments. 

•  Customer-centric order taking: 

the algorithm sees highest potential for 
Premium SSDs and Energy drinks. It suggests 
Coke and Monster and sees similar outlets are 
successful with Predator, so it adds Predator.

Algorithms help generate 
outlet-specific insights for 
personalisation. Data-enabled 
insights power our active 
two million customer base in 
Hellenic across all our markets.”

Investing for growth
Our ability to win in the marketplace 
and to leverage our 24/7 portfolio is 
down to continuous strengthening of 
our customer and supplier partnerships, 
and investment: investment in capacity; 
investment in sustainability; investment 
in digital, data and technology and 
investment in critical, value-creating 
capabilities (read more in Win in 
the Marketplace on pages 33 to 39). 

Investing in capacity to support 
our 24/7 portfolio
We have a broad footprint of 62 production plants, 
of which five are mega-plants, across 29 countries 
(no change from 2022), with five production 
plants in Egypt now fully integrated following the 
acquisition of the business in 2022. We added 
seven new production lines, ranging from our 
new PET line in Hungary to new glass and can 
lines in Nigeria. You can read more about our new 
resealable RGB line in Austria on page 62. 

We have invested heavily in our partnership 
with Monster Energy, as Energy continues to 
be one of the fastest-growing categories in 
NARTD beverages.

In 2023, we added three additional Monster 
canning lines: one each in Ireland and Poland, 
which were commissioned in 2023; and a line 
in Italy that will be commissioned in 2024, 
bringing our total to eight Monster lines 
across five countries. 

We continued our investment in coolers, or 
refrigerators, at customer premises in support 
of our revenue growth management strategy 
and sustainability goals – see pages 43 and 44. 

Investing in sustainability 
as a growth enabler 
Our approach to sustainability is doing what 
is right, while creating value for the business 
and strengthening resilience. For example, 
we have reduced energy use by 30% between 
2010 and 2023, making a significant impact on 
emissions reductions, but also realising more 
than €50 million (gross) in energy cost savings. 

On packaging, we have invested more than €50 
million in three in-house recycled plastic (rPET) 
production units in Italy, Poland and Romania over 
the last two years, with €11 million invested in the 
Romania plant alone in 2023. These investments 
reflect our commitment to a circular economy, 
while allowing us to decrease the cost of buying 
rPET from outside and enhancing our security 
of supply in a tight market. 

We continually scan the market to assess 
supplier capabilities and use strategic partner 
relationships, for example, to increase Post 
Consumer Recycled (PCR) content, reduce shrink 
and stretch film thickness (down-gauging) to 
minimise material consumption and develop close 
loop, circular solutions. In 2023, we implemented 
multiple down-gauging shrink film initiatives 
in the Czech Republic, Northern Ireland and 
Hungary, resulting in cost savings and reduction 
of CO2 emissions. 

We continue innovating in glass and paper 
– investing €12 million in Austria on a new energy- 
and water-efficient returnable glass bottle line 
for our 1 litre ‘universal bottle’ format, while 
introducing a new 400ml resealable, reusable glass 
bottle, and launching a paper-based alternative 
to plastic shrink film for 1.5 litre PET multipacks.

Fuel growth through competitiveness and investment

A paper-based alternative 
to shrink film for 1.5 litre 
bottles was three years in 
the making
CCH Austria, paper producer Mondi and 
machine manufacturer Krones partnered to 
create an innovative, high-strength, paper 
sleeve, ‘Hug-IT’, that tightly wraps and secures 
six 1.5 litre bottle bundles of Coke, Fanta, 
Sprite and Mezzo Mix during transit. 

Hug-IT replaces existing plastic shrink wrap, 
using paper made from FSC® certified 
responsibly sourced fibres, as a more 
sustainable solution. Hug-IT has taken three 
years to come to fruition, from conception 
through to planning, trialling, and finally getting 
the product onto the shelf. Expert teams from 
the three companies worked closely together 
to meet the challenges of aesthetics, strength 
and stretchability of the paper solution.

Our suppliers are important partners in 
sustainability. We monitor the performance 
of our significant suppliers through our annual 
internal assessments, third-party audits of 
compliance, the EcoVadis IQ Plus Tool and 
EcoVadis Risk Assessment platform. EcoVadis 
helps us monitor, assess and benchmark a 
range of risks using 21 criteria from international 
standard setters and is our common ESG 
assessment platform across the Coca-Cola 
System, where we exchange information on the 
ESG performance of our common suppliers. 
We are also investigating how to further extend 
risk assessment in our supply base, leveraging 
new tools, Artificial Intelligence and customised 
alerts, giving our strategic procurement team 
faster access to critical events and information 
affecting our supply chain.

We recognise supplier certifications, as per 
international standards including ISO 9001, ISO 
14001, ISO 50001, FSSC 22000 and ISO 45001. 
For agricultural commodities, we recognise 
the Rainforest Alliance, Fair Trade, Bonsucro, 
the Sustainable Agriculture Initiative Platform 
Farm Sustainability Assessment and Global 
GAP+GRASP. All long-term contractors and 
contracted services on site are assessed 
on human rights through workplace audits, 
which have a three-year cycle.

The careful use of resources and 
recyclable materials is an important 
pillar in our sustainability strategy and 
plays a central role in the design of the 
sustainable packaging mix for the 
Austrian market. With the introduction 
of our new solution, which is unique 
in the world to date, we will be able to 
reduce material use by around 200 
tonnes of plastic per year. It was a 
pleasure to work with Mondi and our 
other partners in jointly contributing 
to a circular economy.”

Felix Sprenger
Supply Chain Director, CCH Austria

Our approach is ‘paper where 
possible, plastic when useful’ – and 
replacing the plastic shrink wrap used 
for bundling bottles provides the ideal 
opportunity to put that into practice. 
By producing a strong paper, 
we are able to replicate what the 
plastic shrink wrap does, delivering 
secure and safe transportation of 
multipacks with our Hug-IT paper 
sleeves that reduce plastic use.”

Silvia Hanzelova
Sales Director Speciality Kraft Paper, Mondi

We successfully continued with the paper-
based holder for smaller multipacks, Keel Clip™, 
implemented in Hungary, Greece, Italy, Poland, 
Romania, Northern Ireland and Austria, while we 
started to look into how to further optimise the 
solution to reduce material usage and minimise 
emissions. Specifically, in Italy we piloted six packs 
of 150ml with a down-gauged carton format. 
Results were encouraging, so we plan to develop 
the commercial solution and introduce to the 
broader market in 2024.

Also in secondary packaging, we concluded an 
assessment related to the introduction of low-
density film in Biaxially Oriented Polypropylene 
(BOPP) labels instead of standard plastic labels. 
Following this assessment, we expect to roll out 
BOPP labels in 2024, and anticipate reducing 
plastic in labels by 12%, saving around 240 tonnes 
of material and 600 tonnes of CO2 emissions 
annually. In 2023, we successfully piloted smaller 
labels in 1 litre upwards multi-serve packs in 
Greece, Cyprus, Poland and Italy, and we are now 
planning the roll out of shorter labels across the 
Company in 2024. This will result in CO2 emissions 
reduction by approximately 550 tonnes. 

Water remains one of our key strategic priorities. 
By using innovative technologies, such as water-
free cleaners for our new can lines in Greece 
and Poland, we are targeting a 20% reduction 
in water consumption by 2025 compared with 
2017 in water risk areas. You can read more about 
our investments and achievements in water on 
pages 61 to 62.

Investing in digital, data  
and technology 
Fuelling our growth requires investment behind 
digital technology and new business models, 
blended with our continuous focus on productivity 
and efficiency improvement initiatives. In 2023, we 
appointed a dedicated head of our Digital Factory to 
focus on embedding digital throughout the business. 
We consider three ‘buckets’ when investing in digital, 
data and technology: consumer and customer 
centricity (read more in ‘Win in the marketplace’ 
on pages 33 to 39); employee experience 
(read more in ‘Cultivate the potential of our people’ 
on pages 45 to 51); and operational productivity.

Consumer and customer centricity
We achieved several milestones in customer 
centricity in 2023, including: 

•  Connected coolers: passed the 1 million 

‘connected coolers’ milestone, meaning that 
we are continually increasing and improving 
the data we obtain from the field
•  Image recognition: processing over 

1.5 million product execution images every 
month, continuing to free up business 
developers to spend more time with 
customers and improving revenue per outlet 

•  DIA using machine learning for 

personalised execution: 57% of customer 
visits had outlet-specific suggested orders 
recommended by business developers
•  Dynamic routing: 11% market coverage 

using algorithm-based routing for deliveries 
in first year of deployment, with target of 
34% coverage for 2024

Employee experience
To achieve best-in-class employee experience, 
we have designed and tested ‘WorkDay’ as 
a new core HR system to improve internal 
productivity, with the target of saving many 
hours for colleagues to use in higher value- 
add activities. During 2024, we will deploy 
the solution throughout the business.

During 2023, we selected Microsoft Viva to 
host our new intranet platform for internal 
communication, and we will design and deploy 
the new intranet in early 2024. 

We also started to research the new-generation 
digital assistants. Using Microsoft Copilot, we 
are evaluating technology and persona-based 
needs as part of our generative AI in the 
workplace plans. 

Operational productivity
We are continually investing in improving our 
operational productivity, reducing changeover 
times between flavours, optimising washing 
procedures, developing our predictive 
maintenance routines and managing 
complexity of production. 

Managing complexity is key as we expand our 
flavour ranges and expand our lines, and we 
launched a Digital Twin pilot project in Edelstal, 
Austria, to explore how to make both financial 
and sustainability savings as the manufacturing 
process becomes more complex.

Other examples of where we are using digital 
include 250 manufacturing practices shared 
through our internal software platform 
‘WeKnow’, enabling best practice and learnings 
to be shared across the organisation. 

We have also implemented a new digital 
application to support plant operators’ 
personal development and capabilities, and in 
particular their ability to embrace technological 
developments, in our connected worker platform. 

Our Digital Factory journey 
so far
The Digital Factory addresses all three 
buckets of our digital, data and technology 
strategy. In 2023, we created a dedicated 
‘Head of Digital Factory’ role to recognise 
the importance of investing in our digital 
innovation and capabilities.

Strengthening our supplier 
partnerships and supply 
chain effectiveness
We consider our suppliers as critical partners, 
contributing to the ongoing and sustainable 
success of our business. Under a unified 
procurement framework, we segment our 
supply base universe of around 15,000 parent 
level supplier organisations into direct and 
indirect spend suppliers, and a hierarchy 
according to their importance. You can read 
more about this and a full description of our 
supply chain on our website (https://www.
coca-colahellenic.com/en/about-us/what-we-
do/supply-chain). We place significant focus 
on forming partnerships with suppliers that have 
supply points located within our countries, both 
multinational and local, while also developing 
strong local suppliers across our territories. 
These efforts support our strategy for local 
sourcing and contributing to socio-economic 
development in the countries where we operate.

We have built a borderless supply chain to a large 
extent that operates effectively and efficiently, 
enabling us to embed innovative technologies 
and respond to customers and suppliers fast. 
We are innovating within our supply chain 
to expand our technical capabilities, driving 
productivity improvements and making cost, 
energy and water savings. 

We are investing in technologies that optimise our 
infrastructure and transform our existing plants 
into efficient mega-plants, effectively serving a 
country or an entire region. 

Our mission is to become the leading 
supply chain function in our industry 
in terms of customer service and 
cost efficiency. To achieve this, 
we focus our efforts on keeping 
our people engaged, excelling in 
sustainability, reducing our costs 
and building best-in-class customer 
service and responsiveness.”

Ivo Bjelis, 
Chief Supply Chain Officer

Stakeholders

Our people

Our communities

Strengthening our culture
We passionately believe that it is only 
with the strength, competence and 
engagement of our people that we will 
achieve our vision and ambitious growth 
agenda. Over the last year, we took 
time to reflect on our wider purpose 
and culture, working with colleagues 
from across the organisation to identify 
a unifying purpose: to open up moments 
that refresh us all.

The subsequent ‘Culture Story’ brought to life in 
2023 is about all of us at Hellenic – who we are, 
our purpose, vision, leadership model, values and 
the behaviours we commit to. It is a story that, for 
the first time, was captured in a Culture Manifesto, 
accessible to all as a booklet and serving as our 
guiding star in all we do. 

We unveiled the Culture Manifesto to senior 
leaders at the annual Leadership Conference in 
Cairo. Shortly afterwards, the story was cascaded 
the same day across all our teams through 
townhall sessions. Our people were further 
engaged through culture labs to build a common 
understanding behind our purpose, values and 
behaviours and to identify team and personal 
commitments that bring our culture to life every 
day. To address the needs of our employees, 
we continued to deploy our bi-annual culture 
and engagement survey, which looks at how we 
are performing against our engagement and 
committed values and behaviours. We scored 
well on the values of ‘We over I’ and ‘Deliver 
Sustainably’, with further work expected to ‘Make 
it Simple’ so that colleagues can avoid time spent 
on non-value-adding activities. We are taking this 
feedback seriously, accelerating how we simplify 
our processes and the way we work.

For example, Oxygen, our Group-wide initiative 
to simplify and introduce smart ways of working, 
has already freed up more than 633,000 hours 
of colleague time. This is thanks to innovations 
such as dynamic routing, piloted in Poland, which 
is reducing travel time for sales teams visiting 
customers by around a third, freeing up 10% of 
their time. We are now rolling dynamic routing 
out to new markets. 

With a new network of passionate ‘change 
leaders’ across the organisation, we look 
forward to accelerating cultural progress in 
2024, against the ultimate objective to put our 
customers first, make it simple and open up 
opportunities for growth.

Making culture real 
through storytelling
Sharing stories from our diverse and talented 
people from across our markets is one of the 
best ways in which we can ensure colleagues 
feel seen, heard, valued and connected to 
each other – and to our culture. 

Red Talks has been an effective platform to 
enable this and in 2023, it proved to be a popular 
way for colleagues to share personal and 
professional experiences, ideas and insights 
securely via their preferred channel – from 
videos to live storytelling and presentations. 

Meanwhile, Coffee Corner events were well 
attended. These open, informal live chats 
invite our storytellers to share on a range 
of topics, from leadership and growth to 
development and feedback. With 150-250 
participants per session, Coffee Corner 
events have sparked interest from across 
the organisation. All our people stories are 
stored in the Red Talks Hub to be accessed 
anytime, anywhere.

Engagement and collaboration
Prior to our bi-annual culture and engagement 
survey in September, a pulse survey in April already 
showed improvement in five out of six strategic 
areas: Strategic Priorities; Work-Life Balance; 
Customer Centric Recognition; Simplification and 
Retention. The culture and engagement survey 
was updated to align with our new values and 
leadership model. Record-breaking participation 
(92%) and a high sustainable engagement 
index score (86%) were headline achievements, 
alongside ‘belief in our strategic priorities’ (88%), 
‘feeling proud to be part of our Company’ (93%), 
and ‘recommend the Company to others’ (87%). 
We also saw a nine percentage points increase 
in Business Developer retention scores vs 2022. 
Our 2023 results were two percentage points 
below the Qualtrics Global Top Decile Norm for 
engagement and we will continue to benchmark 
our performance against other high-performing 
companies. We are also improving how we 
collaborate across functions, which we measure 
through the ‘collaborating for impact’ survey. 
We saw participation nearly doubling, reaching 
28,358 responses, and significant progress 
in cross-functional collaboration. Our internal 
NPS score improved to 30 in November from 
15 in February. While we keep sight of the desired 
behaviours we want to nurture, we are focusing 
to address the opportunities on the biggest 
drivers to create a tangible impact with our 
frontliners and our customers.

Participation in our performance management 
framework, ‘performance for growth’, reached an 
all-time high of 97%. We refreshed the framework 
as well, aligning it with our new values and 
leadership model and emphasising simplification, 
value-adding activities and prioritisation. 

We also revisited feedback loops, introduced 
colleague feedback processes, enhancing 
collaboration across functions and borders. 
This new feedback approach resulted in more 
employees receiving individual feedback (67% 
compared with 46% in 2022). This positive 
evolution underscores our commitment to 
cultivating a high-performance culture that 
resonates with our workforce.

Employee turnover continued to fall, landing at 
11.4% compared with 11.8% in 2022. Retention 
remains a key priority and we prioritise exit 
surveys, attractive remuneration and regular 
dialogue through STAY conversations. We have 
decreased the ratio of female managers leaving 
compared with male counterparts, thanks in 
part to focus groups that were held to better 
understand the root causes of female turnover 
and the action plans put in place.

Supporting our people 
in Ukraine
We could not be prouder of the resilience, 
collaboration and unity demonstrated by 
our team in Ukraine as the country faced a 
second year of war and uncertainty. 

Their safety and wellbeing have remained our 
utmost priority, while colleagues from around 
the world have continued to give generously 
– with monetary aid, time, awareness and 
support. We also ran resilience webinars 
and coaching sessions, townhall events and 
engagement workshops, both on- and offline 
to ensure our Ukraine colleagues feel involved 
and supported by us all. 

Our ‘women in sales’ community was created 
to amplify learning and development for 
female Ukrainian sales teams, while our ‘reskill 
to win’ programme helped anyone having to 
relocate within the country. We continued 
working with local youth organisations, 
providing hope and opportunity for those 
starting their careers and we restarted the 
Fast Forward development programme to 
bring local talent together.

Welcoming Egypt to the  
Coca-Cola HBC family
Integrating over 5,600 new colleagues from 
Egypt was a key focus during the year. The 
Leadership Conference, hosted in the country, 
was a strong starting point to align on culture 
and ambitions, supported by the Culture 
Manifesto and followed up by 11 roadshows 
across the country. We also extended our 
culture and engagement survey to Egypt, 
with an impressive participation rate of 97% 
and a sustainable engagement index score of 
85%. We have identified further improvement 
opportunities in connecting and collaborating 
with our colleagues in Egypt, which we will 
address through follow-up workshops.

We also rolled out in Egypt our annual 
talent review programme and performance 
management cycle, covering over 700 people 
by the end of the year. Line manager labs 
focused on talent acquisition, rewards and 
policies, attended by over 500 colleagues. 
Meanwhile, more than 1,500 end users and 
1,200 as Business Developers and Sales 
Team Leaders were trained, as our new SAP 
system went live in the country.

Health and safety
The health and safety of our people is of 
paramount importance for us, which is why 
we keep focusing on improving systems and 
initiatives, while engaging employees and 
contractors. We enhanced our behaviour-
based safety programme by embedding 
more human and operational principles across 
manufacturing and non-manufacturing locations. 
We have reached 97% programme coverage 
in manufacturing, 96% in warehousing, 95% in 
commercial (excluding Nigeria) and 56% in our 
offices. By end of 2023, 2,168 employees and 
740 contractors were trained as behaviour-based 
safety observers, and we eliminated 80.3% of 
barriers to safety identified under this programme. 

The programme was rolled out to three new 
manufacturing locations in Egypt, where 47 
observers were trained, and 831 behaviour-based 
safety observations were conducted.

We are very happy to report zero employee 
fatalities. However, with great regret there were 
five contractor fatalities that happened on the 
road and within our premises. 

Out of three road accidents leading to a 
contractor fatality, two were caused by a public 
driver. Unfortunately, one on-site fatality was 
reported when a contractor’s truck assistant was 
hit by a reversing truck and the other unfortunate 
on-site incident happened during a forklift repair. 
In both cases, we made a detailed root cause 
analysis, took appropriate corrective actions and 
shared the lessons learned across all our countries 
with mandatory preventative actions to be put 
in place. Our Employee Lost Time Accident Rate 
(LTAR) was 0.27, a 23% improvement versus 2022. 
The Contractors’ Lost Time Incident Frequency 
rate (LTIFR) improved by 9%. In compliance with 
TCCC’s Life Saving Rules (LSR), we conducted 
quarterly assessments of all manufacturing and 
non-manufacturing facilities, achieving 84.7% 
compliance (excluding Russia). Based on these 
assessments, each country has developed its 
own corrective actions to address critical gaps 
and achieve full compliance.

Wellbeing and reward
We continue our commitment to fostering a 
workplace culture that prioritises and supports 
the wellbeing of our people. A dedicated wellbeing 
framework, centred around physical, mental, 
financial and social wellbeing, has been crucial 
to nurturing a healthy and resilient workforce. 
In 2023, alongside continued wellbeing initiatives, 
we organised a session focused on resilience 
and stress management led by a professional 
counsellor from our Employee Assistance 
Programme. Amid high inflation in many of our 
operating countries, we prioritised financial 
wellbeing, including conducting a session with 
valuable insights and strategies to manage 
financial pressures. 

We automated our rewards processes by 
implementing the Beqom platform for annual 
increases in four business units. Following very 
positive user feedback, we also developed a 
management incentive plan (MIP) module and 
deployed digitalised processes to more business 
units, now numbering eight, with the expectation 
to run our annual increases and MIP in almost all 
business units on the platform in 2024. Preparing 
to launch a new workforce administration system, 
Workday, in 2024, we have doubled down on 
increasing the quality of data management, which 
will be a critical enabler in a consistent and better 
employee experience, supported by simplified, 
standardised and automated HR administration.

Continuous improvement in 
reducing accidents

4%reduction in accidents per  

million kilometres in 2023,  
from 1.69 to 1.63

Keeping in place our established fleet safety 
programmes, together with special attention 
on vehicle safety, we can report another year of 
continuous improvement in reducing accidents 
per million kilometres, achieving 1.63. 

To maintain health and safety momentum, 
we conducted two engagement campaigns on 
increasing the safety awareness. One of them 
was linked to World Safety Day in April: “See, Say, 
Do something – Save a life. Stay safe for what you 
love.” The second campaign in October addressed 
safety awareness before the winter season and 
was a continuation titled “Stay Safe for what 
you love!” We also launched a health and safety 
observation toolkit as an app-based resource 
for all colleagues to observe and report hazards 
or unsafe behaviours and to encourage safety 
conversations. Despite positive progress in our 
LTAR Mission 2025 commitments, we seek to 
accelerate it by working with selected business 
units with higher LTARs and engaging their 
leadership teams. We will also continue optimising 
our behaviour-based safety programme and 
strengthen the safety culture and behaviour 
of our employees and contractors.

Diversity and inclusion
We maintained our commitment to diversity 
and inclusion, executing actions as part of our 
business plans and monitoring our progress 
closely. A consistent, continuous focus on 
recruitment, talent and retention has improved 
gender diversity at all levels, with 41.8% of 
management positions now held by women, 
thanks to proactive strategies such as gender-
balanced recruitment shortlists. Overall, nearly 
half of our internal appointments were women 
(46%), while also 38% of our external hires were 
female. On a management level, 51.4% of external 
hires were women, while amongst our sales-based 
external hires the share of females was 36.2%.

We were proud to receive 15 diversity-related 
awards. Further highlights included the following:

•  Ten women senior managers joined WeQual, 

an initiative that brings together global 
organisations to drive gender equality. Our CEO 
continues to be a judge at the WeQual awards 
for female leaders. 

•  Participating in the LEAD conference, as 

a TCCC partner – the largest diversity and 
inclusion event for the European FMCG and 
retail industry. 

•  Support The Boardroom in Greece to develop 

women for Board positions. 

To ensure we adhere to all applicable laws and 
regulations and demonstrate best practice 
around diversity and inclusion, we regularly review 
our Human Rights Policy, our Code of Business 
Conduct, and other internal standards. Find out 
more on pages 114 to 115 and on our website.

Championing women 
in leadership
We continue to champion the professional 
development of our female talents through 
our Women in Leadership programmes. 
During the last year, 78 of our female leaders 
participated in the six-month programme, 
which aims to build engaged and capable 
female leaders, support their transition into 
new roles and change cultural factors that 
may hold them back. 32% of participants 
who completed ‘Women in Leadership 1’ 
and 23% of participants who completed 
‘Women in Leadership 2’, during 2022 and 
2023, have been promoted. Our CEO, Zoran 
Bogdanovic, featured as the first guest in 
its new community talks. 

Our own ‘women leader stories’ video 
series included topics around work-life 
balance, career growth and leadership. 
It has attracted over 18 million views 
since its launch in 2021! Finally, our local 
business units continued creating their own 
regionally targeted campaigns to empower 
women, including breaking women in sales 
stereotypes in Serbia and women in supply 
chain campaigns in Austria and Romania.

Finding our Gen Z 
future leaders
We were delighted to kick-start our 
international leadership trainee programme. 
Designed to challenge and develop Gen Z 
graduates to become our next generation 
of leaders, it is focused on commercial 
experience through a 70-20-10 learning 
model that combines hands-on experience 
with mentoring from our senior leaders 
and highly acclaimed formal learning in 
partnership with Hult, a private business 
school. We supported the programme with 
a marketing campaign, ‘Bring Your Own 
Magic’, which reached out to more than 2.5 
million Gen Z candidates. The campaign was 
nominated for ten global and local awards for 
digital communication and employer branding 
excellence, and won six including Silver in the 
Digital Communication Awards 2023.

Talent development:  
Our lighthouse capability
Our commitment to people development is 
supported by our constantly evolving Talent 
review framework, which enables us to identify 
successors for senior leadership roles. This year 
we have increased the number of successors 
to country function head roles by 2 percentage 
points and out of all identified successors 48% 
are now women. At the same time, we identified 
more than 200 emerging talent individuals to 
tailor their development early on in their career 
and accelerate their growth. We continued 
optimising development tools, such as STAY and 
career conversations, and individual development 
plan guides. Talent Builders was launched as a 
programme to support all new people leaders on 
an end-to-end journey dedicated to the essentials 
of recruiting, developing and retaining people. 
1,325 frontline leaders started their Talent Builder 
journey in 2023. 

To enhance talent visibility across business units 
and functional areas, we worked with 26 cross-
country talent pools, enabling more internal 
moves across our countries and functions. 
This contributed to 87 appointments into senior 
leadership roles, with 84% filled internally. 

In total, around 300 people went through 
our acceleration programmes in 2023, which 
continues to be the main source of our internal 
succession. We have also focused on our 
critical growth capabilities, introducing ‘x-ray’ 
reviews to proactively identify where we need 
to invest in external hires or internal capability 
development, which are vital for sustainable 
business performance and growth. This will 
help us to strengthen the talent pipeline, ensure 
proactive identification of succession gaps and 
enable long-term planning.

Developing critical sales and 
supply chain capabilities
We offer a suite of academies that support 
professional development of key sales roles. We 
had another year of strong uptake in 2023, with 
over 1,300 new Business Developers becoming 
certified (licence to start and licence to sell) and 
89% of existing Business Developers achieving 
certification. Alongside new Premium Spirits 
and Coffee Academies, we launched a Digital 
Commerce Academy and relaunched our Sales 
Academy for Key Accounts. We also launched 
MYcroLearnings across all our markets as 
five-minute bitesize online sessions offered 
every two weeks to our entire sales force to 
reinforce foundational and critical elements 
of sales capabilities.

We launched a new selection tool to hire 
Business Developers in 2023. Combining 
input from over 3,600 candidates and existing 
Business Developers, we were able to introduce 
performance and retention predictors to 
support hiring decisions. The new tool has 
already improved candidate experience, 
reduced time to recruit by 15% and improved 
retention of new Business Developers by 
around 5%. 

When it comes to investing in our supply chain 
talent, we launched the Supply Chain Academy 
to approximately 95% of all supply chain 
personnel across manufacturing, logistics, 
quality, planning and procurement. More than 
1,300 colleagues acquired their licence, and 
we are targeting 100% participation in the 
year ahead – showing operational excellence 
in action.

Helping our people realise 
their potential
Our talent development reinforces continuous 
learning and upskilling, while giving people the 
opportunities for personal growth. Continuously 
striving to make learning accessible to all, we 
delivered over 830,000 hours of learning in 
2023, of which 12% was in personal skills and 
74.6% was in functional skills. The majority of 
our employees learned ‘online’, with 71% of the 
learning activity being in self-paced, ‘anytime,

our virtual LearnFest drew in over 6,600 attendees 
across 16 sessions and four days.

Ensuring our employees can also learn from each 
other, we provide access to coaches and mentors 
through technology-enabled solutions. After 
a successful campaign to inspire and encourage 
internal coaching, in 2023 we incorporated it 
into other learning and talent initiatives. Looking 
to future talent, Avature, our new recruitment 
platform, saw rapid and full adoption by our 
recruiters, doubling the number of candidates 
per recruitment requisition and candidates in our 
talent network. We successfully completed the 
second phase of Avature implementation with a 
new career site, automated recruitment reporting 
and advanced talent acquisition analytics.

Recognised as an employer of choice
In 2023, we increased our ranking in Universum’s 
employer of choice ratings, despite ongoing 
change in talent preferences. Overall, external 
perception of our business increased by six points, 
positioning us in 12th place across all industries 
and in the top five of preferred employers in 
the FMCG sector, of 16 markets. Our brand 
and reputation as an employer is supported by 
authentic accounts shared by our people – each 
year, around 1,300 employees share regular 
content about Coca-Cola HBC on social media 
platforms, reaching over three million potential 
recruits to our business – a consistent growth 
of 85% versus 2022.

Our people practices have been recognised 
externally, with 74 prizes and awards in the last 
year. As well as the diversity and inclusion awards 
listed above, recognition was given to employer 
branding, talent and employer reputation.

Sustainable growth
We are proud to be global industry leaders 
in sustainability. This year we were ranked – 
for the seventh time – as the world’s most 
sustainable beverage company by the Dow 
Jones Sustainability Indices1. Our score positions 
us in the top 1% of 9,400 companies across 62 
industries. This year we also scored a double-A 
ranking for our commitment to transparency on 
climate and water from CDP and we are on CDP’s 
2023 Supplier Engagement Leaderboard.

These achievements are the result of our clear 
vision and targets in sustainability, bold and 
entrepreneurial mindset, and continuing investment 
in technology and innovation. Strong collaboration 
with our suppliers and partners and highly skilled and 
committed colleagues working across our markets 
have also been crucial to this success. We know we 
still have work to do and remain committed to being 
part of the solution to global sustainability challenges. 

Sustainability creates value for our stakeholders and 
supports the socio-economic development of the 
communities in which we operate. As we continue to 
produce our drinks in more sustainable ways, it helps 
us open up opportunities for a better future. 

Here are some examples of what we are doing:

•  A significant focus for us is promoting plastic 

circularity, and our primary packaging is already 
100% recyclable. We are making strong 
progress towards achieving our other Mission 
2025 commitments on packaging of collecting 
at least 75% of the primary packaging we place 
in the market and using, on average, 35% 
recycled PET in our bottles2.

•  In 2023, 100% of our electricity in the EU 

and Switzerland came from renewable and 
clean sources. 

•  On water stewardship, we now have community 
projects in 12 water risk areas where we operate 
– up from eight last year.

•  We announced a new charitable foundation, 

with an initial donation of €10 million, dedicated 
to supporting local communities.

•  We became a partner in the $137.7 million Greycroft 
Coca-Cola System Sustainability Fund with seven 
other bottlers and The Coca-Cola Company.

We strongly believe sustainability is a true growth 
driver for us and our partners. We continue to 
integrate sustainability in our business model 
and support value creation for the business:

• 

In Austria, we invested €12 million in a returnable 
glass bottling line for both one litre and our new 
400ml resealable bottles3. We also introduced an 
industry-leading, innovative solution to replace 
plastic shrink film with 100%-recyclable paper 
on 1.5 litre multi-packs. These innovations help 
us improve packaging circularity and win in the 
marketplace as they meet our consumers’ demand 
for glass packaging and no-plastic packaging.

•  We have invested more than €50 million in 
three in-house rPET production units. This 
supported our shift to 100% rPET portfolio in 
selected markets. In-house rPET production 
helps us reduce costs compared with buying 
from third-party suppliers and eliminates extra 
transport costs.

•  We exceeded our goal of having 50% energy- 

efficient coolers in the market (excluding Egypt, 
which we acquired in 2022), with a total of 55% 
by December 2023 – two years ahead of target. 
These coolers consume less energy, so they 
generate less emissions, and mean lower 
energy costs for our customers.

This year we integrated Egypt into our 
sustainability strategy – after we acquired the 
Coca-Cola Bottling Company of Egypt in 2022 
– and developed specific plans for the market. 
As we continue to develop our 2030 aspirations, 
we will integrate our Egyptian operations in our 
future commitments.

We know that there is a lot to be done, but we 
are encouraged by the progress we have made 
in 2023 and remain committed to accelerating 
our efforts to build a more sustainable future.

Climate 

Towards net zero emissions
In 2021, we committed to achieve net zero 
emissions across our entire value chain by 2040. 
This is our most ambitious, complex and forward-
looking commitment. We were among the first 
companies to adopt science-based reduction 
targets by the Science Based Targets initiative 
(SBTi). In our net zero roadmap, our starting point 
is 2017, which is the baseline for our science-
based targets. 

We have halved direct emissions and reduced our 
absolute total value chain emissions in scopes 1, 
2 and 3 by a third1 from 2010 to the end of 2023, 
despite a global increase in emissions2. These 
results come from our sustained investment and 
focus, and highlight our consistent approach to 
decarbonisation. 

Reducing carbon emissions is the non-negotiable 
goal for our business. We continued to work 
across our value chain to reduce emissions, 
with a particular focus on packaging, coolers 
and ingredients. We do this because we will make 
the biggest progress by delivering sustainable 
solutions in these parts of our value chain. 

By the end of 2023, we had reduced emissions 
from scope 1 and 2 from our direct operations 
by 36% and in all three scopes, our absolute 
emissions, by 16.4% compared with 2017. 

1.  Excluding Egypt.
2.  Global Carbon Project; Expert(s) (Friedlingstein et al. (2023)).

Looking ahead
In 2023, we updated our net zero roadmap 
with two important changes. We integrated 
our Egyptian operations into our 2030 and 
NetZeroby2040 climate targets and, in 
January 2024, we submitted them to the SBTi 
for validation and approval. We also added 
new Forest, Land and Agriculture (FLAG) 
targets. 

After SBTi validation, these changes will be 
reflected in our net zero roadmap:

•  In scope 1 and 2, we integrated Egypt and 
follow the already established pathway 
(1.5°C pathway) for 2030 and 2040.

•  In scope 3, we integrated Egypt and split 

our targets into two categories: energy and 
FLAG.

•  In scope 3, our energy-related targets will 
follow the newly established pathway Well-
Below-2-Degrees (WB2D) until 2030 and 
then the 1.5°C pathway until 2040, our net 
zero year. 

The SBTi introduced the new targets for 
FLAG in 2023. This new standard guides 
businesses to split greenhouse gas emissions 
(GHG) into non-FLAG and FLAG-related 
categories. Non-FLAG emissions are 
commonly known as energy-related GHG 
emissions. FLAG-related emissions apply 
to commodities from forestry, land and 
agricultural sectors. For us, this means scope 
3 packaging, wood and paper pulp, and sugar 
and fruit juices. We do not have any FLAG-
related business or activity under our own 
operational control. However, we have them 
in our upstream value chain in forestry and 
agricultural commodities (scope 3).

We will now update our climate transition 
plans to reflect all our main decarbonisation 
strategies, quantify our main strategic 
resources and milestones, and convert 
these to a clear set of actions.

Scopes 1 and 2 
We have taken action on two of the main 
contributors of scope 1 and 2 emissions: 

•  Focusing on being more energy efficient by 
reducing the amount of energy we use.
•  Switching to low carbon and sourcing our 

energy from renewable sources such as solar 
and hydro power.

We delivered several projects that helped to 
progress reductions in scope 1 and 2 emissions 
of CO2.

1.  Excluding Egypt.

Scope 3: Reducing indirect emissions 
from our value chain
Over 90% of our emissions are in scope 3, 
we focus on three main areas in collaboration with 
our suppliers: packaging, ingredients and coolers.

•  Packaging accounts for 36% of our scope 1,2 
and 3 emissions. We are reducing packaging-
related emissions through a range of 
actions, including rolling out new packaging 
collection systems, increasing recycled 
content, expanding reuse and eliminating 
unnecessary packaging.

•  In 2023, we exceeded our target of having 

50% of energy-efficient coolers in shops and 
outlets by five percentage points, bringing 
the total to 55%. As a result, we reduced 
emissions by 127,461 tonnes compared 
with our 2017 baseline.

•  Critical enabler: suppliers’ 
emissions improvement

We collaborate with our suppliers and partners to 
encourage them to reduce their own emissions. 
In 2021, fewer than ten suppliers were in CDP 
to disclose their emissions, so we set up our 
emissions supplier programme. By the end 
of 2023:

•  189 of our significant suppliers disclose their 

emissions through CDP.

•  117 have already set, or have committed to set, 

science-based targets.

•  These 189 suppliers buy – on average – 26% 
of their energy from renewable sources.

Engaging suppliers to reduce energy and 
use renewable energy is key to meeting our 
NetZeroby40 commitments. In 2023, our 
Supplier Conference focused on ‘opening up a 
more sustainable future together’. We were joined 
by about 200 supply partners. At the conference, 
we gave them inspiration and tools to start or 
continue their own sustainability journey and 
celebrated those who are already on the path to 
reducing emissions. The event was supported 
by expert insight from CDP and the World 
Economic Forum.

Innovating for decarbonisation

Delivering our drinks in more sustainable ways
We can reduce CO2 emissions by changing the types of transport we 
use. In the first pilot of its kind on the island of Ireland, we are using three 
best-in-class electric Heavy Goods Vehicles (e-HGVs) with a range of 
300km. We expect the e-HGVs to reduce carbon emissions by 229 tonnes 
each year – the equivalent of charging over 25 million smartphones1. 
We’ve collaborated with a customer and transport supplier on this initiative. 
This type of partnership along the value chain aims to showcase how 
important it is for the industry to work together and share insights 
so we can reach our shared and individual sustainability goals. 

In Serbia, we more than doubled the number of Compressed Natural 
Gas (CNG) trucks we use in 2023. Since 2021, we have reduced our 
CO2 emissions by around 480 tonnes annually and by the end of 2024, 
we expect to save around 830 tonnes each year.

Innovating for decarbonisation

Manna drones in Ireland
Drones offer fast, safe and quiet home delivery, 
and can deliver to a five-kilometre radius in 
less than three minutes. They can also be up 
to eight times more efficient in terms of CO2 
emitted during delivery when compared with 
conventional petrol vehicles, according to 
a report from Maynooth University in Ireland 
in 2022. 

We are pleased to have invested – through our 
Ventures arm – in Manna Aero, an Irish start-
up leading the way in food and beverage drone 
deliveries. We believe this partnership will help us 
drive profits, deliver better customer service and, 
importantly, reduce harmful CO2 emissions.We 
are looking forward to Manna Aero expanding 
its operations and bringing drone deliveries to 
more cities in the EU and elsewhere.

Decarbonising our value chain
We continued our work to meet our emissions 
reduction targets for 2025, 2030 and 2040. We 
invested in energy efficiency and recovery, and in 
low or zero-carbon (renewable) energy sources, 
and continued to improve, for example, our 
processes, planning and cleaning. 

Our EU and Swiss manufacturing facilities moved 
from using 99.2% in 2022 to 100% renewable and 
clean1 sources this year. We have energy transition 
plans in place for other business units to follow 
suit. We also intensified our efforts in Nigeria 
and Egypt. 

By the end of 2023, we had invested about €28 
million in energy-efficient solutions, including Top 
20 energy savers (excluding Egypt).

Sourcing our energy
In Nigeria, our eight manufacturing plants 
now have solar panels and source 14% of their 
electricity from renewable energy sources. We 
had increased our Nigerian renewable and clean 
energy supply from 58% in 2022 to 73% by the end 
of 2023. All the electricity supplied from the public 
grid is renewable for our Nigerian operations.

This year, we started using cleaner sources 
such as solar energy from rooftop panels in our 
production plant in Challawa. We also continued to 
extend these sources in our production plants in 
Ikeja and Abuja, reaching total installed capacity to 
12 MW compared with 10 MW in 2022.

In Egypt, we installed solar rooftop panels in four 
out of five of our plants, so 10% of our annual 
electrical energy comes from renewable sources. 
We are working on plans to optimise energy use 
solutions and collaborating with our partners to 
expand renewable electricity sourcing plans.

 Clean source means CHP using natural gas.

Transitioning to a green fleet 
In 2023 , we built on the positive momentum of our 
Green Fleet Programme, keeping the trajectory to 
achieving our 2030 CO2 emissions reduction goal. 
We continued our transition to electric and hybrid 
vehicles, which comprise 44% of our total light 
fleet, compared with 16% in 2021 and 28% in 2022. 
We reduced our fleet carbon footprint compared 
with our baseline (2017) by 43%, a reduction of 
about 43,743 tonnes of CO2. We reduced our 
emissions on our light fleet by 19,513 tonnes 
compared with our baseline, and about 24,230 
tonnes of emissions reduction over the same 
period for our heavy fleet.

Our Green Fleet Programme helped us to reduce 
emissions in 2023.

Packaging

Packaging plays a central 
role in delivering our Mission 
2025 commitments and CO2 
emissions reduction target, 
as it accounts for over a third 
of our scope 3 emissions.

Improving the sustainability of our packaging is a 
critical priority for us. We believe every package 
has value and life beyond its initial use and that 
it should be collected and recycled into a new 
package or reused. We focused on making our 
packaging more sustainable by investing in 
recycled content, expanding reusable formats, 
in-house rPET production infrastructure – which 
helps us to have a high-quality, steady supply 
of more affordable rPET in selected markets 
– and driving the implementation of effective 
collection models. 

Packaging can only be circular if it is recyclable. 
Since 2022, 100% of our primary packaging – PET, 
glass, aluminium and aseptic cartons – has been 
recyclable by design. We achieved this milestone 
three years ahead of our 2025 target. 

Our Mission 2025 sustainable packaging vision is

Progress towards our sustainable  
packaging vision

Slovakia: Outstanding 
collection results from DRS
PET collection rates in Slovakia soared from 
50% in 2022 to 92% in 2023, after a new 
Deposit Return Scheme was introduced 
in 2022. In its second year of operation, 
the scheme had 3,250 collection points 
and high levels of consumer engagement. 
This demonstrates how effective a well-
designed and properly implemented 
DRS can be in increasing collection rates. 
The scheme gives a right of first refusal to 
all registered producers on the market to 
purchase their fair share of the collected 
post-consumer materials, supporting 
circularity and high-quality bottle-to-bottle 
and can-to-can recycling.

In 2023, we kick-started the Pack Mix of the 
Future programme across all EU geographies. 
It sets out our vision and trajectory on pack mix 
to continue profitable growth while reducing our 
CO2 footprint through packaging,

We continued to explore the role of dispensers 
and reusable vessels to assess how they could 
contribute to increasing reusable packaging. As 
we do this, we leverage existing market solutions 
and pilot new technologies. 

Collecting and recycling
We are leading industry efforts to introduce 
effective and efficient collection systems in all our 
markets. These include Deposit Return Schemes 
(DRS) in most of our EU markets. 

Romania became the first market in our Group 
in 2023 to combine all three key ingredients of 
plastic packaging circularity:

•  A 100% rPET local bottle portfolio. 
•  An in-house rPET facility.
•  A Deposit Return Scheme. 

By the end of 2023, six of our markets had 
launched DRS: Croatia, Estonia, Latvia, Lithuania, 
Romania and Slovakia, The Republic of Ireland and 
Hungary launched DRS in Q1 2024. The Hungarian 
DRS will have a six-month transition phase. 
Well-designed DRS have a proven track record 
of delivering very high collection rates, typically 
over 90%. We are supporting several additional 
markets to launch DRS in 2025-27.

These combined efforts meant that, in 2023, we 
made significant progress towards our packaging 
collection goal, delivering an overall collection rate 
of 56%, an increase of eight percentage points 
from 20221.

1.  Excluding Egypt.

In Africa, we are working with governments and 
other stakeholders to help establish effective 
Extended Producer Responsibility (EPR) systems 
for packaging collection on a national level. 
In 2023, in Nigeria, we supported a range of 
collection projects, including those of the Food & 
Beverage Recycling Alliance (FBRA). As an alliance, 
FBRA collected almost 40,000 metric tonnes 
(MT) PET in total in 2023 – more than three times 
the amount collected in 2022.

In Egypt, we continued our partnership with 
recycler BariQ to collect and recycle more than 
20,000 MT PET, while also engaging with the 
Egyptian government to offer our support in 
establishing a new national Packaging Recovery 
Organisation (PRO).

Tethered or attached closures help capture the 
entire package for recycling. From 4 July 2024, all 
plastic closures on beverage containers over three 
litres in Europe must have tethered caps to meet 
new rules in the EU’s Single Use Plastic Directive. 

In 2023, we extensively rolled out tethered 
closures to over 80% of our beverage containers 
in scope, so we were prepared for this EU 
Directive. This roll out covered our EU markets and 
Bosnia, North Macedonia, Serbia and Switzerland.

rPET
Using recycled content is a key part of our 
approach to making our packaging circular. In 
2023, 16.1% of the PET that we used was rPET1. 
This represented a significant increase compared 
with our 2022 performance (10.5%) and solid 
progress towards our 2025 target to have 35% 
rPET usage across our Group1.

By the end of 2023, in Austria, Italy (excluding 
water), the Republic of Ireland and Northern 
Ireland, Romania and Switzerland, we had shifted 
our locally produced plastic bottles to 100% rPET.

With these initiatives, we almost doubled the 
percentage of rPET in EU markets and Switzerland 
in the last year from 22.3% rPET in 2022 to 
42% rPET in December 2023. To date, we have 
invested over €50 million in in-house rPET 
production facilities in Italy, Poland and Romania. 
In-house rPET production helps us reduce costs 
compared with buying from third-party suppliers 
and eliminates extra transport costs.

We are on track to achieve 50% rPET in our plastic 
bottles across our portfolio in EU markets and 
Switzerland by 2025.

Expanding reusable packaging
Reusable packaging plays a critical role in reducing 
waste and our carbon footprint, and minimising 
the amount of packaging we produce. Reusable 
packaging includes returnable and refillable glass, 
and dispensers such as fountains or freestyle 
machines, provided reusable vessels are used.

Eliminate unnecessary packaging 
We launched innovative secondary packaging 
for multi-packs of 1.5 litre Coca-Cola, Fanta and 
Sprite. The revolutionary new type of cardboard 
– LitePac Top – is easy to carry and recycle. 
The pilot project in Austria will initially save 
about 200 tonnes of plastic each year.

We continued to explore new-generation 
Compact Freestyle Dispensers in selected 
markets. These allow consumers to use their 
own cup or vessel for more than 40 soft drinks 
and cut emissions by up to 70% emissions 
compared with PET1.
In 2023, 11.7%2 of the drinks we sold 
were in returnable containers and 4.3%2 
through dispensers.

Poland: Reusing customer displays
A new approach to promotional displays has been piloted with 
our customer Żabka, a large chain of convenience stores in 
Poland. This new system only requires the customer to change 
the branding of our products in stores – not the display units 
themselves. This means that our customer retains a high-
quality display and we save money on transport and production 
costs. This collaborative initiative created commercial value 
for us and for our customers while reducing waste and cutting 
down on CO2 emissions. 

We trialled new, high-performance stretch film 
in Ireland and Austria that reduces the amount 
of film needed by 30%. We will continue to test 
this in 2024 and plan to introduce this to our 
sparkling soft drinks portfolio in 2025.

Technology helped us to reduce the overall 
weight of packaging materials. In 2023, we did this 
successfully in the Baltics, the Czech Republic, 
Greece, Hungary, Poland, Nigeria and Northern 
Ireland. This saved over 600 tonnes of PET and 
reduced, on average, the amount of resin we used 
by 11% for specific stock-keeping units (SKUs). 
It also reduced CO2 emissions by 1,300 tonnes 
a year.

We reduced the weight of aseptic plastic closures 
in the Czech Republic, Hungary, Poland and 
Romania, and closures for sparkling soft drinks in 
Nigeria. Overall, this saved 300 tonnes of High-
Density Polyethylene (HDPE) a year, reducing CO2 
emissions by over 600 tonnes.

Increasing recycled materials 
in secondary packaging
We piloted using 100% PCR content in shrink 
film in some of our packs in Italy, Poland and 
Switzerland. We plan to launch these in markets 
in 2024.

Austria: Innovating to 
expand reusable packaging
Coca-Cola HBC Austria is a first mover in our 
29 markets when it comes to innovating with 
reusable packaging and minimising plastic, 
both of which are in demand by customers 
and consumers. 

In 2023, we opened a new high-speed, 
water and energy efficient, returnable glass 
bottling line in Edelstal. This €12 million 
investment was co-funded by the European 
Union NextGenerationEU. 

For the first time in Coca-Cola HBC, we now 
produce 400ml returnable, resealable glass 
bottles, so consumers can enjoy our drinks 
on the go or at home. 

We also produce one-litre, reusable and 
universal bottles. This means we use 
the same shape of bottle for all our soft 
drinks portfolio.

Water 

Water touches every aspect 
of our business. 
Climate change affects water availability and 
water quality. Our commitment is to protect this 
valuable resource, especially in those areas of our 
operations where water is scarce or at risk. We do 
this by: 

•  reducing, reusing and replenishing the amount 

of water we use in our activities;
•  recycling the wastewater from our 

manufacturing sites and returning it to 
the environment;

•  ensuring that communities have access to safe, 

clean water; and

•  engaging with suppliers on our Principles for 

Sustainable Agriculture.

Read more on p66

We use water from the start to the end of the 
production process for our drinks:

•  Growing core ingredients, such as sugar and 
the fruit that provides our juice concentrates.

•  Using it as the largest component of our 

beverages and cleaning, washing and sanitising 
production equipment and processes.

We have been doing comprehensive risk 
assessments for many years and calculating 
the True Cost of Water for investment decisions. 
We have updated this every year since 2015. 

Water reduction and stewardship
Our Mission 2025 commitment for water risk 
areas is to reduce water-use ratio in plants by 
20% compared with our 2017 baseline and help 
secure water availability for communities in which 
we operate.

In our operations, we have 19 water priority 
locations1, including Armenia, Bulgaria, Cyprus, 
Greece, Italy and Nigeria. These locations face 
specific stress factors such as:

•  water being scarce;
• 

local communities lacking access to water and 
sanitation services; or

•  deteriorating water quality in the watersheds.

In these areas, we focus on water-replenishment 
activities, nature-based solutions and improving 
water quality. 

In 2023, our overall reduction in water priority 
locations was 6.8% compared with our 2017 
baseline. We maintained water efficiency at the 
same levels as 2022 in all our production plants. 
In water priority locations, our water usage was 
0.6 percentage points higher than 2022. 

Our production plants in the following markets 
performed well:

•  In Bulgaria, we improved the overall water 
efficiency by 5% compared with 2022.

•  In Greece and Cyprus, we improved the overall 
water efficiency by 6% compared with 2022.

•  In Nigeria, five of our production plants 

delivered strong results on water efficiency. 
The decrease ranged from 1% to 5% compared 
with 2022.

Our water community projects

Greece: Tackling water 
scarcity for impact
Water scarcity is a threat to farmers, local 
communities and tourism in Crete’s largest 
city, Heraklion. This year we improved irrigation 
and water supply systems at five locations to 
save 14.5 million litres of water a year through 
our Zero Drop programme, which we funded 
with The Coca-Cola Foundation. The water 
resources protection programme is locally 
implemented by the Global Water Partnership 
– Mediterranean (GWP-Med) in collaboration 
with the Municipality of Heraklion. 

In Profitis Ilias, we replaced old leaking pipes 
to secure the water distribution network for 
irrigation. And in Voutes, we upgraded two major 
pumping stations, saving energy, reducing CO2 
emissions and preventing water losses.

We shared water-saving advice with the 
local community and a team of environmental 
educators trained schoolchildren. This 
included playing a water-saving game of 
snakes and ladders that was specially created 
for the programme. We also produced new 
educational displays for one of our customers, 
Chalkiadakis stores. These shared tips on how 
to save water on the promotional displays 
and in take-away leaflets for customers. 
Consumers can also buy our products at 
a discount. This important community issue is 
strongly connected with our customer’s ESG 
agenda. Our collaboration increased sales, 
created a positive perception and benefitted 
the wider community. 

We also completed the first part of work in 
Schimatari/Tanagra in Greece to prevent 
water losses at a local water treatment plant. 

Our water community projects

Romania: Rivers 
Interceptors project 
Trapping litter on four rivers flowing into 
the Danube is helping to reduce pollution in 
Romania. The innovative cleaning system 
spreads over the entire width of the river 
in specific areas that were chosen after a 
technical evaluation of where it would be 
most effective. The traps collect litter that’s 
floating on, and one metre below, the surface 
to stop it from going any further. The River 
Water Interceptors project brings together 
the private and public sector. We are in 
partnership with the CSR Nest Association, 
a non-governmental organisation that 
is managing the project, The Romanian 
Waters National Administration and local 
municipalities. Since it was set up in February 
2022, the traps have stopped over 11 tonnes 
of waste from flowing into the River Danube 
and on to the Black Sea. This has included 
1.5 tonnes of recyclable PET and 8.5 tonnes 
of wood, which we donated to local 
communities to use.

Our water community projects

Nigeria: WASH projects
Providing access to clean and safe water 
in local communities is an important part 
of our work in Nigeria. In 2023, we built 
sanitation and water facilities in Benin, Kano, 
Lagos, Maiduguri and Owerri as part of our 
€1 million commitment to celebrate our 70th 
anniversary in Nigeria. The facilities, which 
include a block of toilets, new boreholes 
and overhead tanks, aim to improve people’s 
lives through access to Water, Sanitation 
and Hygiene (WASH) services in communities 
where we operate. 

We continued to invest across our markets in 
technologies with a focus on Top Water Savers 
to reach our 2025 commitments. 

For example, we have invested in:

•  dry rinsers that clean without water;
•  automated controls for our reverse 

osmosis systems;

•  data-driven ion exchangers;
•  backwash filtration units;
•  optimising chemicals for coagulation; and
•  upgrading cooling towers.

Some of our production plants in Egypt are 
located in water stressed areas, so in 2023 
we implemented several projects to mitigate 
the risks, including the following: 

Working with our suppliers
We measure the water consumption of our 
critical suppliers to assess their basin and 
operational water risks using the Water Risk 
Filter methodology. We then work with suppliers 
operating in high-risk areas to develop plans so 
they can reduce their water use.

Our water community projects

• 

• 

•  commissioning a new water treatment in the 
Sadat plant to increase capacity and improve 
water efficiency;
initiating an upgrade to the wastewater 
treatment plant in Sadat;
installing new in-line instrumentation 
in the Alexandria plant to monitor raw 
water quality; and
integrating new flowmeters 
and updating water maps for  
all plants. 

• 

Water stewardship community projects
We have 12 water stewardship community 
projects in water risk areas where we have 
plants. In 2023, we started new projects in 
Maiduguri, Nigeria. With support from The 
Coca-Cola Foundation, we delivered solar-
powered boreholes with overhead tanks in 
four communities. These aim to give 14,000 
local people access to safe WASH services. 
We estimate our projects in Nigeria have provided 
about 4.8 billion litres of clean and safe water in 
the last five years.

Cyprus: Zero Drop 
– Mission Water
The last phase of the water resources 
protection programme “Zero Drop–Mission 
Water” in Cyprus was implemented in 2023 
by Global Water Partnership – Mediterranean 
(GWP-Med) NGO in collaboration with the 
Municipality of Aglantzia and Coca-Cola in 
Cyprus, with the exclusive funding from The 
Coca-Cola Foundation. According to GWP-
Med, the programme’s technical interventions 
in the municipality have the capacity to 
save an estimated 3,000,000 litres of water 
annually, while improving the irrigation of 
the municipality’s green spaces. From these 
interventions, about 10,000 people from the 
local community of Aglantzia, Cyprus have 
benefited. This new project builds on the 
successful implementation of a previous 10-
year water resources protection programme 
in Cyprus that has achieved remarkable results, 
saving several million litres of water annually 
and positively impacting the lives.

People and 
Communities

In 2023, we remained 
focused on making a 
positive impact on the 
local communities where 
we operate. We supported 
young people through 
#YouthEmpowered with 
training programmes 
and skills development, 
and communities in need 
with product donations, 
volunteering initiatives 
and disaster relief activities.

All figures include Egypt and Bambi.

We are here for colleagues and 
communities when disaster strikes
The world sadly witnessed more devastating 
conflicts, natural disasters and extreme weather 
events in 2023. We mobilised rapidly to provide 
immediate aid where possible. This included 
the following: 

•  Greece wildfires: About 9,000 cases of our 
soft drinks, water, juices and coolers were 
distributed through Humanity Greece, 
the Red Cross and local municipalities. 

•  Greece floods: We donated more than two 
million bottles of beverages, mainly Avra 
water, to people affected by the devastating 
floods in Thessaly, central Greece. Together 
with The Coca-Cola Company and Bodossaki 
Foundation, we donated €100,000 to support 
their immediate needs. Through a mobile unit 
of ‘Doctors without Borders’, the donation 
provided medical and psychosocial support 
to people affected in Thessaly. We plan 
to implement a recovery project in the 
affected area in 2024.

•  Slovenia floods: Access to clean and safe 

drinking water and rebuilding infrastructure 
across the country were critical to help 
communities recover. The Coca-Cola System 
donated Römerquelle water and €100,000 to 
the Slovenian Red Cross to help with this work.

•  Turkey and Syria earthquakes: It was 

important for us to help provide relief and 
support the efforts of The Coca-Cola Company 
and The Coca-Cola Foundation when these 
earthquakes happened. Turkey and Syria are 
not territories where we do business, but we 
donated €100,000 to the Turkish Red Crescent 
and CARE international in Syria.

Ireland, Czech Republic and Slovakia,  
and Italy: Donations to Food Banks
We want to support people in need and tackle food waste as part of our 
sustainability commitments. Here are some of the initiatives we were 
involved with this year:

•  Donated 70,000 meals in December 2023 in the Republic of Ireland. We 

collaborated with our customer partner Tesco and FoodCloud, a not-for-profit 
social enterprise working to tackle food waste and food security (pictured right).
•  Co-operated with food banks in the Czech Republic and Slovakia to donate more 

than 800,000 litres of beverages to food banks worth more than €360,000.
•  Supported Banco Alimentare (National Food Bank) in Italy to distribute over 

1.5 million meals during the Christmas period. We also took part in its National 
Food Collection Day with 55 colleagues volunteering. Our seven local family 
days donated the proceeds of their Christmas markets to Banco Alimentare.

Providing 
community support 
in Ukraine

•  A kindergarten that was destroyed in the 

village of Bohdanivka is now being rebuilt and 
will be able to accommodate more children. 
The Coca-Cola Company donated US $1.2 
million and we donated US $1.8 million to make 
this happen. Our production plant has been 
operating nearby for almost 25 years. 
•  At the end of 2023 we donated one million 

bottles for the most vulnerable Ukrainians to 
make the winter holidays a little more joyful. 
Many company volunteers were involved in 
the project across the whole country. Our 
Ukrainian plant produced a batch of one million 
1.5-litre Coca-Cola bottles with a special 
mark on the label ‘For you’. With the help of 
partner humanitarian organisations such as 
the Ukrainian Red Cross and Caritas Ukraine 
we distributed the drinks from December 2023 
until February 2024. This token of gratitude was 
also shared with the communities closest to the 
frontline. We donated some of our beverages 
to the D.R.E.A.M. Charitable Foundation, which 
works together with the Scottish organisation 
Siobhan’s Trust, to provide warm meals to 
residents of such regions.

Community support in Ukraine 
We continued to offer practical help and support 
to people in Ukraine and our employees affected 
by the conflict in 2023. With The Coca-Cola 
Company and NGO partners, we provided water 
and beverages to affected regions, offered 
humanitarian assistance, restored infrastructure, 
and installed electricity and heat generation 
equipment. Since the beginning of the conflict 
in Ukraine, the Coca-Cola System and The Coca-
Cola Foundation have committed US $35 million 
to support people in Ukraine.

The Coca-Cola System has helped in the 
following ways:

•  We donated €4.7 million and volunteering 
support. In partnership with the Red Cross 
Society of Ukraine, we provided 70,000 food 
kits and beverages to people in the regions 
most affected by food and water shortages. 
One kit contains one month’s supply of food 
that does not need to be refrigerated. 

•  54 electric generators were sent to hospitals, 
schools, kindergartens, boarding schools and 
centres for temporarily displaced people across 
Ukraine after The Coca-Cola Foundation 
donated US $500,000 to the Red Cross Society 
of Ukraine. Seventeen centres for internally 
displaced people also received 5,000 sleeping 
kits for their residents through this partnership 
and strong volunteering support.

•  45 mobile boilers were donated to Ukrainian 
communities most in need to help to keep 
people warm during the winter. The cost of 
the project was about US $3.5 million, which 
was donated by The Coca-Cola Foundation, 
in partnership with the Ukrainian Red Cross,

#YouthEmpowered progress

Here are just some of our 2023 
#YouthEmpowered activities:

•  In Nigeria, we trained 1,865 young people 
on viable entrepreneurship and career skills 
during the 2023 campus edition of our 
#YouthEmpowered initiative. This is part 
of our commitment to nurturing the country’s 
future leaders.

•  To celebrate its thirteenth year, The Coca-Cola 
Thank You Fund across the island of Ireland 
doubled the value of its grants to €200,000. 
This year, 28 non-profit organisations were 
awarded grants to help them champion and 
empower young people to take an active role in 
shaping, creating, and maintaining sustainable 
communities. The Coca-Cola Fund operates 
in partnership with the Irish Youth Foundation 
and YouthAction Northern Ireland and is jointly 
funded by The Coca-Cola Company.

•  Experts from the Coca-Cola System across 
Bulgaria shared valuable advice and insights 
with young people to help them develop 
their skills before transition to employment. 
Collaborating with SoftUni Digital, Junior 
Achievement Bulgaria, Teen Station, and 
local universities, free training was delivered 
to 4,788 young people.

#YouthEmpowered progress
We passionately believe that every young 
person has the potential to thrive. Through our 
#YouthEmpowered programme, we are equipping 
them with the skills, experience and confidence 
they need to secure a brighter future. 

By the end of 2023, we had trained 944,948 young 
people since the programme launched in 2017. 

We are confident we will meet our Mission 2025 
target of training one million young people ahead 
of target year.

Working with our communities

Co-operation, Creativity, 
Communication, Critical 
Thinking and AI
More than 4,000 young people from Poland, 
Estonia, Latvia and Lithuania joined our 
2023 #Skills4Future hybrid event hosted 
by Polish influencer, Natalia Sisik.

The theme of the 2023 event was co-
operation, creativity, communication 
and critical thinking – and the role of AI 
in youth development.

We invited 17 experts and business 
practitioners to talk about each skill 
and share their experiences, including 
the role of personal branding in the job 
market and combining creativity with 
new technologies.

During the event, Natalia presented the 
results of a survey carried out on behalf of 
Coca-Cola HBC in Poland. These showed 
that 3 in 4 young people believe that using 
modern technologies will translate into 
their future in the labour market.

“It was just wow.”
“ I would definitely 
recommend it, good 
experience.”
“ During the practical 
sessions, I clarified  
what my strengths  
are, I learned more  
about myself.”

Working with our communities

The Coca-Cola HBC Foundation
We were proud to launch The Coca-Cola 
HBC Foundation in December, and donated 
€10 million to support communities in 2024.

We have always had a strong focus on 
operating sustainably, and a long tradition 
of giving back to the communities we are 
a part of.

We have identified a number of critical 
areas where we will prioritise our support. 
These include:

•  natural disaster relief;
•  packaging and waste management;
•  corporate citizenship; and 
•  empowering youth and women.

The new foundation brings clear focus 
to our work and empowers us to make 
decisions quickly to take action where 
it is most needed.

Sustainable 
sourcing 

We are committed to sourcing 100% 
of our key ingredients in line with the 
Principles for Sustainable Agriculture 
as set out by The Coca-Cola Company. 

In 2023, we reached 79%. Of specific importance 
to achieving our biodiversity goal are the principles 
on conservation of forests, conservation of 
natural habitats, biodiversity and ecosystems, 
soil management and agrochemical management. 
Overall, the principles protect and support 
biodiversity and ecosystems, uphold human  
and workplace rights, ensure animal health 
and welfare, and help build thriving communities. 
They apply to farm-level production and form 
the basis for our continued engagement with 
Tier 1 suppliers to ensure sustainable long-
term supply with lower environmental impact.

Nutrition 

As part of the Coca-Cola System, we 
want to deliver great-tasting soft drinks 
that support balanced diets. We do this 
in five strategic ways: 

•  Less sugar, more choices: We have committed 

to reduce calories per 100ml of sparkling 
soft drinks by 25% between 2015 and 2025 
across all our markets. By the end of 2023, 
we had reduced calories by 19% per 100ml of 
sparkling soft drinks. To reach our commitment, 
we focus on growing zero formulations such 
as Coca-Cola Zero Sugar Zero Caffeine 
and new flavour creations within the Fanta 
and Schweppes brands.

•  New and different drinks: We are responding 

to changing consumer preferences by 
innovating our recipes and pack sizes, 
offering more choice. New zero formulations 
across our brands help us drive growth and 
show how constant innovation is keeping 
us at the forefront of consumer choice and 
customer preference. In 2023 we launched 
nectars reformulation for five mono fruit 
flavours with added functionalities and 
reduced sugar by 30%. We also launched new 
recipes for Schweppes Bitter Lemon Zero 
and Kinley Tonic Water in local markets with 
lower sugar and better taste. We expanded 
Pink Lemonade, the first zero sugar drink 
in our Lemonade range. 

•  Informed decisions: We provide clear and 

transparent nutrition information about what’s 
inside our drinks, such as the Guideline Daily 
Amount (GDA) and traffic-light labels on our 
core sparkling drinks in 22 markets.

•  No marketing targeting children: We commit 

to not market any of our drinks directly to 
children under 13 and do not offer any soft 
drinks in primary schools.

•  Promoting low- and no-sugar choices: We 

are promoting Coke Zero Sugar as our ‘hero’ in 
marketing campaigns encouraging more people 
to choose low- and zero-sugar drinks.

Caring for local biodiversity

Poland: Renovating a 
mineral water spring for 
local communities in Tylicz
Tourists visiting the natural water spring in 
Tylicz, Poland, can now enjoy its therapeutic 
qualities even more after a joint project 
helped to bring it back to life. Our local 
team worked with Multivita and municipal 
employees to unblock the flow and build a 
new casing for the water spring. These both 
help improve access to the water spring, 
making the region more attractive to visitors.

Biodiversity

We are serious about making a net positive impact 
on biodiversity in critical areas of our operations 
and supply chain by 2040 and eliminating 
deforestation in our supply chain by 2025. 
To reach this objective, we joined the Science 
Based Targets Network (SBTN) to focus our 
efforts on the relevant actions so both nature 
and business can thrive. 

In 2023, we undertook the mapping and 
materiality assessment on biodiversity across 
our value chain to help us set targets in areas that 
matter the most and to measure our progress. 
This assessment shows that the biggest impact 
on biodiversity comes from land conversion and 
water withdrawal from our upstream activities, 
mainly from agricultural suppliers. 

We will focus in 2024 on collaborating with our 
suppliers to develop plans to address these two 
risk areas and develop an appropriate monitoring 
system to measure deforestation at supplier level. 
In our direct operations, we currently report on 
seven manufacturing sites adjacent to critical 
to biodiversity areas. We have initiated a few 
biodiversity projects in some of these sites. 
We will now learn from these and take action 
in all the critical areas by following the official 
SBTN guidance and engaging with our business 
partners and the local communities. 

In 2024, we will also start to implement the 
recommendations of the Taskforce on 
Nature-related Financial disclosures (TNFD) 
recommendations.

Caring for local biodiversity

Serbia: Creating scenic hiking trails
Visitors to Lake Vlasina, an area of extraordinary biodiversity 
and beauty in south-east Serbia, can now use 47 kilometres 
of new hiking trails. We partnered with the United Nations 
Development Programme (UNDP), the Ministry for the 
Development of Underdeveloped Municipalities and the 
Municipality of Surdulica to create the new trail. Our natural 
spring water plant is located in Vlasina – an area of national 
significance due to its endemic flora and fauna, unforgettable 
gastronomy and rich historical and cultural heritage. 
Our ambition is to establish Vlasina as a regional must-see 
tourist destination, while supporting local businesses and 
our neighbours to grow in a sustainable way. Visitors can 
now learn about the lake and biodiversity along the trail or by 
visiting digital trails on the Serbia Trails portal. Vlasina hosted 
the nation’s largest hiking event, ROSA Hiking Day, when the 
trail opened in September 2023. New waste bins to separate 
packaging for recycling were also installed along the Vlasina 
Lake and in restaurants and cafes, in partnership with local 
waste management operator Sekopak.

Caring for local biodiversity

Hungary: Zero Waste 
Tisza River project
Coca-Cola Hungary joined forces with 
the water management authorities and 
civil society to help clean up Hungary’s 
second largest river, the Tisza. More than 
100 tonnes of waste have been removed 
since 2019 as part of the initiative. 
GPS-based tracking maps the amount 
of plastic waste and the path it takes to 
help find solutions for the future. A lot has 
been done to improve waste collection 
and treatment in Subcarpathia and a 
new water purifying container has been 
developed to make clean water more 
accessible to the local population. This 
initiative brings together the Plastic Cup 
team and the General Directorate of Water 
Management (OVF) with support from 
The Coca-Cola Foundation.

Priorities in 2024
•  Evolve our sustainability strategy with 2030 commitments.
•  Update our NetZeroby40 roadmap incorporating our Egypt 

operations and have FLAG targets approved.

•  Continue decarbonisation of our business in all three scopes. 
•  Support the roll out of national DRS in EU markets and 

advance our collection model in Nigeria.

•  Continue to innovate in sustainable packaging formats.
•  Strengthen collaboration across ESG areas with our 

customers and suppliers.

•  Get ready for compliance with new EU ESG reporting 

frameworks.

•  Continue on SBTN roadmap to define our action plan for 

biodiversity hotspots.

UN Sustainable Development Goals
Our initiatives in communities help advance the global 
objectives of good health and wellbeing, and sustainable cities 
and communities. Our initiatives to empower youth and women 
contribute to the goals for quality education, decent work 
and economic growth, sustainable cities and communities, 
and partnerships. Our initiatives regarding water stewardship, 
CO2 emissions reduction and waste reduction aid global 
progress towards the SDGs for clean water and sanitation, 
and climate action.

Tracking our progress

Key performance indicators

We measure performance against 
our strategic objectives using 
specific key performance indicators 
(KPIs). These KPIs allow us, and our 
stakeholders, to track our progress 
in delivering on our targets. 

These are also the financial and 
operational milestones which 
we focus on in implementing our 
Growth Story 2025 strategy.

How we measure our progress
Volume is measured in unit cases, where one 
unit case represents 5.678 litres. We grow 
volume as we expand per-capita consumption 
of our products and expand into new markets or 
categories. Since the start of 2022 we measure 
volume growth on an organic basis1.

What happened in the year
Volumes increased by 1.7% on an organic 
basis, led by our strategic priority categories 
of Sparkling, Energy and Coffee, which offset a 
decline in Stills, as a result of a conscious decision 
to drive profitable growth.

Link to remuneration
Revenue growth is used to assess business 
performance for the purpose of annual 
Management Incentive Plan (MIP) bonus awards, 
and volume is a key component of revenue.

Full description of the MIP p168

How we measure our progress
We measure revenues per case and revenues 
on an organic basis to allow better focus on the 
underlying performance of the business. We grow 
organic revenue per case through pricing and 
improving mix.

What happened in the year
Organic revenue per case grew by 15.0%, as 
pricing and revenue growth management actions 
in all markets drove improvements throughout the 
year. Organic revenue grew by 16.9%.

Fuel growth through 
competitiveness 
& investment

How we measure our progress
We measure this by comparable EBIT and 
comparable EBIT margin progress. We generate 
positive operational leverage as we grow revenues 
on our efficient cost base. Using a comparable 
measure allows us to adjust for one-off items which 
impact comparability of performance year on year.

What happened in the year
Comparable EBIT grew by 16.6% and by 17.7% 
on an organic basis. Comparable EBIT margins 
improved 10 basis points on an organic basis.

Link to remuneration
Comparable EBIT is used to assess business 
performance for the purpose of our MIP awards.

Full description of the MIP p168

How we measure our progress
Capex1 as percentage of NSR (%); ROIC1 (%)
We measure capital expenditure (capex) as a 
percentage of net sales revenue (NSR), and ROIC 
(return on invested capital), to ensure prudent capital 
allocation and efficient working capital management. 
Disciplined investment supports our growth.

What happened in the year
Capex as a percentage of revenue was 6.6%, 
towards the low end of our targeted range of 6.5% 
to 7.5%, reflecting the strong level of revenue 
growth achieved in the year. 

ROIC expanded by 230 basis points to 16.4%, 
driven by higher profit, partly offset by higher 
invested capital.

Link to remuneration
ROIC is given a 42.5% weighting in the assessment 
of performance conditions used to determine 
long-term Performance Share Plan (PSP) awards.

How we measure our progress
We conduct an engagement survey with an 
independent third party and measure our results 
against the norm for companies which perform 
highly on this metric.

What happened in the year
Our employee engagement score increased, 
getting closer to our ambition of the global 
top-decile norm.

Link to remuneration
Maintaining our high engagement score is one

How we measure our progress
Progress on Mission 2025 as well as progress 
towards our NetZeroby40 ambition.

What happened in the year 
We made progress against most areas of our 
commitments; however, we need to accelerate 
our improvement in packaging and focus more 
on water reduction and health and safety.

Link to remuneration
Our efforts and ambitions are long term 
and cumulative, therefore greenhouse gas 
reduction is used to determine long-term PSP 
awards. Greenhouse gas reductions have a 15% 
weighting in PSP determinations.

The benefit of this KPI is that it is quantifiable, 
and several of our Mission 2025 commitments 
feed into its progress.

Mission 2025 – our sustainability commitments 
Sustainability is integrated into every aspect of 
our business. It is fundamental to our business 
strategy, which aims to create and share value with 
all of our stakeholders.

Our Mission 2025 approach is based on our 
stakeholder materiality matrix and is fully aligned 
with the United Nations Sustainable Development 
Goals (SDGs) and their targets. Our six key focus 
areas reflect our value chain: reducing emissions; 
water reduction and stewardship; packaging 
(World Without Waste); ingredient sourcing; 
nutrition; and our people and communities. 

The table provides data on the progress of 
each of the six sustainability pillars.

Key to performance status
Each of the Mission 2025 commitments is broken 
down into a series of annual targets that need to 
be met in order to be fully on track with our 2025 
goal. The colour coding below reflects the current

Chief Financial Officer’s letter

Disciplined execution powers another year 
of strong growth

For the first time, we exceeded 
€10 billion in sales and €1 billion 
in comparable EBIT. Not only 
have we achieved record financial 
results, but we’ve accelerated 
our investment for the future 
– to strengthen our customer 
centricity, to enhance our 
execution capabilities and to do 
the right thing for our planet.”

Dear Stakeholder,
It has been a privilege to be CFO of such a 
dynamic, high-growth business, with great people, 
which has delivered great results for the third 
year running, despite significant headwinds. 2023 
comparable EBIT was €1,084 million, exceeding 
€1 billion for the first time in our history. Not only 
have we achieved record financial results and 
invested in the business to drive future growth, 
but we have also made strides in our sustainability 
journey: creating value and strengthening our 
resilience, doing the right thing for our people 
and the planet, and strengthening our right 
to win with customers and consumers.

Our record profitability was driven by our revenue 
growth management initiatives, together with 
effective actions on input cost inflation and our 
focus on cost control. This significant profit 
delivery, aided by effective management of our 
finance costs, capturing the spread between our 
largely fixed cost of borrowing and the benefit of 
rising interest rates on our cash deposits, led our 
comparable EPS to grow by 21.8%.

Converting our operational profitability to free 
cash flow, while maintaining our future-focused 
investment profile, is a key area for CCH. We 
managed that very successfully, achieving another 
year of record free cash flow of €712 million, 
which helped reduce net debt to €1.6 billion. This 
enabled us to increase our returns to shareholders 
and initiate a €400 million, two-year share buyback 
programme, consistent with our capital allocation 
priorities and demonstrating our confidence in 
future growth. And we further expanded ROIC 
to record levels, despite the challenges we faced.

alternative performance measures (APMs) on pages 295 to 301

All of these results would not have been possible 
without our people and their commitment and 
dedication to our customers and consumers. We 
are actively nurturing our talent pipeline, especially 
in the broader finance community, providing them 
with opportunities for growth and strengthening 
our succession options across all levels of the 
organisation. The appointment of my successor, 
Anastasis, from this talent pool, is testament to our 
investment in our people, ensuring the future of CCH.

When it comes to funding our sustainability agenda, 
our approach is to integrate sustainability projects 
in growth-orientated initiatives. For example, as we 
have invested in our route-to-market capabilities with 
a wider network of coolers in customer premises, 
we surpassed our target of ensuring over 50% of 
our installed base was energy efficient by June, 18 
months ahead of schedule. By the end of the year, 
that figure was 55%, excluding Egypt. We have also 
been investing in packaging circularity, more on this 
in Earn our licence to operate on pages 60 to 62.

Chief Financial Officer’s letter continued

In September, we published our Green Finance Report 
outlining our wider plans for creating a sustainable 
future, detailing the proceeds allocation and impact 
of our first Coca-Cola HBC green bond issued in 
September 2022. I am proud of our commitment to 
allocating funds to projects that make a real difference 
to the environment, allowing us to grow responsibly 
and continue to deliver our products sustainably.

Looking ahead
While we expect the macroeconomic and 
geopolitical environment to remain challenging, 
we have high confidence in our 24/7 portfolio 
and the opportunities for growth in our diverse 
markets, amplified by our bespoke capabilities, 
and, above all, the talent of our people. 

At our full-year results on 14 February 2024, we 
set out our ambitions for the year, and fully expect 
to make progress against the medium-term targets 
we set out at our capital markets event in May. 

I know that when I leave Coca-Cola HBC in May 
2024, the Company will be in a strong position 
and will be in experienced hands with Anastasis 
Stamoulis, the incoming CFO. Anastasis has a 
proven track record and broad experience gained 
from 16 years at the Company where, through 
his development journey, he held several senior 
financial positions. 

I wish Anastasis and all my talented colleagues 
at Coca-Cola HBC, as well as our customers, the 
Coca-Cola Company, the Monster Energy team, 
and other valued stakeholders my best wishes and 
heartfelt expectation that we will continue to open 
up moments to refresh us all in the years ahead.

Ben Almanzar
Chief Financial Officer

Introducing our new CFO, Anastasis Stamoulis 

Q&A

Anastasis has been with CCH for 16 years and 
has held several senior financial positions, 
including CFO in our Baltic, Bulgarian and Italian 
operations. He has also held senior Group roles 
such as Group Financial Controller, Head of Finance 
Operations, and Head of Strategic Finance and 
Financial Planning and Analysis. Before joining 
CCH, he spent seven years in senior financial 
positions in the automotive industry. He is a FCMA 
CGMA Fellow of the UK Chartered Institute of 
Management Accountants and he holds an MBA 
in Finance and a BS in marketing from Golden Gate 
University in San Francisco, USA. 

What moments were opened up for you 
in 2023?
For me, 2023 was about opening up more moments 
to think of our customers and the services we offer 
as a finance team. In response to all the changes 
in our business, for example our expanded 24/7 
portfolio including the acquisition of Finlandia, 
we have developed an elevated way of working to 
support our commercial partners. I am incredibly 
proud of our cross-functional teams, their resilience, 
agility and collaboration with customers. And I am 
incredibly proud that we delivered another strong 
year of record profits and free cash flow.

I visited our Nigerian business in May, and 
was impressed by the level of excitement, the 
dedication and commitment of our people there. 
Their passion, resilience and great long-standing 
relationships with customers, meant that we were 
able to navigate the currency devaluation and the 
cash crisis in the country. It is such challenges that 
open up the opportunities to show how strong 
and resilient our teams are, and this extends 
across all functions driving CCH forward.

How would you describe your 
leadership style?
In my view, leadership style is something that evolves 
over your career. I’ve been very fortunate, both while 
in CCH and prior, to have experienced a diverse 
range of business environments and industries. Over 
the last 16 years, I have come across many leaders 
and talents who have provided me with great insights 
across the breadth of the business, and who have 
made an impact on my development as a leader. 

I would say my style is transparent and accessible, 
letting my peers clearly know my views, and I prefer to 
tackle the issues with a hands-on approach. I believe 
in being very present in all aspects of the business 
in addition to the finance function. I am fully inspired 
by our leadership values, and I aspire living them 
through my daily interactions. One thing is certain  
– that I continue to learn and evolve every day.

What will be high on your agenda in 2024?
First, we have a very solid base to build upon and 
a proven track record of delivering our strategy. 
My focus will be continuing to deliver our growth 
story and the mid-term targets we shared at our 
investor day in May. I look forward to working more 
closely with Zoran, Naya and the other Executive 
Leadership Team (ELT) members to ensure 
we continue to focus on our capital allocation 
priorities driving sustainable growth. Maintaining 
an efficient balance sheet, while delivering more 
value to our shareholders, is high on my agenda.

Finally, a clear priority for me is investing in our talent 
pipeline and key people. By developing the right 
capabilities for the finance function of the future, 
such as embracing acceleration of digitalisation and 
automation of finance, we will open up moments 
for our people to unleash their full potential.

My focus will be continuing to deliver 
our growth story and the mid-term 
targets we shared at our investor 
day in May. I look forward to working 
more closely with Zoran, Naya and 
the other ELT members to ensure we 
continue to focus on disciplined capital 
allocation and on organic growth.”

Focused execution of our 24/7 strategy 
delivered strong organic1 growth
In 2023, our organic revenue growth was 
16.9% (10.7% on a reported basis), a very strong 
performance given continued cost inflation, and the 
global macroeconomic and geopolitical challenges. 

Against this backdrop, achieving organic volume 
growth of 1.7% (4.6% on a reported basis) across 
the business was a very positive result, and with an 
encouraging trend in the fourth quarter, where we 
saw organic volumes up 6.8%. 

Organic revenue per case grew 15.0% (5.9% on 
a reported basis). Of this, pricing continued to 

be the largest contributor, accounting for the 
majority of the gain. Package and category mix 
were also accretive, with continued improvements 
in our single-serve mix.

2023’s organic revenue performance followed 
14.2% organic revenue growth in 2022, and over 
20% in 2021. 

Major contributors to these results were a good 
conversion of our revenue growth management 
initiatives, together with effective mitigation 
actions on input cost inflation, albeit partially 
offset by transactional FX impacts. In addition, 
we delivered modest improvement to operating 
costs as a percentage of revenue. 

Operating profit, margins and cost control
Comparable gross profit grew by 13.2%, with 
gross profit margins up 80 basis points to 35.0%. 
Cost of goods sold (COGS) inflation was again 
a material headwind for the business in 2023, 
reflecting inflation in many commodities as 
well as increased costs as a result of currency 
devaluations, particularly in Nigeria. As a result, 
improving our price and mix was an important 
priority for the business in 2023. This we 
did successfully.

While operating costs increased overall, reflecting 
the impact of inflation and investments in our 
capabilities across the Group, as a percentage 
of revenue they decreased by 10 basis points to 
24.4% on a comparable basis. We benefitted from 
good operational leverage while we increased 
marketing spend and added route-to-market 
capabilities, seizing opportunities across our 
markets while maintaining tight control of non-
essential costs.

Organic EBIT up 17.7%
Comparable EBIT increased by 16.6% on a 
reported basis to €1,083.8 million, exceeding 
€1 billion for the first time in our history, 
principally driven by organic profit growth across 
our markets, only partially offset by negative 
foreign currency movements. On an organic 
basis, comparable EBIT grew 17.7% in the year. 
Operating profit grew 35.5% to €953.6 million.

The comparable EBIT margin was 10.6%, up 50 
basis points on a reported basis, and 10 basis 
points on an organic basis, benefitting from 
operational leverage.

On a reported basis, our average comparable EBIT 
growth was more than 10% since 2019, showing 
our sustained, long-term focus on increasing 
the financial fitness of this business and creating 
shareholder value. 

We saw a negative translational and transactional 
currency impact in 2023, driven by the depreciation 
of the Nigerian naira, Russian rouble and 
Egyptian pound.

Net impairment losses were €16.9 million lower, 
reflecting a €109.4 million charge in Egypt, more 
than offset by the non-repeat of the charges 
taken in 2022.

Net finance costs were €34.4 million lower than 
the prior year at €48.3 million, driven mainly by 
higher finance income as a result of increased 
interest on cash deposits and stable finance costs 
on fixed rate borrowings. 

Comparable taxes amounted to €277.1 million, 
representing a comparable tax rate of 27%, 
at the top end of our guided range of 25% to 27%.

Comparable net profit grew 22.3% to €764.2 
million. Reported net profit increased by 53.2% 
to €636.5 million.

Comparable basic EPS grew 21.8%, supported by 
strong profit delivery and effective management 
of finance costs, capturing the spread between 
our largely fixed cost of borrowing and the benefit 
of rising interest rates on our cash deposits.

Strong balance sheet to drive shareholder returns
Our balance sheet remains very strong and we continue to manage it prudently. It is a source of 
strength and flexibility, providing ample capacity for investments both organically and through M&A.

Total non-current assets decreased by €170.1 million during 2023, primarily driven by foreign currency 
translation, which was partially offset by the Group’s continued investment in property, plant and 
equipment. Net current assets decreased by €645.6 million, while non-current liabilities decreased 
by €616.8 million during 2023 respectively, mainly due to the reclassification of the current portion of 
borrowings from non-current liabilities to current liabilities.

borrowings undertaken to finance the purchase of production equipment by the Group’s subsidiary in Nigeria, classified as ‘Repayments of 
borrowings’ in the consolidated cash flow statement.

Record investment in sustainable growth 
Capital expenditure increased by €85.4 million 
to €674.9 million as we continued to invest in 
developing our production facilities, renovating 
and expanding our cooler footprint, and driving 
other strategic opportunities that help deliver our 
sustainability agenda. We added seven new lines, 
three of those in the high-growth Energy category. 
We also increased our footprint of energy-efficient 
coolers to over 55% of our fleet, excluding Egypt, 
helping support broader market presence and 
drive single-serve growth, and invested in our 
sustainability goals, including rPET production 
and packaging solutions. 

Capex as a percentage of revenue was 6.6%, 
towards the low end of our targeted range of 6.5% 
to 7.5%, reflecting the strong level of revenue growth 
achieved in the year.

Continued strong ROIC performance
ROIC is one our most important KPIs. ROIC 
expanded by 230 basis points to 16.4%, driven by 
higher profit, partly offset by higher invested capital 
– a record ROIC performance even as we managed 
through another challenging year.

Borrowings
At the close of the year, total borrowings were 
€3,424.5 million and net debt to EBITDA was 1.1x, 
even after completing the acquisition of Finlandia 
in November. The Group is well insulated from 
interest rate exposure by having most of our debt 
on fixed rates. 

After the publication of our 2023 financial results, 
and before the signing of this year’s Integrated 
Annual Report, we took advantage of attractive 
financial markets to undertake a new bond 
financing, effectively pre-financing a significant 
bond due for repayment in the second half of 
the year. This was successfully completed on 
attractive terms.

Capital allocation priorities
Our priorities for capital allocation are very clear. 
To be the leading 24/7 beverage partner, we make 
thoughtful choices, ensuring that we deploy 
capital efficiently and effectively in the service 
of profitable growth. 

For example, we continue to invest in acquisitions 
that further improve our portfolio, or our capabilities, 
particularly around strengthening our route to 
market for customers and consumers. Finlandia 
was a good example of a targeted portfolio 
enhancement, and we remain open to seizing 
the right opportunities as they come up.

Our capital discipline has also allowed us to drive 
higher returns to shareholders. In November, 
we launched a €400 million share buyback 
programme, reflecting the Board’s long-term 
confidence in our business performance, the 
prudent financial management of our balance 
sheet, and our commitment to return capital 
to shareholders responsibly. 

Dividend
The Board of Directors has proposed a dividend of 
€0.93 per share, a 19.2% increase from the €0.78 
per share dividend paid in 2022, maintaining the 
Group’s progressive dividend policy and reflecting 
the strength of our balance sheet and healthy 
liquidity position, The payout ratio is 45%, within 
the target payout ratio of 40 to 50%. The dividend 
payment will be subject to shareholders’ approval 
at our Annual General Meeting.

Financial risk management
The Group’s activities expose it to a variety of 
financial risks: market risk (including currency 
risk, interest rate risk and commodity price risk), 
credit risk, liquidity risk and capital risk. There have 
been no material changes in the risk management 
policies since the previous year end. 

The Group maintains its healthy liquidity position 
and is able to meet its liabilities as they fall due.

None of our debt facilities are subject to any 
financial covenants that would impact the Group’s 
liquidity or access to capital. In terms of foreign 
exchange risk, the Group is exposed to exchange 
rate fluctuation of the Euro versus the US dollar 
and the local currency of each country of our 
operations. Our risk management strategy 
involves hedging transactional exposures arising 
from currency fluctuations, with available financial 
instruments on a 12-month rolling basis.

As at 31 December 2023, the Group had net debt 
of €1.6 billion. In addition, at 31 December 2023, the 
Group had cash and cash equivalents of €1.3 billion, 
an undrawn revolving credit facility of €800 million, 
an uncommitted money market loan agreement 
of €200 million, as well as €0.8 billion available out 
of the €1.0 billion commercial paper programme. 

Taxes we contribute to 
our communities 

Total tax by category in 2023 (%)

Coca-Cola HBC attributes the utmost 
importance of earning trust in all tax matters. 
Specifically, we stand firmly behind the principle 
of paying relevant taxes in the countries where 
value is created and ensure that we are fully 
compliant, not only with the letter of tax laws 
and regulations, across all jurisdictions we 
operate in, but with the spirit as well. In addition, 
we commit to being open and transparent with 
tax authorities about the Group’s tax affairs 
and to disclose relevant information to enable 
tax authorities to carry out their reviews 
effectively, efficiently and without unwarranted 
delays. We support the communities in the 
countries where we operate directly, by creating 
economic wealth, and indirectly, by paying our 
fair share of taxes.

Segment highlights

Established markets
In the Established segment, organic revenues 
grew by 12.3%.

Organic revenue per case was up 15.1%, driven by 
price increases weighted to the first half. Positive 
category and package mix also helped. We continued 
to focus on single-serve activation, resulting in a 320 
basis point improvement in single-serve mix. 

Established markets volume declined by 2.4%, 
reflecting tough comparatives particularly in the 
middle of the year, but with an improving trend 
towards the end of the year. Sparkling volumes 
were slightly lower versus the prior year, largely 
reflecting comparable growth of over 9% in 2022. 
Within Sparkling, Coke Zero and Adult Sparkling 
delivered good mid-single digit growth. 

Energy volumes expanded by mid-teens despite 
very tough comparatives, with good growth in 

Monster. Coffee also grew strongly – up mid 20s – 
despite lapping strong growth in 2022. 

Stills declined by high-single digits, driven by the 
Water category, especially impacting Italy, where 
we made conscious choices to prioritise profitable 
revenue growth. 

Greece, as an example, delivered mid-single digit 
performance in Sparkling, with high-single digit 
growth from Coke Zero and Fanta, and low-double 
digit growth from Adult Sparkling. Results were 
helped by a prolonged tourist season.

Improving margins while investing in growth has 
been a key priority for some of our Established 
markets, particularly Italy, and, in 2023 the 
Established segment improved organic 
comparable EBIT margins by 100 basis points. 
Overall, organic comparable EBIT grew 23.0%. 
Operating profit grew 22.2%.

Developing markets
In the Developing segment, revenues were up 
over 18%. Revenue per case increased by 20.2%, 
driven by pricing initiatives, and positive category 
and package mix. 

We are focused on growing the share of multi-
packs of single serve and are now reaping the 
benefits of this, with a positive contribution from 
package mix for the segment as a whole.

Volumes were down 1.7%, but with an improving 
trend. The full-year performance largely reflects 
cycling very strong growth in 2022. 

Across the categories, volume trends were 
broadly consistent. In Sparkling, Coke Zero 
delivered good growth and Trademark Coke 
was slightly negative – a good outcome given 
the very strong comparatives and underlying 

market conditions. Monster also delivered mid-
teens growth. Coffee grew strongly throughout 
the year.

In terms of country performance, one highlight 
was Poland, where volumes increased by 1.5%, 
despite lapping high 2022 comparatives. Sparkling 
grew low-single digits, led by double-digit growth 
in Coke Zero and Sprite, and an encouraging 
performance from Coke Zero Sugar Zero Caffeine 
launched in 2023. Like Italy, we made deliberate 
choices to focus on profitable growth in Water 
at the expense of volume, with good success. 

Developing segment improved organic 
comparable EBIT margin by 50 basis points. 
Overall, organic comparable EBIT grew 26.9%, 
with operational leverage and cost control more 
than offsetting input cost inflation. Operating 
profit grew 34.9%.

Group financial review continued 
Segment highlights continued

Emerging markets
In the Emerging segment, organic revenue grew 
by almost 20%, driven by both volume and good 
price mix. Revenue per case increased 15.0%, 
reflecting proactive actions to manage the impact 
of currency devaluation and cost inflation. 

Emerging markets volume grew 4.3%. Sparkling 
volumes were up by mid-single digits, with good 
growth in Nigeria, Ukraine and Egypt. Energy 
volume grew strong double digits, and we were 
very satisfied with the successful launch of our 
position in the category in Egypt.

Still category volumes were broadly unchanged year 
on year, despite the substantial price increases in 
Water in Egypt during the first half of the year.

In terms of country performance, the volume growth 
improvements delivered in Nigeria were positive. 
Our results demonstrate the depth of expertise 
and strength of our team in the country as they 
achieved strong market share gains while tackling 
the impact of significant currency devaluation.

Organic comparable EBIT margin was down 
80 basis points, reflecting the net effect from 
currency headwinds. Overall, organic comparable 
EBIT grew 11.7%. Operating profit grew 50.5%

Materiality assessment

The strategic objectives referred to previously have been 
determined through a robust materiality assessment. 
This process looks in depth at our role in society, specifically the impact we 
have on stakeholders, communities and the environment, as well as their impact 
on our own activities. We conduct this assessment at least annually, evaluating 
the complex interaction between our business, our stakeholders and the world 
at large. The outcome is a list of topics that matter most to our stakeholders 
and our business, incorporating current and emerging ESG trends. 

The topics that matter most
As shown in the matrix opposite, the issues 
deemed to be of greater importance, from both an 
impact and a financial perspective, are packaging 
and waste management, and climate change. 
Our 2023 assessment also confirmed the critical 
importance of sustainable sourcing, product 
quality, and water stewardship. The horizontal axis 
shows impact materiality, while the vertical axis 
discloses the financial materiality. The size of the 
bubble reflects the topic’s prioritisation as defined 
by our stakeholders.

The matrix has been reviewed and endorsed by 
the Social Responsibility Committee of the Board. 

2023 process
Based on the GRI best practices, our materiality 
assessment was conducted in four phases: 

1)  understanding the context to identify a ‘long 
list’ of potentially relevant material issues; 

2)  assessing their impact on society and 

environment; 

3)  assessing their impact on, or importance 

to, stakeholders and the business, including 
financial impact; and 

4)  reviewing and validating findings and reporting 

priority areas. 

In step two and three, we consulted with 
approximately 500 internal and external 
stakeholders, including customers, wider 
consumers, employees, suppliers, community 
representatives, governments, non-governmental 
organisations, investors, trade associations and 
academics. We asked them to identify the topics 
they saw as having the greatest impact on people, 
society, the economy and the environment over 
time, as well as those significantly impacting our 
financial performance. We also asked which topics 
they wanted us to prioritise in our strategy and plans. 

As in previous years, we took an integrated, 
inclusive approach, drawing on Group risk 
assessments, colleague input across multiple 
functions and insights from The Coca-Cola 
Company. In applying this rigorous methodology, 
we were able to assess impacts both negative 
and positive, short- and long-term, intended and 
unintended, and reversible or irreversible – all from 
the perspective of different stakeholder groups. 
We were also able to evaluate the scale, scope, 
irremediability and likelihood of each impact 
across the value chain – upstream; in our direct 
operations; and downstream.

Materiality assessment continued

What materiality means to our 
Growth Story
The material issues identified are integrated 
into our Growth Story 2025 strategy, our 
short-, medium-, and long-term goals and our 
management of risks and opportunities across 
the value chain. 

The process also informs our disclosure, including 
this Integrated Annual Report, which is aligned 
to the International Integrated Reporting 
Council’s (IIRC) framework and the Sustainability 
Accounting Standards Board (SASB) – see pages 
120 to 122. It is prepared in accordance with GRI 
Universal Standards (2021), amongst others. The 
Executive Leadership Team has responsibility for 
integrating our sustainability priorities into our 
business strategy and activities. Management 
of the potential risks, opportunities and impacts 
of our material issues takes place across the 
Company and is disclosed throughout this report. 
Additional information about our material issues is 
included in our GRI Content Index. 

Understanding the topics that matter most 
to our business and stakeholders enables us 
to contribute to wider efforts, such as the UN 
Agenda for Sustainable Development and 
its Sustainable Development Goals (SDGs) 
and the UN Global Compact (see our latest 
Communication on Progress UNGC COP Coca-
Cola HBC (https://unglobalcompact.org/what-
is-gc/participants/2263-Coca-Cola-Hellenic)). 
Our Mission 2025 sustainability commitments, 
our short-, medium-and long-term ESG goals 
(including NetZeroby40) and our material issues 
are all mapped to the SDGs and their underlying 
targets. You can find more about how our material 
issues and sustainability commitments link to 
the SDGs on pages 72 to 74 of this report and on 
our website - Materiality (https://www.coca-

Materiality assessment continued

Future-fit materiality
A key milestone in 2023 was pivoting towards a 
double materiality methodology in preparation 
for the forthcoming Corporate Sustainability 
Reporting Directive (CSRD). In addition to the 
impact materiality, where we assess impacts the 
organisation has or could have on the economy, 
the environment, people, and human rights, 
which in turn can indicate their contribution to 
sustainable development (inside-out approach), 
we take also an ‘outside-in’ approach, focusing 
on the financial impact which identifies and 
analyses the material topics from a financial point 
of view, namely those that affect or could affect 
the Company’s financial condition or operating 
results (outside-in approach). As a first step, we’ve 
applied this approach qualitatively by considering 
mainly the ESG risks and opportunities. Dynamic 
materiality recognises that the materiality of 
sustainability impact can evolve over time, and 
sometimes quite rapidly. In other words, topics 
that might be considered immaterial today could 
prove to be of critical importance tomorrow.

Hearing from our 
stakeholders on what 
matters most 
Every year, we bring together (in virtual format) 
a group of diverse stakeholders to formally 
review our sustainability performance and 
to understand their expectations for the 
future. In 2023, over 130 representatives, 
from customers, industry associations and 
academia, to non-governmental organisations, 
policy makers and peer companies – and 25 
countries – came together under the theme, 
Water Regeneration – partnering to strengthen 
communities’ resilience and drive economic 
growth. This is a prominent ESG risk that 
touches every aspect of our business and 
is central to our sustainability strategy and 
Mission 2025 commitments.

The theme was covered in the context of 
climate resilience, economic growth and the 
wellbeing of people. Stakeholders proposed 
collaborative ideas and collective actions 
that could accelerate progress towards a 
water-resilient future, identifying levers for 
change; tapping into the power of partnerships 
and collaboration; and scaling impactful 
interventions collectively.

The common message was that water is a topic 
that requires a holistic, transboundary and 
multi-stakeholder approach. To address and 
balance complex challenges between water, 
agriculture, climate and biodiversity requires us 
to step up partner engagement at international 
and local levels.

Behind the 
scenes of 
our virtual 
stakeholder 
forum

These recommendations have been reviewed 
by the Social Responsibility Committee 
and we look forward to accelerating our 
impact by investing further to address water 
stress, protect local water resources and 
build community climate resilience and 
economic empowerment. 

Specific recommendations from 
stakeholders included: 

•  mobilising local resources and enhancing 

community engagement in water solutions;

• 

• 

• 

• 

• 

 catalysing and strengthening communities of 
practice to facilitate knowledge-sharing across 
sectors;

 fostering a cooperative approach to address 
the transboundary challenges of water;

 scaling up action to address the nexus of water–
climate challenges; 

 unlocking innovative technologies to mitigate 
water risks; and 

 leveraging partnerships across markets to raise 
awareness and amplify achievements in water 
stewardship.

Managing risk
A resilient business

In a volatile operating environment, 
every business is presented with a 
similar set of challenges, whether it 
be economic upheavals, pandemics, 
geopolitical crises, or regulatory 
changes. What sets apart those 
companies that struggle from those 
companies that not only survive 
but thrive is the ability to identify 
challenges and develop plans to 
manage through them; or, if they can’t 
be prevented or predicted, the agility 
and responsiveness to reduce the 
impact and even take advantage of the 
opportunity inherent in change.

This is business resilience. 
Our Business Resilience programme is designed 
to embed the capability, processes and mindset 
that enable us to proactively manage risks – 
and embrace opportunities – so that we grow 
sustainably and meet our short-, medium- and 
long-term objectives. 

The Group-wide programme includes 
appropriate mitigation and response 
systems that can be deployed when and 
where required. Our integrated and holistic 
approach has been particularly important in 
recent years of geopolitical, economic and 
environmental change. We continue to embed 
the key principles of business resilience and 
risk management throughout our business, 
providing managers at all levels with the processes 
and tools they need to proactively identify and 
assess risks, make well-thought-out decisions 
and take appropriate and timely action. 

We measure the extent to which these principles 
and processes are embedded in our business 
through various key performance indicators, 
including an annual risk maturity survey involving 
over 350 senior managers across all areas 
designed to measure our risk culture. In 2023, 
we scored 92.5% on our overall risk culture score, 
an improvement of over four percentage points 
on 2022 results. 

Integrated approach 
We have continued the integration of risk 
management, insurance, security, business 
continuity and crisis management to develop our 
holistic Business Resilience programme further. 
The Group Business Resilience Team, led by 
the Chief Risk Officer (CRO), has responsibility 
for facilitating cross-functional identification, 
assessment and management of all current and 
emerging risks. Working in close collaboration 
with risk owners across our business units, Group 
functions and the Executive Leadership Team 
(ELT), it is tasked with maintaining a wide-angled 
view of all business streams and emerging risks 
and opportunities and, through regular reporting, 
ensuring visibility and decision support is provided 
to the ELT and our Board.

Our processes recognise that, the earlier we 
identify, assess and manage risk, the higher 
the likelihood is of preventing or reducing 
negative impacts and taking advantage of 
opportunities. For those events that we 
cannot prevent or that are unforeseeable, 
we have well-established processes to reduce 
impact on the business. These include tested 
contingency plans, a business continuity 
programme, our Incident Management and 
Crisis Resolution (IMCR) programme and an 
insurance programme. 

Business units and markets
Risk sponsors and risk and insurance coordinators 
in every business unit facilitate the assessment 
of current and emerging risks and opportunities 
on a country-by-country basis, as well as the 
management of those risks, as set out in our 
Enterprise Risk Management (ERM) framework. 
Risk assessments are reviewed in senior 
leadership team meetings every month and 
risk registers are updated accordingly. All risk 
registers are visible to the Group’s Business 
Resilience Team, which reviews risks, identifies 
key trends and provides benchmarking for risk and 
opportunity management across the business. 
It also reviews business continuity plans across 
the Group to ensure they are up to date and have 
been tested.

Twice a year, the Business Resilience Team 
hosts a conference where all risk sponsors, 
risk and insurance coordinators, and Business 
Resilience Managers are updated on key trends 
and emerging risks across the business. The 
CRO also facilitates discussion with the regional 
management teams twice a year to discuss risk 
and resilience issues and trends, and to calibrate 
and benchmark risks across the business. At least 
every two years, each business unit participates 
in an IMCR validation exercise led by a cross-
functional Group team. This includes training 
and participation in crisis simulation based on 
a relevant business risk.

In 2023, we focused on further embedding our 
integrated approach across our business units. 
This included piloting a new risk management 
tool to improve visibility of key risks and enhance 
best practice sharing and analysis. It also involved 
optimising assessment of business interruption 
risks, and embedding the outcomes in our 
insurance and business continuity programmes.

Managing risk continued

We have enhanced the criteria for evaluating 
crisis management performance in our business 
units, identifying a number of key improvement 
opportunities. Also in 2023, we completed 
the incorporation of our Egypt business into 
our Business Resilience programme, involving 
training and development of key managers 
and senior leadership, including in IMCR. A risk 
register is now in place, alongside appropriate 
insurance coverage.

Group management
The outcomes of engagement with business 
units, region teams and the Group function heads 
are integrated into a principal risk report, which 
is reviewed by the Group Risk and Compliance 
Committee (GRCC). 

Comprising Group function heads as ‘risk 
owners’ for each of our risk categories, the GRCC 
meets quarterly and is co-chaired by the CRO. 
It ensures that principal risks (defined on page 88) 
are reviewed with a broader, cross-functional 
perspective, integrating findings into the principal 
risk report submitted quarterly to the ELT and the 
Audit and Risk Committee of the Board. 

The Group function heads also perform an 
important role in understanding and managing risk 
aggregation. One of the key principles of our risk 
and resilience programme is that no risk exists in 
isolation, neither can any risk be managed within a 
functional silo. For example, the macroeconomic 
environment affects, and is affected by, the 
geopolitical environment, which also affects our 
supply chain. We have seen this most noticeably 
through conflicts in Ukraine and the Middle East. 
Our cross-functional approach helps ensure that 
we consider the broader implications of all risks 
to the business and take a consistent and aligned 
approach to their management.

Sustainability risks
Within the ESG materiality assessment process 
(see pages 83 to 85), we have reassessed risks and 
opportunities facing our business, the environment 
and society. One of the most significant risks 
to our resilience over the longer term is climate 
change. By proactively preparing for and managing 
climate risk through our business strategy and 
capital investments, however, we can harness 
significant opportunities. Climate risk is fully 
integrated into our risk management programme 
and our CRO facilitates more frequent discussions 
with a cross-functional team that includes 
representatives from Business Resilience, 
Finance, Quality, Safety and Environment, 
and Corporate Affairs and Sustainability. 

Risk governance 
The Board retains overall accountability and 
responsibility for the Group’s risk management and 
internal control systems. It has defined the Group’s 
risk appetite, and, through the Audit and Risk 
Committee, reviewed the effectiveness of these 
systems. During the year, the Board reviewed our 
principal risks and opportunities, including those 
associated with climate change and cyber security. 
Additionally, the Social Responsibility Committee 
of the Board takes a particular interest in risks 
associated with climate change, as set out on 
pages 100 to 104. Also in 2023, our CRO conducted 
a risk management workshop with the full Board 
to refresh Directors’ understanding of business 
resilience and risk management principles, and 
how they are applied within the business. This is 
part of our regular risk management education 
programme at all levels across the Company. 

A key role of the Board is to establish the Group’s 
risk appetite. In 2023, the Audit and Risk Committee 
reviewed the Risk Appetite Statement and risk 
tolerance levels that will be applied to every risk, as a 
key element of our risk assessment process at both 
business unit and Group level. This review will be 
considered by the Board in the first quarter of 2024. 

Our internal audit department conducts an annual 
independent audit of the Business Resilience 
programme and its implementation, assessing the 
Company’s risk management, business continuity 
and crisis management processes, and their 
application against business best practices and 
the International Accounting Standard. The Head 
of Corporate Audit makes recommendations 
to improve the programme, where required, 
and the findings are submitted to the Audit and 
Risk Committee. The Board and its committees 
conduct annual reviews of the effectiveness of our 
internal controls. Further details of that review are 
set out in the Audit and Risk Committee report on 
pages 153 to 158.

Principal risks and opportunities
We define principal risks and opportunities as those that are material and have the most 
potential to impact the Group’s strategic objectives. In this section, we have grouped our 
principal risks and opportunities to highlight connectivity between them. 

A.
Responding to upheavals 
in the macroeconomic and 
geopolitical environment

Principal risks and opportunities:
A1.  Foreign exchange fluctuations

A2. Marketplace economic conditions

A3.  Geopolitical and security environment

In 2023, we saw some easing and stability in global commodity costs. However, 
the general macroeconomic and geopolitical environment remained volatile as a 
result of the continuing Russia-Ukraine conflict, inflationary conditions and high 
interest rate environment. Economic challenges are particularly evident in some key 
markets, such as Nigeria and Egypt, where high inflation and volatile exchange 
rates create headwinds to economic expansion. In the latter part of the year, 
conflict between Israel and Hamas led to instability in the Middle East, impacting 
shipping and potentially disrupting supply chains, as well as increasing some 
costs. Calls for boycotts of US brands, including Coca-Cola, as a result of the 
US government’s support for Israel, may impact our sales in some predominantly 
Muslim communities. 

A1.  Foreign exchange fluctuations
We continued to see foreign exchange volatility and 
rate fluctuations, particularly in the Russian Rouble, 
Nigerian Naira and Egyptian Pound.

Our concerns remained centred on the Russia/Ukraine 
crisis. In Ukraine, our focus was and remains the safety 
of our people first, and continuing our production and 
distribution where it is safe to do so.

In Russia, the decision by TCCC to cease operations, and 
economic and other sanctions imposed by many countries, had 
a significant impact on our business. The security environment in 
Nigeria remains volatile as the new government reduces subsidies 
in key areas to improve economic management. Geopolitical 
tensions remain in the Balkans and Armenia, and these led to 
incidents that had the potential to affect the safety of our people 
and disrupt our operations. Conflict in the Middle East threatens 
to impact oil prices and may lead to disruptions and increased 
costs in our supply chain. Calls for boycotts of US brands, including 
Coca-Cola, may impact our business in markets with large Muslim 
communities.

Leveraging our unique 
24/7 portfolio – and 
responding to change
B1.  Product relevance and acceptability
In 2023, debates around sweeteners, as well as 
discussion on appropriate responses to key ESG 
priorities, increased the potential for consumer 
concerns relating to our products, regulatory 
change and imposition of additional taxes. 

This was exacerbated by government actions to reduce national 
debt. Despite these concerns, ensuring we have highly relevant 
and high-quality products that continue to delight consumers, 
and addressing ongoing and emerging health and environmental 
concerns through robust sustainability initiatives, remains part of 
our resilience and a significant opportunity for our business. This 
is closely linked with climate change risks, particularly Sustainable 
packaging and Impact of our sustainability performance on our 
reputation (see page 107).

Principal risks and opportunities:
B1.  Product relevance and acceptability

B2. Strategic stakeholder relationships

B3.  Competing in the digital marketplace

To maintain true business resilience, we continue to evolve our portfolio 
of products and routes to market. To that end, we need to maintain strong 
relationships with our partners, constantly monitoring and responding to 
changing consumer preferences, customer needs, and the business and 
regulatory environment. In 2023, we faced significant challenges, and adapted 
our business to respond to those challenges while keeping our long-term 
objectives firmly in sight.

relationship with our strategic partners 
to ensure we remain aligned. We will 
continue to collaborate on our key 
sustainability initiatives, particularly 
our Pack Mix of the Future project. 

B2.  Strategic stakeholder relationships
It is critical that we remain aligned with our key 
strategic partners, such as TCCC, Monster Energy, 
COSTA Coffee and premium spirits manufacturers. 
In 2023, the Russia/Ukraine crisis resulted in TCCC 
making the decision to stop sales of its brands 
in Russia, which had a significant impact on our 
business there. 

Despite this, our relationship with all our strategic partners, 
including TCCC, remains strong, reflected by the recent renewal 
of our bottling agreements, strong marketing support across 
our territories and close collaboration and alignment on our 
sustainability initiatives. Our relationship with our key partners 
is important for our sustainability agenda and our response to 
climate change, particularly in new products and formulations 
and packaging. This risk is closely linked with climate change 
risks, particularly Sustainable packaging and Impact of our

C3.  Cyber incidents

C4.  People retention 

C5. Ethics and compliance

The macroeconomic and geopolitical environment, combined with regional and 
national issues, created volatile operating conditions in our markets. The Russia/

supply chains across our territory. Our people adapted quickly to these volatile 
conditions to manage safety challenges, and maintain business operations to 
continue to serve our customers and achieve excellent results.

C1.  Health and safety – employee safety
Risks associated with the COVID-19 pandemic and 
influenza continued to reduce. We saw a reduction 
in lost time accidents of employees and contractors, 
and we had no serious injuries or fatalities in our 
employee population. However, we regret that 
we had contractor and public fatalities, primarily 
associated with traffic accidents caused mainly 
by poor road infrastructure in Africa.

(see page 89) and climate change risks, particularly Sustainable 
packaging, the impact of climate change on the cost and 
availability of key ingredients and Impact of our sustainability 
performance on our reputation (see pages 100 to 107). 
Working more closely with our supply chain partners to reduce 
the impact of a continuing volatile operating environment 
and the longer-term impact of climate change makes us more 
resilient and presents a significant opportunity for maintaining 
our profitability and jointly achieving our sustainability goals.

The Romanian 
IMCR Team 
debriefing after 
a successful 
IMCR Validation

Risk management in action
Prepared for crisis response 
In 2023, we conducted a cyber security incident response 
exercise with members of our ELT to practise our cyber IMCR 
response processes. The exercise simulated a cyber attack 
against one of our largest production facilities. The exercise 
required ELT members, in consultation with our Group IMCR 
Team and external experts, to quickly review the operational 
response of our cyber security team, evaluate options and make 
a series of key decisions to protect data privacy and efficiently 
restore our operations. A number of key lessons are being 
incorporated into our continuously improving IMCR programme 
at all management levels. We have committed to conducting 
an IMCR exercise with the ELT annually using a variety of 
different scenarios.

At least every two years, all business units, alongside TCCC 
counterparts, go through a full-day training and simulation 
exercise to ensure the IMCR leaders and teams have the 
capabilities to manage incidents and prevent crises, and to ensure 
IMCR processes are robust. A joint validation team, made up of 
senior managers from both CCH and TCCC, provides the training, 
observes the business unit team in action and provides feedback 
on areas for improvement.

One of the BU’s to go through an IMCR Validation in 2023 was 
Romania. IMCR Leader and Corporate Affairs and Sustainability 
Director Alice Nichita puts the team’s performance down to 
preparation. Alice said “The standout lesson for me is the critical 
need for thorough preparation to ensure effective incident 
management. The team’s outstanding performance depended 
on our ability to swiftly analyse and address a complex scenario, 
the value of disciplined leadership and effective IMCR tools at 
hand. The experience reinforced the need for constant readiness 
and seamless coordination to navigate challenges efficiently.”

We continued focusing on our sanctions compliance 
programme, strengthening our processes and training our 
employees. The risk of fraud against the Company, and non-
compliance with anti-bribery and corruption standards remained 
a focus area. We continued integrating the Egypt business unit,

Principal risks and opportunities:
D1.  Sustainable packaging

D2. Water availability and usage 

D3.  Managing our carbon footprint

Our investment in sustainability-related 
initiatives should be considered in the context 
of opportunities for our business. In addition 
to reducing our impact on the environment, 
cost savings for business and mitigating the 
negative impacts of climate change, there 
is a direct link between how consumers 
perceive our sustainability performance 
– as measured by our “E-score”, and their 
willingness to purchase our products. If we 
are able to increase our E-score, we also 
increase consumers’ willingness to purchase 
and, assuming their willingness to purchase 
leads to an increase in actual purchase, this 
represents a very significant opportunity for 
our business. For further information, see our 
assessment of the Emerging opportunity: 
Impact of our sustainability performance 
on our reputation on page 107. 

We continued to improve our assessment 
of the effects of climate change, with a focus 
on clear targets and robust action plans to 
deliver on our commitments, mitigate risks 
and take advantage of the opportunities 
inherent in change.

In 2023, we added a comprehensive 
assessment of the risks and opportunities 
associated with sustainable packaging and 
the cost and availability of key ingredients. 
Both of these are linked directly with the 
Principal risk: Managing our carbon footprint, 
see pages 103 to 104, which in turn directly 
impacts our ability to meet our NetZeroby40 
commitments. We updated our assessments 
of Water availability and usage see page 102 
and Managing our carbon footprint as a result 
of updated external and internal data. 

During the year we invested €220.3 million, 
representing 33% of our total capex, 
on sustainability initiatives and this is 
expected to rise to 40% of our total capex 
by 2025 and 50% by 2030. This included 
investments in recycled PET manufacturing 
for example increasing food grade recycled 
PET availability. We expect almost 50% 
of our requirement for recycled PET will 
be served in-house by the end of 2024 
which also reduces costs. Our investment 
in energy efficient coolers decreases our 
carbon emissions and also improves our 
sales. Investments in more energy efficient 
equipment improves our manufacturing 
capabilities as well as reduces emissions 
and delivers cost savings.

D1.  Sustainable packaging
Given the potential impact that significant changes 
to our packaging mix could have to longer-term 
capital investment in production and distribution, 
and the influence that packaging has on our 
ability to meet our NetZeroby40 commitments – 
packaging represents over 30% of our emissions 
– managing the risk and opportunity associated 
with Sustainable packaging directly impacts 
and is impacted by our future business strategy.

It is closely linked with other principal risks, particularly Managing 
our carbon footprint (see pages 103 to 104) and the emerging 
risk Impact of our sustainability performance on our reputation 
(see page 107). In 2023, we designed our Pack Mix of the Future 
vision starting with EU markets. The development of a profitable 
packaging strategy aims to reduce our environmental impact, 
address escalating stakeholder concerns relating to packaging 
waste and takes into account new EU regulations such as the 
EU Directive on packaging and packaging waste. Given the 
rapid changes in technology and the evolution of the regulatory 
environment, and the significant impact that major changes 
in our packaging mix have for our NetZeroby40 commitment 
and our future business strategy, Sustainable packaging is also 
an emerging risk and opportunity.

D3.  Managing our carbon footprint 
We updated our comprehensive quantitative 
assessment of the risks associated with managing 
our carbon footprint in line with our continuing 
refinement of our NetZeroby40 transition plan 
and carbon reduction glidepath. 

We estimated the future cost of carbon under multiple climate 
scenarios, including RCP1.9 (Paris Ambition), RCP4.5 (stated 
policy) and RCP8.5 (current policy), as well as a number of transition 
scenarios including the NGFS transition scenarios and IEA transition 
scenarios. For scope 1 emissions, we used projected carbon pricing 
for the beverage industry and for scope 2 we used projected 
carbon pricing for utilities. We used these projections to estimate 
the impact of climate change on future annual operating costs 
for generating carbon and applied that to our projected carbon 
emissions to 2040 to meet our NetZeroby40 goal as set out in 
our NetZeroby40 Roadmap on page 56. This enabled us to create 
an internal pricing mechanism so that we could align our capital 
expenditure investments with our carbon reduction targets.

For scope 3 emissions, we conducted a deeper assessment of 
the costs of packaging (see Principal risk: Sustainable packaging 
on page 100) and key ingredients (see Emerging risk: Impact of 
climate change on the cost and availability of key ingredients 
on page 104) that included estimates of the cost of carbon. All 
ingredients and materials will continue to be subject to normal 
market forces but, in isolating the effect of climate change, the 
most significant will be the cost of carbon emissions. The key 
opportunity in reducing our scope 3 emissions is working closely 
with our long-term suppliers and customers, including potential 
joint investment in low-carbon initiatives.

In addition to the financial costs of meeting our NetZeroby40 
commitments, there is a significant opportunity for our business 
in meeting or exceeding stakeholder expectations in managing 
our carbon footprint. As noted in our assessment of the impact 
of our sustainability performance on our reputation on page 106, 
an increase in perceptions of our environmental performance has 
a direct link to an increase in consumers’ intent to purchase and 
therefore sales.

•  Socio-economic impact
•  Climate change

In 2023, we updated our assessment of the potential impact 
of three different climate change scenarios (RCP1.9, RCP4.5 and 
RCP8.5) relating to extreme weather on our plants, using credible 
insurance industry data. We specifically assessed projected 
increases in flood risk, likelihood of wildfires, precipitation and 
drought. We assessed data relating to 63 locations and identified 

17 plants that were considered higher risk, requiring capex to upgrade 
weather-related mitigation or climate change mitigation. All of those 
facilities are already considered higher risk and subject to current 
mitigation planning. Only four were assessed as requiring additional 
capex as a direct result of climate change. We have estimated that 
one-off capex requirements to mitigate the impact of extreme 
weather, including the impact of climate change, between now and 
2030 is approximately €32 million, of which €5.7 million is required 
for climate change risk mitigation as a direct result of an increased 
risk of wildfire (two plants) or extreme precipitation (two plants).

We expect increases in insurance premiums as a result of insurance 
underwriters considering our facilities’ higher risk of extreme 
weather. The SwissRe Institute has estimated that insurance 
premiums may increase by 40% for fire and 25% for flood and 
precipitation. Assuming insurers apply those premium increases 
against facilities considered to be at risk, and not across the 
board, we have estimated potential annual increases in insurance 
premiums because of climate change to be approximately €1.5 
million per annum by 2050, under an RCP4.5 climate scenario, 
or by 2030 under an RCP8.5 scenario.

During 2023, we completed a comprehensive assessment of 
the potential for business interruption across our top eight plants 
(representing approximately 70% of our volume) for any reason, 
including climate change. As a result of these assessments, we are 
updating our business continuity plans to enhance our ability to 
continue to supply our customers at acceptable levels and within 
our risk tolerance if reasonably foreseeable disruptive events occur.

In 2023, we assessed the impact of climate change on the cost 
and availability of ingredients under multiple climate scenarios – 
RCP1.9 (Paris Ambition), RCP2.6 (Paris Agreement), RCP4.5 and 
RCP8.5 – with a focus on sugar, both from sugar cane and from 
sugar beet, as it represents the most significant component of our 
ingredient spending.

Our assessment indicates that climate change will have a 
significant impact on the productive capacity of some existing 
growing regions. Brazil for example, which is a primary source of 
our cane sugar, is expected to be negatively impacted under most 
climate scenarios. Italy, a key source of sugar from sugar beet, is 
also likely to be negatively impacted. However, our assessment 
also shows that other growing regions for both sugar cane and 
sugar beet are likely to be positively impacted by climate change, 
increasing their productive capacity. Assuming those regions 
leverage that potential productive capacity to fill any gaps in 
existing regions, the impact of climate change is considered 
to be neutral.

Where we do expect changes in the cost of sugar is the increasing 
cost of carbon emissions for those industries that are likely to 
be passed on through higher input costs to us. This is partially 
mitigated by those industries gradually reducing their carbon 
footprint, the reduction in our own use of sugar as we move 
further towards lower-sugar products, and our ability to pass on 
costs in our final products. Our assessment estimates the annual 
additional cost of sugar may increase by 17% by 2030 and 10% 
by 2040 under a Paris Ambition (RCP1.9) scenario and the annual 
additional cost may increase by 3% by 2030 and 1% by 2040 under 
a stated policy (RCP4.5) scenario.

As noted in our 2022 assessment, of the other ingredients that 
we purchase, coffee and lemon-growing regions are considered 
to be at medium to high risk of heat stress under a high-carbon 
scenario by 2050. The majority of growers are conducting their 
own assessments and developing contingency plans, including 
identification of alternative regions for supply. Given the relatively 
small amounts of these ingredients that we purchase, these 
costs are not considered material.

While we are concerned about the impact of climate change on 
ingredients, as all companies in the food and beverage industries 
are, physical risks are more likely to have an impact over a longer 
timeframe. We therefore have more time to better understand 
the potential impact and find ways to adapt to changing 
conditions and create appropriate contingency plans.

The amount of data we create and consume is increasing 
exponentially. With the help of emerging technologies and more 
specifically artificial intelligence (AI), we will be able to capture and 
analyse internal and external data to help us make more informed 
business decisions. The application of AI spans across several 
business processes and will support our acceleration, augmentation 
and automation of business processes and user experiences. 
Examples are planning sales visits, retrieving product information 
from store visit photographs and optimizing our transportation. 
Recently we also introduced the use of digital assistants for 
productivity gains such as summarizing emails.

However, AI technology also poses various risks to the 
organisations, society and individuals due to potential misuse 
by malicious actors and potential of unintended consequences. 

While we are utilising AI primarily for efficiency gains and 
enhancing insights from largely internal data for non-critical 
business processes, and while we do not rely only on AI for 
decision making, we have assessed the risk associated with AI 
to be low. We have existing policies and guidelines, and have 
enhanced training and awareness on appropriate use of AI. As a 
result, we are comfortable that we have captured the risks and 
management of those risks within the existing principal risks 
associated with cyber incidents and data privacy.

What remains an emerging risk is the broader use of AI, its 
application to external data and the potential over-reliance on 
AI as an end-to-end decision support tool. Errors in algorithms 
or biases could lead to faulty decisions, affecting our ability to 
consistently supply product to our customers. AI could increase 
the severity of cyber attacks against our information systems, 
leading to violations of rights to privacy of individuals and non-
compliance with privacy requirements of the legal and regulatory 
framework. The use of AI could increase the severity of cyber 
attacks against our production systems, leading to business 
interruption and inability to supply our customers. Our employees 
may be concerned about the privacy of their information or 
potential loss of jobs with greater automation of financial or 
production systems.

In order to mitigate the risk, we have established a cross-
functional team to ensure compliance by design and a robust 
governance and operating model to ensure deployed AI 
technologies are secure, safe and ethical, and comply with 
internal corporate policies. We have developed a process to 
monitor the use of AI and will revisit our risk assessment regularly.

Principal risks and opportunities continued

Emerging risks and opportunities continued

Our assessment indicates that, across the eight selected markets, 
the perceived industry leader has an E-score 7 points higher than 
ours on average, and, on average, there is a gap of 13 points to an 
E-score rating of ‘strong’. Matching the industry leaders in selected 
markets could increase consumers’ intent to purchase on average 
by 6% and attaining a rating of ‘strong’ on average across our 
markets could increase consumers’ intent to purchase by 10.9%. 
If this intent to purchase were to translate directly to actual sales, 
this represents a very significant opportunity for our business. 

We continue to refine our model to better understand the 
impact of our environmental initiatives. However, it is clear that 
enhancing our environmental initiatives is not only good for the 
environment and the communities we serve, but it also makes 
good business sense.

Link to material issues:
•  Climate change
•  Sustainable sourcing
•  Packaging and waste management 

In 2023, we continued to refine our model for assessing the impact 
of meeting, or not meeting, the expectations of key stakeholder 
groups on our environmental performance. We considered three 
key stakeholder groups in our assessment:

•  current and future employees and their willingness to work for 

us, which could ultimately impact our ability to attract and retain 
talented people; 
investors and their willingness to invest in us, which could impact 
our cost of capital; and

• 

•  consumers and their willingness to purchase our products.

Of those three groups, we determined that employees and investors 
were well aware of our environmental performance through external 
ESG ratings. This year we were ranked, for the seventh time, as the 
world’s most sustainable beverage company by the Dow Jones 
Sustainability Indices (as at 8 December 2023). Our score positions 
us in the top 1% of 9,400 companies across 62 industries. We now 
have the highest scores and rankings in ten of the most-recognised 
ESG ratings including CDP Climate and Water, ISS ESG, MSCI ESG, 
Sustainalytics, FTSE4Good and Vigeo Eiris. 

These achievements are a great source of pride for our employees. 
As a business, we have an opportunity to build greater awareness 
amongst consumers of these achievements, and our actions, to 
deliver our drinks in more sustainable ways. Research indicates 
that an increase in positive perceptions of our environmental 
performance – a higher ‘E-score’ – correlates to an increase in 
the likelihood that consumers will purchase our products (intent 
to purchase) and conversely a decrease in E-score can reduce 
consumers’ intent to purchase. Intent to purchase scores were 
used to determine the impact on our business of meeting, 
exceeding or failing to meet expectations. 

Our assessment included perceptions of our environmental 
performance, or ‘E-score’, for consumers in eight selected markets 
and, in comparison, to our direct competitors and other companies 
in the food and beverage industry. That assessment indicates that, 
as with many large companies in the food and beverage sector, 
consumers perceive that there is more we can do to meet their 
expectations on environmental performance.

Task Force for Climate-related Financial Disclosures (TCFD)

Climate change is having and will have a significant 
impact on our business in a number of ways. Given the 
longer-term nature of climate risks and the number 
of variables – many of which we have no control over 
– we need to continually update our assessment 
and management of risks associated with climate 
change as more accurate data becomes available and 
organisations around the world respond to its effects.

We follow the guidelines provided by the TCFD as an important 
framework for reporting climate-related risks and their financial 
impacts. Our TCFD disclosures can be found throughout this 
report. The table below, provides a summary of where those 
disclosures can be found and how the information is consistent 
with the TCFD recommendations.

For additional information on our climate-related disclosures, 
see our 2023 CDP submission.

Governance 
As noted on page 87, governance of all risks, 
including climate change risks, is the responsibility 
of our Board and specifically the Audit and 
Risk Committee and the Social Responsibility 
Committee, following a clearly defined structure 
and process from business units, to the Group, 
our ELT and the Board. 

Strategy 
Given the longer-term nature and the implications 
of climate change, our response to climate 
change transcends all areas of our strategy 
and operations. Our future packaging mix, for 
example, has significant implications for our 
business given the substantial capital investments 
in our plants and routes to market needed to make 
significant packaging changes. Changes needed 
to meet our NetZeroby40 commitments and 
the impact of climate change on the availability 
and cost of key ingredients have implications for 
our supplier base and our distribution systems. 
Our response to climate change has a significant 
impact on our reputation with key stakeholders 
and ultimately our ability to attract and retain 
people, and attract capital, as well as the 
willingness of consumers to buy our products. 

While there are numerous costs associated with 
managing climate change risks, we also recognise 
that there are significant opportunities for our 
business in continuing to meet the needs and 
expectations of our stakeholders. As noted in our 
assessment of the Impact of our sustainability 
performance on our reputation, see page 107, 
there is a strong correlation between consumers’ 
perception of how we are responding to climate 
change and their intent to purchase our products. 
The longer-term structural changes inherent in 
our sustainability strategy is embedded in our 
business strategy, which is constantly reviewed 
as our understanding of the potential effects of 
climate change risks and opportunities improves, 
to ensure our business remains resilient and 
focused on growth. 

Risk assessment
Many of the risks associated with climate change 
are common across the global Coca-Cola System. 
We therefore take a global system approach to 
the identification, assessment and management 
of climate-related risks. The Coca-Cola System – 
which consists of TCCC and its bottling partners, 
of which CCHBC is one of the largest – has 
identified eight potentially material risks relating 
to the physical and transitional impact of climate 
change on our business. We have fully integrated 
the assessment and mitigation of these physical 
and transition risks associated with climate 
change into our risk management programme, 
which underpins our robust approach to all risks 
to our business. 

The Coca-Cola System has identified eight risks – 
four physical and four transition risks, as depicted 
on the pictogram on page 111, 

We analyse our internal data and work with 
recognised specialist agencies, our insurance 
brokers and insurers to obtain regional analysis 
of the potential impact of climate change. 
This helps us make informed decisions and 
improves our understanding of the potential 
climate vulnerabilities in our operations and the 
communities in which we operate. This data and 
resulting analysis are shared across our business 
units, supporting climate resilience across our 
planning and operations.

Metrics and targets 
We use clear metrics and targets in the 
assessment and management of all our risks 
in order to continually measure risk drivers, the 
potential impact – including the financial impact 
of risks – and key performance indicators to 
ensure we are managing risks effectively. These 
are noted under ‘Metrics and targets’ for each 
risk. Many of our climate change metrics and 
targets are also outlined in our Mission 2025 
and NetZeroby40 commitments. 

Emissions reduction in line with NetZeroby40 
roadmap is a performance target for our ELT 
members and senior leaders, impacting at 
risk compensation.

Given the longer-term nature of managing 
climate-related risks, our allocation of capex 
will be important in meeting our sustainability 
targets. We have been increasing our investment 
in initiatives designed to mitigate the risks 
associated with climate change. In 2023, we 
invested €220.3 million in capex initiatives aligned 
with our sustainability strategy, which represents 
33% of our total capex. We are planning to 
increase the allocation of our annual capex to 
investments aligned with our sustainability 
strategy, expecting to reach 40% of capex by 2025 
and 50% of capex by 2030. This demonstrates 
our commitment to manage climate-related risks 
using a gradual, well-thought-out programme 
of capital expenditure over the medium to long 
term based on our assessment of the risks to 
our business and stakeholders.

Viability statement 

Business model and prospects 
Our business model and strategy, outlined on 
pages 22 to 23 of this report, documents the 
key factors that underpin the evaluation of our 
prospects. These factors include our: 

•  attractive geographic diversity;
•  strong sales and execution capabilities; 
•  ability to innovate;
•  market leadership; 
•  global brands; and 
•  diverse beverage portfolio. 

Macroeconomic conditions, while improving in 
the latter stages of 2023, are expected to remain 
challenging in the short term. Most forecasts are for 
modest short-term growth in most of the countries 
that we operate and some easing of inflation, with the 
exception of Egypt and Nigeria. The ongoing conflict 
between Russia and Ukraine and more recently 
the Israel/Palestine conflict and the prospect of 
continuing geopolitical instability could continue 
to impact the global supply chain and exacerbate 
economic challenges. We have considered the 
potential future implications of continuing volatility 
in macroeconomic and geopolitical conditions in 
our financial forecasts to the extent possible. 

While the Board considers that our markets will 
continue to face challenges over the medium 
to longer term it continues to believe that our 
diverse geographic footprint, including exposure 
to emerging markets that have low per capita 
consumption and therefore greater opportunity 
for growth, and a proven strategy in combination 
with our leading market position, offer significant 
opportunities for future growth. 

Confidence in our continuing growth was also 
reflected in the recent renewal of our bottler 
agreements with TCCC to produce and 
distribute it’s global brands.

Our Board has historically applied and continues 
to apply a prudent approach to the Group’s 
capital management decisions also relating to 
major projects and investments. From 2019 to 
2023, we generated free cash flow of €580 million 
per year on average. 

Key assumptions of the business plan 
and related viability period
The Group maintains a well-established strategic 
business planning process which has formed the 
basis of the Board’s quantitative assessment of 
the Group’s viability, with the plan reflecting our 
current strategy over a rolling five-year period. 

The financial forecasts in the plan are based on 
assumptions for the following: 

•  key macroeconomic data that could impact our 

consumers’ disposable income and consequently 
our sales volume and revenues; 

•  various scenarios relating to the ability of 

governments in key markets to manage the 
economic conditions in their countries; 
•  key raw material and other input costs;
•  the impact of climate change, particularly 

associated with the transition to a lower carbon 
economy and the costs of carbon under multiple 
climate scenarios (see also pages 101 to 104 for 
more information on our quantitative assessments 
of the impact of climate change. In addition to 2030 
and 2040, we also included interim calculations to 
2028 for the purpose of our viability assessment); 
•  the impact of conflicts such as the Russia-Ukraine 
conflict and ongoing instability in the Middle East, 
including loss of sales volume and revenues as 
a result of TCCC’s suspension of its operations 
in Russia; 

•  foreign exchange rates and FX liquidity in Nigeria 
and Egypt; including the economic conditions 
affecting the Egyptian Pound, the Nigerian Naira 
and the impact of the Russia-Ukraine conflict on 
the Russian Rouble; 

•  spending for production overhead and 

operating expenses; 
•  working capital levels; and 
•  capital expenditure. 

The Board has assessed that a viability period of five 
years remains the most appropriate. This is due to 
its alignment with the Group’s strategic business 
planning cycle, consistency with the evaluated 
potential impacts of our principal risks as disclosed on 
pages 88 to 107 and our impairment review process, 
where goodwill and indefinite-lived intangible assets 
are tested based on our five-year forecasts. 

Assessment of viability 
Qualitatively and quantitatively, we analysed the output  
of our robust enterprise risk management, internal 
business planning and liquidity management processes, 
to ensure that the risks to the Group’s viability are 
understood and are being effectively managed. 

In late 2023, the Company completed the 
acquisition of Brown Forman Finlandia Oy, owner 
of the Finlandia vodka brand. An assessment of 
key risks has been completed and appropriate 
management plans are being implemented to 
effectively manage those risks. No risks to the 
Group’s viability over the five-year period of this 
assessment have been identified as a result of the 
acquisition and integration of this business.

The Board has concluded that the Group’s well-
established processes across multiple streams 
continue to provide a comprehensive framework 
that effectively supports the operational and strategic 
objectives of the Group. It also provides a robust basis 
for assessment and confirmation of the Group’s 
ability to continue operations and meet its obligations 
as they fall due over the period of assessment. 

Supporting the qualitative assessment was a 
quantitative analysis performed as part of strategic 
business planning. This assessment included, but was 
not limited to, the Group’s ability to generate cash. 

We have continued to stress test the plan against 
several severe but plausible downside scenarios 
linked to certain principal risks as follows: 

Scenario 1: 
The impact of changes to foreign exchange rates 
was considered, particularly the depreciation of 
foreign currencies including the Egyptian Pound, 
Nigerian Naira and Russian Rouble, also considering 
effects from the Russia-Ukraine conflict. Principal 
risks: Foreign exchange fluctuations, Commodity 
costs and Geopolitical and security environment. 

Scenario 2: 
Lower estimates for sales volumes for various 
reasons including the continuing difficult 
economic conditions in our markets and the 
ability of governments to manage these, 
including the impact of the continued Russia-
Ukraine conflict and Middle East tensions. 

Principal risks: Marketplace economic conditions, 
and Geopolitical and security environment. 

Scenario 3: 
Continued stakeholder focus on issues relating 
to sugar and packaging resulting in the potential 
for discriminatory taxation. Principal risks: 
Product relevance and acceptability, and Cost 
and availability of sustainable packaging.

Scenario 4: 
Higher input costs including raw materials 
and energy costs. Principal risks: Commodity 
costs, Suppliers and sustainable sourcing, and 
Marketplace economic conditions. 

Scenario 5: 
Higher costs of water, carbon and the impact of 
extreme weather as a result of the effects of climate 
change under multiple climate scenarios, as well 
as the increased capital expenditure required to 
mitigate risks associated with climate change. 
Principal risks: Water availability and usage, Managing 
our carbon footprint, Impact of extreme weather 
on our production and distribution (Emerging risk). 

The above scenarios were tested both in isolation 
and in combination. The stress testing showed that 
due to the stable cash generation of our business, 
the Group would be able to withstand the impact 
of these scenarios occurring over the period of the 
financial forecasts. This could be conducted by 
making adjustments, if required, to our operating 
plans within the normal course of business, including 
but not limited to adjustments to our operations and 
temporary reductions in discretionary spending. 

Following a thorough and robust assessment of 
the Group’s risks that could threaten our business 
model, future performance, solvency or liquidity, 
the Board has concluded that the Group is well 
positioned to effectively manage its financial, 
operational and strategic risks.

EU taxonomy 

Supporting a more 
sustainable economy
As part of the EU’s plan to direct 
investments towards a more sustainable 
economy that aligns with the European 
Green Deal, the European Commission 
defined a classification system of 
sustainable activities under taxonomy 
regulation in 2020. The EU taxonomy 
regulation creates a common definition 
of environmentally sustainable economic 
activities to be used by investors, 
corporates, policymakers and 
other stakeholders. 

Climate change mitigation and climate change 
adaptation environmental objectives were set out 
in the Climate Delegated Acts1, and apply since 
2022, while the remaining four objectives came 
into force in June 2023 under the Environmental 
Delegated Act2, and are effective from 2024 
onwards. For each of these objectives, the 
Delegated Acts define which activities are eligible. 
For an economic activity to be considered aligned 
with EU taxonomy, however, it needs to meet 
all the below: a) to substantially contribute to at 
least one environmental objective; b) to meet the 
technical screening criteria (TSC) defined for per 
activity; c) to do no significant harm to any of the 
remaining objectives; and d) to comply with the 
minimum social safeguards.

Relevance to Coca-Cola HBC
As a company domiciled in Switzerland, we are 
not subject to the EU Non-Financial Reporting 
Directive and hence are not currently required 
to report following the EU taxonomy. However, 
in line with our practice to provide stakeholders 
with high-quality and value-adding ESG data, we 
have decided to voluntarily publish key information 
related to EU taxonomy for 2023. This is the result 
of the preparatory work we have been doing, 
in anticipation of the mandatory EU taxonomy 
disclosure next year, as CCH falls into the 
expanded scope of the Corporate Sustainability 
Reporting Directive, introduced in January 2024.

Taxonomy eligibility assessment
According to the EU taxonomy Delegated Acts, 
our main economic activity of ‘Food and beverage 
manufacturing’ is not considered eligible for EU 
taxonomy. It is important to note that non-eligibility 
simply refers to the fact that an economic activity 
is not in scope of the EU taxonomy and should not 
be considered as indicative of ESG performance. 
Following a thorough assessment of economic 
activities across territory, we have mapped some of 
our investments and operational expenses deriving 
from these investments with secondary activities 
under the objectives of ‘transition to a circular 
economy’ and ‘climate change mitigation’. 

According to the Environmental Delegated Act, the 
Gaglianico plant fits the criteria of eligibility under 
the ‘1.1 Manufacture of plastic packaging goods’ 
economic activity, significantly contributing to the 
‘transition to a circular economy’ environmental 
objective. To enable the transition of the Italian 
market to 100% rPET3, we have invested €30 
million to convert the old Gaglianico factory 
into an innovative hub, which transforms up to 

30,000 tonnes of post-consumer PET per year 
into new 100% recycled PET preforms, covering 
the beverage bottling needs in the country. The 
site is fully powered by electricity from 100% 
renewable sources, leading to a reduction in the 
CO2 emissions of producing a preform by up to 
70% compared with virgin plastic. Even if it is not 
required to disclose alignment for the first year of 
implementation of the Environmental Delegated 
Act, we have performed a preliminary assessment 
and are proud to share that the Gaglianico plant 
meets all technical screening criteria. In 2024, 
we will fully evaluate the Do No Significant Harm 
(DNSH) criteria and take necessary action to 
mitigate potential gaps, if any.

We are committed to achieving net zero emissions 
by 2040 across our value chain. One of the key drivers 
to reduce scope 3 emissions is the investment 
in energy-efficient coolers. At the end of 2023, 
55% of all coolers in our markets excluding Egypt 
were energy efficient, reducing greenhouse gas 
emissions by 127,461 tonnes compared with our 
2017 baseline. This activity qualifies as eligible 
for EU taxonomy purposes, under economic 
activity ‘7.3 Installation, maintenance and repair 
of energy efficiency equipment’, significantly 
contributing to the climate change mitigation 
environmental objective. However, as coolers 
are purchased from third parties, we were not 
able to collect all information required to assess 
alignment with the relevant DNSH criteria, and we 
report zero alignment for this economic activity.

Our continuous investment in green fleet is 
also considered eligible for EU taxonomy under 
economic activity ‘6.5 Transport by motorbikes, 
passenger cars and light commercial vehicles’, 
significantly contributing to the climate change 
mitigation environmental objective. In 2023, we 

continued the transition to electric and hybrid 
vehicles, which now comprise 44% of our light 
fleet, compared with 28% in 2022. In total, we 
have reduced the carbon footprint of our fleet 
compared with our baseline (2017) by 43,743 
tonnes of CO2. Even if we could assess the relevant 
TSC for alignment, we were not able to obtain 
the required information for the implementation 
of the DNSH requirements from our suppliers. 
Thus, we will prudently consider zero alignment 
for this economic activity for 2023. 

Investment in charging stations is also 
eligible as per economic activity ‘7.4 Installation, 
maintenance and repair of charging stations for 
electric vehicles in buildings (and parking spaces 
attached to buildings)’, but not aligned. 

Finally, Capex and Opex related to buildings 
owned or leased under right-of-use are captured 
in the ‘7.7 Acquisition and ownership of buildings’ 
eligible activity. 

Minimum social safeguards have also been 
assessed4 and any limited gaps regarding 
human rights due diligence, anti-corruption, 
taxation compliance, and fair competition will be 
addressed in view of the next reporting period. 

The table below contains all our economic 
activities that have been identified as EU 
taxonomy eligible, whilst none can currently be 
considered EU taxonomy aligned. Given that our 
secondary economic activities are not revenue 
generating, the percentage of eligible turnover is 
zero. However, we are presenting the percentage 
of eligible Capex and Opex following the 
definitions of EU taxonomy regulation.

It is important to note that the Capex denominator 
in 2023 includes €204.4 million (out of total of 
€901.3 million) as additions in intangible assets 
coming from the acquisition of Finlandia.

Next steps
EU taxonomy regulation is still evolving, and we remain alert for any amendments to the existing Delegated Acts or the introduction of new ones. As we work towards meeting our NetZeroBy40 commitment, 
we aspire to improve alignment with EU taxonomy by cooperating closely with our suppliers and by addressing any gaps identified. Undoubtedly, in the case that our main economic activity of food and beverage 
manufacturing will be included in future Delegated Acts, it will be considered eligible, hence expanding the scope of the EU taxonomy application for CCH. 

Finally, the implementation of the CSRD earlier this year will significantly increase the sustainability disclosure requirements. Building on the strong foundation of robust ESG reporting over many years, we are 
committed to carrying out all the necessary implementation activities that will facilitate and ensure CSRD compliance for financial year 2024.

Letter from the Chair of the Board

DearStakeholder,
It is my pleasure to share this Corporate 
Governance Report, which details robust 
governance arrangements throughout the Group, 
alongside key updates and decisions undertaken 
by the Board during 2023. 

2023	was	a	successful	year	for	Coca-Cola	HBC,	
despite	the	ongoing	challenges	of	high	inflation	
and	the	conflict	in	Ukraine.	The	Company	
continued the momentum of 2022 into 2023, 
focusing on the health and safety of our people 
across the business and reacting to cost 
pressures with measured and focused price and 
mix changes. Underpinned by the introduction of 
our clear purpose and the consistent application 
of our 24/7 beverage strategy, Zoran and our 
executive team have delivered another year of 
strong operational and strategic progress and 
record	financial	results.	

Leadingwithpurpose
In March, I had the pleasure of attending, alongside 
other members of the Board, our senior leadership 
conference	in	Cairo.	This	was	a	significant	meeting	
for	the	Company,	our	first	in	four	years	where	
we’d been able to bring together our team to unify 
around some common objectives and celebrate 
the progress we’ve made since 2019. Our people 
have consistently risen to the challenges presented 
over	the	last	few	years.	This	was	passionately	
showcased by all disciplines within the business 
and hosted with grace and professionalism by our 
Egyptian team, the latest country to join our Group. 
At the event we were joined by many members of 
The	Coca-Cola	Company	and	other	key	partners	
who also shared their thoughts on the future of 
our business.

The	leadership	conference	showcased	how	
our talented, passionate people have adapted 
and embraced opportunities, ensuring that our 
company continues to be resilient and enjoy such 
a strong performance.

The	event	also	showcased	our	new	purpose,	
endorsed by the Board – to open up moments that 
refresh	us	all.	This	revision	provides	greater	clarity	
and inspiration, and also supports our alignment 
with	the	Coca-Cola	System.

The	long-term	success	of	our	business	remains	
connected to the success of our customers and 
partners, and our ability to delight consumers with 
the beverages and brands that they love. We are 
able	to	accomplish	this	due	to	our	well-embedded,	
values-based	culture.	The	Board	plays	a	critical	role	
in shaping the culture of the Company by promoting 
growth-focused	and	values-based	conduct	and	
ensuring increased focus on continued learning and 
the	smart	risk	taking	necessary	for	the Company’s	
adaptation.	The	Board	is	overseeing	the	development	
and implementation of a new culture manifesto and 
leadership model, ensuring that the revised purpose 
is	well-embedded	in	the	Company’s	culture.	

We monitor our progress in integrating our values 
through various indicators, including our employee 
engagement index, diversity indicators, and health 
and safety indicators, and our Directors lead by 
example as ambassadors of our values, cascading 
good behaviour throughout the organisation. 

One	all-employee	pulse	survey,	one	culture	and	
engagement survey and two Collaborating for 
Impact surveys were conducted in 2023. While 
Charlotte	Boyle	is	our	designated	non-Executive	
Director responsible for engaging with our people 
to provide feedback to the Board, feedback from 
our people through these surveys was brought 
to the full Board’s attention in 2023 to facilitate 
understanding of the concerns raised and ensure 
a rapid response. 

The	Board	and	I	would	like	to	thank	our	leadership	
and	all	our	colleagues	for	making	Coca-Cola	HBC	
a better business every day, working together as 
a team, delivering our Growth Story and making 
impressive progress on our journey of becoming 
the leading 24/7 beverage partner.

Seizingopportunities
In	2022	we	acquired	the	Coca-Cola	bottler	in	
Egypt	expanding	our	footprint	in	long-term	high-
growth markets. A key priority for the Board during 
2023 has been the successful integration of the 
business	into	the	Coca-Cola	HBC	family	and	I	am	
pleased	to report	that	has	gone	very	well.	Despite	
the challenging macroeconomic conditions in 
the	country	in	2023,	we	remain	confident	for	the	
prospects of our business in Egypt .

In	2023	we	undertook	a	different	type	of	acquisition	
with the purchase of Finlandia, a superb vodka 
business,	from	our	long-term	partner,	Brown-
Forman. Zoran and the team have started 
integration of the business and we expect 
significant	growth	opportunities	to	come	as	we	
build-out	this	excellent	brand	across	our	footprint.

Protectingourpeople
The	Board	is	constantly	vigilant	of	the	ongoing	
conflict	in	Ukraine.	First	and	foremost,	we	are	
focused on protecting our employees and 
ensuring, in so far as possible, their health and 
safety. We believe that the decisions we have 
taken to date achieve the best balance for our 
team on the ground and our wider stakeholders. 
We continue to monitor matters closely and will 
take further actions if needed.

The governance 
imperative in 
timesof change

In 2023, the Board has 
carefully sought to position 
our company for continued 
success, preparing to anticipate 
and seize opportunities, 
endeavouring to overcome 
challenges and continuing to 
focus on good governance: doing 
what is right over what is easy.”

Letter from the Chair of the Board continued

Strategy and performance
Our Growth Story 2025 has remained a 
cornerstone for the business throughout 
2023. We continue to prioritise the actions and 
investments that strengthen our capabilities and 
position the Company for sustained success.

Our performance in 2023 demonstrated the 
benefits	of	our	approach.	Coca-Cola	HBC	
delivered	strong	financial	performance	with	
record	levels	of	revenue	and	comparable	EBIT,	
with a good margin improvement, strong free 
cash flow	reaching	all	time	high	and	improved	ROIC.	

I was pleased to launch proceedings at our investor 
day in May in Rome, where Zoran, Ben, Naya and 
the team outlined the many actions we are taking 
to drive revenue growth, margin improvements and 
sustained	strong	cash	generation.	The	Board	fully	
supports	the	raised	mid-term	guidance	Zoran	and	
the team shared with you at the time. Delivering 
these goals will not be easy, but we have laid strong 
foundations with sustained investment over the 
last few years and have developed a culture of 
resilience and adaptability that serves us well.

Presenting at our 
Investor Day in May

We had two new Board members in 2023, 
Evguenia Stoichkova and George Pavlos Leventis, 
both bringing a wealth of experience from the 
beverage sector. 

Dividendgrowthandcapitalreturns
The	Board	has	maintained	our	progressive	
dividend,	and	for	2023	is	proposing	€0.93	per	
share, a 19% increase on the dividend per share 
versus	the	prior	year,	representing	a	45%	pay-out	
ratio, within our targeted range of 40 to 50% of 
comparable EPS.

The	consistent	growth	of	our	dividend	is	
testament	to	our	confidence	in	the	strong	
fundamentals of our business, as well as our 
commitment to shareholders.

Leadership in action
2023 was a year full of opportunity and challenge. 
I am very reassured by the Board’s strong 
contribution to our decision making, representing 
effectively	the	interests	and	viewpoints	of	all	
stakeholders	in	wide	ranging	topics.	This	has	
supported a thorough evaluation of our strategic 
investments, stretching goals for our management 
and	a	continued	strong	focus	on sustainability.

Through	our	Mission	2025	framework	and	
biodiversity policy, we are committed to reducing 
emissions and water use, by preserving and 
re-instating	water	priority	areas,	and	by	sourcing	
agricultural ingredients sustainably. While index 
performance is not a goal in itself, we continue 
to be assured by our ranking as the world’s most 
sustainable beverage company in the Dow Jones 
Sustainability Index, for another year. Consistent 
progress underpins our aim to leave nature in a 
state better than the one we found it in. 

For more on our Mission 2025 sustainability plan, 

see p72 to 74

This	year,	together	with	The	Coca-Cola	
Company and seven other bottling partners, 
we each	committed	$15	million	to	a	new	venture	
capital	fund,	the	Greycroft	Coca-Cola	System	
Sustainability	Fund.	This	$137.7	million	fund	will	
focus on innovative solutions to drive carbon 
footprint reduction, helping accelerate our 
journey towards our NetZeroby40 goal. And 
in December, we were proud to announce 
the establishment of the CCHBC Foundation 
dedicated to supporting communities in the 
areas	where	we operate,	with an	initial	€10	million	
transfer	to the	foundation.

Letter from the Chair of the Board continued

At the same time, in November 2023 we 
announced	the	start	of	a	two-year	share	
buyback programme, aimed at returning up 
to	€400	million	to	shareholders.	We	remain	
committed to a disciplined approach to capital 
allocation that continues to drive shareholder 
value.	The Group’s	capital	allocation	framework	
follows	clear	priorities:	organic	investment	in	the	
business	to	drive	delivery	of	our	medium-term	
financial	targets;	paying	a	progressive	dividend,	
targeting	a	payout	of	40%-50%	of	earnings	per	
share;	strategic	M&A;	and	finally,	additional	capital	
return. With these priorities in mind, the Board 
believed that the 2023 share price undervalued 
the Company’s future growth opportunities, 
and	the approval	of	a	share	buyback	programme	
provided a compelling opportunity to enhance 
value for shareholders while continuing to invest 
in the	business.

The importance of good governance
As a Board, our aim is to always ensure the 
highest standards of corporate governance, 
accountability and risk management. Our 
internal policies and procedures, which have 
been	consistently	effective	since	the	Group	
was formed, are properly documented and 
communicated against the framework applicable 
to companies with a premium listing in the UK. 
The	Board	and	its	committees	have	conducted	
an	annual	review	of	the	effectiveness	of	our	
risk management system and internal controls, 
further details of which are set out in the Audit 
and Risk Committee report on pages 153 to 158. 
The	Board	confirms	that	it	has	concluded	that	our	
risk management	and	internal	control	systems	
are effective.	

We are subject to the UK Corporate Governance 
Code 2018. It sets out the principles of good 
practice	in	relation	to:	Board	leadership	and	
Company	purpose;	division	of	responsibilities;	
composition,	success	and	evaluation;	audit,	risk	
and	internal	controls;	and	remuneration.	Further	
information on how we have applied the principles 
and complied with the provisions of the UK 
Corporate Governance Code 2018 for the year 
ended 31 December 2023 can be found in this 
report on pages 123 and 127. 

Board meetings normally take place in Zug, 
Switzerland, but also in selected markets across 
our territories. 

Boardevaluation
In line with our commitment to adhere to best 
corporate	governance	practices,	an	externally-
facilitated	Board	effectiveness	evaluation	was	
conducted in the second half of 2023. Key 
outcomes are included on page 150 of the 
Nomination	Committee	report.	The	evaluation	will	
be conducted again in 2024 to apply learnings. 

Board composition and diversity 
We	believe	that	our	Board	is	well-balanced	
and diverse, with the right mix of international 
skills, experience, background, independence, 
and knowledge in order to discharge its duties 
and	responsibilities	effectively.	However,	the	
composition and size of the Board continue 
to be kept	under review.	

The	Financial	Conduct	Authority’s	(FCA)	Listing	
Rules on targets for gender and ethnic diversity 
apply	for	the	first	time	and	our	disclosures	are	in	
the Nomination Committee report (see pages 148 
to 149). We continue to attach great importance 
to all aspects of diversity in our nomination 
processes at Board and senior management 
levels, while appointing candidates with the 
credentials that are necessary for the continued 
growth and performance of our operations 
within our highly specialised industry. We believe 
that a diverse Board fosters both innovation 
and resilience and are proud of our track record 
of female and ethnic minority representation. 
As of the date of this report, female Directors 
comprised	more	than	38%	of our Board	
(compared with 33% in 2022), while ethnic 
minorities	represented	8%,	same	as	in 2022.	

Lookingahead
A	further	record	year	in	2023	confirms	our	
resilience,	despite	the	impact	of	cost	inflation	and	
the	conflict	in	Ukraine.	This	reflects	the	continued	
investments we have made in the business, 
focused on strengthening the most critical 
drivers of	future	performance.	

We will continue to ensure the management team 
is properly incentivised and stretched to deliver 
exceptional results. I am proud of the fact that 
we’ve been able to reward our teams with healthy 
remuneration in recent years, consistent we 
believe with the outcomes they’ve delivered. We 
ask for dedication, professionalism and a strong 
performance from them and they have achieved 
a great	deal	in	difficult	times.	

We may have seen the worst of the anticipated 
inflation,	but	economic	risks	remain.	As	Zoran	
explains in his statement in the Strategic Report 
(see page 6), we have taken successful actions to 
improve price and mix within our portfolio while also 
being	mindful	of	maintaining	affordability	for	all	our	
consumers. In several countries, consumers are 
being	squeezed	by	the	legacy	of	high-inflation	and	
weaker economic conditions. Providing relevant 
products with the right appeal and pricing, working 
with our customers on appropriate promotions, 
remains at the heart of how we make ourselves 
relevant for all consumers. It is this focus and drive 
that will enable us to deliver on our Growth Story 
2025	and	our	mid-term	targets.

Doing all of this sustainably is critical. Within this, 
climate change remains a top priority. We are well 
equipped to face these challenges thanks to the 
strength of our portfolio, proven capabilities and 
committed partnerships.

This	work	continues,	as	we	embed	our	values-
based culture to deliver on our clear purpose. 

I would like to thank the Board members for 
their continued commitment and counsel 
this year, as well as extending my thanks to all 
CCHBC colleagues, customers, consumers and 
partners. Our people and culture are at the heart 
of everything we do. Opening up moments that 
refresh	us	all was	at	the	heart	of	our	success	
in 2023 and will underpin our progress for 
generations to come.

Swisscorporaterules
There	is	no	mandatory	Corporate	Governance	
Code under Swiss law applicable to the Company. 
The	main	source	of	law	for	Swiss	governance	
rules is the company law contained in article 
620 et seqq. of the Swiss Code of Obligations. 
Swiss company law includes provisions regarding 
the compensation in listed companies and 
further limits the authority of the Remuneration 
Committee and the Board to determine 
compensation.	The	effective	limitations	include	
requiring that the AGM approve the maximum total 
compensation of each member of the Board and 
the	Executive	Leadership	Team	(ELT),	requiring	
that certain compensation elements be authorised 
in the Articles of Association and prohibiting 
certain forms of compensation, such as severance 
payments	and	financial	or	monetary	incentives	
for	the	acquisition	or	disposal	of	firms.	We	are	
in compliance with the requirements of Swiss 
company	law	and	the	specific	provisions	therein	
regarding the compensation in listed companies.

UK’sCityCodeonTakeovers
and Mergers
The	UK’s	City	Code	on	Takeovers	and	Mergers	
(the ‘City Code’) does not apply to the Company, 
because the Company does not have its 
registered	office	in	the	United	Kingdom,	the	
Channel	Islands	or	the	Isle	of	Man.	The	Articles	of	
Association	include	specific	provisions	designed	
to prevent any person acquiring shares carrying 
30% or more of the voting rights (taken together 
with any interest in shares held or acquired by the 
acquirer or persons acting in concert with the 
acquirer) except if (subject to certain exceptions) 
such acquisition would not have been prohibited 
by the City Code or if such acquisition is made 
through	an	offer	conducted	in	accordance	with	
the City Code. For further details, please refer to 
the Company’s Articles of Association, which are 
available on our website.

Application of the Company’s corporate governance practices

 In accordance with the established policy of 
appointing all Directors for one year at a time, 
the Board continues to keep all positions 
under regular review and subject to annual 
election by shareholders at the Annual 
General	Meeting	(AGM).	The	Board	continues	
to believe that the proven leadership of our 
Chair in combination with his deep knowledge 
of	the	Coca-Cola	System	position	him	as	
unique to steer the Group at the current time.

(2)  Provision 38 requires alignment of Executive 
Director pension contributions with the wider 
workforce.	Our	difficulties	in	compliance	with	
this provision due to existing contractual 
obligations were outlined in the Annual 
Report published in 2021 and are explained 
on page 166 of the Directors’ Remuneration 
Report. On the appointment of any new 
Executive Director, we intend that their 
pension contributions will be aligned with 
the pension scheme for the wider workforce. 
Pursuant to our obligations under the Listing 
Rules, we apply the principles and comply 
with the provisions of the UK Corporate 
Governance Code or explain any instances 
of	non-compliance	in	our	Annual	Report.	
The	Company	has	applied	the	principles	as	
far as possible and in accordance with and as 
permitted by Swiss law. Further information 
on appointment of Directors and compliance 
with the UK Corporate Governance Code 
can be	found	on	the page	123.

Compliance with the UK Corporate 
Governance Code 2018 

As a Swiss corporation listed on the LSE with 
a secondary	listing	on	the	Athens	Exchange,	
we aim	to	ensure	that	our	corporate	governance	
systems remain in line with international 
best practices. Our corporate governance 
standards and procedures are continuously 
reviewed in light of current developments and 
rulemaking processes in the UK, Switzerland 
and	also	the	EU. Further	details	are	available	
on	our	website.	In respect	of	the	year	ended	
31 December 2023, the Company was subject 
to the UK Corporate Governance Code 2018 
(a copy is available at www.frc.org.uk). Our 
Board	confirms that	the	Company	applied	the	
principles and	complied	with the	provisions	of	
the UK	Corporate Governance	Code	throughout	
the	financial	year	ended	December	2023,	except	
for	the	following	provisions:	

(1)		The	Chair	was	not	independent	on	

appointment (provision 9) and has been 
a Board	member	for	more	than	nine	years	
(provision 19). Anastassis David was originally 
appointed	as	non-Executive	Director	(NED)	
in 2006	at	the	request	of	Kar-Tess	Holding	
and was not, at the time of his appointment as 
Chair,	in	2016,	independent	as	defined	by	the	
UK Corporate Governance Code. In view of 
Anastassis	David’s	strong	identification	with	
the Company and its shareholder interests, 
combined with his deep knowledge and 
experience	of	the	Coca-Cola	System,	the	
Board deemed it to be in the best interests 
of the Group and its shareholders for him 
to be appointed as Chair, with unanimous 
support,	to	continue	to	promote	an	effective	
and appropriately balanced leadership of 
the Group.

Application of the Company’s corporate governance practices continued

Amending the Articles of Association
The	Articles	of	Association	may	only	be	amended	
by a resolution of the shareholders passed by a 
majority	of	at	least	two-thirds	of	the	voting	rights	
represented and an absolute majority of the 
nominal value of the shares represented.

Sharecapitalstructure
The	Company	has	ordinary	shares	in	issue	with	a	
nominal value of CHF 6.70 each. Rights attaching 
to each share are identical and each share carries 
one	vote.	The	Company’s	Articles	of	Association	
also allow, subject to shareholder approval, for the 
conversion of registered shares into bearer shares 
and bearer shares into registered shares. Details 
of the movement in ordinary share capital during 
the	year	can	be	found	on	page	257.	There	are	no	
persons holding shares that carry special rights 
with regard to the control of the Company.

PowersofDirectorstoissueandbuy
backshares
Subject to the provisions of the relevant laws 
and the Articles of Association, the Board acting 
collectively has the ultimate responsibility for 
running the Company and the supervision 
and control	of	its	executive	management.	The	
Directors may take decisions on all matters that 
are not expressly reserved to the shareholders 
by the Articles of Association. Pursuant to the 
provisions of the Articles of Association, the 
Directors require shareholder authority to issue 
shares. In accordance with the FCA’s Listing Rules, 
the Directors require shareholder authority to 
repurchase shares. At the AGM on 17 May 2023, 
the shareholders authorised the Directors to 
repurchase ordinary shares of CHF 6.70 each in 
the capital of the Company up to a maximum 
aggregate number of 10,000,000 representing less 
than 10% of the Company’s issued share capital 
as	of	4	April	2023.	The	authority	will	expire	at	the	
conclusion of the 2024 AGM on 21 May 2024 or 
at midnight on 30 June 2024, whichever is earlier. 
The	Company	commenced	a	share	buyback	
programme	on	21 November	2023	and	is expected	
to run for a period of around two years. As at 
31 December	2023,	the	Company	reported	that	
1,638,298 ordinary shares had been purchased at 
an average price of 2,239.8482 pence per ordinary 
share	and	are	held	in	treasury.	The	buyback	
programme	continues	and	as	at	11	March 2024	(the	
latest practicable date for inclusion in this report), 
since 31 December 2023, the Company purchased 
a further 1,154,432 shares at an average price of 
2,475.6449 pence per share and these shares 
are also held in treasury. Shares held in treasury 
as	at	11 March	2024	total	7,215,615	out	of	which	
3,785,480	are	held	by	CCHBC AG	(including	the	
purchased shares) and 3,430,135 shares are held 
by	its subsidiary,	CCHBC	Services	MEPE.

Board composition
On 31 December 2023, our Board comprised 
13 Directors:	the	Chair,	one	Senior	Independent	
Director,	ten	NEDs	and	one	Executive Director.	

The	NEDs	are	experienced	individuals	from	a	
range of backgrounds, countries and industries, as 
shown by their biographies on pages 130 to 132. 
Evguenia Stoichkova and George Pavlos Leventis 
were appointed to the Board at the 2023 AGM and 
at the conclusion of the AGM, Bruno Pietracci and 
Ryan Rudolph retired from the Board. Evguenia 
Stoichkova was also elected as a member of the 
Social	Responsibility	Committee.	This	is	our	first	
year of reporting on gender and ethnicity metrics 
in accordance with the FCA Listing Rules. Further 
details are disclosed on pages 148 to 149 of the 
Nomination Committee Report. 

External appointments
The	Articles	of	Association	of	the	Company	(article	
36) set limits on the maximum number of external 
appointments that members of our Board and 
executive management may hold. In addition, if 
a Board member wishes to take up an external 
appointment, he or she must obtain prior Board 
approval.	The	Board	will	assess	all	requests	on	a	case-
by-case	basis,	including	whether	the	appointment	
in question could negatively impact the Company 
or the performance of the Director’s duties to the 
Group.	The	nature	of	the	appointment	and	the	
expected time commitment are also assessed 
to	ensure	that	the	effectiveness	of	the	Board	
would not be compromised. Details of the external 
appointments of our Directors are contained in 
their respective biographies on pages 130 to 132.

Our Chair is active in the international community. 
With regard to his external appointments, the Board 
considers that fewer than four of the positions held 
by	the	Chair	are	considered	to	be	significant.	A	
number of our other Directors also have other 
external	roles.	With	effect	from	1	January	2023	
Swiss	law	has	amended	the	definition	of	‘external	
appointments’ and requires disclosure of external 
appointments in other undertakings (public or 
private) with a commercial purpose (opposed to 
the requirement under the old law to disclose 
external appointments in legal entities registered 
in a	commercial	register	or	similar	register).	
The	Board	is	satisfied	that	any	additionally	
disclosed	positions	are	not	considered	significant.	
Having considered the scope of the external 
appointments of all Directors, including the Chair, 
our	Board	is	satisfied	that	they	do	not	compromise	
the	effectiveness	of	the	Board.	Each	Director	has	
sufficient	time	to	devote	to	as necessary	for	the	
performance of their duties and, according to the 
terms	of	appointment	to	the	Board.	This	will	include	
attendance annually at approximately ten Board 
meetings, AGMs and other meetings. As can be 
seen in the table of attendance of Board and Board 
Committee meetings on page 140, the Directors 
were able to devote the time required to discharge 
their duties and the Board has determined that 
each	member	commits	sufficient	time	and	
energy	to	the	role,	continuing	to make	a	valuable	
contribution	to	the	Board	and	its committees.

Application of the Company’s corporate governance practices continued 

Independence
Our Board has concluded that Charlotte J. Boyle, 
Olusola	(Sola)	David-Borha,	Anna	Diamantopoulou,	
William W. (Bill) Douglas III, Reto Francioni and 
Alexandra Papalexopoulou are deemed to be 
independent, representing half of the Board, 
excluding the Chair, in accordance with the 
criteria set out in the UK Corporate Governance 
Code, with such individuals being independent 
in	both	character	and	judgement.	The	other	
non-Executive	Directors	were	appointed	following	
nomination by the two major shareholders 
(see details below) and they are therefore not 
considered by the Board, to be independent as 
defined	by	the	UK	Corporate	Governance	Code.

Anastassis David was appointed as Chair on 27 
January	2016.	The	Board	believes	that	Anastassis	
David embodies the Company’s core values, 
heritage and culture and that these attributes, 
together	with	his	strong	identification	with	the	
Company and its shareholders’ interests and his 
deep	knowledge	and	experience	of	the	Coca-Cola	
System,	ensure	an	effective	and	appropriately	
balanced leadership of the Board and the Company. 
Anastassis	David	was	first	appointed	as	a	member	
of the Board in 2006 before being appointed Chair 
in 2016. Prior to his appointment as Chair, major 
shareholders were consulted, and an external search 
consultancy	engaged	to	find	suitable	candidates.	
The	consensus	was	that	Anastassis	David	was	the	
appropriate candidate to become Chair and that 
he	continues	to	be	effective	in	his	leadership	of	the	
Board. In accordance with the established policy 

of appointing all Directors for one year at a time, 
the Board continues to keep all positions under 
regular review and subject to annual election by 
shareholders	at	the	AGM.	The	Board	continues	to	
believe that the proven leadership of our Chair in 
combination	with	his	deep	knowledge	of	the	Coca-
Cola System position him as unique to steer the 
Group at the current time. Accordingly, Anastassis 
David has the continuing support of the Board and 
major shareholders to remain as Chair. 

Shareholder nominees
As described on page 309, since the main listing of 
the	Company	on	the	Official	List	of	the	London	Stock	
Exchange	in	2013,	Kar-Tess	Holding,	TCCC	and	their	
respective	affiliates	have	no	special	rights	in	relation	
to	the	appointment	or	re-election	of	nominee	
Directors.	Those	Directors	who	were	originally	
nominated	for	appointment	by	TCCC	or	Kar-Tess	
Holding	will	be	required	to	stand	for	re-election	
on an annual basis in the same way as the other 
Directors.	The	Nomination	Committee	is	responsible	
for identifying and recommending candidates for 
subsequent nomination by the Board for election 
as Directors by the shareholders on an annual basis.

As our Board currently comprises 13 Directors, 
neither	Kar-Tess	Holding	nor	TCCC	is	in	a	position	
to control (positively or negatively) decisions of 
the Board that are subject to simple majority 
approval. However, decisions of the Board that 
are subject to the special quorum provisions 
and supermajority requirements contained in 
the Articles of Association, in practice, require the 
support of Directors nominated at the request of 

at	least	one	of	either	TCCC	or	Kar-Tess	Holding	
to	be	approved.	In addition,	based	on	their	current	
shareholdings,	neither	Kar-Tess	Holding	nor	
TCCC	is	in	a	position	to	control	a	decision	of	the	
shareholders (positively or negatively), except to 
block a resolution to wind up or dissolve the Company 
or to amend the supermajority voting requirements. 
The	latter	requires	the	approval	of	80%	of	the	total	
number of shareholders being represented and 
voting. Depending on the attendance levels at AGMs, 
Kar-Tess	Holding	or	TCCC	may	also	be	in	a	position	
to control other matters requiring supermajority 
shareholder approval.

Anastassis G. David, Anastasios I. Leventis, 
Christo Leventis, and George Pavlos Leventis 
were all originally nominated for appointment by 
Kar-Tess	Holding.	Henrique	Braun	and	Evguenia	
Stoichkova were nominated for appointment 
by	TCCC.	The	two	Directors	who	retired	at	the	
2023 AGM had been nominated by the two major 
shareholders:	Bruno	Pietracci	was	nominated	by	
TCCC	and	Ryan	Rudolph	by	Kar-Tess	Holding.

Conflictsofinterest
In accordance with the Company’s Organisational 
Regulations, Directors are required to arrange their 
personal	and	business	affairs	to	avoid	a	conflict	of	
interest with the Group. Each Director must disclose 
to	the	Chair	the	nature	and	extent	of	any	conflict	
of interest arising generally or in relation to any 
matter to be discussed at a Board meeting as soon 
as the Director becomes aware of its existence. 
In the event that the Chair becomes aware of a 
Director’s	conflict	of	interest,	the	Chair	is	required	
to contact that Director promptly and discuss 
the	nature	and	extent	of	such	a	conflict	of	interest.	
Subject to exceptional circumstances in which the 
best interests of the Company dictate otherwise, 
the	Director	affected	by	a	conflict	of	interest	is	
not permitted to participate in discussions and 
decision-making	involving	the	interest	at	stake.

Corporate Governance Report continued 
EngagingwithourStakeholders

The	Board	regularly	reviews	stakeholder	
engagement activities undertaken, both by it and 
the	Group	as	whole,	and	is	satisfied	that	the	activities	
outlined in the next two pages and on pages 12 
to	18	remain	effective	for	the	mutual	benefit	of	
the Company and its stakeholders. Going forward, 
a focus on our people, customers, consumers, 
communities and partners will remain high 
on the Board’s	agenda.

Shareholders 
In 2023, shareholders were permitted to attend 
the 2023 AGM with the statutory auditors and 
the independent proxy adviser in person, for 
the	first	time	since	2019,	due	to	Covid-19	safety	
restrictions. At the 2023 AGM, more than 20% of 
votes were cast against three resolutions, being 
the advisory votes on the UK remuneration report 
(resolution 7), the Swiss remuneration report 
(resolution	9),	and	the	re-election	of	Charlotte	
J. Boyle, Chair of the Remuneration Committee 
(Resolution 4.1.3). In accordance with Provision 
4 of the UK Corporate Governance Code, on 
15 December 2023 we published an update on 
the key actions that were taken by the Board 
of Directors and Remuneration Committee in 
response to this. In addition to the consultation 
with its largest shareholders prior to the 2023 
AGM the Chair of the Remuneration Committee 
has further engaged with shareholders to 
understand their feedback regarding the votes. 
From this engagement, it is understood that 
the	significant	factor	regarding	the	votes	was	
connected	to	the	increased	2023-2025	PSP	
opportunity for the CEO, even though this was 
within the policy limits approved by shareholders. 

More information on the actions taken 
in	response to	this	vote	is included	in	the	
Remuneration	Report	on	page 160.	

Pursuant to Swiss law and the Articles of 
Association, shareholders annually elect an 
independent proxy and have the possibility 
to authorise and instruct the independent 
proxy electronically for our general meetings. 
The	Chair,	Senior	Independent	Director	and	
Chair of the Audit and Risk Committee will be 
available at the 2024 AGM to answer questions 
from	shareholders.	The	Board	encourages	
shareholders to attend as it provides an 
opportunity to engage with the Board. 

The	Chairman	meets	and	maintains	a	dialogue	
with the Company’s major shareholders to 
understand their views on the Company’s 
strategy and	performance.

More broadly, our investor relations function 
reports	to	the	CFO.	Through	the	investor	relations	
team, the Company and Board maintain a dialogue 
with	institutional	investors	and	financial	analysts	
on	our	strategy,	financial	and	sustainability	
performance. We engaged with the investment 
community and our shareholders throughout 
the year,	as	outlined	in	the	box	opposite.	
Feedback from	shareholders	was	regularly	
considered by the Board and, where necessary, 
appropriate action to further engage was taken.

OtherStakeholders
We remain constantly vigilant of the ongoing 
conflict	in	Ukraine.	First	and	foremost,	we	are	
focused on protecting our employees and 
ensuring, in so far as possible, their health and 
safety. We believe that the decisions we have 
taken to date achieve the best balance for our 
team on the ground and our wider stakeholders. 
We continue to monitor matters closely and will 
take further actions if needed. 

Stakeholder interests and matters were also 
carefully considered by the Board in the context 
of	the	acquisition	of	Brown-Forman	Finland	
Oy, owner of Finlandia, a leading vodka brand in 
Central	and	Eastern	Europe,	on	1 November	2023	
and	its	subsequent	integration.	The	acquisition	
represents a unique opportunity for the Group 
as it enhances our journey towards becoming the 
leading 24/7 beverage partner and creating value 
for our stakeholders. We have been distributing 
Finlandia and other premium spirits brands for 
more than 17 years and the acquisition, which we 
assessed as an attractive investment is expected 
to further enrich and strengthen our portfolio 
across more of our markets. Ownership of the 
Finlandia vodka business is also expected to 
enhance	our	premium	spirits	credentials;	driving	
mixability	opportunities	with	premium	and	super-
premium	NARTD	products,	helping	capture	
more drinking occasions for our consumers, and 
strengthening partnerships with customers in 
strategically important channels such as hotels, 
restaurants and cafés and creating more value 
for our partners and customers by capturing 
new opportunities	with	our	well-rounded	
beverage portfolio.

EngagingwithourStakeholderscontinued

Championingworkforce
rightsatBoard level
Charlotte Boyle, our designated NED for 
workforce engagement, attended meetings 
with our European Works Council during 
the year. She heard from elected employee 
representatives from our businesses in 
EU	countries,	hearing	first-hand	their	
experiences during the last couple of years. 
The	insights	gained	contributed	to	the	
Board’s decisions in relation to ensuring 
the appropriate support and resources for 
our people – not only in terms of safety, 
but to aid them	in	their	roles.

Charlotte frequently interacted with our 
Head of Labor Relations Director, who is 
also responsible for monitoring diversity, 
equity and inclusion, to better understand 
the steps we are taking to be more diverse 
and	inclusive	(see	page	49).	To	embed	these	
attributes within the Company’s culture, 
multiple initiatives have been launched to 
increase awareness and understanding and 
improve policies and practices to create a 
more equitable and inclusive workplace for all. 
Again, Charlotte reported back to the Board 
on her observations and matters raised by 
employees, ensuring Board deliberations 
and decision	making	were	fully	informed.

Ourpeople
The	Board	recognises	that	our	people	are	core	to	
our strategy – our success depends on our ability 
to	attract,	retain	and	develop	the	best	talent.	The	
safety of our workforce continued to be a focus 
throughout 2023, ensuring appropriate measures 
were in place so that people could continue in 
their roles and that we were supporting a healthy 
working environment, particularly for colleagues 
and their families based in or around Russia and 
Ukraine.	The	Board	closely	monitors	and	reviews	
the results of the employee engagement surveys. 
It also reviews talent development initiatives 
designed	to	support	long-term	success.	For	
further details on investing in our people please 
see below and the Growth Pillar 4 on pages 45 to 
51. For further details on rewarding our people 
please see the Remuneration Committee Report 
on pages 159 to 184. 

Charlotte	Boyle,	our	designated	non-Executive	
Director has the mandate for engagement with 
our people. Employee engagement survey results 
are shared with and reviewed by the Nomination 
Committee	and	the	Board.	The	CEO	held	
engagement sessions with employees during 
the year,	including	Q&As.

Cultureinaction

The Board is responsible for monitoring 
andassessingourculture.TheChair
ensuresthattheBoardisoperating
appropriately and sets the Board’s 
culture,whichinturnsetsthestandard
forthecultureoftheCompany.

The	CEO,	supported	by	members	of	the	ELT,	is	
responsible for ensuring culture is embedded 
throughout the business and its operations and 
in	all	our	dealings	with	our	stakeholders.	The	
Board measures the culture of the Group using 
internal and external metrics, which also enable 
it to identify further actions to ensure the culture 
remains	appropriate.	The	Board	also	assesses	
the alignment of the Group’s policy, practices 
and behaviours throughout the business with 
the company’s purpose, values and strategy, 
and,	if	not	satisfied,	seeks	assurance	that	the	
management	is	taking	corrective	action.	The	
Board also monitors the Group’s performance 
against its peer group within the same sector. 

What	defines	our	culture	is	who	we	are,	our	
purpose, our vision, our values, how we need to 
evolve and the behaviours we commit to each 
other.	In	2023,	we	further	defined	this	with	our	
Culture	Story’	which	was	rolled-out	during	our	
Leadership	Conference	in	Cairo.	The	Board	
monitored progress through the regular updates 
from the management team, and culture and 
engagement surveys ran during the year –

empowering youth and women – see page 66.

Reto Francioni
Committee Chair

Dear Stakeholder
The work of the Nomination Committee focuses 
on the proper composition and effective operation 
of the Board, Board and senior management 
succession planning, the oversight of the talent 
management framework, as well as employee 
engagement and diversity initiatives.

In 2023, the Committee continued to review 
the balance of skills, experience and diversity 
of the Board, and the overall length of service 
of the Board, both as a whole and as part of its 
succession planning and consideration of the 
need to refresh Board membership. Our Group’s 
Nomination Policy for the Recruitment of Board 
members is our compass for the recruitment 
of new Board members. This year, following the 
retirement of two Board members, two new 
members were appointed to the Board at the 
2023 AGM. As every year, this year the Committee 
continued to coordinate the evaluation of the 
Board and the Board committees’ effectiveness 
through an externally facilitated assessment. 

On the employee side, the oversight of the 
Group’s talent development, employee 
engagement and diversity initiatives, which 
are necessary to ensure that the Group has 
the people and skills to deliver on its strategy, 
remained a key priority for the Committee. 
Regular engagement with senior management 
to review results of employee engagement 
surveys and get updates on the new International 
Leadership Trainee programme, Coke 
Summership programme, the progress of 
embedding the Group’s Culture Manifesto rolled 
out earlier in 2023, talent movements within the 
Group and within the Coca-Cola System, as well 
as activities to enhance the Group’s preferred 
employer status provided excellent insights for

a Board self-assessment. The formal role of the 
Nomination Committee is set out in the charter 
for the committees of the Board of Directors 
in Annex C of the Company’s Organisational 
Regulations. This is available online at

members to the Board;

•  planning and managing, in consultation with the 
Chair, a Board membership succession plan;
•  ensuring, together with the Chair, the operation 

of a satisfactory induction programme for

Group’s strategy;

•  setting the criteria for, and overseeing, the 

annual assessment of the performance and 
effectiveness of each member of the Board

Committee concerning succession planning and 
the selection of key people. In 2023, the General 
Counsel also met with the Nomination Committee 
on several occasions. During 2023, the work of the 
Nomination Committee included consideration of:

• 

• 

• 
• 

• 

 succession planning and development of plans 
for the recruitment of new Board members and 
senior management and certain members of 
the Group’s ELT;
 composition of the Board, including the

During the Committee’s discussions on all 
matters detailed above consideration of the 
Company’s Inclusion and Diversity and Anti-

Board Nomination Policy, as well as the Company’s 
commitment to such policies, is taken into 
account to ensure they are embedded into the 
Group’s activities, programmes and initiatives.

Board Nomination Policy
Our Board Nomination Policy requires that 
each Director is recognised as a person of the 
highest integrity and standing, both personally 
and professionally. Each Director must be ready 
to devote the time necessary to fulfil his or her 
responsibilities to the Company according to 
the terms and conditions of his or her letter 
of appointment. Each Director should have 
demonstrable experience, skills and knowledge 
that enhance Board effectiveness and will 
complement those of the other members of the 
Board to ensure an overall balance of experience, 
skills and knowledge on the Board. In addition, 
each Director must demonstrate familiarity with 
and respect for good corporate governance 
practices, sustainability and responsible 
approaches to social issues.

Nomination Committee continued

We are proud of the diverse skills and experiences of 
our Board. 

For example, in relation to ESG matters, 
Anna Diamantopoulou’s familiarity with the 
social protection and welfare state at the EU 
Commission High-Level Group, in addition to the 
expertise of a number of our Board members 
who sit on the Boards of other multi-nationals 
that face similar challenges and have similar 
concerns on the ESG agenda, helped us identify 
the commitments that we want to make in the 
area and set the relevant targets. 

In addition, connected to the ESG, Anastasios 
Leventis, the Chairman of the Social Responsibility 
Committee of the Board, is a member of the 
European Council of The Nature Conservancy 
(TNC), a global environmental non-profit 
organisation working to create a world where 
people and nature can thrive, and he is a board 
member of WWF Hellas (the Greek branch of 
WWF). Those experiences support in driving the 
environmental agenda and in endorsing Coca-
Cola HBC’s bold sustainability commitments 
related to climate, water stewardship, biodiversity 
and packaging.

In relation to risk oversight and management, 
we are proud that the vast majority of our Board 
members possess strong risk management 
expertise, developed over time as a result of their 
extensive experience in senior leadership positions 
in large organizations, as executives and/or as 
board members, where the deep understanding 
of material risks and their potential impact, the 
implementation of mitigation and resolution 
as well as contingency plans and the setting of 
appropriate internal controls, processes and 
policies to effectively address these is paramount 
to successfully perform in such senior roles.

Support and training for the Board
The practices and procedures adopted by our 
Board ensure that the Directors are supplied on 
a timely basis with comprehensive information 
on the business development and financial 
position of the Company, the form and content 
of which is expected to enable the Directors to 
discharge their duties. All Directors have access 
to our General Counsel, as well as independent 
professional advice at the expense of the 
Company. They have full access to the CEO 
and senior management, as well as the external 
auditor and internal audit team.

The Board has in place an induction programme 
for new Directors. It involves meetings with the 
Chair, members of the ELT and other senior 
executives, as well as receiving orientation 
training in relation to the Group and its 
corporate governance practices. It also includes 
meetings with representatives of our sales 
force, customers and major shareholders and 
visits to our production plants. All Directors 
are given the opportunity to attend training to 
ensure that they are kept up to date on relevant 
legal, accounting and corporate governance 
developments. In 2023, our Chief Risk Officer ran 
a risk management workshop for the Board. The 
Directors individually attend seminars, forums, 
conferences and working groups on relevant 
topics. The Nomination Committee reviews 
Director training activities regularly. Finally, as part 
of the continuing development of the Directors, 
the Company Secretary ensures that our Board 
is kept up to date with key corporate governance 
developments. The Board appoints the Company 
Secretary, who acts as secretary to the Board.

Board appointments and 
succession planning
Our Board has in place plans to ensure the 
progressive renewal and appropriate succession 
planning for senior management. These cover the 
short, medium and long term, and are regularly 
reviewed. Appointments and succession plans are 
based on merit and objective criteria to ensure the 
Company is promoting diversity (including gender, 
social and ethnic backgrounds – see page 146 – 
cognitive and personal strengths. Pursuant to our 
Articles of Association, the Board consists of a 
minimum of seven and a maximum of 15 members, 
and the Directors are elected annually for a term 
of one year by the Company’s shareholders, 
which is also in accordance with the UK Corporate 
Governance Code. In case of resignation or 
death of any member, the Board may elect a 
permanent guest to be proposed for election by 
the shareholders at the next AGM. In accordance 
with the Organisational Regulations, the Board 
proposes for election at the shareholders’ meeting 
new Directors who have been recommended by 
the Nomination Committee after consultation 
with the Chair. In making such recommendations, 
the Nomination Committee and the Board must 
consider objective criteria as above, as well as the 
overall length of service of the Board as a whole 
when refreshing its membership. Through this 
process, the Board is satisfied that the Board and 
its committees have diversity, independence 
and knowledge to enable them to discharge their 
duties, including sufficient time commitment.

Diversity
The Group continues to have a firm commitment to 
policies promoting diversity, equal opportunity and 
talent development at every level throughout the 
organisation, including at Board and management 
level, and is constantly seeking to attract and recruit 
highly qualified candidates for all positions in its 
business. The Group’s D&I Policy applies to all people 

who work for us. Further details on the Group’s D&I 
Policy are set out on page 49 in the Strategic Report.

The Group believes that diversity at the Board 
level acts as a key driver of Board effectiveness, 
helps to ensure that the Group can achieve its 
overall business goals especially considering our 
geographical footprint, and is critical in promoting a 
diverse and inclusive culture across the whole Group. 
The Board has adopted a Board Nomination Policy, 
which guides the Nomination Committee and the 
Board in relation to their approach to diversity in 
respect of succession planning and the selection 
process for the appointment of new Board members. 
It does not include targets for either gender or 
ethnicity. However, the Board is cognisant of the 
recommendations in the FTSE Women Leaders 
Review, as well as the targets for gender, ethnicity and 
persons in senior board positions in the FCA’s Listing 
Rules, and these will be taken into consideration 
for succession planning and appointment of new 
Board members. The Nomination Committee 
is responsible for implementing this policy and 
for monitoring progress towards the achievement 
of its objectives.

The requirements and objectives of the Board 
Nomination Policy include that the Nomination 
Committee is required to take into account all 
aspects of diversity, including age, ethnicity, gender, 
educational and professional background and 
social background when considering succession 
planning and new Board appointments; seek a wide 
pool of candidates, with a broad range of previous 
experience, skills and knowledge; and give preference 
to executive search firms that are accredited under 
the Enhanced Code of Conduct for Executive Search 
Firms. Board appointments are evaluated on merit 
against objective criteria with due regard for diversity 
to ensure that candidates contribute to the balance 
of skills, experience, knowledge and diversity of the 
Board. The Board also considers the overall length 
of service of the Board as a whole when considering 
refreshment of the membership.

The Board understands the benefits of diversity of 
gender, ethnicity, knowledge and experience, and 
this is reflected in the Board Nomination Policy. 
The Policy’s objectives include ensuring female 
representation on the Board.

Two Directors retired at the 2023 AGM and, 
following recommendation by the Nomination 
Committee, two Directors, one male and one 
female, were appointed at the 2023 AGM. Female 
representation on the Board increased from 
around 33% to 38% following appointment of 
Evguenia Stoichkova at the 2023 AGM.

Board and ELT gender and 
ethnicity metrics
The FCA’s new Listing Rules on targets for gender 
and ethnic diversity apply to the Company for the 
first time this financial year. As at 31 December 2023, 
the Company had met the target for ethnic Board 
diversity and had just over 38% of female Board 
representation. Although the female proportion 
has increased, the Company is slightly behind 
the required 40% target in the FCA Listing Rules. 
No senior positions on the Board as described in 
the FCA Listing Rules are held by women. Female 
representation in the ELT is 20% and in senior 
management positions reporting to ELT is 36,79%. 
The Board will prioritise improving the Board gender 
balance and the Nomination Committee has, and 
will continue to, consider this in the context of its 
continuous work on succession plans for the Board, 
as well as senior management including the ELT. 

The following metrics set out the range of gender 
and ethnicity as they relate to our Board and ELT as 
at 31 December 2023. The ELT refers to the most 
senior level of managers reporting to the CEO, 
including the General Counsel/Company Secretary 
but excluding administrative and support staff, in 
accordance with the definition in the FCA’s Listing 
Rules. The Board diversity related data is collated 
on an anonymous basis directly from each Director 
and ELT member using a questionnaire and given 
on a self-identifying basis.

to be disclosed.
CEO is a senior position on the Board, but CFO is not.
Board diversity data is collated on an anonymous basis directly from each Director using a questionnaire and given on a self-identifying basis and without identifying their position on the Board.

Gender diversity and representation at 
Board and ELT level
The Board is committed to appointing the best 
people with the right skills, using non-discriminatory 
and fair processes during selection, recognising 
the importance of diversity in its business. It 
is the Board’s responsibility to oversee senior 
management succession planning for a diverse 
pipeline of managers and talent identified from 
the management talent development programme. 
A target has been set of 50% female representation 
of managers, to be achieved by 2025. This links to 
our strategy to develop our people and ensure we 
attract and retain a diverse talent pool, and is one 

of the five pillars of our growth strategy. Further 
information on pages 46 to 51. The Nomination 
Committee, in conjunction with the ELT, will continue 
to monitor the proportion of women at all levels of 
the Group and ensure that all appointments are 
made with a view to having a high level of diversity 
within the workplace and in leadership positions.

We are a global company with a diverse geographic 
footprint, including in emerging markets. Our 
ELT is based in Switzerland where the Company 
is incorporated, but the majority of our senior 
management reporting to the ELT is located in 
a number of other countries. We are currently in 
the process of an internal review and mapping of 

our senior management and their ethnicity. Until 
the completion of this review and mapping we are 
not in a place to set meaningful long-term targets 
in respect of ethnic minority representation in 
senior management positions. The Board intends 
to set a target once it is in a position to do so. We 
are committed to increasing the diversity of our 
senior management population and there will be 
a number of initiatives that will be put in place over 
the coming years to support this and to ensure that 
we have the right pipeline of talent. In the future 
we will also look more closely at ethnic minority 
representation across the whole Company, not just 
at the management population, and report on this 
where appropriate.

Performance evaluation of the Board 

The Nomination Committee led the annual 
evaluation of Board and committee performance 
with the support of Lintstock, an external 
advisory firm we have worked with for the past 
eight years. Lintstock has no other connection 
to the Company or individual Directors. The 
key areas included in the assessment were: 
Board composition; stakeholder oversight; 
Board dynamics; management of meetings; 
Board support; Board committees; strategic, 
risk and people oversight; and priorities for 
change in 2024. It also took actions to address 
the recommendations from the previous (2022) 
evaluation, as summarised in the box opposite. 
The Chair will lead on the priorities identified to be 
actioned during 2024.

In addition to the annual evaluation, the Chair 
met with Directors throughout the year to receive 
feedback on the functioning of the Board and 
its committees, boardroom dynamics and the 
Group’s strategy. Particular focus is given to areas 
where a Director believes the performance of 
the Board and its committees could be improved. 

The independent Directors met separately 
at every Board meeting to discuss a variety of 
issues, including the effectiveness of the Board. 
An evaluation of each Director (other than the 
Chair) was conducted by the Chair and the Senior 
Independent Director. The Senior Independent 
Director leads the evaluation of the Chair in 
conjunction with the NEDs, considering the views 
of the CEO, and, as a matter of practice, meets 
with the other independent NEDs when each 
Board meeting is held to discuss issues together, 
without the CEO or other NEDs present. The Chair 
also holds meetings with the NEDs without the 
CEO present.

A robust, independent 
methodology
The first stage of the review involved 
Lintstock engaging with the Company 
Secretary and the Nomination 
Committee to set the context for 
the evaluation, and to tailor survey 
content to the specific circumstances 
of the Company. The surveys were 
designed to follow up on and further 
explore key themes identified in 
last year’s evaluation, so that year-
on-year progress can be tracked. 
The anonymity of all responses was 
guaranteed throughout the process to 
promote open and honest feedback. 
Lintstock subsequently analysed 
the results and delivered reports on 
the performance of the Board, the 
committees and the Chair, which 
were considered at a subsequent 
Board meeting. The results of the 
review were positive overall, and the 
Board was felt to have performed 
effectively and maintained a strong 
working dynamic. Priority areas 
for 2024 were identified and for 
the Board to focus on: (a) ESG and 
sustainability; (b) closely monitoring 
Emerging markets performance and 
strategy; (c) attracting, developing and 
retaining talent; (d) risk assessment 
and mitigation, and closely monitoring 
macro, geopolitical and currency 
risks; (e) strategic oversight and 
supporting management in achieving 
the 2025 Growth Story targets; and (f) 
technology and digital, including 
cyber security.

Dear Stakeholder
Two decades ago, our Company published its first 
Corporate Social Responsibility Report with the 
ambition of a ‘Journey to World Class’. Since 
then, we have been integrating the aspects of 
sustainability, including the environmental and social 
pillars, in our business strategy, in our decision-
making process and in our long-term goals. Our 
current sustainability commitments, Mission 2025, 
are approaching their target year and we proudly 
report that our progress there is significant. 

In 2023, the Social Responsibility Committee 
continued its focus on the implementation of the 
Mission 2025 sustainability commitments and the 
overall integration of sustainability in the business 
strategy, with a core focus on net zero performance 
and Pack Mix of the Future scenarios and initiatives, 
which not only help our business to decarbonise, 
but also contribute to a litter-free world and support 
sustainability agenda for our customers. The 
Committee reviewed the proposed solutions of 
returnable glass bottles and packageless beverages, 
the pilot testing of Freestyle Compact® machines 
and approach to reusable vessels, the pilot of LitePac 
Top in Austria (from shrink film to cardboard holder 
for family packs multipacks), the results of KeelClip™ 
roll-out (cardboard holder for cans multipacks) 
across 22 countries, scenarios for increasing of 
the rPET content in our markets, and initiatives 
for post-consumer collection, including plans for 
Deposit Return Schemes (DRS). We monitored 
the development of the different ESG regulations 
but also the ESG reporting regulations that will 
be mandated to medium and large companies.

We are very proud of the bold progress in every 
business unit in relation to our NetZeroby40 
roadmap, such as renewable energy initiatives, 
energy-efficient coolers, supplier engagement, 
and to water stewardship projects in water 
risk areas.

In 2023, the Company was again named 
by the Dow Jones Sustainability Index as a 
leader, with the highest S&P Global Corporate 
Sustainability Assessment score in the Beverage 
industry, which is the seventh time we have

highest scores and rankings in ten of the most-
recognised ESG ratings (DJSI, CDP Climate and 
Water, MSCI ESG, ISS ESG, V.E., Sustainalytics

During the year we reviewed the high-level 
activities of the capital investments related 
to sustainability, sustainability communication 
strategy, and the capability programme prepared 
for different levels in our organisation aiming 
to build sustainability knowledge in a tailored, 
engaging and simple way. Going forward in 2024, 
the Committee will ensure that the business 
strategy is fully aligned with the Company’s ESG 
agenda and that the Company continues to 
create value for employees, communities, society 
and the environment. 2024 will be the year when 
we are planning to publish our new set of bold, 
industry leading sustainability targets in the areas 
material for our stakeholders, for our business, 
for society, and for the environment. Biodiversity, 
water community projects, the requirements of 
the CSRD, initiatives to support the Company’s 
Packaging Mix of the Future journey, human rights, 
our social agenda and impact, ESG programmes 
for our suppliers, and customer partnerships 
in sustainability, will be among the focus areas

The Audit and Risk Committee was responsible for 
the review of the 2023 Integrated Annual Report 
including the consolidated financial statements and 
associated reports and information. The Committee 
received assurances from management and details 
on the processes underlying the preparation of 
published financial information. 

Following evaluation of all available information, 
the Audit and Risk Committee concluded and 
advised the Board that the 2023 Integrated 
Annual Report including the Consolidated financial 
statements is fair, balanced and understandable. 
Finally, the Board receives and reviews a report 
from the Audit and Risk Committee on its 
activities and discussions at the Board meeting 
following each Audit and Risk Committee meeting.

Areas of key significance in the 
preparation of the financial statements 
The Audit and Risk Committee considered 
a number of areas of key significance in the 
preparation of the financial statements in 2023, 
including the following:

•  appropriateness of critical accounting 

judgements and estimates that affect the 
reported amounts of assets, liabilities, revenues 
and expenses, and the disclosure of contingent 
assets and liabilities in the consolidated financial 
statements (detailed in Notes 5,14,16,22 and 
30 to the consolidated financial statements), 
identified by management

•  review of the trading environment and resilience 
of the Group’s business in light of the conflict 
between Russia and Ukraine and strategic 
actions implemented to mitigate risks and 
restructure business operations;

• 

 review of the annual impairment testing of 
goodwill and other indefinite lived intangible 
assets testing performed by management and 
reviewed by the external auditor under IAS 36 
as well as the related sensitivity analysis with 
confirmation that management had undertaken 
a robust impairment testing process, relying 
on both internal information, and other publicly 
available metrics to perform their assessment; 

•  review key assumptions for specific countries, 
challenging management drivers of relevant 
deviations and performance to date, as well as 
countries WACC rates development vs prior year;

•  review of the contingencies, legal proceedings, 
competition law and regulatory procedures, 
including cases involving the national competition 
authorities of Greece and litigation matters 
in Nigeria and Greece, and the impact of these 
on the consolidated financial statements and 
accompanying notes;

External auditor
PricewaterhouseCoopers AG, Birchstrasse 160, 
CH 8050 Zurich, Switzerland (‘PwC AG’) has been 
elected by the shareholders as the statutory 
auditor for the Group’s statutory consolidated 
and standalone financial statements. The signing 
partner, for the first year, for the statutory financial 
statements on behalf of PwC AG is Patrick Balkanyi, 
for the year ended 31 December 2023. The Board, 
at the recommendation of the Audit and Risk 
Committee, has retained PricewaterhouseCoopers 
S.A., 260 Kifissias Avenue – 15232 Halandri, Greece 
(‘PwC S.A.’), an affiliate of PwC AG, to act as the 
Group’s independent registered public accounting 
firm for the purposes of reporting under the UK rules 

for the year ended 31 December 2023. For the third 
year, the signing partner, the financial statements 
(for the year ended 31 December 2023) on behalf 
of PwC S.A. is Fotis Smyrnis.

The appointment of PwC S.A. has also been 
approved by the shareholders until the next AGM 
by way of advisory vote for UK purposes. ‘PwC’ 
refers to PwC AG or PwC S.A., as applicable, in this 
Annual Report.

During the accounting period, the members of 
the Audit and Risk Committee met on a regular 
basis with the appointed PwC signing partners, 
both with and without management being present. 
This provided the Audit and Risk Committee with 
an opportunity for open dialogue, to question 
and be satisfied as to the quality of the audit 
work performed by PwC and challenge PwC’s 
professional scepticism. During the meetings, the 
appointed PwC signing partners demonstrated 
their understanding of the Group’s business risks 
and the consequential impact on the financial 
statement risks, especially around areas of key 
significance in the preparation of the financial 
statements including but not limited to the 
trading environment and resilience of the Group’s 
business in light of the challenging macroeconomic 
conditions, the annual impairment testing, 
contingencies and legal proceedings including 
taxes. The Audit and Risk Committee took an 
active role in reviewing the scope of the audit, the 
independence, objectivity and effectiveness of 
PwC, and the negotiations relating to audit fees. 
The Audit and Risk Committee also met with the 
management team, which led the discussions 
with PwC, including the Head of Corporate Audit, 
to review the performance of PwC without PwC 
being present. Following this review process, the 
Audit and Risk Committee has recommended to 
the Board that (i) a proposal to reappoint PwC AG 
be put to a shareholders’ vote and (ii) a proposal 
to reappoint PwC S.A. be put to a shareholders’ 
advisory vote at the next AGM.

PwC has acted as the Group’s principal external 
auditor since 2003. The Company ran a competitive 
tender for the external auditor services in 2015 which 
was overseen by the Audit and Risk Committee. 
Following the evaluation of the proposals, the Audit 
and Risk Committee concluded in 2015 that the 
best interests of the Group and its shareholders 
would be served by reappointing PwC as external 
auditor and made such recommendation to the 
Board. PwC was reappointed by the Board as the 
Group’s external auditor on 11 December 2015 with 
effect from the financial year 2017. Currently, the 
Audit and Risk Committee anticipates that the audit 
contract will be put out to tender again in 2025 for 
audit services with effect from financial year 2027, 
ensuring stability and quality of the audit process. 
The Company as a Swiss company is not subject 
to mandatory auditor rotation rules in the EU or UK 
but understands the requirements. There are no 
contractual or other obligations restricting the 
Group’s choice of external auditor.

Non-audit services provided by the 
external auditor
The Audit and Risk Committee considers the 
independence, in both fact and appearance, of 
the external auditor as critical and has long had an 
auditor independence policy providing definitions 
of the services that the external auditor may 
and may not provide. In line with the relevant 
FRC Guidance, the policy requires the Audit and 
Risk Committee’s pre-approval of all audit and 
permissible non-audit services provided by the 
external auditor, and only for matters that are 
clearly trivial to the Company. Such services include 
audit, work directly related to audit, and certain tax 
and other services as further explained below. In 
practice, the Audit and Risk Committee applies the 
policy restrictively, and approval for work other than 
audit and audit-related services is rarely granted.

Under the policy, pre-approval may be provided 
for work associated with: statutory or other 
financial audit work under IFRS or according to 
local statutory requirements; attestation services 
not required by statute or regulation; accounting 
and financial reporting consultation and research 
work necessary to comply with generally accepted 
accounting and auditing standards; internal control 
reviews and assistance with internal control 
reporting requirements; review of information 
systems security and controls; tax compliance 
and related tax services, excluding any tax services 
prohibited by regulatory or other oversight 
authorities; expatriates’ and other individual 
tax services; and assistance and consultation 
on questions raised by regulatory agencies.

For each proposed service, the external 
auditor is required to provide detailed back-up 
documentation at the time of approval to permit 
the Audit and Risk Committee to decide whether 
the provision of such services would impair the 
external auditor’s independence.

PwC has complied with the policy for the financial 
year ended on 31 December 2023.

Audit fees and all other fees
Audit fees: The fees for audit services to PwC and 
affiliates were approximately €5.3 million for the 
year ended 31 December 2023 (2022: €5.1 million). 
The audit fees for 2023 include fees associated 
with the annual audit and review of the Group’s 
half year report, prepared in accordance with IFRS, 
as well as local statutory audits. Fees for audit 
services to firms other than PwC and affiliates 
were €0.6 million for the year ended 31 December 
2023 (2022: €0.7 million).

Audit-related fees: Fees for audit-related 
services to PwC and affiliates for the year 
ended 31 December 2023 were €1.0 million 
(2022: €1.1 million).

All other fees: Fees to PwC and affiliates for non 
audit services for the year ended 31 December

Risk management
During 2023, the Company continued to revise 
and strengthen its approach to risk management 
as described in detail on pages 86 to 112. The 
primary aim of this framework is to minimise 
our exposure and ensure that the nature and 
significance of all risks we are facing are properly 
identified, reviewed, managed and, where 
necessary, escalated. Risk assessments are 
conducted and discussed at monthly Senior 
Leadership Team meetings in all our business 
units. These assessments are reviewed by 
regional management teams and the Chief 
Risk Officer twice a year. In addition, corporate 
functions conduct broader risk assessments 
across the business with the Chief Risk Officer 
bi-annually.

The Company’s Group Risk and Compliance 
Committee reviews the emerging as well as the 
identified risks biannually and the emerging and 
material risks along with mitigating actions are 
presented by the Chief Risk Officer to ELT and 
the Audit and Risk Committee. This process is 
both top-down and bottom-up and is designed to 
ensure that risks arising from business activities 
are appropriately managed.

The Audit and Risk Committee confirms that the 
risk management and internal control systems 
have been in place for the year under review 
and up to the approval of the annual report 
and accounts. Finally, the Company has in place 
third-party insurance to cover residual insurable 
risk exposure such as property damage, business 
interruption, cyber risks and liability protection, 
including Directors’ and officers’ insurance for 
our Directors and officers.

Internal control
The Board has ultimate responsibility for ensuring 
that the Company has adequate systems of 
financial reporting control. Systems of financial 
reporting control can provide only reasonable 
and not absolute assurance against material 
misstatements or loss. In certain of the countries 
in which we operate, our businesses are exposed to 
a heightened risk of loss due to fraud and criminal 
activity. We review our systems of financial control 
regularly to minimise such losses.

Internal audit
Our internal audit function reports directly to 
the Audit and Risk Committee, which reviews and 
approves the internal audit plan for each year. The 
internal audit function consists of approximately 
40 full-time professional audit staff mainly based 
in Athens, Sofia, and Lagos, covering a range of 
disciplines and business expertise. One of the 
responsibilities of the internal audit function is 
to provide risk-based and objective assurance to 
the Board as to whether the Group’s framework 
of risk management, including internal control 
framework, is operating effectively. For this 
purpose, the Head of Corporate Audit makes 
quarterly presentations to the Audit and Risk 
Committee and meets regularly with the Audit 
and Risk Committee without the presence of 
our management. In addition, the internal audit 
function reviews the internal financial, operational 
and compliance control systems across all the 
jurisdictions in which we operate and reports its 
findings to management and the Audit and Risk 
Committee on a regular basis. 

The internal audit function focuses its work on 
the areas of greatest risk to us, as determined 
by a risk-based approach to audit planning. 
As part of our commitment to maintaining 
and strengthening best practice in corporate 
governance matters, we also consistently seek to 
enhance our internal control environment and risk 
management capability. The internal audit function 

carries out work across the Group, providing 
independent assurance, advice and insight to 
help the organisation accomplish its objectives 
by bringing a systematic, disciplined approach to 
evaluating and improving the effectiveness of risk 
management, control and governance processes. 
In December 2023, the Audit and Risk Committee 
agreed the FY24 audit plan to be undertaken by 
the internal audit team. The audit plan coverage is 
based on risk, strategic priorities and consideration 
of the strength of the control environment. The 
internal audit function prepares audit reports 
and recommendations following each audit, and 
appropriate measures are then taken to ensure that 
all recommendations are implemented. Significant 
issues, if any, are raised at once. There were no 
such issues in 2023.

The Board has adopted a chart of authority, 
defining financial and other authorisation limits 
and setting procedures for approving capital and 
investment expenditure. The Board also approves 
detailed annual budgets. It subsequently reviews 
quarterly performance against targets set forth 
in these plans and budgets. A key focus of the 
financial management strategy is the protection 
of our earnings stream and management of 
our cash flow. Our internal audit function has 
conducted an annual review of the effectiveness 
of our risk management system and internal 
control systems in accordance with the UK 
Corporate Governance Code. 

The review included bi-annual reviews with 
the Chief Risk Officer on the operation of the 
enterprise risk management program, regular 
review of our financial operations and compliance 
controls and consideration of the Company’s 
principal risks. Part of this review involves regular 
review of our financial, operational and compliance 
controls, following which we report back to the 
Board on our work and findings as described 
above. This allowed us to provide positive 
assurance to the Board to assist it in making 
the statements that our risk management and 

internal control systems are effective, as required 
by the UK Corporate Governance Code. Further 
information is set out on page 123.

The key features of the Group’s internal control 
systems that ensure the accuracy and reliability of 
financial reporting include: clearly defined lines of 
accountability and delegation of authority; policies 
and procedures that cover financial planning and 
reporting; preparation of monthly management 
accounts; and review of the disclosures within 
the Annual Report from function heads to ensure 
that the disclosures made appropriately reflect 
the developments within the Group in the year 
and meet the requirement of being fair, balanced 
and understandable.

The Audit and Risk Committee reviews the 
results of the internal audit reports during each 
meeting, focusing on the key observations of 
any reports where processes and controls require 
improvement. The Audit and Risk Committee was 
also provided with updates on the remediation 
status of management actions of internal audit 
findings and on the internal audit quality assurance 
and improvement programme at each meeting.

A particular focus during 2023 was the robustness 
of the internal control systems and processes 
around risk management, in light of the conflict 
between Russia and Ukraine. 

The Audit and Risk Committee was kept informed 
of any changes or adaptations to ensure full 
functionality as the Company continued to operate 
under the circumstances and uncertainties of the 
conflict between Russia and Ukraine.

The Group CFO, the Country General Managers and 
Country CFOs have access to the implementation 
status of the recommendations at all times. 
Where internal or external circumstances give 
rise to an increased level of risk, the audit plan is 
modified accordingly.

Nevertheless, no significant cases occurred this 
year. Any changes to the agreed audit plan are 
presented to and agreed by the Audit and Risk 
Committee. A compliance audit was conducted in 
our operations in Russia and Belarus at the end 
of 2023.

Cyber security and Anti-money 
laundering
There were no significant cyber security incidents 
in the last five years. For further details as to the 
identification of cyber security as a principal risk 
see page 96. In addition, there were no money 
laundering incidents to report.

Business conduct and anti-bribery
We seek to grow our business by serving 
customers and consumers and conduct all 
business activities with integrity and respect. 
The Board is responsible for ensuring appropriate 
procedures and processes are in place to enable 
our workforce to raise any issues of concern 
and is satisfied that the processes in place are 
appropriate. The Board maintains zero tolerance 
regarding breaches of our Code of Business 
Conduct and anti-bribery policies, as well as any 
attempts to retaliate against our people who 
report potential violations. We have mandatory 
training for all our people, including our ELT, so 
that everyone understands our Code of Business 
Conduct, and we hold additional targeted anti-
bribery training for employees working in areas 
we assess as high risk. 

A Code of Business Conduct and Anti-Bribery 
Policy course is available on-line to all employees 
and includes a knowledge test, acknowledgement, 
and re-commitment to compliance with the Code 
and its related policies. At the end of the last 
training wave in 2021, 26,319 employees passed 
the course, which was 97.7% of the total active 
population. Since then, we continued to train 
every newly hired employee. In 2023 we trained 

5,798 employees, including 994 employees in the 
Egypt BU. As in the past, this training will continue 
to be a regular requirement for all employees, 
with a refresher requirement every three years. 

In 2023, our communication plan on compliance 
included several initiatives to continue raising 
awareness on business ethics among our people, 
like our annual Ethics and Compliance Week was 
rolled out across our business units. We have also 
an established anti-bribery due diligence process 
for third parties who have contact with public 
authorities on behalf of our Company.

For further information please see the Anti-Bribery 
Policy and Code of Business Conduct in the 
Company’s website under coca-colahellenic.com/
en/about-us/corporate-governance/policies. 

Whistleblowing
We have established grievance mechanisms, 
including an independently operated 
whistleblower ‘Speak Up! line’, available 
in all CCHBC countries in local languages to 
ensure any concerns can be raised. In 2023, 
we investigated 640 allegations (2022: 589) 
of which 422 (2022: 324) were received through 
the ‘Speak Up Hotline’. All allegations involving 
potential Code of Business Conduct violations 
were investigated in accordance with the Group 
Code of Business Conduct Handling Guidelines. 
Of those investigated, 164 (2022: 219) matters 
were substantiated as code violations of which 
18 (2022: 20) involved an employee in a managerial 
position or involved a loss greater than €10,000. 
For details concerning the handling of allegations 
received in 2023, see our website. You can find 
more on allegations investigated and violations 
uncovered in our GRI index. 

Through the ‘Speak Up! line’, we receive, retain, 
investigate and act on employee, officer, 
consultant, intern, secondee or agent of the 
Company’s complaints or concerns regarding 

accounting, internal control, suspected 
fraudulent conduct, corrupt conduct, violation 
of any applicable antitrust and competition law 
rules, violation of personal data protection and 
company system security rules, endangerment 
of an individual’s or individuals’ health and safety, 
endangerment of the environment, commission 
of a criminal offence, failure to comply with any 
legal or regulatory obligation, and concealment 
of any information pertaining to any of the above, 
or other ethical matters. 

This includes any matters regarding the 
circumvention or attempted circumvention of 
internal controls, including matters that would 
constitute a violation of our Code of Business 
Conduct and related policies or matters involving 
fraudulent behaviour by officers or employees 
of the Group. Individuals can report all such 
allegations, complaints or concerns in local 
languages, also directly to their Ethics and 
Compliance Officer, General Manager, Function 
Head, the Senior Audit Manager – COBC & 
Compliance, the Head of Corporate Audit, 
or our General Counsel. 

All communications received directly by the 
above Company’s representatives or through 
the Speak Up! line are kept confidential and, where 
requested, anonymous. The Head of Corporate 
Audit liaises regularly with the General Counsel 
and communicates all significant allegations 
to the Chair of the Audit and Risk Committee. 
All matters received via the Speak Up! line or 
any other reporting mechanism are thoroughly 
investigated. The Audit and Risk Committee 
receives summary reports of escalated incidents 
and instances of whistleblowing together with the 
status of investigations and, where appropriate, 
management actions to remedy issues identified. 
The Committee reports to the Board on such 
matters, which reviews and considers those 
reports at least bi-annually as appropriate.

Disclosure Committee
A Disclosure Committee has been established, 
and disclosure controls and procedures have 
been adopted to ensure the accuracy and 
completeness of our public disclosures. The 
Disclosure Committee is composed of the Group 
CFO, the General Counsel, the Head of Investor 
Relations and the Group Financial Controller.

Performance reporting
Reports on our annual performance and 
prospects are presented in the Annual Report 
following recommendation by the Audit and 
Risk Committee. In line with UK practice, we 
have adopted half-year and full-year reports, 
and Q1 and Q3 trading updates. Internally, 
our financial results and key performance 
indicators are reviewed by the ELT on a monthly 
basis. This information includes comparisons 
against business plans, forecasts and prior-year 
performance. The Board of Directors receives 
updates on performance at each Board meeting, 
as well as a monthly report on our business and 
financial performance.

Directors’ remuneration report
Letter from the Chair of the Remuneration Committee

Opening up opportunities 
for our people”

Directors’ remuneration report continued
Letter from the Chair of the Remuneration Committee continued

The Group’s remuneration philosophy and policies 
are designed to attract, motivate and retain the 
talented people we need to meet our strategic 
objectives and to give them due recognition.

Coca-Cola HBC AG is domiciled in Switzerland 
and we have a primary listing on the London Stock 
Exchange. We therefore ensure that we adhere 
to UK regulations and best practice, except 
where these conflict with Swiss law, which takes 
precedence. We receive regular updates from our 
remuneration advisers on UK best practice and 
market trends, and we also ensure we are current 
with pay trends in our markets, reflecting our 
geographic footprint and international peers.

This year, there were no significant changes in 
regulation and the format of this year’s Directors’ 
remuneration report is consistent with last 
year. As always, I welcome your feedback and 
suggestions regarding anything we can do to 
improve the report. 

The Remuneration Committee continues to 
focus on ensuring that the remuneration policy 
remains fair, transparent and competitive, and 
that the approach to remuneration contributes 
to driving our growth strategy and long-term 
sustainable performance.

Remuneration in context 
2023 was a third year of double-digit growth and 
record profits. As presented in our full-year results, 
focused execution of our 24/7 strategy delivered 
strong performance, with organic revenue up 
16.9%. We continued to deliver volume growth, 
share gains and record levels of free cash flow. 
The strength of our 24/7 portfolio, our ongoing 
commitment to develop bespoke capabilities, 
and our diversified country footprint, are the 
foundations which support our continuous growth.

Despite the challenging macroeconomic and 
geopolitical environment, we continued with 
integrating our Egypt acquisition and we made 
significant progress towards our Mission 2025 and 
NetZeroby40 goals. In addition, we continue to 
explore new ways to invest in our future with our 
€100k Start-Up Challenge, now in its second year, 
opening up opportunities to discover innovations 
from across the start-up ecosystem, which are 
aligned to the business priorities. Sustainability 
is integrated within every aspect of our business, 
creating and sharing value for all our stakeholders. 
We are proud to make a strong contribution to 
developing the societies in which we operate 
through employment and our wider supply 
chain, as well as through supporting community 
projects. Our progress is recognised by the 
most important ESG benchmarks, such as being 
ranked as the world’s most sustainable beverage 
company for the seventh time by Dow Jones 
Sustainability Indices 2023, MSCI ESG rating 
of AAA, and CDP Climate and Water of A rating 
for both categories, amongst others. 

Our key financial highlights include:

•  organic revenue up 16.9% and reported revenue 

up 10.7%; 

•  organic revenue per case up 15.0%, reflecting 
the benefits of revenue growth management 
initiatives throughout the year;

•  comparable EBIT up 16.6% to €1,083.8 million, 
with organic EBIT up 17.7%, principally driven 
by organic growth across our markets, only 
partially offset by negative foreign currency 
movements; 

•  comparable EPS up 21.8%;
•  another year delivering record free cash 

flow, with free cash flow increased by 10.3% 
to €711.8 million, largely reflecting higher 
operating profit; and

•  proposed ordinary dividend of €0.93 per share, 

up 19.2% year on year and representing a 
45% payout.

Stakeholder experience 
Our shareholders 
Shareholder engagement
As detailed in last year’s remuneration report, 
to recognise the performance of the Group and 
the contribution of the Chief Executive Officer 
(CEO) since appointment, the Committee took 
the decision to apply a one-off increase in the 
CEO’s Performance Share Plan (PSP) award 
to 450% of salary. 

Whilst the proposed increase was within the 
remuneration policy limits and was designed 
to reward the CEO for the delivery of our 2025 
Growth Story Commitments, the Committee 
recognised that there were significant minority 
votes against Resolutions 7 and 9, the advisory 
votes to approve the UK remuneration report and 
the Swiss statutory remuneration report. Each 
was passed with the support of 68.39% of the 
votes cast. I understand and acknowledge the 
significance of this outcome.

Ahead of the change being proposed, the 
Committee actively engaged with shareholders 
on the challenges it faced in operating the 
current remuneration policy within the current 
macroeconomic environment to ensure it struck 
the right balance in incentivising and rewarding 
management for strong performance, whilst 
adhering to best practice. 

Following the AGM, I consulted with investors to 
understand the level of support received on the 
remuneration report. The key pieces of feedback 
received centred on (i) the one-off increase in 
the PSP opportunity for the CEO, where some 
shareholders felt that, although within the policy 
limits, the circumstances were not extraordinary 
and therefore did not justify the increased 
opportunity; and (ii) windfall gains related 
to the PSP award vesting in the year. 

During 2023, we therefore continued our 
engagement programme, actively engaging with 
38 shareholders as well as proxy advisers. We held 
meetings with ten of our largest shareholders 
who had accepted our invitation to meet. This 
group collectively owned approximately 60% 
of our shares. Typically, these were positive and 
constructive discussions, and we are grateful for 
the ongoing dialogue.

The Committee recognises the feedback from 
shareholders. As a Committee and in consultation 
with the Chair, we actively considered alternative 
approaches to implement the remuneration policy, 
which balanced UK governance expectations whilst 
ensuring that the remuneration policy recognised 
the performance of the executive team and drove 
delivery of our future growth strategy. 

Reflecting on the feedback received from 
investors, the Committee agreed that, for 
2024, the PSP award limit would revert to the 
normal policy level (330% of salary), and no 
material one-off decisions would be made on the 
implementation of the policy. We recognise that, 
over the past few AGMs, remuneration-related 
resolutions have received a significant minority 
of votes against. As detailed further on in my 
letter, the Committee intends to undertake a 
review of the remuneration policy over the course 
of 2024 and consider whether it remains fit for 
purpose or whether more substantive changes 
are required going forward. If any material changes 
are proposed, the Committee is committed 
to actively engage with all stakeholders ahead 
of the 2025 AGM. 

I would like to thank our shareholders for taking 
the time to meet with me in 2023 and provide 
their feedback on the approach to Executive 
Director remuneration as well as the important 
topic of our approach to the wider workforce 
and our stakeholders.

Letter from the Chair of the Remuneration Committee continued

Shareholder experience
Regarding the experience of our shareholders, 
a dividend of €0.78 per share was distributed 
in 2023, and a dividend of €0.93 per share is 
proposed for 2024, up 19.2% year on year. 
We remain committed to making progressive 
dividend payments in the future. And in line 
with the Group’s capital allocation framework, 
in November, the Board approved a share 
buyback programme aimed at returning up 
to €400 million to shareholders. 

Our employees
The Committee receives regular updates on our 
active employee engagement activities. During 
this sustained period of uncertainty and high 
inflation, our people have continued to exhibit 
resilience, commitment and passion for what 
they do, which is evident with the continued 
high employee engagement scores at 86%, one 
percentage point higher than 2023. To ensure 
we are remaining market competitive when 
remunerating our workforce, we continued to 
review various data sources on market pay, and 
provided ad hoc increases in addition to the annual 
increase in many of our markets, ensuring that 
our talent and our frontline employees are the 
focus of these additional increases. This emphasis 
on performance and market competitiveness is 
consistent with the reward philosophy we seek 
across all levels of our workforce. 

In addition to reviewing pay practices, benefits 
and wellbeing remain a priority, and in 2023 we 
organised a mental health awareness session 
focusing on resilience and stress management. 
We also conducted a session on financial 
wellbeing, with valuable insights and strategies 
to manage financial pressures. The Committee 
continues to provide strong oversight on our 
rewards practices, ensuring remuneration for 
our wider workforce remains competitive and 
fit for purpose in 2024.

As the Director responsible for Workforce 
Engagement, I attend the work councils’ meetings 
to gather insights from representatives across 
the Company. During 2023, meetings included 
discussion on workforce concern about inflation 
and its impact. The Company’s decision to provide 
one-off bonuses provided at the end of 2023, 
to help alleviate higher cost of living, was well 
received by the workforce. As in previous years, 
I interacted directly with the representatives 
to get their wider insights, which I took back 
to the Committee for discussion and to share 
with the Board. 

As in prior years, we supported humanitarian 
efforts for colleagues and communities impacted 
by war or natural disaster, alongside the Coca-
Cola System partners and the Ukrainian Red 
Cross. In December 2023, we also announced 
the establishment of a charitable foundation 
dedicated to supporting local communities 
where we operate.

We continued our efforts to build an inclusive 
workplace and a diverse workforce to reflect our 
customer base and communities. Our strategy 
starts from retention, complemented by external 
hiring, to create a gender-balanced organisation, 
and we’ve committed to have at least 50% of 
manager positions held by women by 2025. The 
entire Executive Leadership Team volunteered to 
sponsor participants of our Women in Leadership 
programme, acting as sponsors offering 
assistance in navigating common career barriers.

Base salary arrangements
The Committee considered a number of 
factors when reviewing the base salary of the 
CEO in 2023. This included: consideration of 
our wider workforce experience (there was an 
average 7.3% salary increase across the Group) 
market data against the FTSE 100 and broader 
international FMCG peer group; and overall 
business performance. Balancing these factors, 
we approved a 6.3% increase effective 1 May 2023.

Incentive outcomes 
The Committee’s role includes incentivising strong 
business performance and appropriately rewarding 
contributions to the Company’s long-term 
success. The Committee has reviewed the policy-
based outcomes under the annual Management 
Incentive Plan (MIP) and the PSP.

Against recent headwinds of high, albeit tempering 
inflation in Europe, continued war in Ukraine and 
Russia, a bank note crisis and significant currency 
devaluation in Nigeria, and a temporarily weaker 
market in Egypt, the Company outperformed 
against both expectations and the prior year.

MIP
As per the prior year, the Committee agreed it 
was appropriate to remove the impact of Russia 
and Ukraine both in the targets and performance 
of the business, given the ongoing war. The 
outcome reflects record levels of revenue, 
comparable EBIT and free cash flow, which the 
2023 MIP was based on, against a challenging 
backdrop when set.

The formulaic MIP outcome for the CEO 
was 76% of the maximum opportunity, with 
both the performance targets and actual 
performance determined.

When determining performance, the Committee 
took into account the strong results and business 
context highlighted above, including the handling 
of the challenges posed by the Russia-Ukraine 
war, overall exceptional business performance, 
increased engagement of our employees and 
overall progress towards our sustainability 
goals. Taking this performance in the round, the 
Committee determined that this outcome is a 
fair reflection of wider performance, with 50% 
of the MIP payout being deferred into shares 
for three years, ensuring further shareholder 
alignment. Details of the targets, performance 
against them and the plan outcomes are set out 
on pages 177 to 178.

PSP
Reflecting exceptional longer-term performance 
over the three years ending 2023, the Group 
exceeded both the maximum targets for EPS 
and ROIC under the 2021-23 PSP. This was our 
first year where the plan also included reduction 
of CO2 emissions as a third performance metric. 
Following the notification from the third party 
(IFEU, an institute preferred by TCCC as the 
source on material emissions factor change), 
and in line with GHG Protocol guidance a 
recalculation of the base year 2017 onwards was 
triggered in 2023, and again in 2024, to reflect 
the annual release of emissions factors. Given 
the methodology change to the base year 
used for emissions data, which directly impacts 
future years, the Committee considered it 
appropriate for this change to flow through to 
the targets attached to the 2021 PSP award. 
In doing so, the Committee is confident that 
the revised targets were not materially easier 
or harder to achieve than the original targets. 
Further details are set out on pages 178 to 179.

At the time targets were set in September 2021, 
Russia and Ukraine were included while Egypt 
was excluded, and the above results reflect this.

At the end of the period, the Committee 
considered the formulaic outcome was an 
appropriate reflection of the underlying 
performance of the Group, not least factoring in 
the macroeconomic headwinds impacting key 
markets the Group operates, in and approved the 
formulaic outcome of 94% of maximum. The 2021 
PSP award was granted at a higher share price 
than the 2020 PSP award, therefore there are 
no windfall gains associated with this award.

Directors’ remuneration report continued
Letter from the Chair of the Remuneration Committee continued

Looking ahead 
Implementation of the policy in 2024
We expect average employee salary increases 
across the Company at 6.2%. It is anticipated that 
the CEO’s increase will be lower than that of the 
wider workforce. The increase will be effective 
from 1 May 2024 and will be communicated in the 
subsequent Directors’ remuneration report.

As in 2023, the 2024 MIP business performance 
will be measured based on performance 
against three KPIs: revenue (40% weighting), 
comparable EBIT (40% weighting) and free cash 
flow (20% weighting). There will be no change 
to the maximum MIP opportunity for 2024 
(140% of salary).

To achieve our growth ambitions, and to deliver 
continued financial performance that creates the 
desired returns, the Committee believes strongly 
that we must continue to retain and incentivise 
the management team in a fair manner.

The Committee intends that 2024 PSP awards 
will be made subject to the same performance 
metrics as the 2023 awards: ROIC (42.5%), 
EPS (42.5%) and reduction of CO2 emissions 
(15%). As in the prior year, the Committee has 
determined to exclude the impact of Russia and 
Ukraine from the targets of the 2024-26 plan 
in light of the continued uncertainty as a result 
of the Russia-Ukraine war. We will proceed with 
providing the individual grants for the 2024 
PSP in March, as per the usual process, with the 
maximum award for the CEO set at 330% of salary 
as in previous years and as noted above. 

The targets for the 2024 PSP award take into 
account of our business plan, market expectations 
and the wider economic and geopolitical 
environment. The change in the ROIC targets 
relative to prior years reflects the level of invested 
capital deployed, which has been impacted by 
strategic acquisitions (including the acquisition 
in Finlandia) and recent share buybacks. The 
Committee has applied the same approach to 
target setting as in previous years and believes 
that the proposed target range for ROIC and the 
other performance metrics are appropriately 
stretching relative to the business plan and 
external forecasts of performance. 

Remuneration policy going forward 
As we further embed our new purpose, the 
Remuneration Committee will continue to keep 
the policy under review, ensuring that plans and 
programmes relating to remuneration support 
the Company’s strategy and objectives, and are 
appropriately linked to shareholders’ interests.

We will continue to review the wider workforce 
remuneration arrangements with a special focus 
on our frontline workers and specifically our 
business developers’ salaries and incentives. 
We will consider the remuneration strategy for 
our workforce, ensuring it is aligned with the 
Company’s new purpose, strategies and culture. 
We will continue our journey in diversity, equity 
and inclusion (DEI) by ensuring balance in our pay 
equity practices and flexible work arrangements.

With regard to Executive Director remuneration, 
the Committee welcomes the wider debate 
that is currently being held regarding the 
overall competitiveness of remuneration 
within UK-listed businesses. 

Whilst the Remuneration Committee believes 
that the remuneration policy approved by 
shareholders at the AGM in May 2023 remains 
broadly fit for purpose, the Committee intends to 
undertake a detailed review of the remuneration 
policy that applies to our top 40 senior leaders, 
including Executive Directors, over the course of 
the year. The key objectives will be to ensure that 
the remuneration policy supports the delivery 
of the Group’s strategy and is an appropriate 
motivation and retention tool for the senior 
management team. We welcome feedback and 
we are committed to continuing engagement 
with shareholders on this important topic during 
the year.

Finally, on behalf of the Committee, I would like 
to thank our shareholders for the time taken 
to engage during the year, and I look forward to 
engaging with you further in the year ahead.

As Chair of the Committee, I hope you will support 
the remuneration-related resolutions at the AGM.

Reward strategy and objective
The objective of the Group’s remuneration philosophy is to attract, retain and motivate employees who 
are curious, agile and committed to high performance. Our reward strategy seeks to promote a growth 
mindset and reinforce desirable behaviours, ensuring that employees are fairly rewarded and that their 
individual contributions are linked to the success of the Company.

Variable pay is an important element of our reward philosophy. A significant proportion of total 
remuneration for top managers (including the CEO and the members of the Executive Leadership 
Team (ELT) is tied to the achievement of our business objectives. These objectives are defined by key 
business metrics that are consistent with our growth strategy and will deliver long-term shareholder 
value. The variable pay element increases or decreases based on the achieved business performance.

Through equity-related long-term compensation, we seek to ensure that the financial interests 
of the CEO, the members of the ELT and senior managers are aligned with those of shareholders.

All of our remuneration plans, both fixed and variable, are designed to be cost-effective, taking into 
account market practice, business performance, and individual performance and experience where 
relevant. We pay close attention to our shareholders’ views in reviewing our remuneration policy 
and programmes.

In line with the UK Corporate Governance Code, the following factors, which align well with our 
objectives, were also considered:

Clarity
Remuneration arrangements 
should be transparent and 
promote effective engagement 
with shareholders and workforce.

Simplicity
Remuneration structures should 
avoid complexity and their 
rationale and operation should 
be easy to understand.

Risk
Remuneration arrangements 
should ensure reputational 
and other risks from excessive 
rewards, and behavioural risks 
that can arise from target-based 
incentive plans, are identified 
and mitigated.

Predictability
The range of possible values 
of rewards to individual 
Directors and any other limits or 
discretions should be identified 
and explained at the time of 
approving policy.

We believe that our policy provides transparency for Executives and 
shareholders about what performance we are looking for across 
our portfolio.

The Remuneration Committee has aimed to incorporate 
simplicity and transparency into the design and delivery of our 
remuneration policy. 

We aim for disclosure of the policy and how it is implemented to 
be in a clear and succinct format.

Our remuneration arrangements for Executive Directors are 
purposefully simple, comprising fixed pay (salary, benefits, 
pension), a short-term incentive plan (the MIP) and a long-term 
incentive plan (the PSP).

The remuneration structure is simple to understand for both 
participants and shareholders and is aligned to the strategic 
priorities of the business.

The remuneration policy includes a number of points to mitigate 
potential risks:

•  There are defined limits on the maximum opportunity levels 

under incentive plans.

•  Performance targets are calibrated appropriately, ensuring 

they are adequately stretching but sustainable.

•  The Remuneration Committee considers formulaic incentive 
outcomes and determines whether to make any adjustments, 
including to take into account the experience of wider 
stakeholders such as employees and shareholders.

•  Incentive plans include provisions to allow malus and claw back 
to be applied, where appropriate. The use of deferral, holding 
periods, in-employment and post-employment shareholding 
requirements ensures that there is an alignment of interests 
between the CEO and shareholders and encourages 
sustainable performance.

We aim for our disclosure to be clear to allow shareholders to 
understand the range of potential values which may be earned under 
the remuneration arrangements. Our remuneration policy clearly 
sets out relevant limits and potential for discretion.

Proportionality
The link between individual 
awards, delivery of strategy 
and long-term performance of 
the Company should be clear. 
Outcomes should not reward 
poor performance.

We believe that the link between individual awards, the delivery 
of strategy and the long-term performance of the Company 
is clearly explained in this report and that our approach 
ensures proportionate pay outcomes that do not reward poor 
performance. A significant part of the CEO’s reward is linked 
to performance with a clear line of sight between business 
performance and the delivery of shareholder value. The 
Remuneration Committee may adjust formulaic outcomes of 
incentive arrangements if they do not appropriately align with 
performance achieved or the experience of wider stakeholders 
such as employees and shareholders.

Alignment to culture
Incentive schemes should 
drive behaviours consistent 
with Company purpose, values 
and strategy.

We want our Executives to make decisions that support the 
long-term performance and health of the business. The incentive 
arrangements and the performance measures used are strongly 
aligned to those that the Board considers when determining the 
success of the implementation of the Company’s purpose, values 
and strategy.

How we implement our reward strategy
The chart below illustrates how we put our reward strategy into practice, with the different remuneration arrangements that apply to different employee groups.

We regularly review our reward strategy to ensure it remains relevant and effective in meeting the needs of our employees, especially our frontline workers. During 2023 we provided higher increases 
to our front line workers in comparison to other employees.

Fixed pay – base salary
The base salary of the CEO is €892,900.

2024 salary increase levels for employees have not been finalized 
at the date of this report. It is anticipated that the Chief Executive 
Officer’s increase will not be higher than the increases provided for 
the wider workforce and will be effective from 1 May 2024.

Fixed pay – retirement benefits
The CEO participates in a defined benefit pension plan under Swiss law. 
Employer contributions are 15% of annual base salary.

Normal retirement age for the Chief Executive Officer’s plan is 65 
years. In case of early retirement, which is possible from the age of 58, 
the Chief Executive Officer is entitled to receive the amount accrued 
under the plan as a lump sum.

Fixed pay – other benefits
Other benefits include (but are not limited to) medical insurance, 
housing allowance, company car/allowance, cost of living adjustment, 
trip allowance, partner allowance, exchange rate protection, tax 
equalization and tax filing support and advice. Benefit levels vary each 
year depending on need.

Fixed pay – ESPP
The CEO may participate in the Company’s ESPP.

As a scheme participant, the CEO has the opportunity to invest 
a portion of his base salary and/or MIP payments in shares. The 
Company matches employee contributions on a one-to-one basis up 
to 3% of base salary and/or MIP payout.

Awards are subject to potential application of malus and 
clawback provisions.

Variable pay – MIP
The MIP consists of a maximum annual bonus opportunity of up to 
140% of base salary.

Payout is based on business performance targets and individual 
performance. The business performance element will result in an 
outcome between 0% and 200% of the target MIP and the individual 
performance element will result in an outcome of up to 100%, with 
the overall payout as a percentage of salary being based on the 
multiplication of these two figures.

For 2024, business performance will be measured based on 
performance against three KPIs: revenue (40% weighting), 
comparable EBIT (40% weighting) and free cash flow (20% weighting). 

50% of any MIP payout will be deferred into shares for a further 
three-year period. Payments are subject to potential application 
of malus and clawback provisions.

Variable pay – PSP
The PSP is an annual share award which vests after three years. For 
2024 the CEO will be granted an award of 330% of salary. For the 
award in 2024, vesting will be based on performance conditions 
measured over a three-year period against:

i. comparable EPS (42.5% weighting); 

ii. ROIC (42.5% weighting); 

iii. reduction of CO2 emissions (15% weighting).

An additional two-year holding period will apply following vesting.

Awards are subject to potential application of malus and 
clawback provisions.

Shareholding guidelines
The shareholding guidelines support the alignment with shareholders. 

The CEO’s minimum shareholding guideline is set at 300% of 
annual base salary within a five-year period and a post-employment 
shareholding requirement that applies for two years post-leaving.

Remuneration policy
Introduction
The following section (pages 166-169) sets out 
our Directors’ remuneration policy as approved 
by shareholders at the Annual General Meeting 
on 17 May 2023. No changes are being proposed 
to the policy this year.

As a Swiss-incorporated company, we are not 
required to put forward our remuneration policy 
for a shareholder vote, but we intend to do so 
voluntarily at least every three years (or when 
there are changes). We continue to endeavour 
to make sure that our disclosure complies 
with UK regulations, except where these 
conflict with Swiss law.

Policy table – Chief Executive Officer
The Company currently has a single Executive 
Director, being the CEO.

In that case, references in this section to 
the CEO should be read as being to each 
Executive Director.

Therefore, for simplicity, this section refers 
only to the CEO. This remuneration policy would, 
however, apply for any new Executive Director 
role, in the event that one was created during 
the term of this remuneration policy.

Retirement benefits

Purpose and 
link to strategy

To provide a fixed level of compensation appropriate to the requirements of the role of CEO 
and to support the attraction and retention of the talent able to deliver the Group’s strategy.

To provide competitive, cost-effective post-retirement benefits.

Operation

Salary is reviewed annually, with salary changes normally effective on 1 May each year. The 
following parameters are considered when reviewing the base salary level:

•  the CEO’s performance, skills and responsibilities;
•  economic conditions and performance trends;
•  experience of the CEO;
•  pay increases for other employees; and
•  external comparisons based on factors such as: the industry of the business, revenue, 

market capitalisation, headcount, geographical footprint, stock exchange listing (FTSE) 
and other European companies.

Malus and clawback provisions do not apply to base salary.

The CEO participates in a defined benefit pension plan. However, we have adjusted the 
pension scheme to be co-contributory, in line with the pension scheme for the wider Swiss 
workforce, for new Executive Directors’ appointments from 2020 onwards.

Normal retirement age for the CEO’s plan is 65 years. In case of early retirement, which is 
possible from the age of 58, the CEO is entitled to receive the amount accrued under the 
plan as a lump sum.

Malus and clawback provisions do not apply to retirement benefits.

Maximum 
opportunity

Whilst there is no maximum salary level, any increases awarded to the CEO will normally be 
broadly aligned with the broader employee population.

The salary increase made to the CEO may exceed the average salary increase under certain 
circumstances at the Remuneration Committee’s discretion. These circumstances may 
include: business and individual performance; material changes to the business; internal 
promotions; accrual of experience; changes to the role; or other material factors.

The contributions to the pension plan are calculated as a percentage of annual base salary 
(excluding any incentive payments or other allowance/benefits provided) based on age 
brackets as defined by Federal Swiss legislation.

This percentage is currently 15% of base salary and increases to 18% above age 55.

Performance 
metrics

Individual and business performance are key factors when determining any base salary 
changes. The annual base salary for the Chief Executive Officer is set out on page 165.

Other benefits

Purpose and 
link to strategy

To provide benefits to the CEO which are consistent with market practice.

Operation

Benefit provisions are reviewed by the Remuneration Committee which has the discretion 
to recommend the introduction of additional benefits where appropriate.

Typical provisions for the CEO include benefits related to relocation such as housing 
allowance, company car/allowance, cost of living adjustment, trip allowance, partner 
allowance, exchange rate protection, tax equalisation and tax filing support and advice. 
For all benefits, the Company will bear any income tax and social security contributions 
arising from such payments.

Malus and clawback provisions do not apply to benefits.

Maximum 
opportunity

There is no defined maximum as the cost to the Company of providing such benefits will 
vary from year to year.

Performance 
metrics

None.

ESPP 

The ESPP is an Employee Share Purchase Plan, encouraging broader share ownership, 
and is intended to align the interests of employees including the CEO with those of 
the shareholders.

This is a voluntary share purchase scheme across many of the Group’s countries. The CEO 
as a scheme participant has the opportunity to invest from 1% to 15% of his base salary 
and/or MIP payout to purchase the Company’s shares by contributing to the plan on a 
monthly basis.

The Company matches the CEO’s contributions on a one-to-one basis up to 3% of the 
employee’s base salary and/or MIP payout. Matching contributions are used to purchase 
shares one year after the purchase of shares by employees. Matching shares are 
immediately vested.

Dividends received in respect of shares held under the ESPP are used to purchase 
additional shares and are immediately vested. The CEO is eligible to participate in the 
ESPP operated by the Company on the same basis as other employees. 

Malus and clawback provisions apply. Further details may be found in the Additional notes 
to the Executive Director’s remuneration policy table section on page 171.

Maximum investment is 15% of gross base salary and MIP payout. The Company matches 
contributions up to 3% of gross base salary and MIP payout. Matching contributions 
are used to purchase shares one year after the matching. Matching shares are 
immediately vested.

The value is directly linked to the share price performance. It is therefore not affected by 
other performance criteria.

MIP 

Purpose and 
link to strategy

To support profitable growth and reward annually for contribution to business 
performance. The plan aims to promote a high-performance culture with stretching 
business and individual targets linked to our key strategies.

Maximum 
opportunity

Operation

Annual cash bonus awarded under the MIP is subject to business and individual 
performance metrics and is non-pensionable.

Performance 
metrics

The CEO’s individual objectives are regularly reviewed to ensure relevance 
to business strategy and are set and approved annually by the Chair of the 
Remuneration Committee and Chairman of the Board of Directors.

Stretching targets for business performance are set annually, based 
on the business plan of the Group as approved by the Board of Directors. 
The Remuneration Committee will determine the business performance 
metrics and weightings on an annual basis.

Performance against these targets and bonus outcomes is assessed by the 
Remuneration Committee, which may recommend an adjustment to the payout 
level where it considers the overall performance of the Company or the individual’s 
contribution warrants a higher or lower outcome.

Malus and clawback provisions apply. Further details may be found in the 
Additional notes to the Executive Director’s remuneration policy table section 
on page 171.

The CEO’s maximum MIP opportunity is set at 140% of annual base salary. The 
business performance element will result in an outcome between 0% and 200% 
of the target MIP and the individual performance element will result in an outcome 
of up to 100%, with the overall payout as a percentage of salary being based on 
the multiplication of these two figures.

Threshold, target and maximum achievement for the business performance 
element will result in an outcome as follows:

•  Threshold: 0% of base salary
•  Target: 70% of base salary
•  Maximum: 140% of base salary
•  The maximum opportunity level will therefore only pay out for both a 

stretch level of business performance and full achievement of the individual 
performance element

The MIP awards are based on business metrics linked to our business strategy. 
These may include, but are not limited to, measures of revenue, profit, profit 
margins and operating efficiencies. The weighting of individual performance 
metrics shall be determined by the Remuneration Committee around 
the beginning of the MIP performance period.

Details related to the key performance indicators can be found in the Annual 
Report on Remuneration on page 177.

Deferral of MIP

50% of any MIP award is to be deferred into shares which will be made available after 
a three-year deferral period which commences on the first day of the fiscal year in 
which the deferred share award is made. 

Deferred shares may be subject to malus and clawback (for a period of two 
years following this incentive award) to the extent deemed appropriate by the 
Remuneration Committee, in line with best practice.

PSP 

Purpose and

To align the CEO’s interests with the interests of shareholders, and increase the 
ability of the Group to attract and reward individuals with exceptional skills.

Holding  
period

Operation

The CEO is granted conditional awards of shares which vest after three years, 
subject to the achievement of performance metrics and continued service. 
Grants take place annually, normally every March.

Adjustments

Performance metrics and the associated targets are reviewed and determined 
around the beginning of each performance period to ensure that they support the 
long-term strategy and objectives of the Group and are aligned with shareholders’ 
interests. Dividends may be paid on vested shares where the performance metrics 
are achieved at the end of the three-year period.

Malus and clawback provisions apply. Further details may be found in the Additional 
notes to the Executive Director’s remuneration policy table section on page 171.

Maximum 
opportunity

Awards (normally) have a face value up to 330% of base salary.

In exceptional circumstances only, the Remuneration Committee 
has the discretion to grant awards up to 450% of base salary.

Change of 
control

Performance 
metrics

Vesting of awards is subject to the three-year Group performance metrics. For 
each award, the Remuneration Committee will determine the applicable metrics, 
weightings and target calibration making up the performance condition.

Following the end of the three-year period, the Remuneration Committee will 
determine the extent to which performance metrics have been met and, in turn, 
the level of vesting. Participants may receive vested awards in the form of shares 
or a cash equivalent.

For each performance metric, achieving threshold performance results in vesting 
of 25% of the award and maximum performance results in vesting of 100% of the 
award. There will be a straight-line vesting between these performance levels.

Performance share awards will lapse if the Remuneration Committee determines that 
the performance metrics have not been met. The Remuneration Committee will have 
discretion to reduce or negate PSP award vesting, in the case of significant adverse 
environmental, social or governance impacts regarding the Company’s activities.

Any vested award (net of shares sold to cover tax liability) is subject to a further 
two-year holding period following the end of the three-year performance period. 
During this two-year period, these beneficially owned shares are subject to a 
no-sale commitment. Any shares subject to the holding period count towards 
the shareholding requirement.

In the event of an equity restructuring, the Remuneration Committee may make 
an equitable adjustment to the terms of the performance share award by adjusting 
the number and kind of shares which have been granted or may be granted and/or 
making provision for payment of cash in respect of any outstanding performance 
share award.

Where exceptional circumstances exist such that the original targets no longer 
meet the intent at the time of grant, the Committee will have the discretion to adjust 
targets in a manner that is considered to be no less stretching than the original 
performance condition. Where any such adjustment is made, the details will be fully 
disclosed in the following remuneration report.

In the event of change of control, unvested performance share awards held 
by participants vest immediately on a pro-rated basis if the Remuneration 
Committee determines that the performance metrics have been satisfied or 
would have been likely to be satisfied at the end of the performance period, unless 
the Remuneration Committee determines that substitute performance share 
awards may be used in place of the previous awards. For vested shares subject to 
the additional holding period, the holding period will lapse and the participants are 
no longer subject to the no-sale commitment.

Employee Stock Option Plan (ESOP)
The ESOP was replaced by the PSP in 2015 and 
the last grant under the ESOP took place in 
December 2014. Although the Remuneration 
Committee does not intend to award under the 
ESOP going forward, there are still outstanding 
stock option awards which may be exercised in 
future years. Awards vest in one third increments 
each year for three years and can be exercised for 
up to ten years from the date of the award.

Malus and clawback provision for variable 
pay plans
The MIP, PSP, ESOP and ESPP plans include 
malus provisions which give the Remuneration 
Committee and/or the Board discretion to judge 
that an award should lapse wholly or partly in event 
of a material misstatement of financial results 
and/or misconduct, significant reputational risk 
and corporate failure.

The Remuneration Committee and/or Board also 
has the discretion to determine that clawback 
should be applied to awards under the MIP, PSP, 
ESOP and ESPP plans for the CEO and members 
of the ELT. Clawback can potentially be applied to 
payments or vested awards for up to a two-year 
period following payment or vesting.

Shareholding guidelines
In order to strengthen the link with shareholders’ 
interests, the CEO is required to hold shares in 
the Company equal in value to 300% of annual 
base salary. Members of the ELT are required 
to hold 100% of annual base salary. The CEO 
has five years from appointment to accumulate 
shares equal to 300% of annual base salary 
(with shares acquired from PSP awards and 
shares resulting from the deferral of the 50% 
of the MIP counting towards fulfilment of the 
shareholding requirement). 

The Committee continues to review the potential 
need for stronger shareholding requirements in 
the long term and this is subject to further review 
in the future.

The Policy contains a post-employment 
shareholding requirement whereby the CEO 
would, if leaving the Company, be required to 
hold shares equivalent to 200% of base salary 
(or actual shareholding at termination date if 
lower than this) for a period of two years after 
leaving employment.

Remuneration arrangements across the Group
The remuneration approach for the CEO, the 
members of the ELT and senior management 
is similar. The CEO’s total remuneration has a 
significantly higher proportion of variable pay 
in comparison with the rest of our employees. 
The CEO’s remuneration will increase or decrease 
in line with business performance, aligning it with 
shareholders’ interests.

The structure of the remuneration package 
for the wider employee population takes into 
account local market practice and is intended to 
attract and retain the right talent, be competitive 
and remunerate employees for promoting a 
growth mindset while contributing to the Group’s 
performance. As part of the Performance for 
Growth framework introduced in 2019, we revised 
and updated the remuneration framework with 
features such as each business unit having more 
flexibility on target positioning, managers having 
the flexibility to retain key talent, and guidance 
provided for increased awards for high-potential 
and/or exceptional performance.

Policy table – non-Executive Directors

Base fees

Purpose and 
link to strategy

To provide a fixed level of compensation appropriate to the requirements of 
the role of non-Executive Director and to attract and retain high-quality non-
Executive Directors with the right talent, values and skills necessary to provide 
oversight and support to management to grow the business, support the 
Company’s strategic framework and maximise shareholder value.

Operation

Non-Executive Directors’ fees are set at a level that will not call into question 
the objectivity of the Board. When considering market levels, comparable 
companies typically include those in the FTSE index with similar positioning as 
the Company, other Swiss companies with similar market capitalisation and/or 
revenues, and other relevant European listed companies.

Maximum 
opportunity

Fee levels for non-Executive Directors include an annual fixed fee plus additional 
fees for membership of Board committees when applicable. The fees as at 1 
January 2024 are set out below:

•  Base Chairman’s fee: €150,000
•  Base non-Executive Director’s fee: €82,000
•  Senior Independent Director’s fee: €18,000
•  Audit and Risk Committee Chair fee: €32,000
•  Audit and Risk Committee member fee: €16,000
•  Remuneration, Nomination and Social Responsibility Committee Chair 

fees: €13,000

•  Remuneration, Nomination and Social Responsibility Committee member 

fees: €6,500

Fee levels are subject to periodic review and approval by the Chairman of the 
Board and the CEO.

Other benefits

Non-Executive Directors do not receive any benefits in cash or in kind. They 
are not entitled to severance payments in the event of termination of their 
appointment. They are entitled to reimbursement of all reasonable expenses 
incurred in the interests of the Group.

Variable 
remuneration

Non-Executive Directors do not receive any form of variable compensation.

Legacy arrangements
For the avoidance of doubt, it is noted that 
the Company will honour any commitments 
entered into that have previously been disclosed 
to shareholders.

Policy on recruitment/appointment
Executive Directors
Annual base salary arrangements for the 
appointment of an Executive Director will be set 
considering market relevance, skills, experience, 
internal comparisons and cost. The Remuneration 
Committee may recommend an appropriate initial 
annual base salary below relevant market levels. 
In such situations, the Remuneration Committee 
may make a recommendation to realign the level 
of base salary in the following years. As highlighted 
above, annual base salary ‘gaps’ may result in 
higher rates of salary increase in the short term, 
subject to an individual’s performance. The 
discretion is retained to offer an annual base salary 
necessary to meet the individual circumstances 
of the recruited Executive Director and to enable 
the hiring of an individual with the necessary skills 
and expertise.

The maximum level of variable pay that may be 
offered will follow the rules of the MIP and is capped 
at 140% of the relevant individual’s annual base 
salary. The maximum level of equity-related pay 
that may be offered will follow the PSP rules and 
is capped at 450% of the relevant individual’s 
annual base salary. The typical award is not 
expected to surpass 330% of base salary. Different 
performance measures may be set initially for the 
annual bonus taking into consideration the point 
in the financial year that a new Executive Director 
joins. The above limits do not include the value of 
any buyout arrangements.

Benefits will be provided in line with the Group’s 
policy for other employees. If an Executive Director 
is required to relocate, benefits may be provided as 
per the Group’s international transfer policy which 
may include transfer allowance, tax equalisation, 
tax advice and support, and housing, cost of living, 
schooling, travel and relocation costs.

The Remuneration Committee may consider 
recommending the buying out of incentive awards 
that an individual would forfeit by accepting the 
appointment up to an equivalent value in shares 
or in cash. In the case of a share award, the 
Remuneration Committee may approve a grant of 
shares under the PSP. When deciding on a potential 
incentive award buyout and in particular the level 
and value thereof, the Remuneration Committee 
will be informed of the time and performance pro-
rated level of any forfeited award.

It is expected that Executive Directors appointed 
during the remuneration policy period will be 
appointed on similar notice provisions to the CEO, 
allowing for termination of office by either party on 
six months’ notice.

Non-Executive Directors
It is expected that non-Executive Directors 
appointed during the remuneration policy period 
will receive the same basic fee and, as appropriate, 
committee fee or fees as existing non-Executive 
Directors and will be entitled to reimbursement of 
all reasonable expenses incurred in the interests 
of the Group.

It is expected that non-Executive Directors 
appointed during the remuneration policy 
period will be appointed on a one-year term 
of appointment, in the same manner as existing 
non-Executive Directors.

The Company does not compensate new non-
Executive Directors for any forfeited share awards 
in previous employment.

Termination payments
The Swiss corporate law provisions regarding 
the Compensations in Listed Companies limits 
the authority of the Remuneration Committee 
and the Board to determine compensation. 
Limitations include the prohibition of certain 
types of severance compensation.

Our governance framework ensures that the 
Group uses the right channels to support reward 
decisions. In the case of early termination, the 
non-Executive Directors would be entitled to their 
fees accrued as of the date of termination, but are 
not entitled to any additional compensation. The 
CEO’s employment contract does not contain any 
provisions for payments on termination.

Notice periods are set for up to six months and 
non-compete clauses are 12 months. The notice 
period anticipates that up to six months’ paid 
garden leave may be provided. Similarly, up to 12 
months of base salary may be paid out in relation 
to the non-compete period.

In case of future terminations, payments will be 
made in accordance with the termination policy 
on page 173.

When time pro-rating is required, the

Corporate events
In the event of an equity restructuring, the Remuneration Committee may make an 
equitable adjustment to the terms of the performance share award by adjusting the number and kind 
of shares that have been granted or may be granted and/or making provision for payment of cash in 
respect of any outstanding performance share award.

In the event of a change of control, unvested performance share awards held by participants vest 
immediately on a pro-rated basis if the Remuneration Committee determines that the performance 
conditions have been satisfied or would have been likely to be satisfied at the end of the performance 
period, unless the Remuneration Committee determines that substitute performance share awards may 
be used in place of the previous awards.

The CEO’s service contract and the terms and 
conditions of appointment of the non-Executive 
Directors are available for inspection by the public 
at the registered office of the Group.

Consideration of employee views
The remuneration structure has been designed 
to apply to all Group employees, not just 
the Executive Directors, which is a material 
factor in defining and shaping the policy and 
implementation of the policy.

The Remuneration Committee does not currently 
consult specifically with employees on policy 
for the remuneration of the Directors. Pay 
movement for the wider employment group is 
considered when making pay decisions for the 
CEO. The Chair of the Remuneration Committee 
is also the designated non-Executive Director 
for workforce engagement. As such, she attends 
meetings of our European Works Council and 
meets with elected employee representatives 
from our businesses in EU countries. She then 
reports back to the Board on her observations 
and matters raised by employees, ensuring Board 
and Remuneration Committee deliberations 
and decision-making are fully informed. 
Our engagement levels continue to remain 
high at 86%.

Consideration of shareholder views
Shareholder views and the achievement of 
the Group’s overall business strategies have 
been taken into account in formulating the 
remuneration policy. Following shareholder 
feedback before and after the Annual General 
Meeting, the Remuneration Committee and the 
Board consult with shareholders and meet with 
institutional investors to gather feedback on the 
Company’s remuneration strategy and corporate 
governance. The Company will continue to 
engage with shareholders in the future to discuss 
the outcomes of the remuneration policy.

In reviewing and determining remuneration, 
the Remuneration Committee takes into account 
the following:

•  the business strategies and needs of the 

Company;

•  the views of shareholders on Group policies and 

programmes of remuneration;

•  the alignment of remuneration policy with the 

principles of clarity, simplicity, risk, predictability, 
proportionality and alignment with culture;
•  market comparisons and the positioning of the 

Group’s remuneration relative to other

•  comparable companies;
• 

input from employees regarding our 
remuneration programmes;

•  the need for similar, performance-related 

principles for the determination of executive 
remuneration and the remuneration of other 
employees; and

•  the need for objectivity. Board members, 
the CEO and ELT members play no part in 
determining their own remuneration. The 
Chair of the Remuneration Committee and the 
CEO are not present when the Remuneration 
Committee and the Board discuss matters that 
pertain to their remuneration.

This ensures that the same performance-setting 
principles are applied for Executive remuneration 
and for other employees in the organisation.

Directors’ remuneration report continued

The total cost in connection with Willis Towers 
Watson’s work was €37,702 and for Deloitte 
€101,674, invoiced on a time spent basis. Willis 
Towers Watson and Deloitte are members of 
the Remuneration Consultants Group and provide 
advice in line with its Code of Business Conduct. 
Considering this, and the level and nature of the 
service received, the Committee remains satisfied 
that the advice is objective and independent.

Annual Report on Remuneration
Introduction 
This section of the report provides detail on 
how we have implemented our remuneration 
policy in 2023 which, in accordance with the UK 
remuneration reporting regulations and alongside 
other sections of the Directors’ remuneration 
report, will be subject to an advisory shareholder 
vote at our 2024 Annual General Meeting.

The role of the Remuneration Committee 
The main responsibilities of the Remuneration 
Committee are to establish the remuneration 
strategy for the Group and to approve 
compensation packages for Directors and senior 
management. Further, the Committee reviews 
wider workforce remuneration policies at Coca-
Cola HBC and the alignment of incentives and 
rewards with strategy and culture, taking these 
into account when setting the remuneration 
policy. The Remuneration Committee operates 
under the Charter for the Committees of 
the Board of the Company set forth in Annex 
C to the Organizational Regulations of the 
Company, available on the Group’s website at:  
https://www.coca-colahellenic.com/en/about-us/ 
corporate-governance.

•  review and approve the performance 

achievement of the 2020 PSP award, number 
of shares vesting and dividend equivalents;

•  set and approve 2023 PSP targets;
•  review award levels for 2023 PSP awards;
•  review short- and long-term incentive 
arrangements for the wider workforce;
•  review the assets of the Company’s Irish 

defined benefit pension plans;

•  review pay evolution for the wider workforce, 
including actions taken to deal with inflation.

Advisers to the Remuneration Committee
The Chief People and Culture Officer, 
the Head of Rewards and the General 
Counsel regularly attend meetings of the 
Remuneration Committee.

While the Remuneration Committee does not 
have external advisers, in 2023 it authorised 
management to work with external consultancy 
firms Willis Towers Watson and Deloitte, 
which provided independent advice on ad 
hoc remuneration issues during the year. 
These services are considered to have been 
independent, objective and relevant to the 
market. Other than employee engagement 
benchmarking services, Willis Towers Watson 
does not provide any other services to the 
Company or to any individual Director, Deloitte 
provides tax advisory and payroll services to 
the Company.

2.  Cash and non-cash benefits includes the value of all benefits paid during 2023. These are outlined in the ‘Cash and non-cash benefits’ section below and include any gross-ups for the tax benefits.
3.  Annual bonus for 2023 includes the MIP payout, receivable early in 2024 for the 2023 performance year, including the amount deferred in shares. Refer to ‘MIP performance outcomes-2023’ for details.

5. 

‘Employee Share Purchase Plan’ reflects the value of Company matching share contributions under the ESPP.
 ‘Long-term incentives’ for 2023 reflects the 2021 awards made under the Performance Share Plan and the dividend equivalent shares paid on PSP shares that will vest in early 2024. The number of shares due to vest to the CEO for the 2021 award is 88,600.  
The CEO will also get 7,243 shares representing the dividend equivalents for the awarded shares for 2021, 2022 and 2023. The value reflects the number of shares multiplied by the average market price over the last three months of the financial year.
The figure will be restated in next year’s report based on the share price at vesting (as has been done for the 2020 award in the 2022 figure above). €2,404,608 total vested value of the 2021 award was decreased by €262,412 due to decrease in share price since date of grant.
‘Retirement benefits’ includes the pension plan under Swiss law. Employer contributions are 15% of annual base salary. The disclosed figure also includes risk and administration costs of €15,874

to €892,900, representing an increase of 6.3% 
effective May 2023. The average increase for our 
employees was 7.3%

Retirement benefits
Zoran Bogdanovic receives an annual retirement 
benefit of 15% of base salary, aligning to the 
retirement benefit provided under Swiss law 
and based on the age brackets defined by federal 
Swiss legislation. During the year, €148,069 of 
retirement benefit was received, inclusive of 
€15,874 for risk and administration costs.

Normal retirement age for the CEO’s plan is 65 
years. In case of early retirement, which is possible 
from the age of 58, the CEO is entitled to receive 
the amount accrued under the plan as a lump sum.

contribution related to the ESPP (€26,258 reflecting 
the maximum match of 3% under the plan).

Variable pay for 2023
MIP performance outcomes – 2023
The business performance element for the 
2023 MIP was based on the following metrics:

•  NSR, with an opportunity of 56% of salary 
for maximum performance (28% of salary 
for target performance).

•  Comparable EBIT, with an opportunity of 
56% of salary for maximum performance 
(28% of salary for target performance).
•  Free cash flow, with an opportunity level 

of 28% of salary for maximum performance 
(14% of salary for target performance).

The outcome of the business performance 
element is multiplied by the outcome for the 
individual performance element.

The CEO’s individual performance metrics were measured versus the following priorities in 2023:

Directors’ remuneration report continued

The Remuneration Committee took into account the following additional achievements during 2023.

•  Continued handling of the challenges posed by the Russia-Ukraine war and the humanitarian support 

to Ukraine during the war

•  Number one contributor to absolute revenue growth for our retail customers within fast moving 

consumer goods (FMCG) in Europe, according to Nielsen.

•  Recognised in the DJSI as leading beverage company and top scores in S&P Global 

Sustainability Yearbook.

Since the onset of the war in Ukraine, we have taken the decision to exclude Ukraine and Russia from 
both the targets as well as the actuals in calculating the payout. In addition, Finlandia, which was 
acquired in November 2023, was excluded from both the targets and actuals in calculating the payout. 
In 2023, the comparable EBIT adjustment totalled €306.4 million (2022: €237.3 million), with the 
increase principally driven by the performance improvement in Ukraine. 

The CEO’s individual financial metrics were measured as follows:

The Remuneration Committee considered the above formulaic outcome to ensure that it was both fair 
and appropriate given the wider stakeholder experience described above and the wider performance 
assessment as set out in the Remuneration Committee Chair’s letter earlier on in this report. The 
annual bonus award in respect of the 2023 financial year for the CEO was therefore €950,046 and 
106.4% of salary (76% of maximum). The Committee judged that this outcome was appropriate and 
did not apply a discretionary adjustment.

In accordance with the terms of the MIP, 50% of the award will be paid out in March 2024 and the remaining 
50% will be deferred into shares for a period of three years, subject to continued employment.

PSP awards – 2023-25
The PSP is the Company’s primary long-term incentive vehicle. In March 2023, the CEO was granted 
a performance share award of over 157,114 shares under the PSP, representing 450% of base salary at 
date of grant.

The award is subject to a three-year performance period, aligned to the Company’s financial year, with 
performance measured to the end of financial year 2025, and vesting anticipated in March 2026. These 
vested shares will then be subject to a further two-year holding period, and the CEO agrees to a no-sale 
commitment during this time.

The Committee was mindful of share price volatility at the time of grant and will retain the right 
to appropriately apply discretion to the share award outcome at the time of vesting, if the level of 
vesting and value delivered is not considered to be appropriate taking into account an assessment 
of performance.

The following table sets out the details of the performance share award made to the CEO under the 
PSP for 2023-25.

Directors’ remuneration report continued

The financial measures are key measures of business performance. The reduction in greenhouse gas 
emissions metric was selected to directly align with and incentivise delivery of the Company’s ESG 
objectives, particularly our ambitious goal to achieve net zero emissions across our entire value chain 
by 2040. The CO2 emissions target in the PSP implicitly captures reduction in plastics, which was a key 
driver of its selection as a metric. The measures and targets below were set out in the 2022 Directors’ 
remuneration report.

Measure

Description

Comparable EPS

ROIC

Reduction in CO2 
emissions

Calculated by dividing the 
comparable net profit attributable 
to the owners of the parent by 
the weighted average number 
of outstanding shares during 
the period.

ROIC is the percentage return that 
a company makes on its invested 
capital. More specifically, we 
define ROIC as the percentage 
of comparable net profit excluding 
net finance costs divided by the 
capital employed. Capital employed 
is calculated as the average of 
net debt and shareholders’ equity 
attributable to the owners of the 
parent through the year.

This target supports the Company’s 
ambitious goal to achieve net zero 
emissions across its entire value

Based on performance against the targets, the formulaic outcome was a vesting level of 94%.

The 2021 PSP award was granted at a higher share price than the 2020 PSP award therefore there are 
no windfall gains associated with this award. In light of the external challenges facing the business, the 
Committee believed that the financial outcomes achieved reflected strong performance and that the 
vesting outcome was appropriate. 

This was our first year where the plan also included reduction of CO2 emissions as a third performance 
metric. Following the notification from the third party (IFEU, an institute preferred by TCCC as the 
source on material emissions factor change) and in line with GHG Protocol guidance, a re-calculation 
of the base year 2017 onwards was triggered in 2023 and again in 2024. In 2023 the Net Zero roadmap 
was re-calculated based on latest annual release of emissions factors with an increase in absolute 
emissions by 250k MT and cascaded onwards. This also led to higher emissions decline rate year on 
year. In early 2024, the Net Zero roadmap was re-calculated based on latest annual release of emissions 
factors, which triggered an increase in absolute emissions base, starting 2017 by 95k MT and cascaded 
onwards. Given the methodology change to the base year used for emissions data, which directly 
impacts future years, the Committee considered it appropriate for this technical change to flow 
through to the targets attached to the 2021 PSP award. In doing so, the Committee was comfortable 
that the revised targets were not materially easier or harder to achieve than the original targets. It was 
determined that no adjustment would be made to the formulaic outcome. 

The above results include Russia and Ukraine but exclude Egypt as at the time that targets were set 
in September 2021. 

Dilution limit
Usage of shares under all share plans and executive share plans adheres to the dilution limits set by the 
Investment Association Principles of Remuneration (10% for all share plans and 5% for all executive 
share plans, in any ten-year period).

Implementation of policy in 2024
For 2024, we will continue to apply the remuneration policy approved by shareholders in 2023, 
as outlined on pages 166 to 169.

Directors’ remuneration report continued

Base salary and fees
2024 salary increase levels for employees have not been finalised at the date of this report. 
It is anticipated that the CEO’s increase will not be higher than the increases provided for the 
wider workforce.

The weightings will be 42.5% for ROIC, 42.5% for EPS and 15% for reduction of CO2 emissions. These 
are unchanged from 2023. 

The targets for the 2024 PSP award, exclude Russia and Ukraine, and take into account our business 
plan, market expectations and the wider economic and geopolitical environment, and are as follows:

Chairman and Board fees effective June 2022 were approved during the 2022 AGM. The fees as at 
1 January 2024 are as follows:

MIP
The MIP operates on a multiplicative basis. The outcome will be determined by business performance 
multiplied by individual performance, which means that unless the business performance targets are 
achieved no bonus will be payable.

Business performance is measured based on performance against three KPIs: revenue (40% weighting), 
comparable EBIT (40% weighting) and free cash flow (20% weighting). Targets are considered to be 
commercially sensitive but will be disclosed on a retrospective basis in next year’s remuneration report. 
For target performance against this element the outcome will be 70%, rising to 140% for maximum 
performance. For the CEO, individual performance will be assessed based on the achievement of defined 
strategic objectives. Based on the Remuneration Committee’s assessment of performance against 
these strategic objectives, the outcome for the individual performance element may be up to 100%.

The maximum opportunity level (which would reflect both a stretch level of business performance and 
full achievement of the individual strategic objectives) for the CEO will be 140% of base salary, which is 
unchanged from 2023.

PSP
The 2024 PSP award for the CEO will revert back to the normal policy maximum of 330% of salary. It 
is intended that, as in past years, the three-year performance conditions applicable to the award will 
continue to be based on ROIC and EPS as well as the reduction of CO2 emissions metric, which was first 
introduced in 2021.

Description

Calculated by dividing the comparable 
net profit attributable to the owners 
of the parent by the weighted average 
number of outstanding shares 
during the period.

ROIC is the percentage return that 
a company makes on its invested 
capital. More specifically, we 
define ROIC as the percentage 
of comparable net profit excluding 
net finance costs divided by the 
capital employed. Capital employed 
is calculated as the average of 
net debt and shareholders’ equity 
attributable to the owners of the 
parent through the year.

This target supports the Company’s 
ambitious goal to achieve net zero 
emissions across its entire value 
chain by 2040. Aligned with science 
and 1.5 degree Celsius scenarios 
and approved by the SBTi and 
calculated as thousand tonnes of 
CO2 emissions equivalent.

The change in the ROIC targets relative to prior years reflects the level of invested capital at work within 
the business, which has been impacted by strategic acquisitions (including the acquisition of Finlandia) 
and recent share buybacks. The Committee believes that the proposed target range for ROIC and 
the other performance metrics are appropriately stretching relative to the business plan and external 
forecasts of performance.

The performance period for 2024 awards will be the three years to the end of December 2026 and 
vesting will occur in March 2027. These vested shares will then be subject to a further two-year holding 
period, and the CEO agrees to a no-sale commitment during this time.

CEO pay ratio
Coca-Cola HBC is domiciled in Switzerland. We are therefore not required to report a CEO pay ratio 
under UK regulations; however, we are voluntarily disclosing ratios below. We have chosen to make 
a comparison with employees in Switzerland as this is the market in which our CEO is based.

The international nature of our business means that we operate in countries with a significant range 
in terms of market practice for levels of remuneration and cost of living.

Switzerland, for example, has a substantially higher cost of living and employment remuneration 
compared with other countries. For this reason, comparisons with our Swiss workforce are likely to be 
more informative about the pay distribution of our workforce.

The table below compares the 2023 single figure of remuneration for the CEO with that of the employees 
who are paid at the 25th percentile (lower quartile), 50th percentile (median) and 75th percentile (upper 
quartile) of the Company’s workforce based in Switzerland, ranked based on total remuneration.

We are satisfied that the pay ratios reported this year are consistent with our wider pay, reward and 
progression policies for employees.

As described on page 163, we have an overall remuneration philosophy that operates throughout the 
Group, ensuring that employees are fairly rewarded and that their individual contributions are linked 
to the success of the Company.

Variable pay is an important element of our reward philosophy and a significant proportion of total 
remuneration for top managers (including the CEO) is tied to the achievement of our business 
objectives. As employees advance through the Company, there will be the opportunity to receive 
higher rewards commensurate with increased accountability and market practice. The CEO’s total 
remuneration has a significantly higher proportion of variable pay in comparison with the rest of 
our employees. The CEO’s remuneration will therefore increase or decrease in line with business 
performance, aligning it with shareholders’ interests.

The change in the CEO Pay Ratio between 2022 and 2023 was mainly due to the substantial increase in 
the cash and non-cash benefits and long-term incentives under the variable long-term incentive plan.

Chief Executive Officer pay and performance comparison
The graph below shows the total shareholder return (TSR) of the Company compared with the 
FTSE 100 index over a ten-year period to 31 December 2023, based on an initial investment of £100. 
The Remuneration Committee believes that the FTSE 100 Index is the most appropriate index to use 
for historic performance due to the size of the Company and our listing location.

Total Shareholder Return versus FTSE 100
200

Option A has been used as it is the most robust methodology and is based on a sample of full-time 
Swiss employees as of 31 December 2023. Their pay and benefits is calculated, and every Swiss 
employee is ranked to determine P25, P50 and P75. Several Swiss employees around each percentile 
were identified to ensure that they accurately represent the relevant percentile ranking.

The methodology used to identify the lower quartile, median and upper quartile employees was to rank 
all employees of the Swiss workforce on total remuneration (for employees who were in employment for 
the full calendar year). Two employees around each percentile were identified to ensure they accurately 
represent the relevant percentile ranking. The total remuneration for each of these employees was then 
calculated consistent with the methodology applied for deriving the CEO’s single figure remuneration.

The table below sets out the total pay and benefits for the lower quartile, median and upper quartile:

Independent auditor’s report to Coca-Cola HBC AG

Our audit approach

Overview
Audit scope

• 

 Following our assessment of the risks of material misstatement of the financial 
statements, we performed full scope audit procedures on the financial 
information of 17 subsidiary undertakings in 15 countries spread across all of 
the Group’s reportable segments.

•  In addition, we conducted audit procedures around specific account balances 
and transactions including those covering the group treasury operations. The 
group engagement team also performed group level analytical procedures 
over out of scope subsidiary undertakings.

•  Taken together, the undertakings which were in scope for the purpose of 
our audit accounted for 82% of consolidated net sales revenue, 80% of 
consolidated profit before tax and 83% of consolidated total assets of the 
Group.

•  Central audit testing was performed where appropriate for reporting 

components in group audit scope that are supported by the Group’s shared 
services centres.

•  As part of the group audit supervision process, the group engagement 

team has performed reviews of the component auditors’ audit files and final 
deliverables. In person site visits to component auditors in Bulgaria, Greece, 
Italy, Poland, Romania, Serbia and Switzerland were also performed.

Key audit matters

•  Goodwill and indefinite-lived intangible assets impairment assessment.
•  Uncertain tax positions.

Materiality

•  Overall materiality: €51.0 million based on 5% of adjusted profit before tax 

(2022: €41.1 million based on 5% of adjusted profit before tax).

•  Performance materiality: €38.3 million (2022: €30.8 million)

The scope of our audit
As part of designing our audit, we determined materiality and assessed the risks of material 
misstatement in the financial statements.

Report on the audit of the consolidated financial statements

Opinion

In our opinion:

•  Coca-Cola HBC AG’s (‘Coca-Cola HBC’ or the ‘Group’) consolidated financial statements (the 

‘financial statements’) give a true and fair view of the state of the Group’s affairs as at 31 December 
2023 and of its profit and cash flows for the year then ended; and

•  the financial statements have been properly prepared in accordance with International Financial 

Reporting Standards (‘IFRSs’) as adopted by the European Union (‘EU’).

We have audited the financial statements, included within the 2023 Integrated Annual Report 
(the ‘Annual Report’), which comprise: the consolidated balance sheet as at 31 December 2023; 
the consolidated income statement, the consolidated statement of comprehensive income, the 
consolidated cash flow statement, and the consolidated statement of changes in equity for the 
year then ended; and the notes to the financial statements, comprising material accounting policy 
information and other explanatory information.

Our opinion is consistent with our reporting to the Audit & Risk Committee.

Basis for opinion

We conducted our audit in accordance with International Standards on Auditing issued by the 
International Auditing and Assurance Standards Board (‘ISAs’). Our responsibilities under ISAs are 
further described in the Auditor’s responsibilities for the audit of the financial statements section of our 
report. We believe that the audit evidence we have obtained is sufficient and appropriate to provide a 
basis for our opinion.

Independence
We remained independent of the Group in accordance with the ethical requirements that are relevant 
to our audit of the financial statements, which include the International Code of Ethics for Professional 
Accountants (including International Independence Standards) issued by the International Ethics 
Standards Board for Accountants (‘IESBA Code’), and the FRC’s Ethical Standard, as applicable to listed 
entities, and we have fulfilled our other ethical responsibilities in accordance with these requirements.

To the best of our knowledge and belief, we declare that non-audit services prohibited by the IESBA Code 
or the FRC’s Ethical Standard were not provided to the Group.

Other than those disclosed in Note 9 ‘Operating expenses’ of the financial statements, we have 
provided no non-audit services to the Group in the period from 1 January 2023 to 31 December 2023.

Key audit matters
We attended each of the eight Audit & Risk Committee meetings held during the year. Certain 
meetings involved a private discussion without management being present. We also met with the 
Chair of the Audit & Risk Committee on an ad-hoc basis. During these various conversations we 
discussed our observations on a variety of matters, for example the methodology and assumptions 
used in the Group’s impairment assessment over goodwill and indefinite-lived intangible assets, the 
judgements taken by management in assessing the risk of potentially material tax exposures, business 
combinations, the accounting implications of the ongoing challenging macroeconomic conditions, and 
regulatory developments. In September and December 2023, the Audit & Risk Committee discussed 
and challenged the audit plan. The plan included the matters which we considered presented the 
highest risk to the audit, including the key audit matters as set out below, and other information on 
our audit approach such as our approach to specific balances and transactions and where the latest 
technology would be used to obtain better quality audit evidence.

Key audit matters are those matters that, in the auditor’s professional judgement, were of most 
significance in the audit of the financial statements of the current year and include the most significant 
assessed risks of material misstatement (whether or not due to fraud) identified by the auditors, 
including those which had the greatest effect on: the overall audit strategy; the allocation of resources 
in the audit; and directing the efforts of the engagement team. These matters, and any comments 
we make on the results of our procedures thereon, were addressed in the context of our audit of the 
financial statements as a whole, and in forming our opinion thereon, and we do not provide a separate 
opinion on these matters. This is not a complete list of all risks identified by our audit.

The areas of highest risk for the Group audit and where we focused most effort and resources were 
‘Goodwill and indefinite-lived intangible assets impairment assessment’ and ‘Uncertain tax positions’. 
These areas are common with other international beverages companies.

‘Geopolitical events in Russia and Ukraine’, which was a key audit matter last year, continued to be an 
area of focus in light of the uncertainty over the macroeconomic and business environment, liquidity 
and asset values in the wider affected region. Having evaluated the developments in 2023 and to the 
date of this audit report, as well as the level of audit effort required, we assessed that ‘Geopolitical 
events in Russia and Ukraine’ is no longer considered a key audit matter. Otherwise, the key audit 
matters below are consistent with last year.

Key audit matter

How our audit addressed the key audit matter

Goodwill and indefinite-lived intangible 
assets impairment assessment
Refer to Note 14 ‘Intangible assets’.
Goodwill and indefinite-lived intangible assets 
as at 31 December 2023 amount to €1,820.8 
million and €738.2 million, respectively.

The above amounts have been allocated to 
individual cash-generating units (‘CGUs’), which 
in accordance with International Accounting 
Standard 36 ‘Impairment of Assets’ (‘IAS 36’) 
require the performance of an impairment 
assessment at least annually or whenever there 
is an indication of impairment. The impairment 
assessment involves the determination of the 
recoverable amount of the CGU, being the 
higher of the value-in-use and the fair value less 
costs of disposal.

We consider this area as a key audit matter due 
to the magnitude of goodwill and indefinite-
lived intangible assets balances and because 
the determination of whether elements of 
goodwill and of indefinite-lived intangible assets 
are impaired involves complex and subjective 
estimations made by management about the 
future results of the CGUs. These estimations 
include assumptions surrounding revenue 
growth rates, costs, foreign exchange rates and 
discount rates.

Management closely monitored the increasing 
macroeconomic uncertainty in Egypt 
throughout the previous and current year and as 
a result of the annual impairment assessment, a 
charge of €109.4 million for goodwill impairment 
was recorded for the Egyptian CGU. Relevant 
disclosure has been included in the financial 
statements in respect of this CGU.

No impairment was identified for the 
remaining CGUs.

We evaluated the appropriateness of management’s 
identification of the Group’s CGUs, the process 
by which management prepared the CGUs’ value-
in-use calculations and the design and operating 
effectiveness of related control activities.

We tested the mathematical accuracy of the CGUs’ 
value-in-use calculations and compared the cash flow 
projections included therein to the financial budgets, 
approved by the directors, covering a one-year period, 
and management’s projections for the subsequent 
four years. In addition, we assessed management’s 
past forecasting accuracy by comparing key elements 
of the prior year projections with actual results. 

We challenged management’s cash flow projections 
in relation to the assumptions applied to the value-
in-use calculations, taking into account the ongoing 
challenging macroeconomic environment in several 
countries. 

With the support of our valuation specialists, we 
assessed the appropriateness of the methodology 
and valuation techniques used as well as certain 
assumptions including discount, annual revenue growth 
and perpetuity revenue growth rates. 

We also evaluated management’s assessment of 
the potential impact of climate change risks, such as 
the cost of water, carbon emissions and exposure to 
extreme weather events. 

We performed our independent sensitivity analyses 
on the key drivers of the value-in-use calculations for 
the CGUs with significant balances of goodwill and 
indefinite-lived intangible assets.

Based on our work, we concluded that the results 
reached by management in relation to the impairment 
testing of goodwill and indefinite-lived intangible assets 
were supported by assumptions within reasonable 
ranges.

We evaluated the related disclosures provided in the 
financial statements in Note 14 ‘Intangible assets’ and 
concluded that these are appropriate.

Key audit matter

How our audit addressed the key audit matter

Uncertain tax positions
Refer to Note 11 ‘Taxation’ and Note 30 
‘Contingencies’.

The Group operates in numerous tax 
jurisdictions and is subject to periodic 
challenges, in the normal course of business, 
by local tax authorities on a range of matters 
including corporate tax, transfer pricing 
arrangements and indirect taxes. As at 31 
December 2023, the Group has provisions for 
uncertain tax positions of €82.8 million that are 
classified in current tax liabilities, current tax 
assets and deferred tax liabilities.

The impact of changes in local tax regulations 
and ongoing inspections by local tax authorities, 
could materially impact the amounts recorded 
in the financial statements.

Where the amount of tax payable is uncertain, 
the Group establishes provisions based on 
management’s estimates with respect to the 
likelihood of potential material tax exposures 
crystallising and the probable amount of the 
resultant liability.

We consider this area as a key audit matter given 
the level of judgement and uncertainty involved 
in estimating tax provisions, the complexities 
of dealing with tax rules and regulations in 
numerous jurisdictions that could materially 
impact the amounts recorded in the financial 
statements.

In order to understand and evaluate management’s 
judgement, we considered the status of current tax 
authority inspections and enquiries, the outcome 
of previous tax authority inspections, judgemental 
positions taken in tax returns and current year 
estimates as well as recent developments in the tax 
jurisdictions in which the Group operates.

We evaluated the Group’s monitoring process of the 
current tax authority inspections and challenged 
management’s estimates, particularly in respect of 
cases where there had been significant developments 
with tax authorities.

Our component audit teams, through the use of tax 
specialists with local knowledge and relevant expertise, 
assessed the tax positions taken by the subsidiary 
undertakings in scope, in the context of applying local 
tax laws and evaluating the local tax assessments. 
We read recent rulings and correspondence with tax 
authorities, as well as external advice provided by the 
Group’s tax experts and legal advisors. Additionally, with 
our group engagement team tax specialists we further 
evaluated management’s estimation of tax exposures 
and contingencies in order to assess the adequacy of 
the Group’s tax provisions and satisfy ourselves that 
the tax provisions have been appropriately recorded or 
adjusted to reflect the latest developments.

We held meetings with Group and local management 
to discuss the individual tax positions of the in-scope 
subsidiary undertakings and assessed with the support 
of our group engagement tax team the Group’s overall 
tax exposure.

From the evidence obtained we consider the provisions 
in relation to uncertain tax positions as at 31 December 
2023 to be reasonable.

We also evaluated the related disclosures provided 
in the financial statements in Note 11 ‘Taxation’ and 
Note 30 ‘Contingencies’ and concluded that these 
are appropriate.

How we tailored the audit scope
We tailored the scope of our audit to ensure that we performed sufficient work to be able to provide 
an opinion on the financial statements as a whole, taking into account the operating structure of the 
Group, the accounting processes and controls, and the industry in which the Group operates.

The Group operates through its trading subsidiary undertakings in Nigeria, Egypt and 27 countries 
in Europe, as set out in Note 1 ‘General information’ and Note 7 ‘Segmental analysis’ of the financial 
statements. The processing of the accounting records for these subsidiary undertakings is largely 
centralised in a shared services centre in Bulgaria, except for the subsidiary undertakings in Armenia, 
Belarus, Egypt, Moldova, North Macedonia, Russia and Ukraine which process their accounting records 
locally. The Group also operates centralised treasury functions in the Netherlands and in Greece and a 
centralised procurement function for key raw materials in the Netherlands.

Based on their significance to the financial statements and in light of the key audit matters as noted 
above, we identified 17 subsidiary undertakings in 15 countries spread across all of the Group’s 
reportable segments (including the significant trading subsidiary undertakings in Italy, Nigeria, 
Poland, Romania, Russia and Switzerland) which, based on our scoping analysis, required a full scope 
audit of their financial information. In addition, audit procedures were performed with respect to the 
centralised treasury functions by the group engagement team and with respect to the centralised 
procurement function by the component audit team in the Netherlands. The group engagement team 
also performed analytical review and other procedures on balances and transactions of subsidiary 
undertakings not covered by the procedures described above.

The undertakings which were in scope for the purpose of our audit accounted for 82% of consolidated 
net sales revenue, 80% of consolidated profit before tax and 83% of consolidated total assets of the 
Group. This, together with the additional procedures performed at Group level, gave us sufficient and 
appropriate audit evidence for our opinion on the financial statements.

At the planning phase of the audit process, we held a two-day audit planning workshop in Greece 
focusing on planning and risk assessment activities, fraud risk assessment, auditor independence, 
accounting and auditing developments, ESG related topics and centralised testing procedures. This 
audit planning workshop was attended by the component teams in scope for group audit purposes. 
The group engagement team was also responsible for planning, designing and overseeing the audit 
procedures performed at the shared services centre in Bulgaria. In addition, we performed work 
centrally on IT general controls and cybersecurity risks and shared audit comfort with the component 
teams. The group engagement team performed audit procedures with respect to the Group 
consolidation, financial statements disclosures and a number of other areas that involve significant 
judgement and estimates, including goodwill and intangible assets and the Group’s overall going 
concern assessment.

Independent auditor’s report to Coca-Cola HBC AG continued

We issued formal, written instructions to the component teams setting out the work to be performed 
by each of them and we were in active dialogue throughout the year with the teams that conducted 
these component audits. In addition to holding formal periodic meetings, the group engagement team 
had ongoing informal interactions with the component audit teams to be continuously updated and to 
monitor their progress and the results of their procedures. Furthermore, the group engagement team 
reviewed component auditor working papers and undertook other forms of interaction as considered 
necessary, depending on the significance of the component and the extent of accounting and audit 
issues arising. We evaluated the sufficiency of the audit evidence obtained through discussions with 
each team and a review of their audit working papers and deliverables. The senior members of the 
group engagement team performed site visits in Bulgaria, Greece, Italy, Poland, Romania, Serbia and 
Switzerland. These visits gave us an opportunity to meet with the local audit teams and management to 
discuss the business performance and outlook, regulations and taxation, and any specific accounting 
and auditing matters identified, including fraud and internal controls. Where physical attendance was 
not undertaken, we participated in the final audit meetings for the trading subsidiary undertakings in 
Egypt and Nigeria via video conference. 

The impact of climate risk on our audit
As part of our audit, we also made enquiries of management to understand the process adopted 
to assess the extent of the potential impact of climate change risk on the financial statements and 
support the disclosures made. In addition, we read the minutes of the governance processes in 
place to assess climate risk and the additional reporting made by the entity on climate. Management 
considers that climate change does not give rise to a potential material financial statement impact. 
We used our knowledge of the Group to evaluate management’s assessment, and we remained alert 
when performing our audit procedures for any indicators of the impact of climate risk. We particularly 
considered how climate change risks would impact the assumptions made in the forecasts prepared by 
management and used in their impairment analyses and going concern assessment. Our procedures 
did not identify any material impact on the financial statements for the year ended 31 December 2023. 
Whilst the Group has started to quantify some of the impacts, the future estimated financial impacts 
of climate risk are clearly uncertain given the medium to long term timeframes involved and their 
dependency on how governments, global markets, corporations and society respond to the issue of 
climate change and the speed of technological advancements that may be necessary. Accordingly, 
financial statements cannot capture all possible future outcomes as these are not yet known. Where 
climate risk relates to a key audit matter our audit response is given in the key audit matters section of 
our audit report. We considered the consistency of the disclosures in relation to climate change made 
in the other information within the annual report with the financial statements and knowledge from 
our audit. We discussed with management and the Audit & Risk Committee the ways in which climate 
change disclosures should continue to evolve as greater understanding of the actual and potential 
impacts on the Group’s business is obtained.

Materiality
The scope of our audit was influenced by our application of the concept of materiality. We set certain 
quantitative thresholds for materiality. These, together with qualitative considerations, helped us to 
determine the scope of our audit and the nature, timing and extent of our audit procedures on the 
individual financial statement line items and disclosures and to evaluate the effect of misstatements, 
both individually and in aggregate, on the financial statements as a whole. 

Based on our professional judgement, we determined materiality for the financial statements as a 
whole, as follows:

Overall group materiality

€51.0 million (2022: €41.1 million).

How we determined it

5% of adjusted profit before tax

This benchmark has not changed compared to the prior year.

Rationale for benchmark applied We consider that the income statement remains the principal 
measure used by the shareholders in assessing the underlying 
performance of the Group. Therefore, an approach to materiality 
based on 5% of profit before tax has been applied. However, we have 
adjusted this benchmark by items which, in our view, are considered 
unusual and infrequently occurring in nature such as the impairment 
charges. Therefore, we have used adjusted profit before tax which is 
a generally accepted auditing benchmark. 

For each component in the scope of our group audit, we allocated a materiality that is less than our 
overall group materiality. The range of materiality allocated across components was from €3.5 million 
to €30.0 million. 

When planning the audit, we considered if multiple uncorrected and undetected misstatements may 
exist which, when aggregated, could exceed our overall materiality level. In order to reduce the risk 
of multiple misstatements which could aggregate to this amount to an appropriately low level, we 
used a lower level of materiality, known as performance materiality. Specifically, we use performance 
materiality in determining the scope of our audit and the nature and extent of our testing of account 
balances, classes of transactions and disclosures, for example in determining sample sizes. Our 
performance materiality was 75% of overall materiality, amounting to €38.3 million (2022: €30.8 million).

In determining the performance materiality, we considered a number of factors – the history of 
misstatements, risk assessment and aggregation risk and the effectiveness of controls – and 
concluded that an amount at the upper end of our normal range was appropriate.

Where the audit identified any items that were not reflected appropriately in the financial information, 
we considered these items carefully to assess if they were individually or in aggregate material. We 
agreed with the Audit & Risk Committee that we would report to them misstatements identified 
exceeding €2.5 million (2022: €2.0 million) as well as misstatements below that amount that, in our view, 
warranted reporting for qualitative reasons.

Conclusions relating to going concern

Reporting on other information 

Our evaluation of the directors’ assessment of the Group’s ability to continue to adopt the going 
concern basis of accounting included:

•  Verification that the cash flow projections used in the goodwill impairment, going concern and 

viability assessments were consistent;

•  Review of management’s assessment supporting the Group’s ability to continue to adopt the going 
concern basis of accounting, ensuring that appropriate severe but plausible downside scenarios, 
including those relating to climate change, the geopolitical events involving Russia and Ukraine and 
the tensions in the Middle East, were considered;

•  Assessment of the reasonableness of management’s assumptions used in the cash flow projections;
•  Testing of the mathematical integrity of the cash flow forecasts and reconciliation with the Board 

approved budget and management’s projections for the subsequent periods;

•  Evaluation of the Group’s liquidity for the period under assessment by considering the Group’s 

available cash resources, committed undrawn credit facilities and other debt instruments in place 
as well as the maturity profile of the Group’s debt. We confirmed the outstanding amounts of the 
financing facilities and verified their nature, terms and conditions;

•  Consideration of whether climate change is expected to have any significant impact during the 

period of the going concern assessment; and

•  Evaluation of the appropriateness of the related disclosures provided in the financial statements in 

Note 2 ‘Basis of preparation and consolidation’.

Based on the work performed, we have not identified any material uncertainties relating to events or 
conditions that, individually or collectively, may cast significant doubt on the Group’s ability to continue 
as a going concern for a period of at least twelve months from when the financial statements are 
authorised for issue.

In auditing the financial statements, we have concluded that the directors’ use of the going concern 
basis of accounting in the preparation of the financial statements is appropriate. However, because not 
all future events or conditions can be predicted, this conclusion is not a guarantee as to the Group’s 
ability to continue as a going concern.

In relation to the Group’s reporting on how they have applied the UK Corporate Governance Code, we 
have nothing material to add or draw attention to in relation to the directors’ statement in the financial 
statements about whether the directors considered it appropriate to adopt the going concern basis 
of accounting.

Our responsibilities and the responsibilities of the directors with respect to going concern are 
described in the relevant sections of this report.

The other information comprises all of the information in the Annual Report other than the financial 
statements, our auditor’s report thereon and the Swiss statutory reporting, which we obtained prior to 
the date of this auditor’s report. The directors are responsible for the other information. Our opinion 
on the financial statements does not cover the other information and, accordingly, we do not express 
an audit opinion or, except to the extent otherwise explicitly stated in this report, any form of assurance 
thereon.

In connection with our audit of the financial statements, our responsibility is to read the other 
information and, in doing so, consider whether the other information is materially inconsistent 
with the financial statements or our knowledge obtained in the audit, or otherwise appears to be 
materially misstated. If we identify an apparent material inconsistency or material misstatement, 
we are required to perform procedures to conclude whether there is a material misstatement of the 
financial statements or a material misstatement of the other information. If, based on the work we have 
performed, we conclude that there is a material misstatement of this other information, we are required 
to report that fact. We have nothing to report based on these responsibilities.

Corporate governance statement

The Listing Rules require us to review the directors’ statements in relation to going concern, longer-
term viability and that part of the corporate governance statement relating to the Group’s compliance 
with the provisions of the UK Corporate Governance Code specified for our review. Our additional 
responsibilities with respect to the corporate governance statement as other information, are 
described in the Reporting on other information section of this report.

Based on the work undertaken as part of our audit, we have concluded that each of the following 
elements of the corporate governance statement is materially consistent with the financial statements 
and our knowledge obtained during the audit, and we have nothing material to add or draw attention to 
in relation to:

•  The directors’ confirmation that they have carried out a robust assessment of the emerging and 

principal risks;

•  The disclosures in the Annual Report that describe those principal risks, what procedures are in place 

to identify emerging risks and an explanation of how these are being managed or mitigated;

•  The directors’ statement in the financial statements about whether they considered it appropriate 
to adopt the going concern basis of accounting in preparing them, and their identification of any 
material uncertainties relating to the Group’s ability to continue to do so over a period of at least 
twelve months from the date of approval of the financial statements;

•  The directors’ explanation as to their assessment of the Group’s prospects, the period this 

assessment covers and why the period is appropriate; and

•  The directors’ statement as to whether they have a reasonable expectation that the Group will be 

able to continue in operation and meet its liabilities as they fall due over the period of its assessment, 
including any related disclosures drawing attention to any necessary qualifications or assumptions.

Independent auditor’s report to Coca-Cola HBC AG continued

Our review of the directors’ statement regarding the longer-term viability of the Group was 
substantially less in scope than an audit and only consisted of making inquiries and considering the 
directors’ process supporting their statement; checking that the statement is in alignment with the 
relevant provisions of the UK Corporate Governance Code; and considering whether the statement is 
consistent with the financial statements and our knowledge and understanding of the Group and its 
environment obtained in the course of the audit.

In addition, based on the work undertaken as part of our audit, we have concluded that each of the 
following elements of the corporate governance statement is materially consistent with the financial 
statements and our knowledge obtained during the audit:

•  The directors’ statement that they consider the Annual Report, taken as a whole, is fair, balanced and 
understandable, and provides the information necessary for the members to assess the Group’s 
position, performance, business model and strategy;

•  The section of the Annual Report that describes the review of effectiveness of risk management and 

internal control systems; and

•  The section of the Annual Report describing the work of the Audit & Risk Committee.

We have nothing to report in respect of our responsibility to report when the directors’ statement 
relating to the Group’s compliance with the Code does not properly disclose a departure from a 
relevant provision of the Code specified under the Listing Rules for review by the auditors.

Responsibilities for the financial statements and the audit

Responsibilities of the directors for the financial statements
As explained more fully in the Statement of Directors’ Responsibilities in the Annual Report, the 
directors are responsible for the preparation of the financial statements in accordance with the 
applicable framework and for being satisfied that they give a true and fair view. The directors are also 
responsible for such internal control as they determine is necessary to enable the preparation of 
financial statements that are free from material misstatement, whether due to fraud or error.

In preparing the financial statements, the directors are responsible for assessing the Group’s ability to 
continue as a going concern, disclosing as applicable matters related to going concern and using the 
going concern basis of accounting unless the directors either intend to liquidate the Group or to cease 
operations, or have no realistic alternative but to do so.

Auditor’s responsibilities for the audit of the financial statements
Our objectives are to obtain reasonable assurance about whether the financial statements as a whole 
are free from material misstatement, whether due to fraud or error, and to issue an auditor’s report 
that includes our opinion. Reasonable assurance is a high level of assurance, but is not a guarantee 
that an audit conducted in accordance with ISAs will always detect a material misstatement when it 
exists. Misstatements can arise from fraud or error and are considered material if, individually or in the 
aggregate, they could reasonably be expected to influence the economic decisions of users taken on 
the basis of these financial statements.

Irregularities, including fraud, are instances of non-compliance with laws and regulations. We design 
procedures in line with our responsibilities, outlined above, to detect material misstatements in 
respect of irregularities, including fraud. The extent to which our procedures are capable of detecting 
irregularities, including fraud, is detailed below.

Based on our understanding of the Group and the industry in which it operates, we considered the 
extent to which non-compliance with applicable laws and regulations may have a material effect on the 
financial statements, including, but not limited to, the corporate regulations arising from its listings on 
the London Stock Exchange and Athens Exchange, tax laws and regulations applicable to Coca-Cola 
HBC and its subsidiaries and regulations relating to unethical and prohibited business practices. We 
evaluated management’s incentives and opportunities for fraudulent manipulation of the financial 
statements (including the risk of override of controls), and where management made subjective 
judgements in respect of significant accounting estimates that involved making assumptions and 
considering future events that are inherently uncertain. The group engagement team shared this risk 
assessment with the component auditors so that they could include appropriate audit procedures in 
response to such risks in their work. Audit procedures performed by the group engagement team 
and/or component auditors included among others:

•  Inquiries of management, internal audit, internal legal counsel, management’s experts and external 
legal advisors, where relevant, including consideration of known or suspected instances of non-
compliance with laws and regulation and fraud;

•  Evaluation and testing of the operating effectiveness of management’s controls designed to prevent 

and detect irregularities;

•  Assessment of matters reported on the Group’s whistleblowing helpline and the results of 

management’s investigation of such matters;

•  Reading the minutes of Board meetings to identify any inconsistencies with other information 

provided by management;

•  Challenging assumptions and judgements made by management in significant accounting 

estimates, in particular in relation to the key audit matters;

•  Inspecting correspondence with legal advisors and internal audit reports in so far as they related to 

the financial statements; and

•  Identifying and testing journal entries, in particular any entries posted with unusual account 
combinations, journal entries posted by senior management and consolidation entries.

There are inherent limitations in the audit procedures described above. We are less likely to become 
aware of instances of non-compliance with laws and regulations that are not closely related to events 
and transactions reflected in the financial statements. Also, the risk of not detecting a material 
misstatement due to fraud is higher than the risk of not detecting one resulting from error, as fraud may 
involve deliberate concealment by, for example, forgery or intentional misrepresentations, or through 
collusion.

Independent auditor’s report to Coca-Cola HBC AG continued

Our audit testing might include testing complete populations of certain transactions and balances, 
possibly using data auditing techniques. However, it typically involves selecting a limited number of 
items for testing, rather than testing complete populations. We will often seek to target particular items 
for testing based on their size or risk characteristics. In other cases, we will use audit sampling to enable 
us to draw a conclusion about the population from which the sample is selected.

As part of an audit in accordance with ISAs, we exercise professional judgement and maintain 
professional scepticism throughout the audit. We also:

•  Identify and assess the risks of material misstatement of the financial statements, whether due 
to fraud or error, design and perform audit procedures responsive to those risks, and obtain 
audit evidence that is sufficient and appropriate to provide a basis for our opinion. The risk of not 
detecting a material misstatement resulting from fraud is higher than for one resulting from error, 
as fraud may involve collusion, forgery, intentional omissions, misrepresentations, or the override of 
internal control. 

•  Obtain an understanding of internal control relevant to the audit in order to design audit procedures 
that are appropriate in the circumstances, but not for the purpose of expressing an opinion on the 
effectiveness of the Group’s internal control. 

•  Evaluate the appropriateness of accounting policies used and the reasonableness of accounting 

estimates and related disclosures made by management.

We also provide those charged with governance with a statement that we have complied with relevant 
ethical requirements regarding independence and communicate with them all relationships and 
other matters that may reasonably be thought to bear on our independence, and where applicable, 
related safeguards. 

From the matters communicated with those charged with governance, we determine those matters 
that were of most significance in the audit of the financial statements of the current year and are 
therefore the key audit matters. We describe these matters in our auditor’s report unless law or 
regulation precludes public disclosure about the matter or when, in extremely rare circumstances, 
we determine that a matter should not be communicated in our report because the adverse 
consequences of doing so would reasonably be expected to outweigh the public interest benefits of 
such communication.

Use of this report
This report, including the opinions, has been prepared for and only for Coca-Cola HBC AG for the 
purpose of compliance with the Disclosure Guidance and Transparency Rules sourcebook and the 
Listing Rules of the FCA and for no other purpose. We do not, in giving these opinions, accept or 
assume responsibility for any other purpose or to any other person to whom this report is shown or 
into whose hands it may come, save where expressly agreed by our prior consent in writing. 

•  Conclude on the appropriateness of management’s use of the going concern basis of accounting 

Other required reporting

and, based on the audit evidence obtained, whether a material uncertainty exists related to events or 
conditions that may cast significant doubt on the Group’s ability to continue as a going concern. If we 
conclude that a material uncertainty exists, we are required to draw attention in our auditor’s report 
to the related disclosures in the financial statements or, if such disclosures are inadequate, to modify 
our opinion. Our conclusions are based on the audit evidence obtained up to the date of our auditor’s 
report. However, future events or conditions may cause the Group to cease to continue as a going 
concern. 

•  Evaluate the overall presentation, structure and content of the financial statements, including the 

disclosures, and whether the financial statements represent the underlying transactions and events 
in a manner that achieves fair presentation.

•  Obtain sufficient appropriate audit evidence regarding the financial information of the entities 

or business activities within the Group to express an opinion on the financial statements. We are 
responsible for the direction, supervision and performance of the group audit. We remain solely 
responsible for our audit opinion. 

We communicate with those charged with governance regarding, among other matters, the planned 
scope and timing of the audit and significant audit findings, including any significant deficiencies in 
internal control that we identify during our audit. Those charged with governance are responsible for 
overseeing the Group’s financial reporting process.

Appointment
We have been the Group’s auditors since 2003 and following a tender process that the Group 
conducted in 2015, at the recommendation of the Audit & Risk Committee, we were reappointed by the 
directors on 11 December 2015 to audit the financial statements for the year ended 31 December 2017 
and subsequent financial periods. 

Assurance Report on the European Single Electronic Format pursuant to the Athens Exchange 
listing requirements
We have examined the digital files of Coca-Cola HBC, which were compiled in accordance with the 
European Single Electronic Format (ESEF) defined by the Commission Delegated Regulation (EU) 
2019/815, as amended by Regulation (EU) 2020/1989 (hereinafter ‘ESEF Regulation’), and which 
include the consolidated financial statements of the Group for the year ended 31 December 2023, 
in XHTML format 549300EFP3TNG7JGVE49-2023-12-31-en.xhtml, as well as the provided XBRL file 
549300EFP3TNG7JGVE49-2023-12-31-en.zip with the appropriate marking up, on the aforementioned 
consolidated financial statements, including the other explanatory information (notes to the financial 
statements).

Regulatory framework 
The digital files of the European Single Electronic Format are compiled in accordance with ESEF 
Regulation and 2020 / C 379/01 Interpretative Communication of the European Commission of 
10 November 2020, as provided by the Greek Law 3556/2007 and the relevant announcements of 
the Hellenic Capital Market Commission and the Athens Exchange (‘ESEF Regulatory Framework’).

In summary, this Framework includes the following requirements: 

Conclusion 
Based on the procedures performed and the evidence obtained, we conclude that the 
consolidated financial statements of the Group for the year ended 31 December 2023, in XHTML 
file format 549300EFP3TNG7JGVE49-2023-12-31-en.xhtml, as well as the provided XBRL file 
549300EFP3TNG7JGVE49-2023-12-31-en.zip with the appropriate marking up, on the aforementioned 
consolidated financial statements, including the other explanatory information, have been prepared, in 
all material respects, in accordance with the requirements of the ESEF Regulatory Framework.

•  All annual financial reports should be prepared in XHTML format. 
•  For consolidated financial statements in accordance with International Financial Reporting 

Other matters

Standards, the financial information stated in the consolidated balance sheet, the consolidated 
income statement, the consolidated statement of comprehensive income, the consolidated 
cash flow statement and the consolidated statement of changes in equity, as well as the financial 
information included in the other explanatory information, should be marked-up with XBRL ‘tags’ 
and ‘block tag’, according to the ESEF Taxonomy, as in force. The technical specifications for ESEF, 
including the relevant classification, are set out in the ESEF Regulatory Technical Standards. 

The requirements set out in the current ESEF Regulatory Framework are suitable criteria for 
formulating a reasonable assurance conclusion. 

Responsibilities of the management and those charged with governance 
Management is responsible for the preparation and submission of the consolidated financial 
statements of the Group, for the year ended 31 December 2023 in accordance with the requirements 
set by the ESEF Regulatory Framework, as well as for those internal controls that management 
determines as necessary, to enable the compilation of digital files free of material error due to either 
fraud or error. 

Auditor’s responsibilities
Our responsibility is to plan and carry out this assurance work, in accordance with no. 214/4 / 11.02.2022 
Decision of the Board of Directors of the Hellenic Accounting and Auditing Standards Oversight Board 
(HAASOB) and the ‘Guidelines in relation to the work and the assurance report of the Certified Public 
Accountants on the European Single Electronic Format (ESEF) of issuers with securities listed on a 
regulated market in Greece’ as issued by the Board of Certified Auditors on 14/02/2022 (hereinafter 
‘ESEF Guidelines’), providing reasonable assurance that the consolidated financial statements of the 
Group prepared by management in accordance with ESEF comply in all material respects with the 
applicable ESEF Regulatory Framework. 

Our work was carried out in accordance with the Code of Ethics for Professional Accountants of the 
International Ethics Standard Board for Accountants (IESBA Code). 

The assurance work we conducted is limited to the procedures provided by the ESEF Guidelines 
and was carried out in accordance with International Standard on Assurance Engagements 3000, 
‘Assurance Engagements other than Audits or Reviews of Historical Financial Information’. Reasonable 
assurance is a high level of assurance, but it is not a guarantee that this work will always detect a material 
misstatement regarding non-compliance with the requirements of the ESEF Regulation. 

Swiss statutory reporting requirements
PwC Switzerland has reported separately on the Group and Company financial statements of Coca-
Cola HBC AG for the year ended 31 December 2023 for Swiss statutory purposes. The reports are 
available in pages 266 and 270.

ESEF Regulatory Technical Standard pursuant to the London Stock Exchange listing requirements
As required by the Financial Conduct Authority Disclosure Guidance and Transparency Rule 4.1.14R, 
these financial statements form part of the ESEF-prepared annual financial report filed on the National 
Storage Mechanism of the Financial Conduct Authority in accordance with the ESEF Regulatory 
Technical Standard (‘ESEF RTS’). This auditors’ report provides no assurance over whether the annual 
financial report has been prepared using the single electronic format specified in the ESEF RTS which 
may differ from the ESEF as defined in section ‘Other required reporting’ above.

Notes to the consolidated financial statements

1. General information

Coca-Cola HBC AG and its subsidiaries (the ‘Group’ or ‘Coca-Cola HBC’ or ‘the Company’) are 
principally engaged in the production, sales and distribution of primarily non-alcoholic ready-to-drink 
beverages, under franchise from The Coca-Cola Company, across Nigeria, Egypt and 26 countries 
in Europe, while in Russia the Group operates under a business model focusing on local brands. 
Information on the Group’s operations by segment is included in Note 7.

On 11 October 2012, Coca-Cola HBC, a Swiss stock corporation (Aktiengesellschaft/Société 
Anonyme) incorporated by Kar-Tess Holding (a related party of the Group, refer to Note 28), announced 
a voluntary share exchange offer to acquire all outstanding ordinary registered shares and all 
American depositary shares of Coca-Cola Hellenic Bottling Company S.A. As a result of the successful 
completion of this offer, on 25 April 2013, Coca-Cola HBC acquired 96.85% of the issued Coca-Cola 
Hellenic Bottling Company S.A. shares, including shares represented by American depositary shares, 
and became the new parent company of the Group. On 17 June 2013, Coca-Cola HBC completed its 
statutory buyout of the remaining shares of Coca-Cola Hellenic Bottling Company S.A. that it did not 
acquire upon completion of its voluntary share exchange offer. Consequently, Coca-Cola HBC acquired 
100% of Coca-Cola Hellenic Bottling Company S.A. which was eventually delisted from the Athens 
Exchange, from the London Stock Exchange where it had a secondary listing and from the New York 
Stock Exchange where American depositary shares were listed.

The shares of Coca-Cola HBC started trading in the premium segment of the London Stock Exchange 
(Ticker symbol: CCH) and on the Athens Exchange (Ticker symbol: EEE) and regular way trading in 
Coca-Cola HBC American depositary shares commenced on the New York Stock Exchange (Ticker 
symbol: CCH) on 29 April 2013. On 24 July 2014, the Group proceeded to the delisting of its American 
depositary shares from the New York Stock Exchange and terminated its reporting obligations under 
the US Securities Exchange Act of 1934. The deregistration of Coca-Cola HBC shares under the US 
Securities Exchange Act of 1934 and the termination of its reporting obligations became effective on 3 
November 2014.

2. Basis of preparation and consolidation

Basis of preparation
The consolidated financial statements of the Group have been prepared in accordance with 
International Financial Reporting Standards (‘IFRS’) as adopted by the European Union (‘EU’) and in 
compliance with Swiss law. 

These consolidated financial statements were approved for issue by the Board of Directors on 14 March 
2024 and are expected to be verified at the Annual General Meeting to be held on 21 May 2024.

Going concern
The financial statements have been prepared on a going concern basis. In adopting the going concern 
basis for the preparation of these consolidated financial statements, management has considered 
the Group’s financial performance in the year and overall financial position, the Group’s quantitative 
viability exercise linked to its principal risks, including those relating to climate change, the geopolitical 
events involving Russia and Ukraine, and the tensions in the Middle East. Management has reviewed the 
Group’s financial forecasts and funding requirements with consideration given to the potential impact 
of severe but plausible downside scenarios. Even under these scenarios, the Group’s cash position is 
still expected to remain strong over the period of the financial forecasts, considering also that there 
are mitigating actions the Group could take, should they be required, by making adjustments to its 
operating plans within the normal course of business.

After assessing the Group’s current strong balance sheet and liquidity position, its committed funding 
facilities and financial forecasts, management confirms the Group’s ability to generate cash for a period 
of 12 months from the date of approval of these consolidated financial statements and beyond. 

Therefore, it is deemed appropriate that the Group continues to adopt the going concern basis 
for the preparation of the consolidated financial statements under the historical cost convention, 
as modified by the revaluation of financial assets at fair value through profit or loss, investments 
in equity instruments classified at fair value through other comprehensive income and derivative 
financial instruments.

Basis of consolidation
Subsidiary undertakings are those companies over which the Group, directly or indirectly, has control. 
The Group controls an entity when the Group is exposed to, or has rights to, variable returns from its 
involvement with the entity and has the ability to affect those returns through power over the entity. 
Subsidiary undertakings are consolidated from the date on which control is transferred to the Group 
and cease to be consolidated from the date on which control is transferred out of the Group. The 
subsidiaries’ accounting policies are consistent with policies adopted by the Group. All inter-company 
transactions and balances between Group companies are eliminated on consolidation.

Transactions with non-controlling interests that do not result in loss of control are accounted for as 
equity transactions – that is, as transactions with the owners in their capacity as owners. The difference 
between fair value of any consideration paid and the relevant acquired share of the carrying value of net 
assets of the subsidiary is recorded in equity.

When the Group ceases to have control over a subsidiary, it derecognises the related assets and 
liabilities, non-controlling interests and any other components of equity, while any resulting gain or loss 
is recognised in the income statement. Any retained interest in the former subsidiary is remeasured 
to its fair value at the date when such control is lost, with the change in carrying amount recognised in 
the income statement. The fair value is the initial carrying amount for the purposes of subsequently 
accounting for the retained interest as an associate, joint venture or financial asset. In addition, any 
amounts previously recognised in other comprehensive income in respect of that entity are accounted 
for as if the Group had directly disposed of the related assets or liabilities. This means that amounts 
previously recognised in other comprehensive income, if any, are reclassified to the income statement.

3. Foreign currency and translation

4. Accounting pronouncements 

The individual financial statements of each Group entity are presented in the currency of the primary 
economic environment in which the entity operates (its functional currency). For the purposes of the 
consolidated financial statements, the results and financial position of each entity are expressed in 
Euro, which is the presentation currency for the consolidated financial statements. 

a) Accounting pronouncements adopted in 2023
The Group has adopted the following standards and amendments to standards which were endorsed 
by the EU, that are relevant to its operations and effective for accounting periods beginning on 
1 January 2023:

The assets and liabilities of foreign subsidiaries are translated into Euro at the exchange rates prevailing 
at the balance sheet date. The results of foreign subsidiaries are translated into Euro using the average 
monthly exchange rates, being a reasonable approximation of the rates prevailing on the transaction 
dates. The exchange differences arising on translation are recognised in other comprehensive income. 

On disposal of a foreign entity, accumulated exchange differences are recognised as a component of 
the gain or loss on disposal.

Transactions in foreign currencies are recorded at the rates ruling at the date of transaction. Monetary 
assets and liabilities denominated in foreign currencies are remeasured at the rates of exchange ruling 
at the balance sheet date. All gains and losses arising on remeasurement are included in the income 
statement, except for exchange differences arising on assets and liabilities classified as cash flow hedges 
which are deferred in equity until the occurrence of the hedged transaction, at which time they are 
recognised in the income statement. Share capital and share premium denominated in a currency other 
than the functional currency is initially stated at the spot rate of the date of issue but is not retranslated.

The principal exchange rates used for the translation purposes in respect of one Euro are:

The adoption of these standards and amendments to standards did not have a material impact on the 
consolidated financial statements of the Group. 

b) Accounting pronouncements not yet adopted
At the date of approval of these consolidated financial statements, the following amendments relevant 
to the Group’s operations were issued but not yet effective and not early-adopted:

•  Classification of Liabilities as Current or Non-current and Non-Current liabilities with Covenants – 

Amendments to IAS 1;

•  Lease Liability in a Sale and Leaseback – Amendments to IFRS 16;

•  The Effects of Changes in Foreign Exchange Rates: Lack of Exchangeability – Amendments to IAS 21 

(not endorsed by the EU). 

The above amendments are not expected to have a material impact on the consolidated financial 
statements of the Group.

5. Critical accounting estimates and judgements

In conformity with IFRS, the preparation of the consolidated financial statements for Coca-Cola 
HBC requires management to make estimates and judgements that affect the reported amounts 
of assets, liabilities, revenues and expenses, and the disclosure of contingent assets and liabilities 
in the consolidated financial statements and accompanying notes. Although these estimates and 
judgements are based on management’s knowledge of current events and actions that may be 
undertaken in the future, actual results may ultimately differ from estimates.

5. Critical accounting estimates and judgements continued

Estimates
The key items concerning the future and other key sources of estimation uncertainty at the reporting 
date, that have a significant risk of causing a material adjustment to the carrying amounts of assets and 
liabilities within the next financial year, are described below:

•  Impairment of goodwill and indefinite-lived intangible assets (refer to Note 14); and
•  Employee benefits – defined benefit pension plans (refer to Note 22).

Judgements
In the process of applying the Group’s accounting policies, management has made the following 
judgements, apart from those involving estimations as described above, which have the most 
significant effect on the amounts recognised in the consolidated financial statements:

•  Joint arrangements (refer to Note 16).

6. Russia-Ukraine conflict impact

6.1 Exceptional items related to Russia-Ukraine conflict
The conflict between Russia and Ukraine, which began in the prior year, affected the Group’s business 
in those countries resulting in significant non-recurring costs. More specifically, the Group incurred 
significant net impairment losses for property, plant and equipment, intangible assets and equity 
method investments in Russia. These items have been presented in a separate line ‘Exceptional 
items related to Russia-Ukraine conflict’ in the consolidated income statement, to provide users with 
enhanced visibility over these items, considering their materiality. There were no exceptional items 
related to the Russia-Ukraine conflict in 2023, while for 2022 these costs can be summarised as follows:

 References to Russia, Russian operation or Russian cash-generating unit in this Note relate to Multon Partners LLC (formerly LLC Coca-
Cola HBC Eurasia) the Group’s bottler in Russia.

a) Operations in Russia
Recoverability of individual assets in Russia
The Coca-Cola Company announced in March 2022 the suspension of its business in Russia, following 
the Russia-Ukraine conflict. In response to this decision, the Group implemented a restructuring plan in 
connection with its Russian operation and transitioned to a self-sufficient business model focusing on 
local brands. This resulted in pre-tax impairment losses related to buildings, production and cold drink 
equipment of €102.1 million during the first half of 2022, which were recorded based on a value-in-use 
exercise, reported in line ‘Exceptional items related to Russia-Ukraine conflict’ of the 2022 condensed 
consolidated interim income statement and included under Emerging markets for segmental 
reporting purposes.

Following June 2022, whilst uncertainty levels remained high in Russia, the Group experienced more 
stable market conditions and demand than initially anticipated. As a result, an updated value-in-use 
exercise was performed for the Russian operation’s property, plant and equipment, which resulted in 
a partial reversal of pre-tax impairment losses recognised during the first half of 2022, amounting to 
€42.8 million, considering also foreign currency translation impact. Net impairment losses amounted 
to €59.3 million for 2022, relating to buildings, production and cold drink equipment, which were 
reported in line ‘Exceptional items related to Russia-Ukraine conflict’ of the 2022 consolidated 
income statement and included under Emerging markets for segmental reporting purposes.

During 2023, whilst the conflict with Ukraine is ongoing and thus uncertainty levels remain high in 
Russia, no impairment indicator was identified in connection with the assets of the Russian operation, 
as market conditions remained relatively stable compared with 2022 and performance under the 
new business model was in line with management’s forecasts. The Group is continuously monitoring 
developments in the region to ensure recoverability of its assets. 

Following the above, property, plant and equipment of the Russian operation represented 
approximately 7% of the Group’s total property, plant and equipment as at 31 December 2023 
(2022: 8%).

Recoverability of the Russian cash-generating unit, including goodwill
During the first half of 2022, the Group experienced worsening macroeconomic factors in Russia, 
as sanctions and other regulations had an adverse impact in the country’s economic environment, 
resulting in a material deterioration of the discount rate used to determine the recoverable amount 
of the Group’s Russian cash-generating unit. The Group performed an interim impairment test of 
the Russian cash-generating unit’s recoverable amount, including goodwill, in June 2022 as part of its 
condensed consolidated interim financial statements. As part of that exercise, the recoverable amount 
was determined based on value-in-use calculations consistent with those performed under the 2021 
annual impairment test methodology, updated to consider management’s revised best estimates of 
expected cash flow forecasts and a higher discount rate, reflective of the macroeconomic uncertainty 
in Russia. This exercise resulted in pre-tax impairment losses for goodwill and property, plant and 
equipment of €13.7 million and €15.0 million respectively, which were recorded in line ‘Exceptional items 
related to Russia-Ukraine conflict’ of the 2022 condensed consolidated interim income statement 
and included under Emerging markets for segmental reporting purposes.

6. Russia-Ukraine conflict impact continued

Considering the relevant uncertainty in connection with its new business model in Russia and 
volatility in the market, the Group updated the impairment test of its Russian cash-generating unit’s 
recoverable amount based on value-in-use calculations consistent with its 2022 annual impairment 
test methodology (refer to Note 14), using management’s updated best estimates of expected cash 
flow forecasts, taking into account the actual performance of the new business in the year and relevant 
market developments as described above. The recoverable amount of the Russian cash-generating 
unit resulting from this exercise amounted to approximately €1.1 billion as at 31 December 2022. In the 
context of this exercise, it was identified that the recoverable amount exceeded the carrying amount of 
the Russian cash-generating unit, resulting in the reversal of €13.4 million pre-tax impairment losses to 
property, plant and equipment recognised in June 2022, considering also foreign currency translation 
impact. The reversal of the impairment charge was accordingly recorded in line ‘Exceptional items 
related to Russia-Ukraine conflict’ in the 2022 consolidated income statement and included under 
Emerging markets for segmental reporting purposes.

The following table sets out the key assumptions used in the impairment assessment of the Russian 
cash-generating unit for 2022, as well as 2022 interim results:

Growth rate in perpetuity

Post-tax discount rate

Pre-tax discount rate

2022

4.0%

14.9%

18.3%

2022 interim

4.0%

26.5%

29.2%

The high discount rate used in the 2022 interim results was mainly driven by higher bond yield spreads 
due to fears of potential default of Russia’s debt, on the back of the imposed sanctions, which subsided 
in the second half of the year, thus resulting in a lower discount rate for 2022 compared with the first 
half of the year.

Following the above, the Group’s carrying amount of goodwill and other indefinite-lived intangibles for 
its Russian cash-generating unit was €nil as at 31 December 2023 and 2022.

Recoverability of equity method investments
The impact of the Russia-Ukraine conflict on the macroeconomic environment of Russia as described 
above, was also considered an impairment indicator by the Group under IAS 36 ‘Impairment of assets’, 
in connection with its integral, joint venture investment in Multon AO group of companies (‘Multon’). 
Multon is engaged in the production and distribution of juices in Russia and was jointly controlled by the 
Group and The Coca-Cola Company. The Group performed an interim impairment test in connection 
with its investment in Multon in June 2022 as part of its condensed consolidated interim financial 
statements. The recoverable amount of the investment was determined based on a fair value exercise, 
considering management’s best estimates of cash flow forecasts for a discrete period of five years. 
Cash flows beyond the five-year period were extrapolated using the following estimated growth and 
discount rates:

Growth rate in perpetuity

Post-tax rate

2022 interim

4.0%

28.6%

The recoverable amount of the Group’s investment in Multon resulting from this exercise, which was 
classified as a Level 3 fair value measurement, amounted to €174.2 million. This resulted in a pre-tax 
impairment loss of €52.8 million, which was recorded in line ‘Exceptional items related to Russia-
Ukraine conflict’ in the 2022 consolidated income statement and included under Emerging markets for 
segmental reporting purposes.

In August 2022, The Coca-Cola Company unilaterally waived certain of its governance rights in 
connection with its 50% interest in Multon. Following this waiver and considering the criteria set 
out in IFRS 10 ‘Consolidated financial statements’, the Group has concluded that it controls Multon 
and has been accordingly consolidating its financial performance effective from 11 August 2022 
(refer to Note 24).

6. Russia-Ukraine conflict impact continued

b) Operations in Ukraine
As a result of the Russia-Ukraine conflict, operations of the Group’s Ukrainian subsidiary were 
temporarily suspended for the period March-April 2022. From May 2022, the Group has resumed 
production and distribution of products in Ukraine, where safe to do so. Non-current assets of 
Ukraine represented approximately 1% of the Group’s total non-current assets as at 31 December 
2023 (2022: 1%). An impairment test of the Ukrainian cash-generating unit, based on a value-in-use 
exercise consistent with the Group’s annual impairment testing methodology was performed both for 
the purposes of the Group’s condensed consolidated interim financial statements and consolidated 
financial statements for 2022 as well as for the purposes of the Group’s consolidated financial 
statements for 2023, as it was considered that, whilst operations have resumed, the continued conflict 
has resulted in significant changes in the relevant market with an adverse effect in the cash-generating 
unit. No impairment was identified as a result of this impairment testing neither in 2022 nor in 2023. 
The Group’s carrying amount of goodwill and other indefinite-lived intangibles for its Ukrainian cash-
generating unit was €nil as at 31 December 2023 and 2022.

An amount of €4.4 million losses directly attributable to the Russia-Ukraine conflict, primarily related 
to inventory and property, plant and equipment write-offs, were incurred by the Group’s Ukrainian 
subsidiary during 2022, of which €3.3 million were recorded in line ‘Operating expenses (excluding 
exceptional items related to Russia-Ukraine conflict)’ and €1.1 million in line ‘Cost of goods sold’ of the 
consolidated income statement respectively. During 2023, an amount of €0.2 million in connection with 
these losses was reversed, as the relevant items of property, plant and equipment were recovered, and 
recorded in line ‘Operating expenses (excluding exceptional items related to Russia-Ukraine conflict)’ of 
the consolidated income statement.

6.2 Foreign-currency risk
The Group is exposed to the effect of foreign currency risk on future transactions, recognised 
monetary assets and liabilities that are denominated in currencies other than the local entity’s 
functional currency, as well as net investments in foreign operations. The Group actively manages its 
foreign currency risk as described in Note 25 ‘Financial risk management and financial instruments’. The 
Russia-Ukraine conflict has, among other things, resulted in increased volatility in currency markets, 
especially in connection with the Russian Rouble.

The following tables present details of the Group’s sensitivity to reasonably possible increases and 
decreases in the Euro and US Dollar against the Russian Rouble and Ukrainian Hryvnia. In determining 
reasonably possible changes, the historical volatility over a 12-month period of the respective 
foreign currencies in relation to the Euro and US Dollar has been considered. The sensitivity analysis 
determines the potential gains and losses in the income statement or equity arising from the Group’s 
foreign exchange positions as a result of the corresponding percentage increases and decreases in the 
Group’s main foreign currencies relative to the Euro and the US Dollar. The sensitivity analysis includes 
outstanding foreign-currency-denominated monetary items, external loans, and loans between 
operations within the Group where the denomination of the loan is in a currency other than the 
functional currency of the local entity.

6.3 Other topics
As a result of sanctions and other regulations, there have been changes in required regulatory 
approvals, potentially impacting the transfer and usage of cash outside of Russia. Cash and cash 
equivalents held by the Group’s operations in Russia (including Multon) amounted to €278.7 million 
equivalent in Russian Rouble, US Dollar and Euro as at 31 December 2023 (2022: €155.3 million). The 
aforementioned changes restrict the usage of cash held in Russia outside the country; however, they 
are not expected to have a material impact on the Group’s liquidity, as the cash and cash equivalents 
held in Russia are expected to be used in the forthcoming financial periods primarily for working capital 
purposes in the Russian operations. 

The Group is continuously monitoring performance of its Russian and Ukrainian operations as well as 
the developments in the region, to ensure timely actions and initiatives are undertaken to minimise 
potential adverse impact.

The Group has essentially one business, being the production, sale and distribution of primarily non-
alcoholic, ready-to-drink, beverages across 29 countries. The Group’s markets are aggregated in 
reportable segments as follows:

Established 
markets:

Austria, Cyprus, Greece, Italy, Northern 
Ireland, the Republic of Ireland, Switzerland 
and Global exports1.

Developing 
markets:

Croatia, Czech Republic, Estonia, 
Hungary, Latvia, Lithuania, Poland, 
Slovakia and Slovenia.

Emerging 
markets:

Armenia, Belarus, Bosnia and Herzegovina, 
Bulgaria, Egypt, Moldova, Montenegro, 
Nigeria, North Macedonia, Romania, the 
Russian Federation, Serbia (including the 
Republic of Kosovo) and Ukraine.

1. 

 The Global exports market refers to the export business for Finlandia and Three Cents in countries where the Group does not have 
operations in connection with non-alcoholic ready-to-drink beverages, established due to the Finlandia acquisition (refer to Note 24).

The Group’s chief operating decision maker is its Executive Leadership Team, which evaluates 
performance and allocates resources based on volume, net sales revenue and operating profit. The 
Group’s operations in the Established, Developing and Emerging markets have been aggregated on the 
basis of their similar economic characteristics, assessed by reference to their net sales revenue per unit 
case as well as disposable income per capita, exposure to political and economic volatility, regulatory 
environments, customers and distribution infrastructures. The accounting policies of the reportable 
segments are the same as those adopted by the Group.

undertaken to finance the purchase of production equipment by the Group’s subsidiary in Nigeria, classified as ‘Repayments of borrowings’ 
in the consolidated cash flow statement.

Accounting policy
The Group essentially produces, sells and distributes primarily non-alcoholic, ready-to-drink 
beverages. Under IFRS 15 ‘Revenue from contracts with customers’, the Group recognises revenue 
when control of the products is transferred, being when the products are delivered to the customer. 

Net sales revenue is measured at the fair value of the consideration received or receivable and is 
stated net of sales discounts and consideration paid to customers. These mainly take the form of 
promotional incentives and are amortised over the terms of the related contracts as a deduction 
in revenue. 

The Group provides volume rebates to customers once the quantity of goods purchased during 
the period exceeds a threshold specified in the contract. To estimate the variable consideration 
for the expected future rebates the Group uses the most likely amount method and the amount is 
recognised in net sales revenue only to the extent that it is highly probable that a significant reversal 
in the amount of cumulative revenue recognised will not occur when the uncertainty associated with 
the variable consideration is subsequently resolved.

A contract liability is recognised if a payment is received or a payment is due (whichever is earlier) 
from a customer before the Group transfers the related goods. Contract liabilities are recognised as 
revenue when the Group performs under the contract (i.e., transfers control of the related goods to 
the customer).

Net sales revenue includes excise and other duties where the Group acts as a principal but excludes 
amounts collected by third parties such as value-added taxes as these are not included in the 
transaction price. The Group assesses these taxes and duties on a jurisdiction-by-jurisdiction basis 
to conclude on the appropriate accounting treatment.

Revenue recognised in 2023 that was included in the contract liability balance at the beginning of the 
year amounted to €14.4 million (2022: €11.6 million). For contract liabilities as at 31 December 2023 and 
2022, refer to Note 21.

For an analysis of net sales revenue per reportable segment, refer to Note 7.

For the contributions received from The Coca-Cola Company, which are offset against consideration 
paid to customers, refer to Note 28.

For the contributions received from The Coca-Cola Company, which are offset against expenses for 
general marketing programmes, refer to Note 28.

a) Restructuring expenses

Accounting policy
Restructuring expenses are recorded in a separate line item within operating expenses and 
comprise costs arising from significant changes in the way the Group conducts its business such 
as significant supply chain infrastructure changes, outsourcing of activities and centralisation of 
processes. Restructuring provisions are recognised only when the Group has a present constructive 
obligation, which is when a detailed formal plan identifies the business or part of the business 
concerned, the location, function and number of employees affected, a detailed estimate of the 
associated costs, and an appropriate timeline as well as when the employees affected have been 
notified of the plan’s main features.

As part of the effort to optimise its cost base and sustain competitiveness in the marketplace, 
the Company undertakes restructuring initiatives. The restructuring expenses consist mainly of 
employees’ termination benefits. Restructuring expenses per reportable segment for the years ended

11. Taxation

The income tax charge for the years ended 31 December was as follows:

Accounting policy
Tax is recognised in the income statement, except to the extent that it relates to items recognised in 
other comprehensive income or in equity. In this case, the tax is recognised in other comprehensive 
income or directly in equity.

The current income tax expense is calculated on the basis of the tax laws enacted or substantively 
enacted at the balance sheet date in the countries where the Group operates and generates taxable 
income. Management periodically evaluates positions taken in tax returns with respect to situations 
in which applicable tax regulations are subject to interpretation and establishes provisions where 
appropriate, on the basis of amounts expected to be paid to the tax authorities.

Deferred tax is provided using the liability method for all temporary differences arising between 
the tax bases of assets and liabilities and their carrying values for financial reporting purposes. 
However, the deferred tax liabilities are not recognised if they arise from the initial recognition of 
goodwill. Deferred tax is not accounted for if it arises from initial recognition of an asset or liability in 
a transaction other than a business combination that at the time of the transaction affects neither 
accounting nor taxable profit or loss. Tax rates enacted or substantively enacted at the balance 
sheet date are those that are expected to apply when the deferred tax asset is realised or deferred 
tax liability is settled.

Deferred tax assets are recognised to the extent that it is probable that future taxable profit will 
be available against which the temporary differences can be utilised. Deferred tax assets are 
recognised for tax losses carried forward to the extent that realisation of the related tax benefit 
through the reduction of the future taxes is probable.

Deferred tax is provided on temporary differences arising on investments in subsidiaries, 
associates and joint ventures, except where the timing of the reversal of the temporary difference 
can be controlled by the Group, and it is probable that the temporary difference will not reverse 
in the foreseeable future. This includes taxation in respect of the retained earnings of overseas 
subsidiaries only to the extent that, at the balance sheet date, dividends have been accrued as 
receivable or a binding agreement to distribute past earnings in future periods has been entered 
into by the subsidiary.

Deferred tax assets and deferred tax liabilities are offset if a legally enforceable right exists to offset 
current tax assets against current income tax liabilities and the deferred taxes relate to the same 
taxation authority on either the same taxable entity or different taxable entities where there is an 
intention to settle the balances on a net basis.

Non-deductible expenses for tax purposes include marketing and advertising expenses, service fees, 
loss allowance on trade receivables, entertainment expenses, certain employee benefits and other 
items that, partially or in full, are not deductible for tax purposes in certain of the Group’s jurisdictions.

The Group’s effective tax rate varies depending on the mix of taxable profits by territory, the non-
deductibility of certain expenses, non-taxable income, and other one-off tax items across its 
territories. The changes in applicable tax rates compared to the previous period are driven by a 
combination of blended tax rates and changes in the standard corporate tax rate in certain territories of 
the Group (namely Austria, Belarus, Czech Republic, Italy, Northern Ireland, Slovenia and Switzerland).

11. Taxation continued

The Group is subject to income taxes in numerous jurisdictions. There are many transactions and 
calculations for which the ultimate tax determination cannot be assessed with certainty in the ordinary 
course of business. The Group recognises a provision for potential cases that might arise in the 
foreseeable future based on assessment of the probabilities as to whether additional taxes will be due. 
Where the final tax outcome on these matters is different from the amounts that were initially recorded, 
such differences will impact the income tax provision in the period in which such determination is 
made; however, based on past experience, management expects that any such differences in the next 
financial year will be immaterial for the Group. The income tax provision amounted to €82.8 million as at 
31 December 2023 (2022: €67.5 million), of which €72.9 million (2022: €67.2 million) are classified in line 
‘Current tax liabilities’, €0.3 million (2022: €0.3 million) in line ‘Current tax assets’ and €9.6 million (2022: 
€nil) in line ‘Deferred tax liabilities’ of the consolidated balance sheet.

OECD Pillar Two model rules
The Organisation for Economic Co-operation and Development (OECD)/G20 Inclusive Framework 
on Base Erosion and Profit Shifting published the Pillar Two model rules designed to address the tax 
challenges arising from the digitalisation of the global economy. Under Pillar Two legislation, the Group 
may be liable to pay a top-up tax for the difference between their Global Anti-Base Erosion (‘GloBE’) 
effective tax rate per jurisdiction and the 15% minimum rate1.
As of 31 December 2023, Pillar Two2 legislation has been enacted or substantively enacted in certain 
jurisdictions in which the Group has presence. In particular, Pillar Two legislation was enacted or 
substantively enacted in Austria, Bulgaria, Croatia, Czech Republic, Finland, Hungary, Republic 
of Ireland, Italy, the Netherlands, Romania, Slovakia, Slovenia, Switzerland and Northern Ireland. 
Further countries in which the Group has presence have introduced draft legislation or declared 
their intention to introduce Pillar Two legislation.

The legislation will be effective for the Group’s financial year beginning 1 January 2024. Since the Pillar 
Two legislation was not effective at the reporting date, the Group has no related current tax exposure. 
In May 2023, the IASB amended IAS 12 to provide timely relief for affected entities, to avoid diverse 
interpretations of IAS 12 and to improve disclosures. The amendments have introduced a temporary 
exception to the requirements to recognise and disclose information about deferred tax assets and 
liabilities related to Pillar Two income taxes as well as additional disclosure requirements. The Group 
applied the temporary exception at 31 December 2023.

The Group has performed a preliminary assessment of its potential exposure to Pillar Two income 
taxes, following the transitional Pillar Two Safe Harbor rules. This assessment is based on the financial 
accounts of the Constituent Entities3 which have been used in the preparation of the Group’s 
consolidated financial statements under IFRS as adopted by the EU for 2021, 2022 and 2023. The 
assessment considers all countries in which the Group has presence and involves the assessment 
of whether a local additional tax liability or a tax liability at the level of the respective holding entity is 
expected to arise.

Based on the Group’s assessment, it is expected that no additional tax liability will arise in most of the 
Group’s jurisdictions; however, there is a limited number of jurisdictions where the Pillar Two effective 
tax rate may be lower than 15%, namely Bulgaria, Kosovo, Bosnia and Herzegovina, Republic of Ireland, 
Moldova and Romania. While the effective tax rates in 2024 will depend on factors such as revenues, 
costs and foreign currency exchange rates, an estimation based on the figures of the fiscal year 2023 
indicates that, had the Pillar Two legislation been effective for the year ended 31 December 2023, the 
effective tax rate under IFRS would have been approximately 0.5% higher than the reported effective 
tax rate of 30.2%. On this basis, the impact of any Pillar Two additional tax liability to the Group’s 
effective tax rate for 2024 is not expected to be material.

3. 

 The top-up tax is calculated on the GloBE income after deduction of the Substance Based Excluded Income (i.e. after deducting part of 
the income calculated based on the local personnel costs and local tangible assets as per Pillar Two rules).
 Pillar Two legislation refers to OECD Global Base Anti-Erosion Rules (OECD GloBE Rules) introducing minimum taxation effective on 
low-tax jurisdictions.
 Constituent Entities are the entities in scope of the Pillar Two rules, i.e. entities included in the financial statements with full consolidation 
and certain joint ventures to which CCHBC Group participates with a 50% ownership share.

The aggregate amount of distributable reserves arising from the realised earnings of the Group’s 
operations was €3,871.2 million in 2023 (2022: €3,574.8 million). No deferred tax liabilities have been 
recognised on such reserves given that their distribution is controlled by the Group, or in the event of 
plans to remit overseas earnings of subsidiaries, such distribution would not give rise to a tax liability.

12. Earnings per share

Accounting policy
Basic earnings per share is calculated by dividing the net profit attributable to the owners of the 
parent by the weighted average number of ordinary shares outstanding during the year. The 
weighted average number of ordinary shares outstanding during the year is the number of ordinary 
shares outstanding at the beginning of the year, adjusted by the number of ordinary shares bought 
back or issued during the year multiplied by a time-weighting factor. Diluted earnings per share 
incorporates stock options for which the average share price for the year is in excess of the exercise 
price of the stock option and which create a dilutive effect.

The calculation of the basic and diluted earnings per share attributable to the owners of the parent 
entity is based on the following data:

Net profit attributable to the owners of the parent (€ million)

Weighted average number of ordinary shares for the purposes of basic 
earnings per share (million)

Effect of dilutive stock options on number of shares (million)

Weighted average number of ordinary shares for the purposes of diluted 
earnings per share (million)

Accounting policy
Intangible assets consist of goodwill, franchise agreements, trademarks and water rights. Goodwill 
and other indefinite-lived intangible assets are carried at cost less accumulated impairment losses, 
while intangible assets with finite lives are amortised over their useful economic lives. The useful 
lives, both finite and indefinite, assigned to intangible assets are evaluated on an annual basis.

Intangible assets with indefinite lives (‘not subject to amortisation’)
Intangible assets not subject to amortisation consist of goodwill, franchise agreements and 
trademarks.

Goodwill is the excess of the consideration transferred over the fair value of the share of net assets 
acquired. Goodwill and fair value adjustments arising on the acquisition of subsidiaries are treated 
as the assets and liabilities of those subsidiaries. These balances are denominated in the functional 
currency of the subsidiary and are translated to Euro on a basis consistent with the other assets 
and liabilities of the subsidiary.

The useful life of franchise agreements is usually based on the term of the respective franchise 
agreements. The Coca-Cola Company does not grant perpetual franchise rights outside the 
United States. However, given the Group’s strategic relationship with The Coca-Cola Company 
and consistent with past experience, the Group believes that franchise agreements will continue 
to be renewed at each expiration date with no significant costs. The Group has concluded that the 
franchise agreements are perpetual in nature and they have therefore been assigned indefinite 
useful lives.

The Group’s trademarks are assigned an indefinite useful life when they have an established sales 
history in the applicable region, it is the intention of the Group to receive a benefit from them 
indefinitely and there is no indication that this will not be the case.

Goodwill and other indefinite-lived intangible assets are tested for impairment annually and 
whenever there is an indication of impairment.

14. Intangible assets continued

The movements in intangible assets by classes of assets during the year are as follows:

For the purpose of impairment testing, goodwill is allocated to each of the Group’s cash-generating 
units expected to benefit from the business combination in which the goodwill arose. Other 
indefinite-lived intangible assets are also allocated to the Group’s cash-generating units expected 
to benefit from those intangibles. The cash-generating units (‘unit’) to which goodwill and other 
indefinite-lived intangible assets have been allocated are tested for impairment annually, or more 
frequently when there is an indication that the unit may be impaired. If the recoverable amount 
(i.e. the higher of the value-in-use and fair value less costs to sell) of the cash-generating unit is less 
than the carrying amount of the unit, the impairment loss is allocated first to reduce the carrying 
amount of any goodwill allocated to the unit and then pro-rata to the other assets of the unit on 
the basis of the carrying amount of each asset in the unit. Impairment losses recognised against 
goodwill are not reversed in subsequent periods.

Intangible assets with finite lives
Intangible assets with finite lives mainly consist of water rights and certain brands, are amortised 
over their useful economic lives and are carried at cost less accumulated amortisation and 
impairment losses. Intangible assets with finite lives are reviewed for impairment whenever 
events or changes in circumstances indicate that the carrying amount may not be recoverable.

Critical accounting estimates
Determining whether goodwill or indefinite-lived intangible assets are impaired requires an 
estimation of the value-in-use of the cash-generating units to which they have been allocated 
in order to determine the recoverable amount of the cash-generating units. The value-in-use 
calculation requires the Group to estimate the future cash flows expected to arise from the 
cash-generating unit, discounted at an appropriate rate. Estimating the discounted future cash 
flows involves a significant degree of uncertainty. The value-in-use estimation is sensitive to the 
discount rate used as well as the perpetuity growth rates used for extrapolation purposes. The key 
assumptions used to determine the recoverable amount for the different cash-generating units, 
including a sensitivity analysis where possible changes to these key assumptions could eliminate the 
remaining headroom, are disclosed and further explained below under ‘Annual impairment test for 
goodwill and other indefinite-lived intangible assets’ section.

14. Intangible assets continued

Impairment losses of €13.7 million in 2022 relate to the impairment of goodwill in connection with the 
Group’s Russian cash-generating unit (refer to Note 6).

In 2023, the Group recognised an impairment loss of €3.1 million in connection with its self-serve coffee 
vending business in Poland (the ‘Costa Express Business’), as the recoverable amount was lower than 
the carrying amount. The recoverable amount was determined based on value-in-use calculations, 
considering management’s best estimates of future cash flows expected to arise from the business, 
discounted at a rate of 7.7%. The impairment was driven mainly by a change in expectations regarding 
scope and duration of a contract with a key customer. The impairment loss was allocated to goodwill 
(€1.1 million) and other finite-lived intangible assets (€2.0 million), and was included in line ‘Operating 
expenses’ of the consolidated income statement and under Developing markets for segmental 
allocation purposes.

In addition, impairment losses of €109.4 million in 2023 relate to the impairment of goodwill of the 
Group’s Egyptian cash-generating unit. For details on the impairment testing of the Group’s Egyptian 
cash-generating unit, refer to section ‘Annual impairment test for goodwill and other indefinite-lived 
intangible assets’ below.

Intangible assets not subject to amortisation amounted to €2,559.0 million (2022: €2,529.7 million), and 
are presented in the charts below: 

2023
€2,559.0 million

2022
€2,529.7 million

The carrying value of intangible assets subject to amortisation amounted to €9.6 million 
(2022: €12.8 million) and comprised water rights of €5.3 million, trademarks of €3.9 million and 
other intangible assets of €0.4 million (2022: €6.0 million water rights, €4.2 million trademarks and 
€2.6 million other intangible assets).

Annual impairment test for goodwill and other indefinite-lived intangible assets
The recoverable amount of each cash-generating unit was determined through a value-in-use 
calculation. This calculation uses cash flow forecasts based on financial budgets approved by the Board 
of Directors covering a one-year period and cash flow forecasts for four additional years. Cash flows for 
years two to five are forecasted by management based on operation and market-specific assumptions 
including growth rates, forecast selling prices, direct costs and operating expenses. Management 
determined gross margins based on past performance, expectations for the development of the 
market and expectations about raw materials’ costs. Cash flows for the subsequent years after the 
forecast period are extrapolated using perpetuity growth rates which reflect management’s best 
estimate of industry growth, considering long-term inflation and gross domestic product forecasts 
specific to the countries of operation. The discount rates used by management represent the current 
market assessment of the risks specific to each cash-generating unit, taking into consideration the 
time value of money and are derived from the weighted average cost of capital. The Group applies 
post-tax discount rates to post-tax cash flows as the valuation calculated using this method closely 
approximates to applying pre-tax discount rates to pre-tax cash flows.

Management also considered the potential adverse impact to future cash flows arising from climate 
change risk, under different scenarios. These scenarios included the increased capital expenditure 
required to mitigate climate-related risks and focused on the impact from disruptions to production 
and distribution due to extreme weather as well as the increased cost of water and carbon emissions. 
The Group will continue to refine its approach on climate-related risks and opportunities in the 
impairment assessment, as greater understanding of the potential impacts on the Group’s business 
is obtained.

Except for the impairment in the goodwill of the Egyptian cash-generating unit analysed below, no 
further impairment of goodwill and other indefinite-lived assets was identified during the annual 
impairment test of 2023.

For the cash-generating units of the Republic of Ireland and Northern Ireland and Koncern Bambi a.d. 
Požarevac, the growth rate in perpetuity as estimated by management was higher than that expected 
for the industry in general. This is attributable to the strength of the Group’s brand portfolio, which 
is amongst the strongest and broadest in the industry. The Group has historically achieved higher 
revenue growth than the industry leveraging the strength of its portfolio, while it continually invests 
in brand-related innovations to remain relevant, be able to cater to all consumption occasions and 
increase market share.

Impairment of Egyptian cash-generating unit
We disclosed in our 2022 Integrated Annual Report that in the cash-generating unit (‘unit’) of Egypt, 
reasonably possible changes in key assumptions of the 2022 impairment test would remove the 
remaining headroom. During 2023, we experienced worsening macroeconomic factors in the country, 
with inflation persisting at record-high levels, more than double the upper bound of the Central Bank of 
Egypt’s target band, and increasing risk of foreign currency crisis due to low reserves, while geopolitical 
tensions in the Middle East negatively impacted the financial performance of the unit in late 2023.

The Group performed its annual impairment test in 2023, which resulted in an impairment loss for 
its Egyptian unit of €109.4 million, as the recoverable amount was lower than the carrying amount 
of the unit. The recoverable amount was determined based on value-in-use calculations consistent 
with those performed in 2022, updated to consider management’s best estimates of expected cash 
flows and a higher discount rate, reflective of the increased macroeconomic uncertainty in Egypt, as 
discussed above. The impairment loss was allocated in its entirety to reduce the carrying amount of 
goodwill allocated to the unit and was included in line ‘Operating expenses’ of the consolidated income 
statement and under Emerging markets for segmental allocation purposes.

The following table sets out the key assumptions used in the impairment assessment of the Egyptian unit:

initiatives are undertaken to minimise potential adverse impacts on its expected performance.

15. Property, plant and equipment

Accounting policy
All property, plant and equipment is initially recorded at cost and subsequently measured at cost 
less accumulated depreciation and impairment losses. Subsequent expenditure is added to the 
carrying value of the asset when it is probable that future economic benefits, in excess of the original 
assessed standard of performance of the existing asset, will flow to the operation and the costs 
can be measured reliably. All other subsequent expenditure is expensed in the period in which it 
is incurred.

Assets under construction are recorded as part of property, plant and equipment, and depreciation 
on these assets commences when the assets are made available for use.

Depreciation is calculated on a straight-line basis to allocate the depreciable amount over the 
estimated useful life of the assets as follows:

Freehold buildings and improvements

40 years

Leasehold buildings and improvements

Over the lease term, up to 40 years

Deposits received for returnable containers by customers are accounted for as deposit liabilities 
(refer to Note 21).

Residual values and useful lives of assets are reviewed and adjusted if appropriate at each balance 
sheet date. Climate change-related risks and relevant mitigation and adaptation actions may impact 
the useful lives of property, plant and equipment. The Group monitors the potential impact of 
climate change-related risks and associated legislation in the context of its review of the useful lives 
and no impact has been identified.

Property, plant and equipment is reviewed for impairment whenever events or changes in 
circumstances indicate that the carrying amount may not be recoverable. An impairment loss is 
recognised for the amount by which the carrying amount of the asset exceeds its recoverable 
amount, which is the higher of the asset’s fair value less cost to sell and its value-in-use. For the 
purposes of assessing impairment, assets are grouped at the lowest level of separately identifiable 
cash flows.

For the accounting policy regarding right-of-use assets, refer to Note 17 ‘Leases’.

Assets under construction at 31 December 2023 include advances for equipment purchases of 
€78.6 million (2022: €63.2 million). The depreciation charge for the year, including that for right-of-
use assets (refer to Note 17), recognised in operating expenses and cost of goods sold amounted to 
€203.7 million (2022: €209.6 million) and €181.4 million (2022: €193.8 million) respectively.

Impairment of property, plant and equipment and right-of-use assets
In 2022, the Group recorded impairment losses of €1.6 million, €0.9 million and €81.4 million, and 
reversals of impairment of €0.6 million, €0.2 million and €1.6 million relating to property, plant and 
equipment in the Established, Developing and Emerging segments respectively. Net impairment losses 
of €60.9 million, relating to property, plant and equipment in the Emerging segment are included in 
the exceptional items related to Russia-Ukraine conflict (refer to Note 6). The impaired assets, being 
mainly buildings, production and cold drink equipment, were written down based mainly on value-in-
use calculations.

Associates and joint arrangements

Accounting policy
Equity method investments comprise investments in associates and joint arrangements and are 
classified into integral and non-integral on the basis of whether they are considered part of the 
Group’s core operations and strategy.

Investments in associates
Investments in associated undertakings are accounted for by the equity method of accounting. 
Associated undertakings are all entities over which the Group has significant influence but not 
control, generally accompanying a shareholding of between 20% and 50% of the voting rights.

The equity method of accounting involves recognising the Group’s share of the associates’ post-
acquisition profit or loss and movements in other comprehensive income for the period in the 
income statement and statement of other comprehensive income respectively. Unrealised gains 
and losses resulting from transactions between the Group and the associate are eliminated to the 
extent of the interest in the associate.

The Group’s interest in each associate is carried in the balance sheet at an amount that reflects 
its share of the net assets of the associate and includes goodwill on acquisition. When the Group’s 
share of losses in an associate equals or exceeds its interest in the associate, the Group does not 
recognise further losses, unless the Group has incurred obligations or made payments on behalf 
of the associate.

Investments in joint arrangements
Joint arrangements are arrangements in which the Group has contractually agreed sharing of 
control, which exists only when decisions about the relevant activities require unanimous consent. 
Joint arrangements are classified as joint ventures or joint operations depending upon the rights 
and obligations arising from the joint arrangement.

The Group classifies a joint arrangement as a joint venture when the Group has rights to the net 
assets of the arrangement. The Group accounts for its interests in joint ventures using the equity 
method of accounting as described in the section above.

The Group classifies a joint arrangement as a joint operation when the Group has the rights to the 
assets, and obligations for the liabilities, of the arrangement and accounts for each of its assets, 
liabilities, revenues and expenses, including its share of those held or incurred jointly, in relation to 
the joint operation.

If facts and circumstances change, the Group reassesses whether it still has joint control and 
whether the type of joint arrangement in which it is involved has changed.

Critical accounting judgements
The Group participates in several joint arrangements. Judgement is required in order to determine 
the classification of the Group’s joint arrangements as joint ventures where the Group has rights to 
the net assets of the arrangement, or joint operations where the Group has rights to the assets and 
obligations for the liabilities of the arrangement. In making this assessment, consideration is given 
to the legal form of the arrangement, and the contractual terms and conditions, as well as other 
facts and circumstances (including the economic rationale of the arrangement and the impact of 
the relevant legal framework). The Group participates in a number of joint arrangements with The 
Coca-Cola Company in connection with its water business across its markets, the classification of 
which involves a significant degree of judgement due to the complexity of the underlying contractual 
arrangements of the business model and the diversity of the relevant legal frameworks across 
markets.

a) Investments in joint ventures
The Group has a 50% interest in Multon AO Group of companies (‘Multon’), which is engaged in the 
production and distribution of juices in Russia and was jointly controlled by the Group and The Coca-
Cola Company until August 2022 (the joint arrangement was classified as a joint venture, as its structure 
provided to the Group rights to its net assets). In August 2022, The Coca-Cola Company unilaterally 
waived certain of its governance rights in connection with its 50% interest in Multon, which were 
accordingly assumed by the Group. As a result, considering the criteria set out in IFRS 10 ‘Consolidated 
financial statements’, the Group concluded that, effective 11 August 2022, it controls Multon (refer to 
Note 24).

As a result of the change in control of Multon described above, on 11 August 2022 the Group 
remeasured the previously held equity interest in Multon at its fair value (refer to Note 24), which 
resulted in a gain of €70.8 million, which was presented in line ‘Gain on remeasurement of previously 
held equity interest arising from business combination’ of the table on page 221, regarding 2022 
changes in the carrying amount of equity method investments. The Group then proceeded to 
derecognise the resulting carrying amount of Multon investment of approximately €250 million, against 
the fair value of the identifiable net assets recognised (refer to Note 24), which was presented in line 
‘Deemed disposal arising from business combination’ of the table on page 221, regarding 2022 changes 
in the carrying amount of equity method investments.

Apart from Multon, the Group has a significant joint venture with Heineken, through its 50% interest 
in AD Pivara Skopje, which is engaged in the bottling and distribution of soft drinks and beer in North 
Macedonia. The structure of the joint venture provides the Group with rights to its net assets.

Summarised financial information of the Group’s significant joint ventures is presented below.

The information below reflects the amounts presented in the IFRS financial statements of the joint 
venture, amended to reflect adjustments made when using the equity method, including fair value 
adjustments and not the Group’s share in these amounts.

b) Investment in associates
The Group has one significant associate, being Casa Del Caffè Vergnano S.p.A. (‘Caffè Vergnano’), 
a premium Italian coffee company in which the Group holds a 30% equity shareholding. The 
corresponding investment is classified as an associate, as the Group has significant influence over the 
investee. The Group has also entered into an exclusive distribution agreement for Caffè Vergnano’s 
products in all its territories outside of Italy. The investment is accounted for using the equity method 
and is further classified as a non-integral equity method investment in the consolidated financial 
statements of the Group, considering that the distribution agreement is separate to the shareholding.

During 2022, acquisition costs of €0.8 million accrued in 2021 in connection with the investment in 
Caffè Vergnano were paid and presented in line ‘Payments for non-integral equity method investments’ 
of the consolidated cash flow statement, while in 2023 €0.2 million of accrued acquisition costs were 
written-off.

The information below reflects the amounts presented in the financial statements of Caffè Vergnano 
under Italian law, amended to reflect adjustments made by the associate when using the equity 
method, including fair value adjustments and not the Group’s share in those amounts.

We disclosed in our 2022 Integrated Annual Report that Frigoglass Industries (Nigeria) Limited, an 
associate in which the Group holds an effective interest of 23.9% (2022: 23.9%) through its subsidiary 
Nigerian Bottling Company Ltd, was guarantor under the amended banking facilities and notes issued 
by the Frigoglass Group. This guarantee expired in April 2023 as part of the restructuring of Frigoglass 
Group (refer to Note 28). However, Frigoglass Industries (Nigeria) Limited is a guarantor for the new 
senior secured notes issued in 2023 by the restructured Frigoglass Group. The Group has no direct 
exposure arising from this guarantee arrangement, but the Group’s investment in this associate, which 
stood at €14.0 million as at 31 December 2023 (2022: €21.1 million), would be at potential risk if there 
was a default under the terms of the senior secured notes and the restructured Frigoglass Group 
(including the guarantor) was unable to meet its obligations thereunder.

c) Joint operations

17. Leases

Accounting policy
Leases for which the Group is in a lessee position are recognised as a right-of-use asset and a 
corresponding lease liability at the date at which the leased asset is available for use by the Group. 
Assets and liabilities arising from a lease are initially measured on a net-present-value basis and 
are recognised as part of ‘Property, plant and equipment’, ‘Current borrowings’ and ‘Non-current 
borrowings’ in the consolidated balance sheet, respectively.

Lease contracts may contain both lease and non-lease components. The Group allocates the 
consideration in the contract to the lease and non-lease component respectively. Consideration 
relevant to the non-lease component is recognised as an expense in the consolidated income 
statement over the period of the lease.

Lease liabilities include the net present value of the following lease payments:

a)  fixed payments (including in-substance fixed payments) over the lease term, less any lease 
incentives receivable;

b)  variable lease payments that are based on an index or a rate;

c)  amounts expected to be payable by the lessee under residual value guarantees;

d)   the exercise price of a purchase option if the Group is reasonably certain it will exercise that 

option; and

e)   payments of penalties for terminating the lease, if the lease term reflects the Group exercising 

that option.

When adjustments to lease payments based on an index or rate take effect, the lease liability 
is reassessed and adjusted against the right-of-use asset.

Variable lease payments that do not depend on an index or a rate are recognised as an expense 
in the period in which the event or condition that triggers the payment occurs.

The lease payments are discounted using the interest rate implicit in the lease (if that rate can 
be determined), or the incremental borrowing rate of the lease, being the rate that the individual 
lessee would have to pay to borrow the funds necessary to obtain an asset of similar value in a similar 
economic environment with similar terms, security and conditions. In determining the incremental 
borrowing rate to be used, the Group applies judgement to establish the suitable reference rate and 
credit spread. 

Each lease payment is allocated between the liability (principal) and finance cost. The interest 
expense is charged to the consolidated income statement as part of ‘Finance costs’ over the lease 
period so as to produce a constant periodic rate of interest on the remaining balance of the liability 
for each period.

Right-of-use assets are measured at cost comprising the following:

a)  the amount of the initial measurement of lease liability;

b)   any lease payments made at or before the commencement date less any lease 

incentives received;

c)  any initial direct costs; and

d)  any restoration costs.

The right-of-use assets are depreciated over the shorter of the assets’ useful life and the lease term 
on a straight-line basis. If the Group is reasonably certain to exercise a purchase option, the right-of-
use asset is depreciated over the underlying asset’s useful life. 

The Group utilises a number of practical expedients permitted by the standard, namely:

1)   applying the recognition exemption to short-term leases (i.e. leases with a term of 12 months 

or less) that do not contain a purchase option; and

2)   applying the recognition exemption to leases of underlying assets with a low value, which mainly 

comprise IT equipment.

Payments associated with short-term leases and leases of low-value assets are recognised on a 
straight-line basis as an expense in the consolidated income statement. 

In determining the lease term, management considers all facts and circumstances that create an 
economic incentive to exercise an extension option, or not exercise a termination option. Extension 
options (or periods after termination options) are only included in the lease term if the lease is 
reasonably certain to be extended (or not terminated). The assessment is revised if a significant 
event or a significant change in circumstances occurs, which affects this assessment and which is 
within the control of the lessee.

Lease payments are presented as follows in the consolidated cash flow statement:

•  short-term lease payments, payments for leases of low-value assets and variable lease payments 
that are not included in the measurement of the lease liabilities are presented within cash flows 
from operating activities;

•  payments for the interest element of recognised lease liabilities are included in ‘Interest paid’ 

within cash flows from financing activities; and

•  payments for the principal element of recognised lease liabilities are presented within cash flows 

from financing activities.

17. Leases continued

The following expenses have been included in cost of goods sold and operating expenses:

Leasing activities
The leases which are recorded on the consolidated balance sheet are principally in respect of buildings 
and vehicles. Lease terms are negotiated on an individual basis and contain a wide range of different 
terms and conditions.

Extension and termination options are included in a number of leases across the Group. These are used 
to maximise operational flexibility in terms of managing the assets used in the Group’s operations. 
Extension options considered reasonably certain to be exercised relate to both buildings and motor 
vehicles and do not exceed one year. Most termination options have not been considered reasonably 
certain to be exercised.

The total cash outflow for leases in 2023 was €109.3 million (2022: €103.6 million).

Expenses relating to short-term leases in 2023 and 2022 comprise consideration for leases with 
a term of 12 months or less used to cover seasonal business needs.

18. Inventories

Accounting policy
Inventories are stated at the lower of cost and net realisable value. 

Cost for raw materials and consumables is determined on a weighted average basis. Cost for work 
in progress and finished goods comprises the cost of direct materials and labour plus attributable 
overhead costs. Cost of inventories includes all costs incurred to bring the product to its present 
location and condition.

Net realisable value is the estimated selling price in the ordinary course of business, less the 
estimated costs necessary to complete and sell the inventory.

Inventories consisted of the following as at 31 December:

Right-of-use assets arising on business combinations in 2023 amounted to €6.7 million (2022: €40.1 
million) (refer to Note 24).

19. Trade, other receivables and assets

Trade, other receivables and assets consisted of the following as at 31 December:

Accounting policy
Trade receivables are amounts due from customers for goods sold or services performed in the 
ordinary course of business. They are initially recognised at fair value and subsequently measured 
at amortised cost using the effective interest rate method. The normal credit terms are between 
7-90 days upon delivery. 

The Group applies the IFRS 9 simplified approach for trade and other receivables and follows an 
Expected Credit Losses (‘ECLs’) approach for measuring the allowance of its trade receivables. 
The expected loss rate is assessed on the basis of historical credit losses of 24 months before the 
year end and adjusted to reflect current and forward-looking information. ECLs are based on the 
difference between the contractual cash flows due in accordance with the contract and all the cash 
flows that the Group expects to receive. The carrying amount of the receivable is reduced by the 
loss allowance, which is recognised as part of operating expenses. If a trade receivable ultimately 
becomes uncollectible, it is written off initially against any loss allowance made in respect of that 
receivable with any excess recognised as part of operating expenses. Subsequent recoveries 
of amounts previously written off or loss allowance no longer required are credited against 
operating expenses. 

The Group has entered into a contract that provides insurance coverage against defaulted 
trade receivables. This contract meets the definition of a financial guarantee contract, which 
is in substance part of the contract terms (that is, integral to the trade receivables) and is not 
recognised separately. Therefore, the expected cash flows from the credit insurance are included 
in the measurement of ECLs of trade receivables.

Loans are initially recognised at the fair value net of transaction costs incurred. After initial 
recognition, all interest-bearing loans are subsequently measured at amortised cost. Amortised 
cost is calculated using the effective interest rate method whereby any discount, premium 
or transaction costs associated with a loan are amortised to the income statement over the 
lending period.

20. Assets classified as held for sale

21. Trade and other payables

Accounting policy
Non-current assets and disposal groups are classified as held for sale if it is considered highly 
probable that their carrying amount will be principally recovered through a sale transaction rather 
than through continuing use. This condition is regarded as met only when the sale is highly probable 
and the asset (or disposal group) is available for immediate sale in its present condition. In order for 
a sale to be considered highly probable, management must be committed to a plan to sell the asset, 
an active programme to locate a buyer and complete the plan must have been initiated, and the sale 
should be expected to be completed within one year from the date of classification.

In the event that the criteria for continued classification as held for sale are no longer met, the assets 
are reclassified to property, plant and equipment and the depreciation charge is adjusted for the 
depreciation that would have been recognised had the assets not been classified as held for sale.

Non-current assets and disposal groups classified as held for sale are measured at the lower of the 
individual assets’ previous carrying amount and their fair value less costs to sell.

As at 31 December 2023, the Group’s assets classified as held for sale amounted to €3.3 million, 
comprising the net book value of land and buildings of €1.8 million and €1.5 million in the Group’s 
Established and Emerging segments respectively (2022: €0.1 million of plant and equipment in the 
Group’s Established segment), that has been written down to fair value less costs to sell (refer to 
Note 15). The fair value of assets classified as held for sale was determined through the use of a sales 
comparison approach and is a non-recurring fair value measurement within Level 3 of the fair value 
hierarchy. Assets classified as held for sale in 2022 were reclassified to property, plant and equipment 
during 2023, as sale did not complete within one year from the date of classification as held for sale.

Accounting policy
Trade payables are recognised initially at fair value and subsequently measured at amortised cost 
using the effective interest rate method.

Trade and other payables consisted of the following at 31 December:

Trade payables

Accrued liabilities

Payables to related parties (refer to Note 28)

The Group facilitates a supply chain financing programme under which the supplier can elect on 
an invoice-by-invoice basis to either receive a discounted early payment from the partner bank, or 
continue to be paid in line with the agreed payment terms; in either case, the value and due date of the 
liability payable by the Group remain unchanged and, as such, the liability remains classified as trade 
and other payables. As at 31 December 2023, invoices included in the programme amounted to €144.7 
million (2022: €175.3 million). 

Accrued liabilities regarding volume, marketing and promotional incentives as well as listing fees 
and other incentives provided to customers as at 31 December 2023 amounted to €351.2 million 
(2022: €287.3 million).

Accounting policy
Provisions are recognised when: the Group has a present obligation (legal or constructive) as a 
result of a past event; it is probable that an outflow of resources embodying economic benefits 
will be required to settle the obligation; and a reliable estimate can be made of the amount 
of the obligation.

Where the Group expects a provision to be reimbursed, for example under an insurance 
contract, the reimbursement is recognised as a separate asset only when such reimbursement 
is virtually certain. 

If the effect of the time value of money is material, provisions are determined by discounting the 
expected future cash flows at a pre-tax rate that reflects current market assessments of the time 
value of money and the risks specific to the liability.

Termination benefits are payable whenever an employee’s employment is terminated before the 
normal retirement date or whenever an employee accepts voluntary redundancy in exchange for 
these benefits. The Group recognises termination benefits at the earlier of the following dates: 
a) when the Group can no longer withdraw the offer of those benefits; and b) when the Group 
recognises costs for a restructuring that is within the scope of IAS 37 ‘Provisions, contingent 
liabilities and contingent assets’ and involves the payment of termination benefits (refer to Note 9). 
In the case of an offer made to encourage voluntary redundancy, the termination benefits are 
measured based on the number of employees expected to accept the offer.

During 2023, a restructuring provision of €0.7 million was recognised in connection with the new 
business model in Russia following the Russia-Ukraine conflict (refer to Note 6), which was utilised 
during the year (2022: €3.9 million). Other provisions primarily comprise provisions in relation to 
donations, employee litigation, legal and other tax provisions.

b) Employee benefits

Accounting policy
The Group operates a number of defined benefit and defined contribution pension plans 
in its territories.

The defined benefit plans are made up of both funded and unfunded pension plans and employee 
leaving indemnities. The assets of funded plans are generally held in separate trustee-administered 
funds and are financed by payments from employees and/or the relevant Group companies.

The liability recognised in the balance sheet in respect of defined benefit plans is the present value 
of the defined benefit obligation at the balance sheet date less the fair value of the plan assets. 

For defined benefit pension plans, pension costs are assessed using the projected unit credit 
method. Actuarial gains and losses arising from experience adjustments and changes in actuarial 
assumptions are charged or credited to equity in other comprehensive income in the period in 
which they arise. Such actuarial gains and losses are not reclassified to the income statement in 
subsequent periods. The defined benefit obligations are measured at the present value of the 
estimated future cash outflows using interest rates of high-quality corporate bonds that are 
denominated in the currency in which the benefits will be paid, and that have terms approximating 
to the terms of the related obligation. In countries where there is no deep market in such bonds, 
the market rates on government bonds are used. Past service cost is recognised immediately in 
the income statement. A number of the Group’s operations have other long-service benefits in the 
form of jubilee plans. These plans are measured at the present value of the estimated future cash 
outflows with immediate recognition of actuarial gains and losses in the income statement.

The Group’s contributions to the defined contribution pension plans are charged to the income 
statement in the period to which the contributions relate.

Critical accounting estimates
The Group provides defined benefit pension plans as an employee benefit in certain territories. 
Determining the value of these plans requires several actuarial assumptions and estimates 
that may differ from actual developments in the future. These include the determination of the 
discount rates, rate of compensation increases, rate of pension increases and life expectancy of 
pensioners at the age of 65. Due to the long-term nature of these plans, such estimates are subject 
to significant uncertainty. Details on the key assumptions used and a sensitivity analysis regarding 
the impact of reasonably possible changes in key assumptions on the defined benefit obligation are 
further presented below.

Other employee benefits primarily comprise employee bonuses which are linked to business and

Employees of Coca-Cola HBC’s subsidiaries in Austria, Bulgaria, Croatia, Greece, Italy, Montenegro, 
Nigeria, Poland, Romania, Serbia and Slovenia are entitled to employee leaving indemnities, generally 
based on each employee’s length of service, employment category and remuneration. These are 
unfunded plans where the Company meets the payment obligation as it falls due.

Coca-Cola HBC’s subsidiaries in Austria, Northern Ireland, the Republic of Ireland and Switzerland 
sponsor defined benefit pension plans. Of the three plans in the Republic of Ireland, two have 
plan assets, as do the two plans in Northern Ireland, and one plan out of the three in Switzerland. 
The Austrian plans do not have plan assets and the Company meets the payment obligation as it falls 
due. The defined benefit plans in Austria, the Republic of Ireland and Northern Ireland are closed to 
new members.

Coca-Cola HBC provides long-service benefits in the form of jubilee plans to its employees in Austria, 
Croatia, Nigeria, Poland, Serbia, Slovenia and Switzerland.

Funding levels are monitored in conjunction with the agreed contribution rate. The funding level of the 
funded plans as at 31 December 2023 was 112% (2022: 116%).

Five of the plans have funded status surplus totalling €48.6 million as at 31 December 2023 
(2022: five plans, totalling €51.9 million) that is recognised as an asset on the basis that the 
Group has an unconditional right to future economic benefits either via a refund or a reduction 
in future contributions.

Defined benefit plan expense is included in employee costs and presented in cost of goods sold 
and operating expenses.

Asset liability matching: Plan assets allocated to growth assets are monitored regularly to ensure they 
remain appropriate and in line with the Group’s long-term strategy to manage the plans. As the plans 
mature, the level of investment risk will be reduced by investing more in assets such as bonds that 
better match the liabilities.

Pension plan assets are invested in different asset classes in order to maintain a balance between 
risk and return. Investments are well diversified to limit the financial effect of the failure of any 
individual investment. Through its defined benefit plans the Group is exposed to a number of risks, 
as outlined below: 

Asset volatility: The liabilities are calculated using a discount rate set with reference to corporate bond 
yields; if assets underperform this yield, a deficit will be created. The Northern Ireland, Republic of 
Ireland and Swiss plans hold a significant proportion of growth assets (equities), which are expected to 
outperform corporate bonds in the long term while being subject to volatility and risk in the short term.

Changes in bond yields: A decrease in corporate bond yields will increase the plan liabilities, although 
this will be partially offset by an increase in the value of the plans’ bond holdings. Conversely, an increase 
in corporate bond yields will decrease the plan liabilities, although this will be partially offset by a 
decrease in the value of the plans’ bond holdings.

Inflation: The Northern Ireland, Republic of Ireland and Swiss plans’ benefit obligations are linked to 
inflation, which is used as a basis to determine the rate of compensation increases. As a result, higher 
inflation will lead to higher liabilities, although, in most cases, caps on the level of inflationary increases 
are in place to protect against extreme inflation. The majority of the assets are either unaffected by or 
only loosely correlated with inflation, meaning that an increase in inflation will also increase the deficit.

Life expectancy: The majority of the pension plans’ obligations are to provide benefits for the life of the 
member, so increases in life expectancy will result in an increase in the liabilities.

The assets of funded plans are generally held in separately administered trusts, either as specific assets 
or as a proportion of a general fund, or are insurance contracts. Plan assets held in trust are governed 
by local regulations and practice in each country. The category ‘Other’ mainly includes investments in 
funds holding a portfolio of assets. Plan assets relate predominantly to quoted financial instruments.

Equity securities were not invested in ordinary shares of the Company as at 31 December 2023 
or 31 December 2022.

Defined contribution plans
The expense recognised in the income statement in 2023 for the defined contribution plans is 
€41.2 million (2022: €22.5 million). This is included in employee costs and recorded in cost of goods 
sold and operating expenses.

23. Offsetting financial assets and financial liabilities

Accounting policy
The Group offsets financial assets and financial liabilities to the net amount reported in the 
balance sheet when it currently has a legally enforceable right to offset the recognised amounts 
and it intends to settle on a net basis or to realise the asset and settle the liability simultaneously. 
The legally enforceable right must not be contingent on future events and must be enforceable 
in the normal course of business and in the event of default, insolvency or bankruptcy of the 
Company or the counterparty.

The Group enters into derivative transactions under International Swaps and Derivatives Association 
(ISDA) master netting agreements or other similar agreements. In general, under such agreements 
the counterparties can elect to settle as one single net amount the aggregated amounts owed by each 
counterparty on a single day with respect to all outstanding transactions of the same currency and the 
same type of derivative. In the event of default or early termination, all outstanding transactions under 
the agreement are terminated and subject to any set-off. These agreements do not meet all of the IAS 
32 criteria for offsetting in the balance sheet as the Group does not have any current legally enforceable 
right to offset amounts since the right can only be applied if elected by both counterparties.

The financial assets and financial liabilities presented below are subject to offsetting, enforceable 
master netting or similar agreements. The column ‘Net amount’ shows the impact on the Group’s 
balance sheet if all set-off rights were exercised.

Financial liabilities offset against trade receivables mainly relate to accrued customer rebates, 
as the offsetting criteria for these are met.

24. Business combinations and acquisition of non-controlling interests

Accounting policy
The acquisition method of accounting is used to account for business combinations. The 
consideration transferred is the fair value of any asset transferred, shares issued and liabilities 
assumed. The consideration transferred includes the fair value of any asset or liability resulting 
from a contingent consideration arrangement. Identifiable assets acquired and liabilities and 
contingent liabilities assumed are measured initially at their fair values at the acquisition date. The 
excess of the consideration transferred and the fair value of non-controlling interest over the net 
assets acquired and liabilities assumed is recorded as goodwill. In a business combination achieved 
without the transfer of consideration, the acquisition-date fair value of the previously held interest 
in the acquiree is used in place of the acquisition-date fair value of the consideration transferred 
to measure goodwill or a gain on a bargain purchase. Acquisition costs comprise costs incurred 
to effect a business combination such as finder’s, advisory, legal, accounting, valuation and other 
professional or consulting fees. Integration costs comprise direct incremental costs necessary for 
the acquiree to operate within the Group. All acquisition and integration-related costs are expensed 
as incurred.

For each business combination, the Group elects to measure the non-controlling interest in the 
acquiree either at fair value or at the proportionate share of the acquiree’s identifiable net assets.

If the business combination is achieved in stages, the acquisition date carrying value of the 
previously held equity interest in the acquiree is remeasured to fair value at the acquisition date. Any 
gains or losses arising from such remeasurement are recognised in profit or loss, within operating 
expenses in line ‘Acquisition and integration costs’. Any accumulated amounts regarding the Group’s 
share of other comprehensive income of the previously held equity interest are reclassified to the 
income statement, within operating expenses in line ‘Acquisition and integration costs’. The Group 
has also elected to present gains on bargain purchase within operating expenses in line ‘Acquisition 
and integration costs’.

Acquisition of Brown-Forman Finland Oy
On 1 November 2023, the Group acquired 100% of the issued shares of Brown-Forman Finland Oy 
(‘BFF’), established in Finland, owner of the Finlandia Vodka brand. The acquisition enhances the 
Group’s premium spirits business, while complementing its existing adult sparkling beverages portfolio 
and better positions the Group to strengthen partnerships with customers in strategically important 
channels such as hotels, restaurants and cafes (HoReCa).

The fair value of the consideration for the acquisition of BFF consists of US Dollar 193.8 million 
(€183.9 million), which has already been paid, and an additional payment, based on BFF’s net financial 
position and working capital movement, of US Dollar 0.6 million (€0.5 million), which is expected to be 
transferred within the first quarter of 2024. This additional payment is still under discussion with the 
seller, according to the terms of the sale and purchase agreement.

Details of the acquisition with regard to the provisionally determined fair values of the net assets 
acquired and goodwill are presented in the table below. The net assets acquired reflect the additional 
payment at the provisional amount of US Dollar 0.6 million (€0.5 million).

 Property, plant and equipment and borrowings acquired relate to right-of-use assets (refer to Note 17) and lease liability (refer to Note 26), 
respectively.

Fair values on acquisition are provisional and will be finalised within 12 months of the acquisition date.

The goodwill arising is attributable to the brand’s growth potential across the Group’s markets. 
Acquisition-related costs of €5.6 million were included in the 2023 operating expenses, as a result 
of the above acquisition.

The fair value of trade, other receivables and assets acquired includes trade receivables with a fair 
value of €2.0 million, while there was no significant amount of trade receivables acquired considered 
to be uncollectible.

Net sales revenue and profit after tax contributed by BFF to the Group for the period from 1 November 
2023 to 31 December 2023, amounted to €9.5 million and €2.8 million respectively. If the business 
combination had occurred on 1 January 2023, consolidated net sales revenue and profit after tax 
for the year ended 31 December 2023 would have been higher by approximately €43.5 million and 
€7.4 million respectively. This pro forma information reflects the pre-acquisition operating model 
of BFF and is not adjusted for the benefits arising from the post-acquisition transfer of distribution 
from Brown-Forman or third-party distributors to CCH operations in the CCH markets, and therefore 
should not be considered as indicative of Finlandia Vodka brand future performance.

Acquisition of Three Cents
On 21 October 2022, the Group acquired 100% of the issued shares of ESM Effervescent Sodas 
Management Limited, established in Cyprus, the owner of the super-premium adult sparkling beverage 
and mixer product line under the Three Cents brand and its subsidiary Three Cents Hellas Single 
Member S.A., established in Greece (together, ‘Three Cents’), for a consideration of €45.9 million. 
The acquisition complements and further premiumises the Group’s existing adult sparkling beverage 
portfolio and will better position the Group to address a wider range of consumer tastes and segments.

Multon AO group of companies (‘Multon’)
The Group holds a 50% interest in Multon, which is engaged in the production and distribution of juices 
in Russia and was jointly controlled by the Group and The Coca-Cola Company. On 8 March 2022, as a 
result of the Russia-Ukraine conflict, The Coca-Cola Company announced that it was suspending its 
business in Russia and unilaterally waived certain of its governance rights in connection with its 50% 
interest in Multon, while retaining consent rights in respect of certain limited board and shareholder 
reserved matters that are protective in nature (the ‘Waiver’). 

Considering the criteria set out in IFRS 10 ‘Consolidated financial statements’, the Group concluded 
that, effective 11 August 2022, it controlled Multon. The change in control of Multon was accounted for 
as a business combination achieved in stages in line with IFRS 3 ‘Business combinations’ requirements. 
For more details on the Waiver and the assessment regarding change of control of Multon, refer to Note 
24 of the 2022 Integrated Annual Report.

The fair value of the Group’s previously held interest in Multon, amounted to approximately €250 million 
and was estimated based on discounted forecasted cash flows of the business, using a discount rate of 
27.8%. As a result of the change in control of Multon, a gain on remeasurement of the previously held 
equity interest to fair value amounting to €70.8 million and a loss regarding the reclassification to the 
income statement of the Group’s share of Multon’s other comprehensive income amounting to €145.2 
million were recognised in 2022. The arising net loss of €74.4 million was recognised within ‘Operating 
expenses’ line of the consolidated income statement, included under Emerging markets for segmental 
reporting purposes and within ‘Other non-cash items’ line of the consolidated cash flow statement. 
The Group incurred acquisition costs of €0.1 million in 2022 regarding the change in control of Multon, 
which were included in line ‘Operating expenses’ of the consolidated income statement.

The cash and cash equivalents acquired amounting to €24.2 million was presented in line ‘Payment for 
business combinations, net of cash acquired’ in the consolidated cash flow statement. Trade balances 
between the Group and Multon were effectively settled on acquisition, with no gain or loss recognised 
on the settlement, as the balances were effectively settled at the recorded amount.

The gain from bargain purchase arose mainly due to the deferred tax asset recognised on the economic 
obsolescence attributed to Multon’s machinery and equipment and was presented in line ‘Operating 
expenses’ in the consolidated income statement and line ‘Other non-cash items’ in the consolidated 
cash flow statement. More specifically, the business enterprise value, which was estimated based 
on discounted forecasted cash flows, was lower than the estimated fair value of the net identifiable 
assets acquired, using the cost of depreciated replacement to new methodology for the machinery 
and equipment of Multon. The Group considered that a market participant would not be willing to buy 
the net assets of the business at the estimated fair value, as described above, if the utility of the same, 
measured by the discounted forecasted cash flows of the business is smaller. 

Therefore, a downward adjustment of €39.8 million was made on the fair value of the identifiable assets 
as economic obsolescence in connection with Multon’s machinery and equipment, representing the 
difference between the business enterprise value and the fair value of net identifiable assets. This in turn 
resulted in the recognition of a deferred tax asset, which is considered recoverable based on the future 
economic performance of Multon and was included in the value of net identifiable assets acquired.

The Group chose to recognise the non-controlling interests in Multon (The Coca-Cola Company’s 50% 
share) at their fair value upon change in control. This was determined based on discounted forecasted 
cash flows of the business and a scenario-based approach altering the potential dates at which The 
Coca-Cola Company could potentially reinstate its rights in Multon, based on the terms of the unilateral 
Waiver. The discount rate used in discounting the forecasted cash flows was 27.8%.

For more details on the scenarios used to calculate the fair value of non-controlling interest, refer to 
Note 24 of the 2022 Integrated Annual Report. 

Following the Waiver The Coca-Cola Company effectively has no entitlement over Multon’s profit or 
loss generated in the ordinary course of business as it has contractually waived its rights over dividend 
or other distributions made by Multon. As a result, Multon’s net profit or loss is not being allocated to 
non-controlling interests during the period of the Waiver.
Acquisition of Coca-Cola Bottling Company of Egypt S.A.E.1
On 12 August 2021, the Group entered into a sale and purchase agreement to acquire approximately 
52.7% of Coca-Cola Bottling Company of Egypt S.A.E. (‘CCBCE’), the bottling partner of The Coca-Cola 
Company in Egypt, from MAC Beverages Limited and certain of its affiliated entities (‘MBL acquisition’). 
The MBL acquisition was completed on 13 January 2022 and resulted in the Group obtaining control 
over CCBCE. 

The operating results and assets and liabilities of CCBCE have been consolidated from 14 January 2022.

The fair value of the consideration for the MBL acquisition consisted of US Dollar 303.7 million (€264.9 
million), which was transferred on acquisition, and an additional payment of US Dollar 124.0 million 
(€119.1 million), based on CCBCE’s past performance, net financial position and working capital 
movement, which was transferred in October 2022. Foreign exchange loss arising on settlement of 
the consideration payable for the MBL acquisition amounted to €11.3 million and was presented in line 
‘Payment for business combinations, net of cash acquired’ of the consolidated cash flow statement, 
while proceeds from settlement of derivatives used to hedge the relevant foreign currency risk 
amounted to €13.0 million and were presented in line ‘Proceeds from settlement of derivatives relating 
to business combination’ of the consolidated cash flow statement.

1.  Effective 18 June 2023, Coca-Cola Bottling Company of Egypt S.A.E. was renamed to Coca-Cola HBC Egypt.

24. Business combinations and acquisition of non-controlling interests continued

As part of the MBL acquisition completion, a convertible loan which had been granted to CCBCE from a 
wholly-owned affiliate of The Coca-Cola Company, one of its major shareholders, was also transferred 
to the Group for a consideration of €19.1 million, which was presented in line ‘Repayments of 
borrowings’ in the consolidated cash flow statement. The consideration was equal to the outstanding 
principal amount of the convertible loan and any unpaid interest at the time of its transfer. The loan was 
convertible at its original maturity in March 2022 into new CCBCE shares at fair market value and was 
eliminated upon consolidation of CCBCE. The conversion option was not subsequently exercised.

Details of the MBL acquisition with regard to the determined fair values of the net assets acquired, non-
controlling interests and goodwill are presented in the below table.

The line ‘Borrowings’ in the above table includes the convertible loan as well as third-party loans of 
€122.7 million, which have been repaid and replaced with intra-group borrowings. The Group has 
chosen to recognise the non-controlling interests at their proportionate share of the fair value of 
CCBCE’s net identifiable assets acquired.

The Group incurred acquisition and integration costs of €8.8 million in 2022 regarding the acquisition 
of CCBCE, which were included in line ‘Operating expenses’ of the consolidated income statement.

On 12 August 2021, the Group entered into an additional sale and purchase agreement to acquire 
approximately 42% of CCBCE, from a wholly-owned affiliate of The Coca-Cola Company (‘TCCC 
acquisition’). The TCCC acquisition was completed on 25 January 2022.

The fair value of the consideration paid for the TCCC acquisition amounted to US Dollar 122.7 million 
(€108.9 million). The transaction was treated as separate to the MBL acquisition, considering that whilst 
the transactions above were entered into at the same time and in contemplation of each other, they 
were separate from a commercial and contractual perspective. The TCCC acquisition was accordingly 
accounted for as an equity transaction.

Following the completion of both the transactions, the Group held a 94.7% interest in CCBCE 
as at 31 December 2022. During 2023, the Group acquired a further 3.1% interest in CCBCE for 
a consideration of €12.6 million, which was presented in line ‘Purchase of shares from non-controlling 
interests’ of the consolidated cash flow statement. Following this, the Group held a 97.8% interest 
in CCBCE as at 31 December 2023.

25. Financial risk management and financial instruments

Accounting policy
Financial assets
On initial recognition financial assets are recorded at fair value plus, in the case of financial assets not 
at fair value through profit or loss (FVTPL), any directly attributable transaction costs. Transaction 
costs of financial assets at FVTPL are expensed.

356.8

Financial assets are classified into three categories:

a) Financial assets at amortised cost (debt instruments)

The classification of debt instruments at amortised cost depends on two criteria: a) the Group’s 
business model for managing assets; and b) whether the instruments’ contractual cash flows 
represent solely payments for principal and interest on the principal amount outstanding (the ‘SPPI 
criterion’). If both criteria are met the financial assets of the Group are subsequently measured at 
amortised cost whereby any interest income is recognised using the effective interest method. 
This category includes trade receivables, treasury bills and time deposits. The accounting policy 
for trade receivables is described in Note 19.

b) Financial assets through other comprehensive income (FVOCI)

The Group also has investments in financial assets at FVOCI. These include equity investments 
that are not of a trading nature. The Group intends to hold these equity instruments for the 
foreseeable future and has irrevocably elected to classify them as FVOCI upon initial recognition. 
Upon derecognition of these financial assets, there is no recycling of gains or losses to the income 
statement.

c) Financial assets through profit or loss (FVTPL)

The Group also has investments in financial assets at FVTPL which are subsequently measured at 
fair value and where changes in fair value are recognised in the income statement. Financial assets 
at FVTPL mainly comprise money market funds.

For those financial assets that are not subsequently held at fair value, the Group assesses whether 
there is evidence of impairment at each balance sheet date.

Derivative financial instruments
The Group uses derivative financial instruments, including currency, commodity and interest 
rate derivatives, to manage currency, commodity price and interest rate risk associated with 
its business activities. The Group does not enter into derivative financial instruments for 
trading activity purposes.

All derivative financial instruments are initially recognised on the balance sheet at fair value and 
are subsequently remeasured at their fair value. Changes in the fair value of derivative financial 
instruments are recognised at each reporting date either in the income statement or in equity, 
depending on whether the derivative financial instrument qualifies for hedge accounting as a 
cash flow hedge.

Embedded derivatives in financial host contracts are recorded at fair value through profit or loss 
together with the host contracts.

All derivative financial instruments that are not part of an effective hedging relationship 
(undesignated hedges) are classified as assets or liabilities at fair value through profit or loss.

At the inception of a hedge transaction the Group documents the relationship between the 
hedging instrument and the hedged item, as well as its risk management objective and strategy 
for undertaking the hedge transaction. This process includes linking the derivative financial 
instrument designated as a hedging instrument to the specific asset, liability, firm commitment or 
forecast transaction. The Group has established a hedge ratio of 1:1 for the hedging relationships 
as the underlying risk of the hedging instruments are identical to the hedged risks component. 
The economic relationship between the hedged item and the hedging instrument is assessed 
on an ongoing basis. Ineffectiveness may arise if the timing or the notional of the forecast 
transaction changes or if the credit risk changes impacting the fair value movements of the 
hedging instruments.

Changes in the fair value of derivative financial instruments (both the intrinsic value and the aligned 
time value) that are designated and effective as hedges of future cash flows are recognised directly 
in other comprehensive income, while the ineffective portion is recognised immediately in the 
income statement. Amounts accumulated in equity are recycled to the income statement as the 
related hedged asset acquired or liability assumed affects the income statement. 

Hedge accounting is discontinued when the hedging instrument expires or is sold, terminated, 
exercised, or no longer qualifies for hedge accounting. At that time, any cumulative gain or loss 
on the hedging instrument recognised in equity is retained in equity until the forecast transaction 
occurs. If a hedged transaction is no longer expected to occur, the net cumulative gain or loss 
recognised in equity is transferred to the income statement. 

Derivatives embedded in non-financial host contracts are accounted for as separate derivatives and 
recorded at fair value through profit or loss if:

•  their economic characteristics and risks are not closely related to those of the host contracts; 
•  the host contracts are not designated as at fair value through profit or loss; and 
•  a separate instrument with the same terms as the embedded derivative meets the definition 

of a derivative.

These embedded derivatives are measured at fair value with changes in fair value recognised in the 
income statement. Reassessment only occurs if there is either a change in the terms of the contract 
that significantly modifies the cash flows that would otherwise be required or a reclassification of a 
financial asset out of the fair value through profit or loss category takes place.

Regular purchases and sales of investments are recognised on the trade date, which is the day 
the Group commits to purchase or sell. The investments are recognised initially at fair value plus 
transaction costs, except in the case of FVTPL. For investments traded in active markets, fair value 
is determined by reference to stock exchange quoted bid prices. For other investments, fair value 
is estimated by reference to the current market value of similar instruments or by reference to the 
discounted cash flows of the underlying net assets or other valuation techniques.

Financial risk factors, objectives and policies
The Group’s activities expose it to a variety of financial risks: market risk (including foreign currency risk, 
commodity price risk and interest rate risk), credit risk, liquidity risk and capital risk. The Group’s overall 
risk management programme focuses on the volatility of financial markets and seeks to minimise 
potential adverse effects on the Group’s cash flows. The Group uses derivative financial instruments 
to hedge certain risk exposures. Risk management is carried out by Group Treasury in a controlled 
manner, consistent with the Board of Directors’ approved policies. Group Treasury identifies, evaluates 
and hedges financial risks in close cooperation with the Group’s subsidiaries. The Board of Directors 
has approved the Treasury Policy which provides the control framework for all treasury and treasury-
related transactions.

Market risk
a) Foreign currency risk
The Group is exposed to the effect of foreign currency risk on future transactions, recognised 
monetary assets and liabilities that are denominated in currencies other than the local entity’s 
functional currency, as well as net investments in foreign operations. Foreign currency forward, option 
and futures contracts are used to hedge a portion of the Group’s foreign currency risk. The majority of 
the foreign currency forward, option and futures contracts have maturities of less than one year after 
the balance sheet date. 

Management has set up a policy that requires Group companies to manage their foreign exchange 
risk against their functional currency. To manage their foreign exchange risk arising from future 
transactions and recognised monetary assets and liabilities, entities in the Group use foreign currency 
forward, option and future contracts transacted by Group Treasury. Group Treasury’s risk management 
policy is to hedge, on an average coverage ratio basis, between 25% and 80% of anticipated cash flows 
for the next 12 months by using a layer strategy and 100% of balance sheet remeasurement risk in 
each major foreign currency for which hedging is applicable. Each subsidiary designates contracts with 
Group Treasury as fair value hedges or cash flow hedges, as appropriate. External foreign exchange 
contracts are designated at Group level as hedges of foreign exchange risk on specific monetary 
assets, monetary liabilities or future transactions on a gross basis. 

The following tables present details of the Group’s sensitivity to reasonably possible increases and 
decreases in the Euro and the US Dollar against the relevant foreign currencies. In determining 
reasonably possible changes, the historical volatility over a 12-month period of the respective foreign 
currencies in relation to the Euro and the US Dollar has been considered. The sensitivity analysis 
determines the potential gains and losses in the income statement or equity arising from the Group’s 
foreign exchange positions as a result of the corresponding percentage increases and decreases in the 
Group’s main foreign currencies relative to the Euro and the US Dollar. The sensitivity analysis includes 
outstanding foreign-currency denominated monetary items, external loans, and loans between 
operations within the Group where the denomination of the loan is in a currency other than the 
functional currency of the local entity.

b) Commodity price risk
The Group is affected by the volatility of certain commodity prices (being mainly sugar, aluminium, 
aluminium premium, plastic and gas oil) in relation to certain raw materials necessary for the production 
of the Group’s products. 

Due to the significantly increased volatility of commodity prices, the Group’s Board of Directors has 
developed and enacted a risk management strategy regarding commodity price risk and its mitigation. 
Although the Group continues to contract prices with suppliers in advance, to reduce its exposure 
to the effect of short-term changes in the price of sugar, aluminium, aluminium premium, gas oil and 
plastic the Group hedges the market price of these commodities using commodity swap contracts 
based on a rolling forecast for a period up to 36 months. Group Treasury’s Risk management policy is to 
hedge a minimum of 25% and a maximum of 80% of commodity exposure for the next 12 months with 
the exception of certain types of plastic for which lower compliance ratios apply.

The following table presents details of the Group’s income statement and equity sensitivity to 
increases and decreases in sugar, aluminium, aluminium premium, plastic and gas oil prices. The table 
does not show the sensitivity to the Group’s total underlying commodity exposure or the impact of 
changes in volumes that may arise from increase or decrease in the respective commodity prices. The 
sensitivity analysis determines the potential effect on profit or loss and equity arising from the Group’s 
commodity swap contract positions as a result of the reasonably possible increases or decreases of the 
respective commodity price. In determining reasonably possible changes of the respective commodity 
price, the historical volatility over a 12-month period per contract maturity has been considered.

c) Interest rate risk
The Group is subject to interest rate risk for its outstanding borrowings and interest rates swap 
contracts (‘swaptions’).The sensitivity analysis in the following table has been determined based on 
exposure to interest rates of both derivative and non-derivative instruments existing at the balance 
sheet date and assuming constant foreign exchange rates. For floating rate liabilities, the analysis is 
prepared assuming the amount of liability outstanding at the balance sheet date was outstanding 
for the whole year. A 100 basis point increase or decrease for 2023 (2022: 50 basis point) represents 
management’s assessment of a reasonably possible change in interest rates.

The impact in the Group’s equity is attributable to the changes in the fair value of the swaptions 
entered in 2023 for a notional amount of €525.0 million and designated as hedging instruments 
in a cash flow hedge.

Credit risk
Credit risk is the risk of financial loss to the Group if a customer or counterparty to a financial instrument 
fails to meet its obligations under the contract or arrangement. The Group has limited concentration 
of credit risk across trade and financial counterparties. Credit policies are in place and the exposure to 
credit risk is monitored on an ongoing basis. 

The Group’s maximum exposure to credit risk in the event that counterparties fail to meet their 
obligations at 31 December 2023 in relation to each class of recognised financial asset is the carrying 
amount of those assets as indicated on the balance sheet.

Under the credit policies, before accepting any new credit customers, the Group investigates the 
potential customer’s credit quality, using either external agencies and in some cases bank references 
and/or historic experience, and defines credit limits for each customer. Customers that fail to meet 
the Group’s benchmark credit quality may transact with the Group only on a prepayment or cash basis. 
Customers are reviewed on an ongoing basis and credit limits are adjusted accordingly. The Group 
also carries credit insurance on a portion of the accounts receivable balance. There is no significant 
concentration of credit risk with regard to loans, trade and other receivables as the Group has a large 
number of customers which are geographically dispersed.

The Group has policies that limit the amount of credit exposure to any single financial institution. 
The Group only undertakes investment and derivative transactions with banks and financial institutions 
that have a minimum credit rating of ‘BBB-’ from Standard & Poor’s and ‘Baa3’ from Moody’s, unless the 
investment is in countries where the Sovereign Credit Rating is below the ‘BBB-/Baa3’. The Group also 
uses Credit Default Swaps of a counterparty in order to measure in a timelier way the creditworthiness 
of a counterparty and set up its counterparties in tiers in order to assign maximum exposure and tenor 
per tier. If the Credit Default Swaps of a certain counterparty exceed 400 basis points the Group will 
stop trading derivatives with that counterparty and will try to cancel any deposits on a best-effort 
basis. In addition, the Group regularly makes use of time deposits and money market funds to invest 
excess cash balances and to diversify its counterparty risk. As at 31 December 2023, an amount of 
€54.8 million (2022: €529.5 million) is invested in time deposits with tenor more than three months 
and €513.8 million (2022: €497.2 million) is invested in money market funds.

Liquidity risk
The Group actively manages liquidity risk to ensure there are sufficient funds available for any 
short-term and long-term commitments. Bank overdrafts and bank facilities, both committed 
and uncommitted, are used to manage this risk.

The Group manages liquidity risk by maintaining adequate cash reserves and committed banking 
facilities, access to the debt and equity capital markets, and by continuously monitoring forecast and 
actual cash flows. In Note 26, the undrawn facilities that the Group has at its disposal to manage liquidity 
risk are discussed under the headings ‘Commercial paper programme’, ‘Committed credit facilities’ and 
‘Uncommitted loan agreement’.

As at 31 December 2023, the Group has a net debt of €1.6 billion (refer to Note 26), of which €600 million 
Euro-denominated fixed rate bond matures in November 2024. In addition, the Group has an undrawn 
revolving credit facility of €800 million available, €0.8 billion available out of the €1.0 billion commercial 
paper facility, as well as undrawn uncommitted loan agreement of €200 million.

The following tables detail the Group’s remaining contractual maturities for its financial liabilities. 
The tables include both interest and principal undiscounted cash flows, assuming that interest rates 
remain constant from 31 December 2023.

Capital risk

Accounting policy
The Group monitors its financial capacity and credit ratings by reference to a number of key financial 
ratios including net debt to comparable adjusted EBITDA, which provides a framework within which 
the Group’s capital base is managed. This ratio is calculated as net debt divided by comparable 
adjusted EBITDA.

Adjusted EBITDA is calculated by adding back to operating profit the depreciation and net 
impairment of property, plant and equipment, the amortisation and impairment of intangible 
assets, the employee performance share costs, the net impairment of equity method investments 
and items, if any, reported in line ‘Other non-cash items’ of the consolidated cash flow statement. 
Comparable adjusted EBITDA refers to adjusted EBITDA excluding restructuring expenses, 
exceptional items related to Russia-Ukraine conflict, acquisition, integration and divestment-related 
costs and the unrealised gains or losses resulting from the mark-to-market valuation of derivatives 
and embedded derivatives related to commodity hedging.

Refer to Note 26 for definition of net debt.

The Group’s objectives when managing capital are to safeguard the Group’s ability to continue as a 
going concern and to maintain an optimal capital structure to reduce the cost of capital.

In order to maintain or adjust the capital structure, the Group may increase or decrease debt, issue or 
buy back shares, adjust the amount of dividends paid to shareholders, or return capital to shareholders.

The Group’s goal is to maintain a conservative financial profile. This is evidenced by the credit ratings 
maintained with Standard & Poor’s and Moody’s, which were reaffirmed in 2023, while the outlook by 
Standard & Poor’s returned to stable in 2023 compared with negative in 2022.

Interest rate swap contracts
The Group entered into forward starting swap contracts of €500.0 million in 2014 to hedge the interest 
rate risk related to its Euro-denominated forecast issuance of fixed rate debt in March 2016. In August 
2015, the Group entered into additional forward starting swap contracts of €100.0 million. In March 
2016, the forward starting swap contracts were settled, and at the same time, the new note was issued. 
The accumulated loss of €55.4 million recorded in other comprehensive income is being reclassified to 
the income statement over the term of the new note.

The Group entered into swaption contracts of €350.0 million in 2018 and €1,050.0 million in 2019 to 
hedge the interest rate risk related to its Euro-denominated forecast issuance of fixed rate debt in 
2019 and formally designated them as cash flow hedges. In May and November 2019, the swaption 
contracts were settled and, at the same time, the new notes were issued. The accumulated loss of €9.6 
million recorded in other comprehensive income is being reclassified to the income statement over the 
relevant period.

The Group entered into swaption contracts of €180.0 million in 2022 to hedge the interest rate risk 
related to its Euro-denominated forecast issuance of fixed rate debt in 2022 and formally designated 
them as cash flow hedges. In September 2022, the swaption contracts were settled and, at the 
same time, the new notes were issued. The accumulated gain of €3.4 million recorded in other 
comprehensive income is being reclassified to the income statement over the relevant period.

The Group entered into swaption contracts of €525.0 million in 2023 to hedge the interest rate risk 
related to its Euro-denominated forecast issuance of fixed rate debt in 2024 and formally designated 
them as cash flow hedges. The valuation of the outstanding swaptions for the year ended 31 December 
2023 was €3.4 million loss recorded in other comprehensive income.

Embedded derivatives
During 2023, the Group recognised embedded derivatives whose risks and economic characteristics 
are not considered to be closely related to the commodity contract in which they were embedded. The 
fair value of the embedded derivatives as at 31 December 2023 amounted to a financial liability of €9.1 
million (2022: €nil).

Fair values of financial assets and liabilities
For financial instruments such as cash, deposits, debtors and creditors, investments, loans payable 
to related parties, short-term borrowings (excluding the current portion of bonds and notes payable) 
and other financial liabilities (other than bonds and notes payable), carrying values are a reasonable 
approximation of their fair values. According to the fair value hierarchy, the financial instruments 
measured at fair value are classified as follows:

Level 1
The fair value of FVOCI listed equity securities as well as FVTPL securities is based on quoted 
market prices at the reported date. The fair value of bonds is based on quoted market prices 
at the reported date.

Level 2
The fair value of foreign currency forward, option and futures contracts, commodity swap contracts, 
bonds and notes payable, interest rate option and swap contracts, forward starting swap contracts 
and embedded foreign currency derivatives is determined by using valuation techniques, which 
maximise the use of observable market data and include discounting. The fair value of the foreign 
currency forward, option and future contracts, commodity swap contracts, embedded foreign 
currency derivatives and cross-currency swap contracts is calculated by reference to quoted forward 
exchange and deposit rates, interest rates and forward rate curves of the underlying commodity at the 
reported date for contracts with similar maturity dates. The fair value of interest rate option contracts 
is calculated by reference to the Black-Scholes valuation model and implied volatilities. The fair value of 
interest rate swap contracts is determined as the difference in the present value of the future interest 
cash inflows and outflows based on observable yield curves.

Level 3
The fair value of FVOCI unlisted equity securities as well as convertible note agreements, certain 
undesignated derivatives and foreign currency futures and forward contracts is determined through 
the use of estimated discounted cash flows or other valuation techniques that use unobservable 
inputs. These valuation techniques estimate the fair value of undesignated derivatives by using 
settlement and forward prices received from counterparty banks and subscription-based publications 
and the fair value of foreign currency futures and forward contracts by using adjusted quoted prices.

Transfers between levels of the fair value hierarchy are deemed to have occurred at the date of the 
event or change in circumstances that caused the transfer.

After initial recognition, all interest-bearing borrowings are subsequently measured at amortised 
cost. Amortised cost is calculated using the effective interest rate method whereby any discount, 
premium or transaction costs associated with a borrowing are amortised to the income statement 
over the borrowing period.

Refer also to Note 17 for accounting policy on leases.

Cash and cash equivalents comprise cash balances and short-term, highly liquid investments 
that are readily convertible to known amounts of cash and which are subject to insignificant risk of 
change in value. Bank overdrafts are classified as short-term borrowings in the balance sheet and 
for the purpose of the cash flow statement. Time deposits and treasury bills that do not meet the 
definition of cash and cash equivalents are classified as short-term investments at amortised cost. 
Money market funds are classified as short-term investments at fair value through profit or loss. 
The Group has elected to report cash receipts and payments regarding investments at amortised 
cost and fair value through profit or loss respectively, on a net basis in the consolidated cash flow 
statement, considering that the relevant amounts are large, turnover is quick and maturities (where 
applicable) are short. These investments are expected to be continually renewed, taking into 
account market returns and cash generation by the Group.

Net debt is defined as current borrowings plus non-current borrowings less cash and cash 
equivalents, and certain other financial assets.

Net debt for the year ended 31 December comprised:

Current borrowings

Non-current borrowings

Less: Cash and cash equivalents

•  Financial assets at amortised cost

•  Financial assets at fair value through profit or loss

Less: Other financial assets

through profit or loss relate to money market funds. Line ‘Other financial assets’ of the consolidated 
balance sheet includes derivative financial instruments of €97.5 million (31 December 2022: €35.3 
million) and related party loans receivable of €1.8 million (31 December 2022: €1.8 million).

26. Net debt continued

The ‘Other non-cash movements’ primarily include the transfer from long-term to short-term liabilities 
and interest incurred as well as the decrease to borrowings in 2022, resulting from the change in control 
of Multon (refer to Note 16).

Commercial paper programme 
In October 2013 the Group established a €1.0 billion Euro commercial paper programme (the ‘CP 
programme’), which was updated in September 2014, in May 2017, in May 2020 and then in May 2023, 
to further diversify its short-term funding sources. The Euro commercial paper notes may be issued 
either as non-interest-bearing notes sold at a discount or as interest-bearing notes at a fixed or floating 
rate. All commercial paper issued under the CP programme must be repaid within 7 to 364 days. 
The CP programme has been granted the Short Term Euro Paper (STEP) label and commercial paper 
is issued through Coca-Cola HBC’s fully-owned subsidiary Coca-Cola HBC Finance B.V. and is fully, 
unconditionally and irrevocably guaranteed by Coca-Cola HBC AG. The outstanding amount under 
the CP programme as at 31 December 2023 was €211.0 million (2022: €167.5 million).

Committed credit facilities
In April 2019, the Group updated its then-existing €500.0 million syndicated revolving credit facility, 
which was set to expire in June 2021. The updated syndicated revolving credit facility has been 
increased to €800.0 million and has been extended to April 2024, with the option to be extended up for 
two more years until April 2026. In March 2020, the Company exercised its extension option and the 
facility was extended to April 2025. In April 2021, the Company exercised its second option to further 
extend the maturity of the syndicated loan facility to April 2026. This facility can be used for general 
corporate purposes and carries a floating interest rate over EURIBOR. No amounts have been drawn 
under the syndicated revolving credit facility since inception. The borrower in the syndicated revolving 
credit facility is Coca-Cola HBC’s fully-owned subsidiary Coca-Cola HBC Finance B.V. and any amounts 
drawn under the facility are fully, unconditionally and irrevocably guaranteed by Coca-Cola HBC AG.

In December 2019, the Group established a loan facility of US Dollar 85.0 million to finance the purchase 
of production equipment by the Group’s subsidiary in Nigeria. The facility has been drawn down by 
Nigerian Bottling Company (NBC) over the course of 2020 and 2021, maturing in 2027. The obligations 
under this facility are guaranteed by Coca-Cola HBC AG. As at 31 December 2023, the outstanding 
liability amounted to €45.4 million (2022: €59.3 million).

Uncommitted loan agreement
In August 2022, the Group established an uncommitted money market loan agreement of €250.0 
million which was subsequently reduced to €200.0 million in October 2022. The loan agreement can 
be used for general corporate purposes. No amounts have been drawn under the money market loan 
agreement since its inception. The borrower in the money market loan agreement is Coca-Cola HBC’s 
fully-owned subsidiary Coca-Cola HBC Finance B.V.

Euro medium-term note programme
In June 2013, the Group established a new €3.0 billion Euro medium-term note programme (the 
‘EMTN programme’). The EMTN programme was updated in September 2014, September 2015, April 
2019, when it was increased to €5.0 billion, April 2020, September 2021, September 2022 and then in 
December 2023. Notes are issued under the EMTN programme through Coca-Cola HBC’s fully-owned 
subsidiary Coca-Cola HBC Finance B.V. and are fully, unconditionally and irrevocably guaranteed by 
Coca-Cola HBC AG.

In March 2016, Coca-Cola HBC Finance B.V. completed the issue of a €600 million Euro-denominated 
fixed rate bond maturing in November 2024. The coupon rate of the bond is 1.875% which, including the 
reclassification of the loss on the forward starting swap contracts to the income statement over the 
term of the fixed rate bond, results in an effective interest rate of 2.99%. The net proceeds of the new 
issue were used to partially repay €214.6 million of the 4.25%, €600 million seven-year fixed rate notes 
due in November 2016. The remaining €385.4 million was repaid in November 2016 upon its maturity.

In May 2019, Coca-Cola HBC Finance B.V. completed the issue of a €700 million Euro-denominated 
fixed rate bond maturing in May 2027 with a coupon rate of 1% and the issue of a €600 million Euro-
denominated fixed rate bond maturing in May 2031 with a coupon rate of 1.625%. The net proceeds 
of the new issue were used to partially repay €236.6 million of the 2.375%, €800 million seven-year 
fixed rate bond due in June 2020, while the remaining €563.4 million was repaid in June 2020 upon 
its maturity.

In November 2019, Coca-Cola HBC Finance B.V. completed the issue of a €500 million Euro-
denominated fixed rate bond maturing in November 2029 with a coupon rate of 0.625%.

In September 2022, Coca-Cola HBC Finance B.V. completed the issue of a €500 million Euro-
denominated fixed rate Green bond maturing in September 2025 with a coupon rate of 2.75%.

As at 31 December 2023, a total of €2.9 billion in notes issued under the EMTN programme 
were outstanding.

Notes to the consolidated financial statements continued

As at 31 December 2023, time deposits of €54.8 million (2022: €529.5 million), which do not meet 
the definition of cash and cash equivalents, are recorded as other financial assets.

Cash and cash equivalents include an amount of €92.5 million (€120.9 million as at 31 December 2022) 
equivalent in Nigerian Naira. This includes an amount of €nil (€10.6 million as at 31 December 2022) 
equivalent in Nigerian Naira, which related to the outstanding balance held for the repayment of NBC’s 
former minority shareholders, following the 2011 acquisition of non-controlling interests. The financial 
liability regarding former minority shareholders was extinguished in 2023.

The amount of dividends payable to the Company by its operating subsidiaries is subject to, among 
other restrictions, general limitations imposed by the corporate laws and exchange control restrictions 
of the respective jurisdictions where those subsidiaries are organised and operate. Also, there are 
fund transfer restrictions in certain countries in which we operate, in particular Belarus, Nigeria, Egypt, 
Serbia and Ukraine, where these restrictions do not have a material impact on the Group’s liquidity, 
as the amounts of cash and cash equivalents held in such countries are generally retained for capital 
expenditure, working capital and dividend distribution purposes. Intra-group dividends paid by certain 
of our subsidiaries are also subject to withholding taxes. 

As a result of sanctions and other regulations, there have been changes in required regulatory 
approvals, potentially impacting the transfer and usage of cash outside of Russia. Cash and cash 
equivalents held by the Group’s operations in Russia (including Multon) amounted to €278.7 million 
equivalent in Russian Rouble, US Dollar and Euro as at 31 December 2023 (2022: €155.3 million). The 
aforementioned changes restrict the usage of cash held in Russia outside the country; however, they 
are not expected to have a material impact on the Group’s liquidity, as the cash and cash equivalents 
held in Russia are expected to be used in the forthcoming financial periods primarily for working capital 
purposes by the Russian operations.

27. Equity

Accounting policy
Share capital
Coca-Cola HBC has only one class of shares, ordinary shares. When new shares are issued, they 
are recorded in share capital at their par value. The excess of the issue price over the par value is 
recorded in the share premium reserve. Incremental external costs directly attributable to the 
issue of new shares or to the process of returning capital to shareholders are recorded in equity as a 
deduction, net of tax, in the share premium reserve.

Where the Group purchases the Company’s equity instruments, for example as the result of a share 
buyback programme, the consideration paid, including any directly attributable incremental costs 
(net of income taxes), is deducted from equity attributable to the owners of the parent as treasury 
shares until the shares are cancelled or reissued. Where such ordinary shares are subsequently 
reissued, any consideration received, net of any directly attributable incremental transaction costs 
and the related income tax effects, is included in equity attributable to the owners of the parent.

Dividends
Dividends are recorded in the Group’s consolidated financial statements, against the relevant equity 
component, in the period in which they are approved by the Group’s shareholders.

The Group reorganisation reserve relates to the impact from adjusting share capital, share premium 
and treasury shares to reflect the respective statutory amounts of Coca-Cola HBC on 25 April 2013, 
together with the transaction costs incurred by the latter, relating primarily to the redomiciliation of the 
Group and its admission to listing in the premium segment of the London Stock Exchange, following 
successful completion of the voluntary share exchange offer (refer also to Note 1). These transactions 
were treated as a reorganisation of an existing entity that has not changed the substance of the 
reporting entity.

In 2023, the share capital of Coca-Cola HBC increased by the issue of 891,127 (2022: 290,677) 
new ordinary shares following the exercise of stock options pursuant to the Coca-Cola HBC AG’s 
employees’ stock option plan. Total proceeds from the issuance of the shares under the stock option 
plan amounted to €14.2 million (2022: €4.7 million).

Following the above changes, on 31 December 2023 the share capital of the Group amounted to 
€2,030.3 million and comprised 372,977,222 shares with a nominal value of CHF 6.70 each.

b) Dividends
On 21 June 2022, the shareholders of Coca-Cola HBC AG at the Annual General Meeting approved a 
dividend distribution of €0.71 per share. The total dividend amounted to €262.6 million and was paid 
on 2 August 2022. Of this, an amount of €2.4 million related to shares held by the Group.

The shareholders of Coca-Cola HBC AG approved a dividend distribution of €0.78 per share at the 
Annual General Meeting held on 17 May 2023. The total dividend amounted to €289.9 million and was 
paid on 19 June 2023. Of this, an amount of €2.7 million related to shares held by the Group.

The Board of Directors of Coca-Cola HBC AG has proposed a €0.93 dividend per share in respect 
of 2023. If approved by the shareholders of Coca-Cola HBC AG, this dividend will be paid in 2024.

Treasury shares
Treasury shares held by the Group represent shares acquired following approval of share buyback 
programmes, forfeited shares under the equity compensation plan operated by the Group, as well as 
shares representing the initial ordinary shares of Coca-Cola HBC acquired from Kar-Tess Holding. 

On 20 November 2023, the Group announced the launch of a share buyback programme of up to a 
maximum of 18,000,000 ordinary shares to be purchased in a manner consistent with the Company’s 
general authority to repurchase shares granted at its Annual General Meeting on 17 May 2023 and any 
such authority granted at its subsequent annual general meetings. The programme commenced on 
21 November 2023 and is expected to run for a period of around two years. As at 31 December 2023, 
the Group had purchased shares under the programme for a total consideration of €42.6 million, which 
was reflected in line ‘Acquisition of treasury shares’ of the consolidated cash flow statement and the 
consolidated statement of changes in equity.

An amount of €29.7 million in 2023 (2022: €15.4 million) relates to treasury shares provided to 
employees in connection with vested performance share and deferred management incentive share 
awards under the Group’s employee incentive scheme, which was reflected as an appropriation 
of reserves between ‘Treasury shares’ and ‘Other reserves’, more specifically the ‘Stock option, 
performance share and deferred management incentive share reserve’ in the consolidated statement 
of changes in equity.

As at 31 December 2023, 6,068,537 (2022: 5,386,717) treasury shares were held by the Group.

Exchange equalisation reserve
The exchange equalisation reserve comprises all foreign exchange differences arising from the 
translation of the financial statements of Group entities with functional currencies other than the Euro.

Other reserves
Hedging reserve
The hedging reserve reflects changes in the fair values of derivatives accounted for as cash flow 
hedges, net of the deferred tax related to such balances.

Tax-free and statutory reserves
The tax-free reserve includes investment amounts exempt from tax according to incentive legislation, 
other tax-free income or income taxed at source. Statutory reserves are particular to the various 
countries in which the Group operates. The amount of statutory reserves of the parent entity,  
Coca-Cola HBC AG, is €nil. During 2023, a net amount of €4.7 million was reclassified from retained 
earnings to statutory reserves relating to the formation of additional reserves by the Group’s 
subsidiaries (2022: €5.7 million net release of statutory reserves). 

Stock option, performance share and deferred management incentive share reserve
The stock option, performance share and deferred management incentive share reserve represents 
the cumulative charge to the income statement for employee stock option, performance share 
and deferred management incentive share awards less the vested performance share and deferred 
management incentive share awards.

Other
Other reserves are particular to the various countries in which the Group operates and include reserve 
for shares held for the Group’s employee share purchase plan, which is an equity compensation plan 
in which eligible employees may participate, as well as the Group’s share of changes in other reserves 
of equity method investments.

28. Related party transactions

a) The Coca-Cola Company
As at 31 December 2023, The Coca-Cola Company indirectly owned 21.0% (2022: 21.0%) of the 
issued share capital of Coca-Cola HBC. Coca-Cola HBC’s business relationship with The Coca-Cola 
Company is mainly governed by the bottlers’ agreements with The Coca-Cola Company, which are an 
important element of Coca-Cola HBC’s business. The Coca-Cola Company considers Coca-Cola HBC 
to be a ‘key bottler’. Following their expiry on 31 December 2023, all bottlers’ agreements in the CCH 
territories where CCH Group produces, sells and distributes The Coca-Cola Company’s trademarked 
beverages were renewed with effect as from 1 January 2024, for an initial term of ten years, with the 
option for the CCH Group to request an extension (at the discretion of The Coca-Cola Company) 
for another ten years upon expiry of the initial term. All the bottlers’ agreements entered into by 
The Coca-Cola Company and Coca-Cola HBC are Standard International Bottlers’ (‘SIB’) agreements. 
The terms of the bottlers’ agreements grant Coca-Cola HBC the right to produce and the exclusive 
right to sell and distribute the beverages of The Coca-Cola Company in each of the countries in which 
the Group operates. Consequently, Coca-Cola HBC is obliged to purchase all concentrate for The 
Coca-Cola Company’s beverages from The Coca-Cola Company, or its designee, in the ordinary 
course of business.

The Coca-Cola Company owns or has applied for the trademarks that identify its beverages in each of 
the countries in which the Group operates. The Coca-Cola Company has authorised Coca-Cola HBC 
and certain of its subsidiaries to use the trademark ‘Coca-Cola’ in their corporate names.

Accounting policy
Contributions from The Coca-Cola Company
The Coca-Cola Company participates at its discretion in shared marketing programmes with 
the Group to promote the sale of The Coca-Cola Company products. Where such cooperative 
arrangements are entered into, the Group receives contributions from The Coca-Cola Company 
to offset the cost it has incurred for price support and marketing and promotional campaigns in 
respect of specific customers as well as general marketing programmes. 

These contributions from The Coca-Cola Company are classified as other income and are accrued 
and matched to the expenditure to which they relate, in line with the substance of the arrangement 
with The Coca-Cola Company as described above. These contributions are presented as follows:

•  to the extent that they relate to compensation for costs incurred by the Group for price support 
and marketing and promotional campaigns in respect of specific customers, which have been 
treated as a deduction from revenue from contracts with customers, they are presented as an 
offset against such deductions from revenue and accordingly, included within net sales revenue 
in the consolidated income statement; and

•  to the extent that they relate to compensation for expenditure incurred by the Group in 

connection with general marketing programmes, they are presented as an offset against 
this expenditure and accordingly, included within operating expenses in the consolidated 
income statement.

Contributions received from The Coca-Cola Company for marketing and promotional incentives 
during the year amounted to €125.1 million (2022: €108.6 million) which can be analysed as follows: 
contributions made by The Coca-Cola Company to Coca-Cola HBC for price support and marketing 
and promotional campaigns in respect of specific customers in 2023 totalled €59.3 million (2022: €59.9 
million) and were recognised as an offset against the relevant incentives provided to those customers 
within net sales revenue (refer to Note 8), while contributions made by The Coca-Cola Company to 
Coca-Cola HBC for general marketing programmes in 2023 totalled €65.8 million (2022: €48.7 million) 
and were recognised against the relevant cost incurred within operating expenses (refer to Note 9). The 
Coca-Cola Company has also customarily made additional payments for marketing and advertising 
directly to suppliers as part of the shared marketing arrangements. The proportion of direct and 
indirect payments, made at The Coca-Cola Company’s discretion, will not necessarily be the same from 
year to year.

As at 31 December 2023, the Group had a total amount due from The Coca-Cola Company of €42.8 
million (2022: €45.3 million), and a total amount due to The Coca-Cola Company of €273.4 million (2022: 
€226.9 million).

Also, refer to Note 24 regarding consideration paid to The Coca-Cola Company during 2022 for the 
purchase of the convertible loan and shares held by non-controlling interests in connection with the 
acquisition of Coca-Cola Bottling Company of Egypt S.A.E.

b) Frigoglass S.A. (‘Frigoglass’), Kar-Tess Holding and AG Leventis (Nigeria) Ltd
Truad Verwaltungs AG currently indirectly owns 99.3% (31 December 2022: 99.3%) of AG Leventis 
(Nigeria) Ltd and also indirectly controls Kar-Tess Holding, which holds approximately 23.0% (31 
December 2022: 23.0%) of Coca-Cola HBC’s total issued capital.

As at 31 December 2022, Truad Verwaltungs AG also indirectly owned 48.4% of Frigoglass. Frigoglass, 
a company listed on the Athens Exchange, is a manufacturer of coolers, cooler parts, glass bottles, 
crowns and plastics. The Group entered into a supply agreement with Frigoglass for the purchase of 
cooling equipment in 1999. The supply agreement was extended in 2004, 2008, 2013, 2018 and, most 
recently, in 2021, on substantially similar terms. The current agreement expires on 31 December 2025. 
In April 2023, Frigoglass restructured its debt, which resulted in changes to its ownership structure. The 
restructured Frigoglass Group no longer meets the definition of related party as per IAS 24 ‘Related 
party disclosures’ for Coca-Cola HBC AG. Accordingly, transactions with Frigoglass and its subsidiaries1 
up to April 2023 and the year ended 31 December 2022 are presented below:

29. Share-based payments

Accounting policy 
Stock option, performance share award and deferred management incentive share plan
Coca-Cola HBC provides equity-settled share-based payments to its senior managers in the form 
of an employee stock option, performance share award and deferred management incentive plan 
(the ‘Plan’).

Stock options under the Plan are measured at fair value at the date of grant. Fair value reflects 
the parameters of the compensation plan, the risk-free interest rate, the expected volatility, the 
dividend yield and the early exercise experience under the Plan. Expected volatility is determined by 
calculating the historical volatility of Coca-Cola HBC’s share price over previous years. The fair value 
determined at the grant date is expensed on a straight-line basis over the vesting period. 

The Plan offers a specified number of performance share awards and deferred management 
incentive plan shares (the ‘deferred MIP shares’) that vest three years after the grant. The fair value 
is determined at the grant date and reflects the parameters of the compensation plan, the dividend 
yield and the closing share price on the date of grant. The fair value determined at the grant date is 
expensed on a straight-line basis over the vesting period. At the end of each reporting period the 
Group revises its estimates of the number of shares that are expected to vest based on non-market 
conditions, and recognises the impact of the revision to original estimates, if any, in the income 
statement with a corresponding adjustment to equity.

When the terms of an equity-settled award are modified, the minimum expense recognised is the 
grant date fair value of the unmodified award, provided the original vesting terms of the award 
are met. An additional expense, measured as at the date of modification, is recognised for any 
modification that increases the total fair value of the share-based payment transaction, or is 
otherwise beneficial to the employee.

Employee Share Purchase Plan
The Group operates an employee share purchase plan (the ‘ESPP’), an equity compensation 
plan in which eligible employees can participate. The Group makes contributions to the plan for 
participating employees and recognises expenses over the vesting period of the contributions.

The charge included in employee costs regarding share-based payments for the years ended 
31 December is analysed as follows:

Terms and conditions
Stock option, performance share award and deferred management incentive share plan
The Group has not issued any new stock options since 2014. Based on Plan rules, senior managers 
were granted awards of stock options, based on performance, potentiality and level of responsibility. 
Options were granted at an exercise price equal to the closing price of the Company’s shares trading 
on the London Stock Exchange on the day of the grant and vested in one third increments each year 
for three years. Options can be exercised for up to ten years from the date of award. When the options 
are exercised, the proceeds received by the Group, net of any transaction costs, are credited to share 
capital (at the nominal value) and share premium. 

Since 2015, performance shares are the primary long-term award. Senior managers are granted 
performance share awards, which have a three-year vesting period and are linked to Group-specific 
key performance indicators. The closing price of the Company’s shares trading on the London Stock 
Exchange on the day of the grant is used to determine the number of performance share awards 
granted. In 2018, the Group modified the performance share plan, in order for eligible employees 
to receive upon vesting, additionally to the specific number of shares, the value of dividends 
corresponding to the years from grant till vest date, subject to the approval of the Remuneration 
Committee. Furthermore, 50% of the Chief Executive Officer’s annual bonus awarded under the terms 
of the management incentive plan is deferred into shares, which vest over a three-year period, subject 
to service conditions. No dividend-equivalent shares corresponding to the years from grant till vest 
date are provided, in connection with the deferred shares granted.

Employee Share Purchase Plan
The Employee Share Purchase Plan is administered by a Plan Administrator. Under the terms of this 
plan, employees have the opportunity to invest 1% to 15% of their salary in ordinary Coca-Cola HBC 
shares by contributing to the plan through a payroll deduction. Employee deductions are used monthly 
to purchase ordinary Coca-Cola HBC shares in the open market (London Stock Exchange).

Coca-Cola HBC will match employee contributions up to a maximum of 3% of the employee’s salary. 
Employer matching cash contributions vest one year after the grant, at which time they are used to 
purchase matching shares on the open market that are immediately vested. Dividends received in 
respect of shares held under this plan are used to purchase additional shares at the time of dividend 
distribution. Shares are held under the Plan Administrator. For employees resident in Greece, Coca-
Cola HBC matches the employees’ contribution with an annual employer contribution of up to 5% of the 
employees’ salary that vests annually in December of each year.

30. Contingencies

In relation to the Greek Competition Authority’s decision of 25 January 2002, one of Coca-Cola 
Hellenic Bottling Company S.A.’s competitors had filed a lawsuit against Coca-Cola Hellenic Bottling 
Company S.A. claiming damages in an amount of €7.7 million. The court of first instance heard the 
case on 21 January 2009 and subsequently rejected the lawsuit. The plaintiff appealed the judgement 
and on 9 December 2013 the Athens Court of Appeals rejected the plaintiff’s appeal. On 19 April 2014, 
the same plaintiff filed a new lawsuit against Coca-Cola Hellenic Bottling Company S.A. (following the 
spin-off, Coca-Cola HBC Greece S.A.I.C.) claiming payment of €7.5 million as compensation for losses 
and moral damages for alleged anti-competitive commercial practices of Coca-Cola Hellenic Bottling 
Company S.A. between 1994 and 2013. On 21 December 2018, the plaintiff served their withdrawal 
from the lawsuit. However, on 20 June 2019, the same plaintiff filed a new lawsuit against Coca-Cola 
HBC Greece S.A.I.C. claiming payment of €10.1 million as compensation for losses and moral damages 
again for alleged anti-competitive commercial practices of Coca-Cola Hellenic Bottling Company S.A. 
for the same period between 1994 and 2013. On 16 July 2021, the Athens Multimember Court of First 
Instance issued its judgement number 1929/2021 (hereinafter the ‘Judgement’), which adjudicates 
that Coca-Cola HBC Greece S.A.I.C. is obliged to pay to the plaintiff an amount of circa €0.9 million plus 
interest as of 31 December 2003. Both Coca-Cola HBC Greece S.A.I.C and the plaintiff have appealed 
against this decision to the court of appeals. Both appeals were heard on 19 January 2023. The decision 
is pending to be issued. Management believes that any liability to the Group that may arise as a result 
of these pending legal proceedings will not have a material adverse effect on the results of operations, 
cash flows, or the financial position of the Group taken as a whole.

With respect to the investigation of the Greek Competition Commission initiated on 6 September 
2016, regarding Coca-Cola HBC Greece S.A.I.C.’s operations in certain commercial practices in the 
non-alcoholic beverages market, the Rapporteur of the Greek Competition Commission appointed 
for this case issued her Statement of Objections on 5 July 2021, alleging that Coca-Cola HBC Greece 
S.A.I.C. undertook a series of anti-competitive practices in the market of instant consumption for cola 
and non-cola carbonated soft drinks, thereby excluding competitors and limiting their growth potential. 
Coca-Cola HBC Greece S.A.I.C. has vigorously defended its commercial practices, in rebuttal of the 
allegations set out in the Statement of Objections. The hearing of the case, before the plenary session 
of the Greek Competition Commission, was concluded on 29 November 2021 and the supplementary 
briefs of the parties were submitted on 16 December 2021. On 3 November 2022, the Hellenic 
Competition Commission notified Coca-Cola HBC Greece S.A.I.C. of its ruling on the case, according 
to which Coca-Cola HBC Greece S.A.I.C. allegedly abused its dominant position in the Greek immediate 
consumption market segment for cola and non-cola carbonated soft drinks. The Hellenic Competition 
Commission ruling imposed on Coca-Cola HBC Greece S.A.I.C. a fine of €10.3 million, as well as a 
behavioural remedy in relation to beverage coolers valid until the end of 2024. Coca-Cola HBC Greece 
S.A.I.C. paid the fine in May 2023. Coca-Cola HBC Greece S.A.I.C. strongly disagrees with this ruling and 
has challenged it before the competent Court of Appeal. The hearing date of the appeal is set for 26 
September 2024.

In 1992, our subsidiary NBC acquired a manufacturing facility in Nigeria from Vacunak, a Nigerian 
company. In 1994, Vacunak filed a lawsuit against NBC, alleging that a representative of NBC had 
orally agreed to rescind the sale agreement and instead enter into a lease agreement with Vacunak. 
As part of its lawsuit, Vacunak sought compensation for rent and loss of business opportunities. NBC 
discontinued all use of the facility in 1995. On 19 August 2013, NBC received the written judgement 
of the Nigerian court of first instance issued on 28 June 2012 providing for damages of approximately 
€7.8 million. The Appeal Court dismissed NBC’s appeal and Vacunak’s cross-appeal and affirmed the 
judgement of the first instance court in 2023. Both NBC and Vacunak have filed an appeal against the 
judgement before the Supreme Court. Based on advice from NBC’s outside legal counsel, we believe 
that it is unlikely that NBC will suffer material financial losses from this case. We have consequently not 
provided for any losses in relation to this case.

The tax filings of the Group and its subsidiaries are routinely subjected to audit by tax authorities 
in most of the jurisdictions in which the Group conducts business. These audits may result in 
assessments of additional taxes. The Group provides for additional tax in relation to the outcome of 
such tax assessments, to the extent that a liability is probable and estimable.

The Group is also involved in various other legal proceedings. Management believes that any liability to 
the Group that may arise as a result of these pending legal proceedings will not have a material adverse 
effect on the results of operations, cash flows, or the financial position of the Group taken as a whole.

Considering the above, there have been no significant adverse changes in contingencies since 31 
December 2022 (as described in our 2022 Integrated Annual Report available on Coca-Cola HBC’s 
web site: www.coca-colahellenic.com).

31. Commitments

Capital commitments
As at 31 December 2023, the Group had capital commitments for property, plant and equipment 
amounting to €203.4 million (2022: €210.5 million). Of this, €1.5 million are related to the Group’s share 
of the commitments arising from joint ventures (2022: €0.5 million).

Capital commitments for 2023 include total future minimum lease payments under leases not 
yet commenced to which the Group was committed as at 31 December 2023 of €10.0 million 
(2022: €28.8 million).

32. Post balance sheet events

In late January 2024, the Nigerian Naira depreciated against the US Dollar by approximately 33% 
compared with the December 2023 respective rate. The Group has assessed the impact of 
the devaluation to its financial position as at 31 December 2023 and this is not material. We are 
continuously monitoring the situation to ensure that timely actions are undertaken as planned to 
minimise the adverse impact from the currency devaluation to the Group’s business in Nigeria.

In February 2024, Coca-Cola HBC AG’s wholly-owned subsidiary Coca-Cola HBC Finance B.V. 
completed the issue of a €600 million Euro-denominated fixed rate bond maturing in February 2028 
with a coupon rate of 3.375%. The new bond was issued under the Group’s €5.0 billion Euro medium-
term note programme and it is guaranteed by Coca-Cola HBC AG. At the same time, the Group 
unwound the €525.0 million nominal amount swaptions, which had been designated as cash flow 
hedges in connection with the interest rate risk of the new bond. As a result, effective February 2024, 
the relevant accumulated valuation loss of €2.9 million recorded in other comprehensive income is 
being reclassified to the income statement over the term of the swaptions, while the settlement will 
take place in June and July 2024. 

In early March 2024, the Egyptian Pound depreciated against the US Dollar by approximately 
39% compared with the December 2023 respective rate. The Group has assessed the impact of 
the devaluation to its financial position as at 31 December 2023 and this is not material. We are 
continuously monitoring the situation to ensure that timely actions are undertaken as planned to 
minimise the adverse impact from the currency devaluation to the Group’s business in Egypt.

On 13 March 2024, the Remuneration Committee granted performance share and deferred 
MIP share awards of €25.3 million equivalent, under the performance share award and deferred 
management incentive share plan, which have a three-year vesting period. The number of shares 
granted is calculated by dividing the value of the grant with the closing share price as of the date 
of the approval of the grant.

Coca-Cola HBC AG

Report on the audit of the consolidated financial statements

Opinion
We have audited the consolidated financial statements of Coca-Cola HBC AG and its subsidiaries 
(the Group), which comprise the consolidated income statement and consolidated statement of 
comprehensive income for the year ended 31 December 2023, the consolidated balance sheet as at 
31 December 2023 and the consolidated statement of changes in equity and consolidated cash flow 
statement for the year then ended, and notes to the consolidated financial statements, including 
material accounting policy information.

In our opinion, the consolidated financial statements (pages 194 to 265) give a true and fair view 
of the consolidated financial position of the Group as at 31 December 2023 and its consolidated 
financial performance and its consolidated cash flows for the year then ended in accordance with 
IFRS Accounting Standards as adopted by the European Union (EU) and comply with Swiss law.

Basis for opinion
We conducted our audit in accordance with Swiss law, International Standards on Auditing (ISAs) and 
Swiss Standards on Auditing (SA-CH). Our responsibilities under those provisions and standards are 
further described in the ‘Auditor’s responsibilities for the audit of the consolidated financial statements’ 
section of our report. We are independent of the Group in accordance with the provisions of Swiss 
law and the requirements of the Swiss audit profession, as well as the International Code of Ethics for 
Professional Accountants (including International Independence Standards) issued by the International 
Ethics Standards Board for Accountants (IESBA Code), and we have fulfilled our other ethical 
responsibilities in accordance with these requirements.

We believe that the audit evidence we have obtained is sufficient and appropriate to provide a basis for 
our opinion.

Our audit approach
Overview

Materiality

Audit scope

Overall Group materiality: €51 million

We conducted full scope audit procedures on the financial information of 17 
subsidiaries in 15 countries spread across all of the Group’s reportable segments. 
We also conducted procedures around specific account balances and transactions 
and analytical review procedures for other subsidiaries and Group functions. Our 
audit scope addressed 82% of consolidated net sales revenue, 80% of consolidated 
profit before tax and 83% of consolidated total assets of the Group.

Key audit matters

As key audit matters the following areas of focus have been identified:
•  Goodwill and indefinite-lived intangible assets impairment assessment
•  Uncertain tax positions

Materiality
The scope of our audit was influenced by our application of materiality. Our audit opinion aims to 
provide reasonable assurance that the consolidated financial statements are free from material 
misstatement. Misstatements may arise due to fraud or error. They are considered material if, 
individually or in aggregate, they could reasonably be expected to influence the economic decisions 
of users taken on the basis of the consolidated financial statements.

Based on our professional judgement, we determined certain quantitative thresholds for materiality, 
including the overall Group materiality for the consolidated financial statements as a whole as set out 
in the table below. These, together with qualitative considerations, helped us to determine the scope 
of our audit and the nature, timing and extent of our audit procedures and to evaluate the effect of 
misstatements, both individually and in aggregate, on the consolidated financial statements as a whole.

Overall Group materiality

€51 million

Benchmark applied

Adjusted profit before tax

Rationale for 
the materiality 
benchmark applied

We consider that the income statement remains the principal measure 
used by the shareholders in assessing the underlying performance of 
the Group. Therefore, an approach to materiality based on the profit 
before tax has been applied. However, we have adjusted this benchmark 
by items which, in our view, are considered unusual and infrequently 
occurring in nature such as the impairment charges. Therefore, we 
have used adjusted profit before tax which is a generally accepted 
auditing benchmark.

We agreed with the Audit and Risk Committee that we would report to them misstatements above 
€2.5 million identified during our audit as well as any misstatements below that amount which, in our 
view, warranted reporting for qualitative reasons.

Audit scope
We tailored the scope of our audit in order to perform sufficient work to enable us to provide an opinion 
on the consolidated financial statements as a whole, taking into account the structure of the Group, the 
accounting processes and controls, and the industry in which the Group operates.

The Group operates through its trading subsidiary undertakings in Nigeria, Egypt and 27 countries in 
Europe, as set out in Note 1 ‘General information’ and Note 7 ‘Segmental analysis’ of the consolidated 
financial statements. The processing of the accounting records for these subsidiary undertakings 
is largely centralised in a shared services centre in Bulgaria, except for the subsidiary undertakings 
in Armenia, Belarus, Egypt, Moldova, North Macedonia, Russia and Ukraine which process their 
accounting records locally. The Group also operates centralised treasury functions in the Netherlands 
and in Greece and a centralised procurement function for key raw materials in the Netherlands.

Based on their significance to the financial statements and in light of the key audit matters as noted 
above, we identified 17 subsidiary undertakings in 15 countries spread across all of the Group’s 
reportable segments (including the significant trading subsidiary undertakings in Italy, Nigeria, 
Poland, Romania, Russia and Switzerland) which, based on our scoping analysis, required a full scope 
audit of their financial information. In addition, audit procedures were performed with respect to the 
centralised treasury functions by the group engagement team and with respect to the centralised 
procurement function by the component audit team in the Netherlands. The group engagement team 
also performed analytical review and other procedures on balances and transactions of subsidiary 
undertakings not covered by the procedures described above.

As the Swiss statutory auditor, we issued group audit instructions to PwC Greece, who has the 
responsibility as the group engagement team for the Group’s reporting requirements for the 
London and Athens Stock Exchanges. These instructions covered the scope of our group audit to 
enable us to fulfil our responsibilities under Swiss law. As the Swiss statutory auditor, we had ongoing 
interactions with the group engagement team in Greece to be continuously updated and to monitor 
their progress and the results of their procedures. We reviewed the instructions which PwC Greece 
issued to component audit teams including centralised audit procedures performed at the shared 
services centre in Bulgaria and shared audit comfort with component teams as it relates to IT general 
controls and cybersecurity risks. We reviewed working papers and undertook additional interactions as 
considered necessary depending on the significance of the accounting and audit matters. The Group 
consolidation, financial statement disclosures and a number of other areas that involve significant 
judgement and estimates, including goodwill and intangible assets and the Group’s overall going 
concern assessment, were audited by the Swiss statutory auditor and the group engagement team of 
PwC Greece.

As the Swiss statutory auditor, we held frequent virtual meetings to oversee the work performed by the 
group engagement and component audit teams. We attended such meetings for Italy, Russia (including 
Multon), Nigeria, Romania, Switzerland, Austria, Bulgaria, Greece, Hungary, Northern Ireland, Poland, 
Serbia, the Netherlands, and Egypt. As the Swiss statutory auditor, we also held physical meetings 
and discussions with the management of the trading subsidiary in Switzerland to discuss business 
performance and outlook, matters relating to regulation and taxation, as well as any specific accounting 
and auditing matters identified, including fraud and internal controls.

Based on the above, the subsidiaries which were in scope for the purposes of the group audit 
accounted for 82% of consolidated net sales revenue, 80% of consolidated profit before tax and 83% 
of consolidated total assets of the Group. This, together with the additional procedures performed 
at Group level, provided us with sufficient and appropriate evidence for our audit opinion on the 
consolidated financial statements.

Key audit matters
Key audit matters are those matters that, in our professional judgement, were of most significance in 
our audit of the consolidated financial statements of the current period. These matters were addressed 
in the context of our audit of the consolidated financial statements as a whole, and in forming our 
opinion thereon, and we do not provide a separate opinion on these matters.

How our audit addressed the key audit matter

Refer to Note 14 ‘Intangible assets’ of the 
consolidated financial statements.

Goodwill and indefinite-lived intangible assets as at 
31 December 2023 amount to €1,820.8 million and 
€738.2 million, respectively.

The above amounts have been allocated to 
individual cash-generating units (‘CGUs’), which in 
accordance with International Accounting Standard 
36 ‘Impairment of Assets’ (‘IAS 36’) require the 
performance of an impairment assessment at 
least annually or whenever there is an indication of 
impairment. The impairment assessment involves 
the determination of the recoverable amount of the 
CGU, being the higher of the value-in-use and the 
fair value less costs of disposal.

We consider this area as a key audit matter due 
to the magnitude of goodwill and indefinite-lived 
intangible assets balances and because the 
determination of whether elements of goodwill and 
of indefinite-lived intangible assets are impaired 
involves complex and subjective estimations made 
by management about the future results of the 
CGUs. These estimations include assumptions 
surrounding revenue growth rates, costs, foreign 
exchange rates and discount rates.

Management closely monitored the increasing 
macroeconomic uncertainty in Egypt throughout 
the previous and current year and as a result of 
the annual impairment assessment, a charge 
of €109.4 million for goodwill impairment was 
recorded for the Egyptian CGU. Relevant disclosure 
has been included in the financial statements in 
respect of this CGU.

No impairment was identified for the 
remaining CGUs.

We evaluated the appropriateness of 
management’s identification of the Group’s CGUs, 
the process by which management prepared the 
CGUs’ value-in-use calculations and the design and 
operating effectiveness of related control activities.

We tested the mathematical accuracy of the CGUs’ 
value-in-use calculations and compared the cash 
flow projections included therein to the financial 
budgets, approved by the directors, covering a 
one-year period, and management’s projections 
for the subsequent four years. In addition, we 
assessed management’s past forecasting accuracy 
by comparing key elements of the prior year 
projections with actual results.

We challenged management’s cash flow 
projections in relation to the assumptions applied 
to the value-in-use calculations, taking into 
account the ongoing challenging macroeconomic 
environment in several countries.

With the support of our valuation specialists, we 
assessed the appropriateness of the methodology 
and valuation techniques used as well as certain 
assumptions including discount, annual revenue 
growth and perpetuity revenue growth rates.

We performed our independent sensitivity analyses 
on the key drivers of the value-in-use calculations 
for the CGUs with significant balances of goodwill 
and indefinite-lived intangible assets.

Based on our work, we concluded that the results 
reached by management in relation to the 
impairment testing of goodwill and indefinite-lived 
intangible assets were supported by assumptions 
within reasonable ranges.

We evaluated the related disclosures provided in 
the consolidated financial statements in Note 14 
‘Intangible assets’ and concluded that these 
are appropriate.

Refer to Note 11 ‘Taxation’ and Note 30 
‘Contingencies’ of the consolidated financial 
statements.

The Group operates in numerous tax jurisdictions 
and is subject to periodic challenges, in the normal 
course of business, by local tax authorities on a 
range of matters including corporate tax, transfer 
pricing arrangements and indirect taxes. As at 
31 December 2023, the Group has provisions for 
uncertain tax positions of €82.8 million that are 
classified in current tax liabilities, current tax assets 
and deferred tax liabilities.

The impact of changes in local tax regulations and 
ongoing inspections by local tax authorities, could 
materially impact the amounts recorded in the 
consolidated financial statements.

Where the amount of tax payable is uncertain, 
the Group establishes provisions based on 
management’s estimates with respect to the 
likelihood of potential material tax exposures 
crystallising and the probable amount of the 
resultant liability.

We consider this area as a key audit matter given 
the level of judgement and uncertainty involved 
in estimating tax provisions, the complexities 
of dealing with tax rules and regulations in 
numerous jurisdictions that could materially 
impact the amounts recorded in the consolidated 
financial statements.

In order to understand and evaluate management’s 
judgement, we considered the status of current tax 
authority inspections and enquiries, the outcome 
of previous tax authority inspections, judgemental 
positions taken in tax returns and current year 
estimates as well as recent developments in the 
tax jurisdictions in which the Group operates.

We evaluated the Group’s monitoring process 
of the current tax authority inspections and 
challenged management’s estimates, particularly 
in respect of cases where there had been 
significant developments with tax authorities.

Our component audit teams, through the use of 
tax specialists with local knowledge and relevant 
expertise, assessed the tax positions taken 
by the subsidiary undertakings in scope, in the 
context of applying local tax laws and evaluating 
the local tax assessments. We read recent rulings 
and correspondence with tax authorities, as 
well as external advice provided by the Group’s 
tax experts and legal advisors. Additionally, with 
our group engagement team tax specialists we 
further evaluated management’s estimation of tax 
exposures and contingencies in order to assess 
the adequacy of the Group’s tax provisions and 
satisfy ourselves that the tax provisions have been 
appropriately recorded or adjusted to reflect the 
latest developments.

We held meetings with Group and local 
management to discuss the individual tax 
positions of the in-scope subsidiary undertakings 
and assessed with the support of our group 
engagement tax team the Group’s overall 
tax exposure.

From the evidence obtained we consider the 
provisions in relation to uncertain tax positions 
as at 31 December 2023 to be reasonable.

We also evaluated the related disclosures provided 
in the consolidated financial statements in Note 
11 ‘Taxation’ and Note 30 ‘Contingencies’ and 
concluded that these are appropriate.

Our opinion on the consolidated financial statements does not cover the other information and we do 
not express any form of assurance conclusion thereon.

In connection with our audit of the consolidated financial statements, our responsibility is to read the 
other information and, in doing so, consider whether the other information is materially inconsistent 
with the consolidated financial statements or our knowledge obtained in the audit, or otherwise 
appears to be materially misstated.

If, based on the work we have performed, we conclude that there is a material misstatement of this 
other information, we are required to report that fact. We have nothing to report in this regard.

Board of Directors’ responsibilities for the consolidated financial statements
The Board of Directors is responsible for the preparation of consolidated financial statements that give 
a true and fair view in accordance with IFRS Accounting Standards as adopted by the European Union 
(EU) and the provisions of Swiss law, and for such internal control as the Board of Directors determines 
is necessary to enable the preparation of consolidated financial statements that are free from material 
misstatement, whether due to fraud or error.

In preparing the consolidated financial statements, the Board of Directors is responsible for assessing 
the Group’s ability to continue as a going concern, disclosing, as applicable, matters related to going 
concern and using the going concern basis of accounting unless the Board of Directors either intends 
to liquidate the Group or to cease operations, or has no realistic alternative but to do so.

Auditor’s responsibilities for the audit of the consolidated financial statements
Our objectives are to obtain reasonable assurance about whether the consolidated financial 
statements as a whole are free from material misstatement, whether due to fraud or error, and to issue 
an auditor’s report that includes our opinion. Reasonable assurance is a high level of assurance, but 
is not a guarantee that an audit conducted in accordance with Swiss law, ISAs and SA-CH will always 
detect a material misstatement when it exists. Misstatements can arise from fraud or error and are 
considered material if, individually or in the aggregate, they could reasonably be expected to influence 
the economic decisions of users taken on the basis of these consolidated financial statements.

A further description of our responsibilities for the audit of the consolidated financial statements is 
located on EXPERTsuisse’s website: http://www.expertsuisse.ch/en/audit-report. This description 
forms an integral part of our report.

Report on other legal and regulatory requirements

In accordance with article 728a para. 1 item 3 CO and PS-CH 890, we confirm the existence of an 
internal control system that has been designed, pursuant to the instructions of the Board of Directors, 
for the preparation of the consolidated financial statements.

We recommend that the consolidated financial statements submitted to you be approved.

Report on the audit of the financial statements

Report of the statutory auditor
to the General Meeting of
Coca-Cola HBC AG
Steinhausen (Zug)

Report on the audit of the financial statements

Opinion
We have audited the financial statements of Coca-Cola HBC AG (the Company), which comprise 
the balance sheet as at 31 December 2023, and the income statement, the cash flow statement 
for the year then ended, and notes to the financial statements, including a summary of significant 
accounting policies.

In our opinion, the financial statements (pages 272 to 281) comply with Swiss law and the Company’s 
articles of incorporation.

Basis for opinion
We conducted our audit in accordance with Swiss law and Swiss Standards on Auditing (SA-CH). 
Our responsibilities under those provisions and standards are further described in the ‘Auditor’s 
responsibilities for the audit of the financial statements’ section of our report. We are independent of 
the Company in accordance with the provisions of Swiss law and the requirements of the Swiss audit 
profession, and we have fulfilled our other ethical responsibilities in accordance with these requirements.

We believe that the audit evidence we have obtained is sufficient and appropriate to provide a basis for 
our opinion.

Our audit approach
Materiality
The scope of our audit was influenced by our application of materiality. Our audit opinion aims to 
provide reasonable assurance that the financial statements are free from material misstatement. 
Misstatements may arise due to fraud or error. They are considered material if, individually or in 
aggregate, they could reasonably be expected to influence the economic decisions of users taken on 
the basis of the financial statements.

Based on our professional judgement, we determined certain quantitative thresholds for materiality, 
including the overall materiality for the financial statements as a whole as set out in the table below. 
These, together with qualitative considerations, helped us to determine the scope of our audit and the 
nature, timing and extent of our audit procedures and to evaluate the effect of misstatements, both 
individually and in aggregate, on the financial statements as a whole.

Overall materiality

CHF 33’707’000

Benchmark applied

Net assets

Rationale for 
the materiality 
benchmark applied

We chose net assets as the benchmark because, in our view, it is the 
benchmark which reflects the actual substance of the entity. This is a 
generally accepted benchmark for ultimate holding companies

We agreed with the Audit and Risk Committee that we would report to them misstatements above CHF 
1’872’640 identified during our audit as well as any misstatements below that amount which, in our view, 
warranted reporting for qualitative reasons.

Audit scope
We designed our audit by determining materiality and assessing the risks of material misstatement 
in the financial statements. In particular, we considered where subjective judgements were made; 
for example, in respect of significant accounting estimates that involved making assumptions and 
considering future events that are inherently uncertain. As in all of our audits, we also addressed the 
risk of management override of internal controls, including among other matters consideration of 
whether there was evidence of bias that represented a risk of material misstatement due to fraud.

We tailored the scope of our audit in order to perform sufficient work to enable us to provide an 
opinion on the financial statements as a whole, taking into account the structure of the Company, 
the accounting processes and controls, and the industry in which the Company operates.

Key audit matters
We have determined that there are no key audit matters to communicate in our report.

Other information
The Board of Directors is responsible for the other information. The other information comprises 
the information included in the annual report, but does not include the financial statements, 
the consolidated financial statements, the statutory remuneration report and our auditor’s 
reports thereon.

Our opinion on the financial statements does not cover the other information and we do not express 
any form of assurance conclusion thereon.

In connection with our audit of the financial statements, our responsibility is to read the other 
information and, in doing so, consider whether the other information is materially inconsistent 
with the financial statements or our knowledge obtained in the audit, or otherwise appears to be 
materially misstated.

If, based on the work we have performed, we conclude that there is a material misstatement of this 
other information, we are required to report that fact. We have nothing to report in this regard.

Board of Directors’ responsibilities for the financial statements
The Board of Directors is responsible for the preparation of financial statements in accordance with the 
provisions of Swiss law and the Company’s articles of incorporation, and for such internal control as the 
Board of Directors determines is necessary to enable the preparation of financial statements that are 
free from material misstatement, whether due to fraud or error.

In preparing the financial statements, the Board of Directors is responsible for assessing the 
Company’s ability to continue as a going concern, disclosing, as applicable, matters related to going 
concern and using the going concern basis of accounting unless the Board of Directors either intends 
to liquidate the Company or to cease operations, or has no realistic alternative but to do so.

Auditor’s responsibilities for the audit of the financial statements
Our objectives are to obtain reasonable assurance about whether the financial statements as a whole 
are free from material misstatement, whether due to fraud or error, and to issue an auditor’s report that 
includes our opinion. Reasonable assurance is a high level of assurance, but is not a guarantee that an 
audit conducted in accordance with Swiss law and SA-CH will always detect a material misstatement 
when it exists. Misstatements can arise from fraud or error and are considered material if, individually 
or in the aggregate, they could reasonably be expected to influence the economic decisions of users 
taken on the basis of these financial statements.

integral part of our report.

Report on other legal and regulatory requirements
In accordance with article 728a para. 1 item 3 CO and PS-CH 890, we confirm the existence of an 
internal control system that has been designed, pursuant to the instructions of the Board of Directors, 
for the preparation of the financial statements.

We further confirm that the proposed appropriation of available earnings and the proposed repayment 
of the reserves from capital contributions comply with Swiss law and the Company’s articles of 
incorporation. We recommend that the financial statements submitted to you be approved.

Notes to the financial statements of Coca-Cola HBC AG, Steinhausen (Zug) for the year ended 31 December 2023

General information

Coca-Cola HBC AG (the ‘Company’) was incorporated on 19 September 2012 by Kar-Tess Holding. On 
11 October 2012, the Company announced a voluntary share exchange offer to acquire all outstanding 
ordinary registered shares and all American depositary shares of Coca-Cola Hellenic Bottling Company 
S.A., Maroussi (GR) (‘CCHBC SA’). As a result of the successful completion of this offer, on 25 April 
2013 the Company acquired 96.85% of the issued CCHBC SA shares, including shares represented by 
American depositary shares, and became the new parent company of the Group (the Company and its 
direct and indirect subsidiaries). On 17 June 2013, the Company completed its statutory buyout of the 
remaining shares of CCHBC SA that it did not acquire upon completion of its voluntary share exchange 
offer.

1. Accounting principles

Accounting principles applied in the preparation of the financial statements
These financial statements have been prepared in accordance with the provisions of commercial 
accounting as set out in the Swiss Code of Obligations (Art. 957 to 963b CO). The Company is preparing 
its consolidated financial statements in accordance with International Financial Reporting Standards 
(‘IFRS’) as adopted by the European Union (‘EU’) in accordance with Art. 963b CO due to a requirement 
from the Athens Exchange, its primary listing in the EU. In accordance with Art. 961 para 2. CO, the 
Company is presenting a cash flow statement. Significant accounting and valuation principles are 
described below:

Dividend income
Dividend income is recognised when the right to receive payment is established.

Other operating income
The Company provides management services to its principal subsidiaries and acts as guarantor to its 
principal subsidiary, Coca-Cola HBC Finance B.V. The income from these services is recognised in the 
accounting period in which the service is provided.

Exchange rate differences
The accounting records of the Company are retained in Euro and translated to Swiss francs (‘CHF’) for 
presentation purposes. Except for investments in subsidiaries, property, plant and equipment, long-
term liabilities and equity, which are translated at historical rates, all assets and liabilities denominated 
in foreign currencies are translated into CHF using the closing exchange rate as at 31 December 2023. 
Income and expenses are translated into CHF at the average exchange rate of the reporting year 
except for dividend income and related write down of investments (see Note 2.3), which are valued 
at the transaction date exchange rate. Net unrealised exchange losses are recorded in the income 
statement, while net unrealised gains are deferred within accrued expenses.

Leasing disclosure 
Management has applied an economic-view approach to the disclosure of lease contracts considering 
the underlying usage rights. Right-of-use assets are presented within property, plant and equipment 
depreciated over their useful life. The short- and long-term lease liabilities are adjusted for interest and 
lease payments.

Investments in subsidiaries
Investments in subsidiaries are valued at historical cost and evaluated for impairment if identified 
triggering events occur.

Property, plant and equipment
Right-of-use assets are included within property, plant and equipment.

Depreciation is calculated on the basis of the following useful lives and in accordance with the 
following methods:
Property, plant and equipment

2. Proposed declaration of dividend from reserves
The Board of Directors proposes to declare a gross dividend of €0.93 on each ordinary registered 
share with a par value of CHF 6.70 from the general capital contribution reserve. Own shares held 
directly by the Company are not entitled to dividends. The total aggregate amount of the dividends 
shall be capped at an amount of CHF 375,000 thousand (the ‘Cap’), and thus will reduce the general 
capital contribution reserve of CHF 3,403,978 thousand, as shown in the financial statements as 
at 31 December 2023, by a maximum of CHF 375,000 thousand. To the extent that the dividend 
calculated on €0.93 per share would exceed the Cap on the day of the Annual General Meeting, due 
to the exchange rate determined by the Board of Directors in its reasonable opinion, the Euro per 
share amount of the dividend shall be reduced on a pro-rata basis so that the aggregate amount of all 
dividends paid does not exceed the Cap. Payment of the dividend shall be made at such time and with 
such record date as shall be determined by the Annual General Meeting and the Board of Directors.

Report on the audit of the statutory remuneration report 2023

Other information
The Board of Directors is responsible for the other information. The other information comprises 
the information included in the annual report, but does not include the information in the statutory 
remuneration report, the consolidated financial statements, the financial statements and our auditor’s 
reports thereon.

Our opinion on the statutory remuneration report does not cover the other information and we do not 
express any form of assurance conclusion thereon.

In connection with our audit of the statutory remuneration report, our responsibility is to read the other 
information and, in doing so, consider whether the other information is materially inconsistent with the 
audited financial information in the statutory remuneration report or our knowledge obtained in the 
audit, or otherwise appears to be materially misstated.

If, based on the work we have performed, we conclude that there is a material misstatement of this 
other information, we are required to report that fact. We have nothing to report in this regard.

Board of Directors’ responsibilities for the statutory remuneration report
The Board of Directors is responsible for the preparation of a statutory remuneration report in 
accordance with the provisions of Swiss law and the Company’s articles of incorporation, and for 
such internal control as the Board of Directors determines is necessary to enable the preparation 
of a statutory remuneration report that is free from material misstatement, whether due to 
fraud or error. It is also responsible for designing the remuneration system and defining individual 
remuneration packages.

Report of the statutory auditor
to the General Meeting of
Coca-Cola HBC AG
Steinhausen (Zug)

Report on the audit of the statutory remuneration report

Opinion
We have audited the statutory remuneration report of Coca-Cola HBC AG (the Company) for the year 
ended 31 December 2023. The audit was limited to the information pursuant to article 734a-734f CO 
on pages 285 to 294 of the statutory remuneration report.

In our opinion, the information pursuant to article 734a-734f CO in the statutory remuneration report 
(pages 285 to 294) complies with Swiss law and the Company’s articles of incorporation.

Basis for opinion
We conducted our audit in accordance with Swiss law and Swiss Standards on Auditing (SA-CH). 
Our responsibilities under those provisions and standards are further described in the ‘Auditor’s 
responsibilities for the audit of the statutory remuneration report’ section of our report. We are 
independent of the Company in accordance with the provisions of Swiss law and the requirements of 
the Swiss audit profession, and we have fulfilled our other ethical responsibilities in accordance with 
these requirements.

We believe that the audit evidence we have obtained is sufficient and appropriate to provide a basis for 
our opinion.

Report on the audit of the statutory remuneration report 2023 continued

Auditor’s responsibilities for the audit of the statutory remuneration report
Our objectives are to obtain reasonable assurance about whether the information pursuant to article 
734a-734f CO is free from material misstatement, whether due to fraud or error, and to issue an 
auditor’s report that includes our opinion. Reasonable assurance is a high level of assurance, but is not a 
guarantee that an audit conducted in accordance with Swiss law and SA-CH will always detect a material 
misstatement when it exists. Misstatements can arise from fraud or error and are considered material 
if, individually or in the aggregate, they could reasonably be expected to influence the economic 
decisions of users taken on the basis of this statutory remuneration report.

As part of an audit in accordance with Swiss law and SA-CH, we exercise professional judgement and 
maintain professional scepticism throughout the audit. We also:

•  Identify and assess the risks of material misstatement in the statutory remuneration report, 

whether due to fraud or error, design and perform audit procedures responsive to those risks, and 
obtain audit evidence that is sufficient and appropriate to provide a basis for our opinion. The risk of 
not detecting a material misstatement resulting from fraud is higher than for one resulting from error, 
as fraud may involve collusion, forgery, intentional omissions, misrepresentations, or the override of 
internal control.

•  Obtain an understanding of internal control relevant to the audit in order to design audit procedures 
that are appropriate in the circumstances, but not for the purpose of expressing an opinion on the 
effectiveness of the Company’s internal control.

•  Evaluate the appropriateness of accounting policies used and the reasonableness of accounting 

estimates and related disclosures made.

We communicate with the Board of Directors or its relevant committee regarding, among other 
matters, the planned scope and timing of the audit and significant audit findings, including any 
significant deficiencies in internal control that we identify during our audit.

We also provide the Board of Directors or its relevant committee with a statement that we have 
complied with relevant ethical requirements regarding independence, and communicate with them 
all relationships and other matters that may reasonably be thought to bear on our independence, and 
where applicable, actions taken to eliminate threats or safeguards applied.

Statutory Remuneration Report

Additional disclosures regarding the Statutory Remuneration Report

Remuneration for acting members of governing bodies

The section below is in line with the Swiss Code of Obligations, which requires disclosure of the 
elements of compensation paid to the Company’s Board of Directors and the Executive Leadership 
Team (formerly known as the Operating Committee). The amounts relate to the calendar years of 
2023 and 2022. In the information presented below, the exchange rate used for conversion of 2023 
remuneration data from Euro to CHF is 1/0.9729 and the exchange rate used for conversion of 2022 
remuneration data from Euro to CHF is 1/1.0081.

As the Company is headquartered in Switzerland, it is required for statutory purposes to present 
compensation data for two consecutive years, 2023 and 2022. The applicable methodology used 
to calculate the value of stock option and performance shares follows Swiss Standards. In 2023 and 
2022, the fair value of performance shares from the 2023 and 2022 grants is calculated based on 
the performance share awards that are expected to vest. Below is the relevant information for Swiss 
statutory purposes.

The Statutory Remuneration Report should be read in conjunction with the Directors’ remuneration 
report presented in the Integrated Annual Report as the qualitative aspects of remuneration policy are 
described therein.

The Company’s Directors believe that the level of remuneration offered to Directors and the members 
of the Executive Leadership Team should reflect their experience and responsibility as determined by, 
among other factors, a comparison with similar multinational companies and should be sufficient to 
attract and retain high-calibre Directors who will lead the Group successfully. In line with the Group’s 
commitment to maximise shareholder value, its policy is to link a significant proportion of remuneration 
for its Executive Leadership Team to the performance of the business through short- and long-term 
incentives. Therefore, the Executive Leadership Team members’ financial interests are closely aligned 
with those of the Company’s shareholders through the equity-related long-term compensation plan.

The total remuneration of the Directors and members of the Executive Leadership Team of the 
Company, including performance share grants, during 2023 amounted to CHF 28.6 million (2022: 
CHF 24.5 million). Out of this, the amount relating to the expected value of performance share awards 
granted in relation to 2023 was CHF 7.4 million (2022: CHF 5.4 million). Pension and post-employment 
benefits for Directors and the Executive Leadership Team of the Company during 2023 amounted to 
CHF 0.9 million (2022: CHF 1.0 million).

Alternative performance measures

Definitions and reconciliations of alternative performance measures (APMs)
1. Comparable APMs1

In discussing the performance of the Group, ‘comparable’ measures are used. In 2023, the Group 
updated the definitions of items which are deducted from the directly reconcilable IFRS measures to 
calculate comparable APMs, to include impairment of goodwill and indefinite-lived intangible assets. 
This update was performed to provide more relevant information on the Group’s ongoing operating 
and financial performance, considering also reporting by its peer group and had no impact on the 
comparative figures disclosed. More specifically, comparable measures are calculated by deducting 
from the directly reconcilable IFRS measures the impact of the Group’s restructuring costs, the mark-
to-market valuation of the commodity hedging activity, the acquisition, integration and divestment-
related costs, the impairment of goodwill and indefinite-lived intangible assets, the Russia-Ukraine 
conflict impact and certain other tax items, which are collectively considered as items impacting 
comparability, due to their nature. More specifically the following items are considered as items that 
impact comparability:

1. Restructuring costs
Restructuring costs comprise costs arising from significant changes in the way the Group conducts 
business, such as significant supply chain infrastructure changes, outsourcing of activities and 
centralisation of processes. These costs are included within the income statement line ‘Operating 
expenses’; however, they are excluded from the comparable results so that the users can obtain a 
better understanding of the Group’s operating and financial performance achieved from underlying 
activity. Restructuring costs resulting from initiatives driven by the Russia-Ukraine conflict are 
presented under the ‘Russia-Ukraine conflict impact’ item, to provide users complete information on 
the financial implications of the conflict.

2. Commodity hedging
The Group has entered into certain commodity derivative transactions in order to hedge its exposure 
to commodity price risk. Although these transactions are economic hedging activities that aim to 
manage our exposure to sugar, aluminium, gas oil and plastics price volatility, hedge accounting has 
not been applied in all cases. In addition, the Group recognises certain derivatives embedded within 
commodity purchase contracts that have been accounted for as stand-alone derivatives and do 
not qualify for hedge accounting. The fair value gains or losses on the derivatives and embedded 
derivatives are immediately recognised in the income statement in the cost of goods sold and 
operating expenses line items. The Group’s comparable results exclude the gains or losses resulting 
from the mark-to-market valuation of these derivatives to which hedge accounting has not been 
applied (primarily plastics) and embedded derivatives. These gains or losses are reflected in the 
comparable results in the period when the underlying transactions occur, to match the profit or loss 
to that of the corresponding underlying transactions. We believe this adjustment provides useful 
information related to the impact of our economic risk management activities.

3. Acquisition, integration and divestment-related costs or gains
Acquisition costs comprise costs incurred to effect a business combination such as finder’s fees, 
advisory, legal, accounting, valuation and other professional or consulting fees as well as changes in 
the fair value of contingent consideration recognised in the income statement. They also include any 
gain from bargain purchase arising from business combinations, as well as any gain or loss recognised 
in the income statement from the remeasurement to fair value of previously held interests and the 
reclassification to the income statement of items of other comprehensive income resulting from 
step acquisitions. Integration costs comprise direct incremental costs necessary for the acquiree 
to operate within the Group. Divestment-related costs comprise transaction expenses, including 
advisory, consulting, and other professional fees to effect the disposal of a subsidiary or equity method 
investment, any impairment losses or write downs to fair value less costs to sell recognised in the 
income statement upon classification as held for sale and any relevant disposal gains or losses or 
reversals of impairment recognised in the income statement upon disposal. These costs or gains are 
included within the income statement line ‘Operating expenses’, however, to the extent that they relate 
to business combinations or divestments that have been completed or are expected to be completed, 
they are excluded from the comparable results so that the users can obtain a better understanding of 
the Group’s operating and financial performance achieved from underlying activity.

4. Impairment of goodwill and indefinite-lived intangible assets
Impairment losses recognised for goodwill and indefinite-lived intangible assets as well as reversals 
of impairment losses recognised for indefinite-lived intangible assets are included within the income 
statement line ‘Operating expenses’; however they are excluded from comparable results so that the 
users can obtain a better understanding of the Group’s ongoing operating and financial performance.

5. Russia-Ukraine conflict impact
As a result of the conflict between Russia and Ukraine, the Group recognised net impairment losses 
for property, plant and equipment, intangible assets and equity method investments as well as 
restructuring costs, in connection with the new business model in Russia and adverse changes to 
the economic environment. The Group also recognised incremental allowance for expected credit 
losses and write offs of inventory and property, plant and equipment resulting from the Russia-Ukraine 
conflict. The aforementioned net impairment losses are included within the income statement line 
‘Exceptional items related to Russia-Ukraine conflict’ so as to provide users with enhanced visibility 
over these items considering their materiality, while remaining costs are included within ‘Operating 
expenses’ and ‘Cost of goods sold’ lines of the income statement accordingly. Net impairment losses 
and other costs directly attributable to the Russia-Ukraine conflict are excluded from the comparable 
results so that the users can obtain a better understanding of the Group’s operating and financial 
performance from underlying activity.

1.  Comparable APMs refer to comparable cost of goods sold, comparable gross profit, comparable operating expenses, comparable EBIT, comparable EBIT margin, comparable Adjusted EBITDA, comparable profit before tax, comparable tax, comparable net profit and comparable EPS.

6. Other tax items
Other tax items represent the tax impact of (a) changes in income tax rates affecting the opening 
balance of deferred tax arising during the year and (b) certain tax-related matters selected based on 
their nature. Both (a) and (b) are excluded from comparable after-tax results so that the users can 
obtain a better understanding of the Group’s underlying financial performance.

The Group discloses comparable performance measures to enable users to focus on the underlying 
performance of the business on a basis which is common to both periods for which these measures 
are presented.

The reconciliation of comparable measures to the directly related measures calculated in accordance 
with IFRS is as follows:

Organic growth 
Organic growth enables users to focus on the operating performance of the business on a basis that is 
not affected by changes in foreign currency exchange rates from year to year or changes in the Group’s 
scope of consolidation (‘consolidation perimeter’), i.e. acquisitions, divestments and reorganisations 
resulting in equity method accounting. Thus, organic growth is designed to assist users in better 
understanding the Group’s underlying performance. 

More specifically, the following items are adjusted from the Group‘s volume, net sales revenue and 
comparable EBIT in order to derive organic growth metrics:

(a) Foreign currency impact
Foreign currency impact in the organic growth calculation reflects the adjustment of prior-year net 
sales revenue and comparable EBIT metrics for the impact of changes in exchange rates applicable to 
the current year.

(b) Consolidation perimeter impact
Current-year volume, net sales revenue and comparable EBIT metrics, are each adjusted for the impact 
of changes in the consolidation perimeter. More specifically adjustments are performed as follows:

For current-year step acquisitions where the Group obtains control of a) entities over which it previously 
held either joint control or significant influence and which were accounted for under the equity method, 
or b) entities which were carried at fair value either through profit or loss or other comprehensive 
income, the results generated in the current year by the relevant entities over the period during which 
these entities are consolidated are not included in the organic growth calculation. For such step 
acquisitions of entities previously accounted for under the equity method, the share of results for the 
respective period described above is included in the organic growth calculation of the current year. 
For such step acquisitions of entities previously accounted for at fair value through profit or loss, any 
fair value gains or losses for the respective period described above are included in the organic growth 
calculation. For such step acquisitions in the prior year, the results generated in the current year by the 
relevant entities over the period during which these entities were not consolidated in the prior year are 
not included in the organic growth calculation. However, the share of results of gains or losses from 
fair value changes of the respective entities, based on their accounting treatment prior to the step 
acquisition, for the current-year period during which these entities were not consolidated in the prior 
year are included in the organic growth calculation.

ii. Divestments:
For current-year divestments, the results generated in the prior year by the divested entities over the 
period during which the divested entities are no longer consolidated in the current year are included in 
the current year’s results for the purpose of the organic growth calculation. For prior-year divestments, 
the results generated in the prior year by the divested entities over the period during which the divested 
entities were consolidated are included in the current year’s results for the purpose of the organic 
growth calculation.

iii. Reorganisations resulting in equity method accounting:
For current-year reorganisations where the Group maintains either joint control or significant 
influence over the relevant entities so that they are reclassified from subsidiaries or joint operations 
to joint ventures or associates and accounted for under the equity method, the results generated 
in the current year by the relevant entities over the period during which these entities are no longer 
consolidated are included in the current year’s results for the purpose of the organic growth calculation. 
For such reorganisations in the prior year, the results generated in the current year by the relevant 
entities over the period during which these entities were consolidated in the prior year are included 
in the current year’s results for the purpose of the organic growth calculation. In addition, the share 
of results in the current year of the relevant entities, for the respective period as described above, is 
excluded from the organic growth calculation for such reorganisations.

i. Acquisitions: 
For current-year acquisitions, the results generated in the current year by the acquired entities are 
not included in the organic growth calculation. For prior-year acquisitions, the results generated in the 
current year over the period during which the acquired entities were not consolidated in the prior year 
are not included in the organic growth calculation.

The calculations of the organic growth and the reconciliation to the most directly related measures 
calculated in accordance with IFRS are presented in the below tables. Organic growth (%) is calculated 
by dividing the amount in the row titled ‘Organic movement’ by the amount in the associated row titled 
‘2022 reported’ or, where presented, ‘2022 adjusted’. Organic growth for comparable EBIT margin is the 
organic movement expressed in basis points.

3. Other APMs

Adjusted EBITDA
Adjusted EBITDA is calculated by adding back to operating profit the depreciation and net impairment 
of property, plant and equipment, the amortisation and impairment of intangible assets, the net 
impairment of equity method investments, the employee share option and performance share costs 
and items, if any, reported in line ‘Other non-cash items’ of the consolidated cash flow statement. 
Adjusted EBITDA is intended to provide useful information to analyse the Group’s operating 
performance excluding the impact of operating non-cash items as defined above. The Group also 
uses comparable Adjusted EBITDA, which is calculated by deducting from Adjusted EBITDA the impact 
of: the Group’s restructuring costs, the acquisition, integration and divestment-related costs, the 
mark-to-market valuation of the commodity hedging activity and the impact from the Russia-Ukraine 
conflict. Comparable Adjusted EBITDA is intended to measure the level of financial leverage of the 
Group by comparing comparable Adjusted EBITDA with net debt.

Adjusted EBITDA and comparable Adjusted EBITDA are not measures of profitability and liquidity under 
IFRS and have limitations, some of which are as follows: Adjusted EBITDA and comparable Adjusted 
EBITDA do not reflect our cash expenditures, or future requirements, for capital expenditures or 
contractual commitments; Adjusted EBITDA and comparable Adjusted EBITDA do not reflect changes 
in, or cash requirements for, our working capital needs; although depreciation and amortisation are 
non-cash charges, the assets being depreciated and amortised will often have to be replaced in the 
future, and Adjusted EBITDA and comparable Adjusted EBITDA do not reflect any cash requirements 
for such replacements. Because of these limitations, Adjusted EBITDA and comparable Adjusted 
EBITDA should not be considered as measures of discretionary cash available to us and should be used 
only as supplementary APMs.

Free cash flow
Free cash flow is an APM used by the Group and defined as cash generated by operating activities after 
payments for purchases of property, plant and equipment net of proceeds from sales of property, plant 
and equipment and including principal repayments of lease obligations. Free cash flow is intended to 
measure the cash generation from the Group’s business, based on operating activities, including the 
efficient use of working capital and taking into account its net payments for purchases of property, plant 
and equipment. The Group considers the purchase and disposal of property, plant and equipment as 
ultimately non-discretionary since ongoing investment in plant, machinery, technology and marketing 
equipment, including coolers, is required to support the day-to-day operations and the Group’s growth 
prospects. The Group presents free cash flow because it believes the measure assists users of the 
financial statements in understanding the Group’s cash-generating performance as well as availability 
for interest payment, dividend distribution and own retention. The free cash flow measure is used by 
management for its own planning and reporting purposes since it provides information on operating 
cash flows, working capital changes and net capital expenditure that local managers are most directly 
able to influence.

Free cash flow is not a measure of cash generation under IFRS and has limitations, some of which are 
as follows: free cash flow does not represent the Group’s residual cash flow available for discretionary 
expenditures since the Group has debt payment obligations that are not deducted from the measure; 
free cash flow does not deduct cash flows used by the Group in other investing and financing activities 
and free cash flow does not deduct certain items settled in cash. Other companies in the industry 
in which the Group operates may calculate free cash flow differently, limiting its usefulness as a 
comparative measure.

Net debt
Net debt is an APM used by management to evaluate the Group’s capital structure and leverage. Net 
debt is defined as current borrowings plus non-current borrowings less cash and cash equivalents and 
financial assets (time deposits and money market funds), as illustrated below:

Annual Report 2023 and the GRI Content Index 2023 – (hereinafter referred to as the “Report”), which 
was prepared by Coca-Cola HBC (hereinafter referred to as “CCHBC”), with retroactive start date on 
01/01/2023 and end date on 31/12/2023 (hereinafter “Reporting Period”).

Applicable Criteria

In addition, regarding the Taskforce for Climate-related Financial Disclosures (TCFD), our work covers:

Scope of Work

We designed and carried out our work in order to obtain the information, analysis and explanations 
we deemed necessary, where available from CCHBC’s Management, in order to assess whether the 
Report has been prepared in accordance with the “Applicable Criteria”. In order to form our conclusions, 
we performed the following:

i. 

ii. 

 Assessed the suitability of the Applicable Criteria in terms of their relevance, comprehensiveness, 
reliability, neutrality and understandability and their consistent application.

 Obtained an understanding of CCHBC’s control environment, processes and systems relevant to 
the preparation of the Report. Our procedures did not include evaluating the suitability of the design 
or operating effectiveness of control activities.

iii.   Inspected the relevant documentation of the systems and processes for compiling, analyzing, and 

aggregating data and tested such documentation on a sample basis.

iv.   Οbtained an understanding of CCHBC’s materiality process and materiality assessment, and 

verified it against the GRI Standards (2021 update) methodology.

v. 

 Reviewed a sample of supporting documentation and conducted interviews with the information 
owners to assess whether the outputs of the materiality process fairly represent the identified 
material issues.

vi.   Οbtained an understanding of the existing internal processes related to application of policies in 

relation to the sustainability information, under the scope of our engagement.

vii.  Inquired CCHBC’s Departmental Managers and information owners responsible for collecting, 

consolidating and calculating the Subject Matter Information in order to evaluate the 
appropriateness of measurement and evaluation methods, reporting policies used and estimates 
made by CCHBC. Our procedures did not involve testing the data on which the estimates are based 
or separately developing our own estimates against which to evaluate CCHBC’s estimates.

viii.  Performed analytical procedures and inspection of documents on a sample basis with respect to the 
compilation and reporting of quantitative performance indicators related to the “Applicable Criteria”:

a. 

b. 

 At Group level1, performed analytical procedures to check that underlying information was 
complete and accurate, and had been appropriately evaluated or measured, recorded, collated 
and reported as well as to verify the correct consolidation of the collected data.
 At the level of a representative selection of location sites2, undertook site visits at 11 plants and 
8 headquarters (HQs). We selected these sites based on risk assessment procedures performed 
(factors considered included indicatively inherent risk, site contribution to the consolidated 
indicators, location, etc.) and performed detailed assurance procedures for all the applicable 
KPIs at plant and HQ level for all selected locations (combination of on site and remote visits). 
More specifically, as part of our visits, we performed detailed tests on a sample basis, consisting 
of checking the correct application of the definitions and agreeing performance indicators to or 
from source information to check that the underlying subject matter was complete and accurate, 
and had been appropriately evaluated or measured, recorded, collated and reported.

c. 

 For the KPI Greenhouse Gas (GhG) emissions, assessed all three inventory scopes (Scopes 1, 2 
and 3) as defined by the GHG Protocol (Corporate Standard), including progress against emission 
reduction targets, reported changes in emissions compared with the baseline year (2017) and the 
figures for absolute emissions and emissions intensity in 2023.

ix.   Performed targeted testing to select significant qualitative statements related to the “Applicable 

Criteria” listed above and tested their fair statement to identify misstatements that are material to 
the intended users of the subject matter information. We performed risk-based targeted testing for 
any remaining qualitative statements with characteristics of increased risk of material misstatement 
and evaluated remaining population not subject to targeted testing.

x. 

 Evaluated all environmental, social and governance disclosures, and overall presentation of the 
Subject Matter Information included in the Report for the Reporting Period (as described in the 
section “Applicable Criteria” and in the Appendices).

The procedures performed in a limited assurance engagement vary in nature and timing and are less 
extensive than in a reasonable assurance engagement, and accordingly, the level of assurance obtained 
in a limited assurance engagement is significantly lower than the level of assurance which would have 
been obtained if an assignment of reasonable assurance had been performed.

Inherent Limitations

The work performed does not provide absolute assurance that all material weaknesses related to 
the accuracy and completeness of data and relevant disclosures, as these are included in the Report, 
will be identified.

A material weakness exists when the design of the internal controls is not adequate and thus, does not 
mitigate the risk of material deficiencies occurring without being detected in a timely manner.

Our work covered only the items listed in the “Scope of Work” paragraph to obtain limited assurance 
based on the procedures included in the same paragraph. Our work does not constitute an audit or 
review of historical Financial Information, in accordance with applicable International Standards on 
Auditing or International Standards for the Engagement of Review Engagements, and for this reason 
we do not express any assurance other than those listed in the paragraph “Scope of Work”.

All issues brought to our attention during the work performed were accordingly communicated to the 
CCHBC’s Management. Relevant points resulting from our work were discussed with Management and 
subsequently their written responses were obtained.

1. 

2. 

 The Departments involved at a group level are: People and Culture Department, Legal Affairs Department (including the Risk team), Internal 
Controls Center, Commercial Department, Supply Chain Department (including Procurement team, Quality, Safety and Environment team, 
Fleet team and Cold Drink Equipment team), Investor Relations Department and Corporate Affairs and Sustainability Department, as well 
as managers from other Group functions.
 The manufacturing plants are located in Nigeria (Abuja, Ikeja), Egypt (Qaliub, Alexandria), Italy (Nogara), Romania (Ploiești), Czech Republic 
(Prague), Ireland (Knockmore Hill), Greece (Aeghion, Schimatari) and Russia (Schelkovo).

Socio-economic impact 
In conducting socio-economic studies, we use 
input-output modelling to generate estimates of 
jobs supported and economic value added across 
the value chain. Data we use in this process includes 
our financial information (revenues, expenses, 
taxes, sales volume and profits) as well as some 
data from the Coca-Cola System. While rigorous, 
the process involves statistical modelling, which 
should be considered when interpreting and using 
the results from the studies.

Modelling enables an assessment of three key 
dimensions of impact:

•  direct: immediate effect in terms of 
employment, wages and output
indirect: subsequent effect in the supply chain
induced: effect caused by staff spend on goods 
or services

• 
• 

We do not conduct socio-economic studies for all 
of our markets every year; studies are conducted 
for each market on a rolling basis. In 2023, we 
updated the studies for six markets, adding this

Forward looking statements

Special note regarding forward-looking 
statements
This document contains forward-looking 
statements that involve risks and uncertainties. 
These statements may generally, but not always, 
be identified by the use of words such as ‘believe’, 
‘outlook’, ‘guidance’, ‘intend’, ‘expect’, ‘anticipate’, 
‘plan’, ‘target’, ‘seek’, ‘estimates’, ’potential‘ and 
similar expressions to identify forward-looking 
statements. All statements other than statements 
of historical facts, including, among others, 
statements regarding the future financial position 
and results; Coca-Cola HBC’s outlook for 2024 and 
future years; business strategy and the effects of 
the global economic slowdown; the impact of the 
sovereign debt crisis, currency volatility, Coca-
Cola HBC’s recent acquisitions, and restructuring 
initiatives on Coca-Cola HBC’s business and 
financial condition; Coca-Cola HBC’s future 
dealings with The Coca-Cola Company; budgets; 
projected levels of consumption and production; 
projected raw material and other costs; estimates 
of capital expenditure; free cash flow; effective tax 
rates and plans and objectives of management for 
future operations, are forward-looking statements.

You should not place undue reliance on such 
forward-looking statements. By their nature, 
forward-looking statements involve risk and 
uncertainty because they reflect Coca-Cola HBC’s 
current expectations and assumptions about 
future events and circumstances that may not 
prove accurate. 

Forward-looking statements speak only as of 
the date they are made. Coca-Cola HBC’s actual 
results and events could differ materially from those 
anticipated in the forward-looking statements for 
many reasons, including the risks described in the 
Managing risk and resilience section. Although 
Coca-Cola HBC believes that, as of the date of this 
Integrated Annual Report, the expectations reflected 
in the forward-looking statements are reasonable, 
Coca-Cola HBC cannot assure that Coca-Cola 
HBC’s future results, level of activity, performance 
or achievements will meet these expectations. 

Moreover, neither Coca-Cola HBC, nor its Directors, 
employees, advisers nor any other person assumes 
responsibility for the accuracy and completeness 
of any forward-looking statements. After the date 
of this Integrated Annual Report, unless Coca-Cola 
HBC is required by law or the rules of the UK Financial 
Conduct Authority to update these forward-looking 
statements, Coca-Cola HBC makes no commitment 
to update any of these forward- looking statements 
to conform them either to actual results or to 
changes in Coca-Cola HBC’s expectations.

About our report
The 2023 Integrated Annual Report (the 
‘Integrated Annual Report’) consolidates Coca-
Cola HBC AG’s (also referred to as ‘Coca-Cola 
HBC’ or the ‘Company’ or the ‘Group’) UK and 
Swiss disclosure requirements, while meeting 
the disclosure requirements for its secondary 
listing on the Athens Exchange. In addition, the 
Integrated Annual Report aims to deliver against 
the expectations of the Company’s stakeholders 
and sustainability reporting standards, providing a 
transparent overview of the Group’s performance 
and progress in sustainable development for 2023.

Our strategy is designed to deliver sustainable 
and profitable growth. This strategy is grounded 
in our purpose to open up moments that refresh 
us all. Our purpose is directly linked to our strategy 
and the five growth pillars that guide us as we 
pursue our objectives and targets. Those growth 
pillars are: 1. Leverage our unique 24/7 portfolio; 
2. Win in the marketplace; 3. Fuel growth through 
competitiveness and investment; 4. Cultivate 
the potential of our people; 5 Earn our license 
to operate. The initiatives we implemented 
within each of these pillars form the basis of 
the narrative of the Integrated Annual Report, 
which is structured around these five pillars.

The Integrated Annual Report is for the year 
ended 31 December 2023, and its focus is on the 
primary core business of non-alcoholic ready-
to-drink beverages across the 29 countries in 
which we operate. Our website and any other 

website referred to in the Annual Report are not 
incorporated by reference and do not form part 
of the Integrated Annual Report.

The consolidated financial statements of the 
Group, included on pages 194 to 197, have been 
prepared in accordance with International 
Financial Reporting Standards (IFRS) as adopted 
by the European Union (EU) ) and in compliance 
with Swiss law. Coca-Cola HBC AG’s statutory 
financial statements, included on pages 272 to 282, 
have been prepared in accordance with the Swiss 
Code of Obligations. Unless otherwise indicated 
or required by context, all financial information 
contained in this document has been prepared 
in accordance with IFRS. For Swiss law purposes, 
the annual management report consists of the 
sections entitled ‘Strategic Report’, ‘Corporate 
Governance’ (without the sub-section ‘Directors’ 
remuneration report’), ‘Supplementary Information’ 
and ‘Glossary’.

The Group uses certain Alternative performance 
measures (APMs) which provide additional insights 
and understanding to the Group’s underlying 
operating and financial performance, financial 
condition and cash flows. A full list of these APMs, 
their definition and reconciliation to the respective 
IFRS measures can be found on pages 295 to 301.

This report has been prepared in accordance with the 
GRI Standards (2021). In addition, the sustainability 
aspects of this Integrated Annual Report comply with 
the requirements for communication on progress 
against the 10 Principles of the United Nations Global 
Compact (UNGC) as well as Art. 964b of the Swiss 
Code of Obligations. Furthermore, the Integrated 
Annual Report is aligned with the principles and 
elements of the International Integrated Reporting 
Council’s (IIRC) framework and key indicators of the 
Sustainability Accounting Standards Board (SASB). 
Coca-Cola HBC supports the Task Force on Climate-
related Financial Disclosures (TCFD) and implements 
the TCFD recommendations in the Integrated 
Annual Report. Finally, Greenhouse gas emissions 
are calculated using the GHG Protocol Corporate 
Accounting and Reporting Standard methodology.

Sustainability disclosures in the Integrated 
Annual Report and the 2023 GRI Content 
Index, contain information from all entities 
included in the financial statements with the 
exception of certain items described below, 
considering materiality thresholds. Scope of 
the Integrated Annual Report: environmental 
and social data covers all 29 countries of Coca-
Cola HBC, including the North Macedonia joint 
venture as well, unless otherwise stated. Snacks 
manufacturing operations are not included in 
the environmental reporting, unless otherwise 
stated (due to their very small impact, less than 
the internal materiality threshold). Relevant impact 
areas from coffee and premium spirits categories 
are included in the environmental and social data. 
Three Cents business acquired in late 2022 and 
Finlandia Vodka business acquired in late 2023 are 
still under integration and not reported, and our 
current assessment is that their impact is below the 
materiality threshold. Mission 2025 sustainability 
commitments exclude Egyptian operations, as 
they were not foreseen in the baseline year nor 
in the target year.

As with the rest of the information provided, the 
sustainability aspects of this Integrated Annual 
Report cover the full year ended 31 December 
2023 and the related information presented is 
based on an annual reporting cycle.

Limited assurance based on ISAE 3000 (Revised) 
and ISAE 3410 is provided over selected information 
of the Integrated Annual Report and the GRI 
Content Index by an independent audit firm as 
dictated by the Company’s Executive Leadership 
Team (ELT). The relevant assurance report could 
be found on pages 302 to 308.

We remain committed to strong corporate 
governance and leadership as well as transparency 
in our disclosures. We will continue to review our 
reporting approach and routines, to ensure they 
meet best practice reporting standards and the 
expectations of our stakeholders, and provide 
visibility on how we create sustainable value for 
the communities we serve.
