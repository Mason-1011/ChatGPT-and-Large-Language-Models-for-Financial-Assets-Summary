CHAIRMAN’S INTRODUCTION

Introduction from  
Peter Ventress,  
Chairman of the Board

Peter Ventress 
Chairman 

The Board welcomes 
developments in corporate 
governance practice, which 
aim to enhance trust and 
transparency in our 
disclosures.”

On behalf of the Board, I am pleased to present 
the Corporate governance report for the year 
ended 31 December 2023. This report, in 
conjunction with the Nomination, Board 
Sustainability, Audit and Remuneration 
Committee reports, outlines Bunzl’s approach 
to governance: prudent risk management, 
transparency, open engagement with 
stakeholders and compliance with the principles 
and provisions of the 2018 UK Corporate 
Governance Code (the ‘Code’).

I am delighted to welcome Jacky Simmonds, 
who joined the Board on 1 March 2023, as a 
non-executive director. Through her executive 
and non-executive roles, she brings a wealth of 
international and listed company experience, 
which, coupled with Jacky’s extensive HR 
expertise, will enhance and strengthen the 
capabilities of the Board further. Following Jacky’s 
appointment, the proportion of female directors 
on the Board is 44%, exceeding the Financial 
Conduct Authority’s new 40% board gender 
diversity target. More information on Jacky’s 
experience and induction process can be found 
on pages 91 and 99, respectively. 

As announced on 26 February 2024, Vanda 
Murray, Senior Independent Director and Chair 
of the Remuneration Committee, has informed 
the Board of her intention to step down as a 
director at the conclusion of the Company’s 
Annual General Meeting (‘AGM’) on 24 April 2024. 
Her independent advice and valued contribution 
to the Board’s deliberations over the years have 
been greatly appreciated and she leaves with the 
Company’s thanks and best wishes. A robust 
recruitment process for a new non-executive 
director is now underway and an announcement 
will be released in due course, once a suitable 
candidate has been identified. Full details of the 
recruitment process will also be included in next 
year’s Annual Report.

Vanda will be succeeded as Chair of the 
Remuneration Committee by Jacky and Pam Kirby 
will succeed her as the Board’s new Senior 
Independent Director. The timing of the changes 
allows for a meaningful handover period with 
Vanda as part of a planned succession. Further 
information concerning the Board and Committee 
changes, and succession planning more generally, 
can be found in our Nomination Committee 
report on pages 106 to 109.

In line with recognised best practice, Bunzl 
undertakes Board reviews on an annual basis 
to further increase Board effectiveness and to 
identify areas for improvement. Bunzl engaged 
Lintstock Ltd in 2023 to conduct an external 
review of the performance of the Board and its 
Committees. Additional evaluations of my 
performance as Chairman, as well as the 
performance of each individual director, were also 
undertaken. A wide variety of performance areas 
were assessed, with key strengths and potential 
priorities for 2024 identified to drive future 
discussions. The results of the evaluation were 
positive and identified that the Board 
demonstrates an appropriate mix of cohesion 
and challenge, has a transparent relationship 
with management, strong clarity of Bunzl’s 
operating model and of the Board’s role in driving 
the Group’s strategic outcomes. For additional 
information on the Board evaluation process 
and outcomes, see page 103.

Sustainability was highlighted as one of the 2023 
priority areas for the Board. Direct oversight of 
sustainability-related risks and opportunities is 
key to the continued strengthening of Bunzl’s 
sustainability strategy. In 2022, the Board 
established a new Board Sustainability Committee 
(‘BSC’), reflecting the importance Bunzl places on 
the consideration of Environmental, Social and 
Governance (‘ESG’) matters. The BSC comprises 
all of the non-executive directors and invitations 
to attend the meetings are regularly extended to 
the Chief Executive Officer (‘CEO’), Chief Financial 
Officer (‘CFO’), Director of Group HR and Head of 
Sustainability. More information about the work 
undertaken by the BSC during the year, as well as 
its priorities for 2024, can be found in the BSC 
report on pages 110 to 111.

CHAIRMAN’S INTRODUCTION continued

Acquisition growth is a key pillar of Bunzl’s 
compounding growth strategy and remained 
an area of focus for the Board in 2023. During the 
year, the Board maintained close oversight of the 
acquisition pipeline and received regular 
presentations from senior managers, covering 
financial, operational and ESG factors, including 
cultural fit. The Board is mindful of the need to 
consider the interests of the Company’s 
stakeholders when making decisions, and a case 
study demonstrating how the Board has had 
regard to stakeholder interests during the 
acquisition process can be found on page 67.

The Board welcomes developments in corporate 
governance practice, which aim to enhance trust 
and transparency in our disclosures. We are 
aware that revisions to the Code were published 
by the Financial Reporting Council (‘FRC’) in 
January 2024 and the Board will be giving further 
consideration to these during the year. We will 
report formally against the new Code in the 
Company’s future Annual Reports, as the 
requirements come into effect in 2025 and 2026. 

I am pleased to report that, for the year ended 31 
December 2023, the Company has complied in 
full with the provisions of the 2018 version of the 
Code that is currently in force.

As a Board, we are committed to ensuring that 
Bunzl’s robust governance structure enables 
sustainable and resilient growth, for the benefit 
of all of our stakeholders. We hope that you find 
the following report to be a useful overview of 
Bunzl’s approach to governance and look 
forward to welcoming you at the Company’s 
forthcoming AGM.

Peter Ventress 
Chairman 
26 February 2024

Continued Board oversight of strategic 
priorities and the execution of Bunzl’s 
strategic plans

During the year, the Board continued to focus 
on Bunzl’s strategic pillars of profitable organic 
growth, operating model improvements 
and acquisition growth. The Board received 
frequent updates on business area 
performance, acquisition reviews and 
supplier performance, which enhanced its 
ability to oversee Bunzl’s strategic priorities 
and have meaningful discussions with regard 
to future plans. 

Further information regarding Bunzl’s strategic 
priorities can be found in the Strategic report.

On the Board’s mind in 2023
Focusing on management succession 
planning and enhancing the Group’s 
organisational structure, talent 
management, and diversity and 
inclusion processes

The Board is committed to ensuring that  
it is balanced, diverse and representative  
of the markets in which it operates. During  
the year, Jacky Simmonds was appointed  
to the Board and brings with her valuable 
knowledge and experience, particularly 
in people-related matters. 

Succession planning for executives remained 
high on the agenda and formal Board sessions 
were held to focus on the topic of talent and 
leadership succession. These sessions involved 
the review of succession plans for the senior 
leadership team, leadership talent within the 
business areas and young talent initiatives, in 
the context of fostering diversity. Examples of 
the diversity and inclusion initiatives that are in 
place include reverse mentoring, annual 
leadership conferences and the Bunzl Women 
in Leadership engagement programmes, which 
are now present in all business areas. 

More information on succession planning, 
talent management and diversity and 
inclusion can be found in the Nomination 
committee report. 

More on page 109

Continuing Bunzl’s focus on sustainability 
and building this into customer relationships

The Board continued to develop the Company’s 
sustainability strategy and oversee its 
implementation throughout the year. The 
establishment of the Board Sustainability 
Committee in 2022 has allowed for more 
detailed consideration of sustainability-related 
risks and opportunities, with one of the focal 

points of Bunzl’s 2023 sustainability objectives 
being products and packaging. Approaching this 
objective with a focus on responsible sourcing 
has enabled the Group to develop deep and 
meaningful customer relationships whereby 
customers are supported with tailored 
solutions and innovative products better suited 
to a circular economy.

Further information on Bunzl’s tailored 
solutions can be found in the 
Sustainability report. 

More on page 56

Supporting management in acquisition and 
organic growth strategies

In line with the Company’s acquisition growth 
strategy, the Board approved the acquisition 
of 19 businesses in 2023. The Board drives and 
monitors the success of acquisitions through:

•  Bunzl’s decentralised model, which allows 
previous company owners to retain an 
entrepreneurial culture and drive further 
success;

•  providing management with training;

•   providing acquired companies with 
support, resources and operational 
excellence; and

•  frequently reviewing the performance of 
acquired companies against projections.

Further information regarding Bunzl’s 
acquisition strategy can be found in the 
Strategic report.

Governance structure

The Board has ultimate responsibility for the 
overall leadership of the Group. To ensure the 
directors maintain overall control over strategic, 
financial, operational and compliance issues, the 
Board meets regularly throughout the year and 
has formally adopted a schedule of matters which 
are required to be brought to it for consideration. 
Further details of the matters reserved for the 
Board can be found on page 93. 

The Board has established four Committees to 
which it delegates certain matters, all of which 
comply with the provisions of the Code and play 
an important governance role through the 
detailed work they carry out to fulfil the 
responsibilities delegated to them. The Board 
recognises the importance of evolving the 
governance structures of the Company in line 
with the development of the Company’s strategy, 
and the Board Sustainability Committee was 
formed with a mandate to provide strategic 
advice to the Board on the principal objectives, 
targets and priorities of Bunzl’s sustainability 
strategy. All Committees meet at least three times 
a year, with the exception of the Audit Committee 
which meets at least four times a year, and 
briefing papers are prepared and circulated to 
Committee members in advance of each meeting. 

The terms of reference for each Committee can 
be found on the Company’s website,  
www.bunzl.com

Board composition
As at 31 December 2023, the Board was made up 
of nine members comprising a Chairman, a CEO, 
a CFO and six non-executive directors, including 
a Senior Independent Director. 

Brief biographical details of the directors in office 
at the date of this report are given on pages 90 to 
91 and further information on the Nomination 
Committee’s approach to succession planning 
can be found in its report on page 108.

None of the Company’s non-executive directors 
had any previous connection with the Company 
or its executive directors on appointment to the 
Board, with the exception of Jacky Simmonds, who 
is presently Chief People Officer at Experian plc. 
Lloyd Pitchford, another non-executive director at 
Bunzl, is the CFO of Experian plc. Notwithstanding 
this connection, all of Bunzl’s non-executive 
directors, including Jacky, are considered by both 
the Board and the criteria set out in the Code to 
be independent. Further details concerning the 
determination of director independence can be 
found in the Nomination Committee report on 
pages 107 to 108.

Each of the non-executive directors is considered 
to have a breadth of strategic, management and 
financial experience gained in each of their own 
fields in a range of multinational businesses, 
further details of which can be found in the 
director skills matrix on page 92. 

The Board is satisfied that each non-executive 
director dedicates appropriate time to their role, 
continues to contribute effectively to Board 
decision making and executes their 
responsibilities to challenge, monitor, advise and 
guide the Company to a high standard for the 
benefit of Bunzl’s stakeholders as a whole. 
Further details relating to the time commitments 
of the directors can be found on page 99. 

In accordance with the terms of the Code and 
Bunzl’s Articles of Association, with the exception 
of Vanda Murray, each of the directors in office at 
the date of this Annual Report will be subject to 
re-election at the 2024 AGM and the reasons for 
each director’s re-election will be set out in the 
forthcoming Notice of Meeting.

CORPORATE GOVERNANCE REPORT continued

Board roles and responsibilities 
The following table summarises the role and responsibilities of the different members of the Board:

Role

Responsibilities

Chairman

The primary job of the Chairman is to be responsible for the leadership of the Board and to 
ensure its effectiveness in all aspects of its role. The Chairman:

•  takes overall responsibility for the composition and capability of the Board and its 

Committees;

•  organises the annual evaluation of the Board, its Committees and each individual director;

•  consults regularly with the Chief Executive Officer and is available on a flexible basis to 

provide advice, counsel and support to the Chief Executive Officer; and

•  ensures corporate governance is conducted in accordance with current best practice, as 

appropriate to the Group.

The Chairman is also viewed by investors as the ultimate steward of the Group and the 
guardian of the interests of all the shareholders.

Chief Executive 
Officer

The Chief Executive Officer is responsible for the leadership and the operational and 
performance management of the Company within the strategy agreed by the Board. The 
Chief Executive Officer:

•  manages the CFO and the Group’s management and day-to-day activities;

•  prepares and presents the strategy for growth in shareholder value to the Board;

•  sets the operating plans and budgets required to deliver the agreed strategy;

•  ensures that the Group has appropriate risk management and control mechanisms in 

place; and

•  communicates with the Company’s shareholders on a day-to-day basis as necessary.

There is a clear division of 
responsibilities between 
the Chairman and the 
Chief Executive Officer, 
which is set out in writing 
and has been agreed by 
the Board.

Chief Financial 
Officer

The Chief Financial Officer supports the Chief Executive Officer and is responsible for managing the Group’s funding strategy, 
financial reporting, non-financial reporting, risk management and internal controls, investor relations programme and the 
leadership of the Finance, Tax and Treasury functions. The Chief Financial Officer communicates with the Company’s analysts 
on a day-to-day basis as necessary.

Senior 
Independent 
Director

The Senior Independent Director is available to shareholders if they have concerns, which contact through the normal 
channels of Chairman, Chief Executive Officer or Chief Financial Officer has failed to resolve or for which such contact is 
inappropriate. The Senior Independent Director is also available to the other directors should they have any concerns, 
which are not appropriate to raise with the Chairman or that have not been satisfactorily resolved by the Chairman.

Independent 
non-executive 
directors

The non-executive directors play an important role in corporate governance and accountability, through both their 
attendance at Board meetings and their membership of the various Board Committees. The non-executive directors bring 
a broad range of business and financial expertise and experience to the Board, which complements and supplements the 
experience of the executive directors. This enables them to offer strategic guidance, evaluate information provided and 
constructively challenge management’s viewpoints, assumptions and performance.

Board activity
The Board meets formally at least seven times 
a year, with two Board meetings held at or near 
Group locations around the world. During 2023, 
the Board held meetings in Spain and in Canada, 
which gave the directors the opportunity to meet 
with local employees and assess the culture of 
the Company.

At each Board meeting, Bunzl’s operational and 
financial performance is discussed and 
presentations are made by the CEO and the CFO. 
The Business Area Heads attend certain meetings 
by invitation to present on key topics within their 
remit. The importance of bringing management 
into meetings to present on their respective area 
of expertise, share knowledge and provide 
updates on the performance of the business is 
well recognised by the Board. The Director of 
Corporate Development frequently presents to 
the Board on potential acquisitions and the Board 
receives regular updates from management on 
risk, health & safety, digital strategy, information 
security, environment, sustainability, governance 
and people matters. 

Board agendas are set by the Chairman in 
consultation with the CEO and with the assistance 
of the Company Secretary, who maintains a rolling 
programme of items for discussion by the Board. 
This ensures that all matters reserved for the 
Board and other key issues are considered at the 
appropriate time. 

Each Board meeting is structured to accommodate 
sufficient challenge and contribution by all 
participants. The Board is supplied with full and 
timely information to enable informed decision 
making. All directors have access to the advice and 
services of the Company Secretary who ensures 
that Board procedures are complied with, and the 
Board is fully briefed on relevant legislative, 
regulatory and corporate governance 
developments. Directors may also take 
independent professional advice at the Company’s 
expense where they judge this to be necessary in 
the furtherance of their duties to discharge their 
responsibilities as directors.

Conflicts of interest
The directors are required to avoid situations in 
which they have, or could have, a direct or indirect 
interest that conflicts, or possibly may conflict, 
with the Company’s interests. In accordance with 
the Companies Act 2006, the Company’s Articles 
of Association allow the Board to authorise 
potential conflicts of interest that may arise and 
to impose such limits or conditions as it thinks fit.

Directors are required to give notice of any 
potential situational and/or transactional 
conflicts, which are then considered by the 
Board and, if deemed appropriate, authorised 
accordingly. A director is not however permitted 
to participate in such considerations or to vote 
in relation to their own conflicts.

The Board has considered and authorised 
a number of potential situational conflicts, 
all of which relate to the holding of external 
directorships and have been entered on the 
Company’s conflicts register. No actual 
conflicts have been identified during the year 
and the Board considers that these 
procedures operate effectively. 

External appointments and time 
commitment of directors
The Board takes the time commitment of 
directors seriously and the time expected of 
directors is set out in their letters of appointment. 
Each director must notify the Chairman prior to 
accepting a new appointment, and the Chairman 
must notify the Board. During the year, the Board 
considered the external appointment of Vanda 
Murray as a non-executive director of Howden 
Joinery Group plc with effect from 1 February 
2024. Additional information on how the Board 
assessed this external appointment is available 
on pages 107 to 108 of the Nomination 
Committee report.

The Board recognises the benefits in terms of 
director knowledge and experience that external 
appointments can bring to Board deliberations. 
In 2023, when considering Vanda’s new 
appointment, the Board considered whether it 
would impact the time required for her to prepare 

for and attend meetings of the Company, engage 
with stakeholders, undertake any training or 
personal development and execute her duties to 
the Company effectively. In addition, the Board 
considered her current portfolio, whether there 
were any conflicts or potential conflicts, the time 
commitment required with the new appointment 
and whether the appointment would cause the 
number of directorships she held to exceed those 
set out in the Code or institutional investor and 
proxy adviser guidance.

The Board is satisfied that each director devotes 
sufficient time to their role at Bunzl and continues 
to discharge their duties effectively.

Induction
The Company Secretary assists the Chairman 
in designing and delivering a tailored induction 
programme for each new member of the Board. 
This takes into account each director’s individual 
needs, aims to outline their roles, responsibilities 
and duties as a director of the Company and 
facilitate their understanding of the Group’s 
business, people, processes, purpose, values 
and culture. 

A typical induction programme normally includes:

•  a detailed information pack that includes 

details of directors’ duties and responsibilities, 
procedures for dealing in Bunzl plc’s shares and 
other governance-related issues;

•  one-to-one meetings with the other members 

of the Board and the Company Secretary;

•  meetings with Committee Chairs, as 

appropriate;

•  meetings with senior management;

•  visits to some of the Group’s locations;

•  information on the main areas of the Group’s 

business activity and risks; and

•  information on the Company’s approach to 
sustainability and stakeholder engagement. 

INDUCTION:
Jacky Simmonds

Meeting with members of senior 
management and employees in Bunzl’s 
business areas has provided me with an 
understanding of the culture within the 
Company and an awareness of the views 
and priorities of employees throughout 
the Group. This knowledge allows me to 
consider the employee perspective in 
Board deliberations and is something  
that I look forward to developing further  
in 2024 and beyond.”

Training and development
The Board recognises the importance of 
continually developing existing directors and 
believes good decision making is enabled by 
a deep understanding of the Group’s operations 
and people. During the course of the year, 
directors receive training and presentations to 
keep their knowledge current and enhance their 
experience. They are updated continually on the 
Group’s businesses, their markets and changes 
to the competitive and regulatory environments 
in which they operate. In addition, the Board is 
kept informed of relevant legal, regulatory and 
financial developments or changes by the 
Company Secretary and the CFO. The Company’s 
legal advisers and auditors give presentations and 
training to the Board on specific topics of interest.

Training and development needs of the Board are 
kept under review and directors attend external 
courses where it is considered appropriate for 
them to do so.

2023 training and development 
activities
•  External adviser training on anti-bribery and 

corruption, including:

 − an overview of the offences under the

Transparency Act 2023 and the

Employee engagement statement
In accordance with Provision 5 of the Code, the 
Board has decided to use alternative 
arrangements to engage with employees. Bunzl 
is a global, decentralised business with operations 
in multiple locations and our employees fulfil a 
broad range of roles with many different 
perspectives. It is therefore essential that our 
engagement methods suit the nature of our 
business, the culture of the Company and our 
workforce. This holistic approach to engagement 
is the most effective method and allows the 
Board to understand, monitor and assess 
employee sentiment. 

Some of the mechanisms used to engage with 
employees during the year are described in the 
following section. Employees are also encouraged 
to get involved with the Company’s performance 
through a variety of different means, including the 
operation of all employee share plans, bonus and 
commission schemes and other incentive 
arrangements. Our employee engagement 
mechanisms are discussed at Board meetings 
and kept under review to ensure that they remain 
appropriate and effective.

Site visits
In 2023, visits to operational sites gave the Board 
a chance to hear views from employees at all 
levels, providing a platform for meaningful 
engagement while enhancing their understanding 
of Bunzl’s operations and culture. Additional 
information on the Board’s site visits can be found 
on page 99.

Bunzl’s CEO, Frank van Zanten, carried out 
additional site visits during the year including 
a five day trip to Latin America, where he met 
employees within the teams of 17 Bunzl 
businesses. This has bolstered his ability as an 
executive director to bring the employee voice 
into Board deliberations.

CEO listening session
In 2023, the CEO, alongside the Director of Group HR, held a third annual listening session with female employees, and employees from ethnically 
diverse backgrounds, across the Group. Bunzl’s CEO listening sessions enable direct engagement between the CEO and employees, which is used 
to review progress against the Company’s diversity objectives, inform future Board decisions and gain further insight into the results of the employee 
pulse survey.

Key themes were identified from the employee feedback provided in the 2023 CEO listening session, which have been compiled and used to inform 
decision making around Bunzl’s diversity and inclusion initiatives in 2024.

Theme

Role models

Key point(s) raised

•  The creation of strong role models is critical, as employees can find it motivating to see people from 

similar backgrounds in senior positions throughout the organisation

•  Success stories covering role models should be more widely publicised through internal 

communications channels

Targets

•  Employees were pleased to see progress towards diversity targets in 2023 and appreciated the 

ambitious targets set for 2024

•  Targets were considered crucial in demonstrating clear measures of success, ensuring that progress 

is not left to chance

Communications

•  Different cultures, including faiths and nationalities, should continue to be celebrated through 

effective communications

Bunzl’s CEO listening sessions have been a valuable engagement mechanism, facilitating the provision of feedback from employees of diverse 
backgrounds direct to Board level. Further information on our diversity and inclusion initiatives can be found on page 36.

Non-executive director listening sessions
To gain insight into the 2023 employee experience, Lloyd Pitchford and Vanda Murray held several non-executive director listening sessions, speaking 
directly with employees from the Continental Europe, North America and Asia Pacific business areas. These sessions are held to facilitate direct 
engagement between the non-executive directors and Bunzl employees across all levels of the Group, on topics such as the effectiveness of 
communications, the quality of IT resources, and the alignment of executive remuneration with wider company pay policy. The matters raised by 
employees are fed back to the Board and the Board uses this feedback to inform its decisions.

Theme

Communications

Technology

Surveys

Reward

Key point(s) raised

•  Employees considered that internal communications had improved, resulting in a greater feeling of 

connectedness

•  Increased communication around Group strategy was identified as being something that employees 

would welcome

•  Employees were supportive of improvements to IT resources and systems in 2023 and encouraged 

continued investment

•  The Great Place to Work survey had been expanded to cover all regions in 2023 and this was 

positively received as an additional way for employees to have their voices heard across the Group
•  The basis of reward for frontline staff, when compared with that of management, was considered to 

be consistent

Engagement with customers,  
suppliers and other stakeholders
Understanding the views of the Company’s 
stakeholders is a key priority for the Board and 
Bunzl as a whole. It helps to focus the Company’s 
resources, engagement and reporting activities by 
addressing those issues that matter most to the 
Group’s businesses and to the Company’s wider 
stakeholders. Fostering strong business 
relationships is an intrinsic part of the Company’s 
long established and successful compounding 
strategy and a key consideration in all decision 
making. More information about Bunzl’s 
engagement with its suppliers, customers and 
wider stakeholder groups can be found on 
pages 64 to 67 and in the Sustainability report 
on pages 54 to 62.

Bunzl Insight series
In 2022, Bunzl began hosting Insight events, 
designed to enhance communication and 
engagement with key stakeholders by providing 
more detailed and comprehensive information 
regarding the Group’s international business 
operations. Given the intricate and expansive 
nature of Bunzl’s decentralised operations, 
providing additional detail beyond that outlined in 
Bunzl’s Annual Report, Capital Markets Days and 
other engagement activities allows stakeholders 
to gain a better insight into the Group’s culture 
and operational activities.

With a focus on Bunzl’s Continental Europe 
businesses in 2022, and North America in 2023, 
the Insight events were hosted by local senior 
leadership and focused on a wide variety of 
topics, including value-added solutions for 
customers, an overview of Bunzl’s expanding 
acquisition model and highlights of our 
established platform for future growth. The 
Group aims to enhance its engagement with 
stakeholders by actively fostering interaction 
through discussion and feedback.

The Group’s Insight events have been well 
received by stakeholders, with additional Insight 
events having been requested covering specific 
areas of the business. 

Shareholder meetings
The Board is committed to maintaining strong 
communications with our shareholders. 
Committee Chairs seek engagement with major 
shareholders on pertinent matters within their 
responsibility and, in 2023, the Chair of the 
Remuneration Committee sought engagement 
with major shareholders, regarding Bunzl’s 
proposed 2024 director’s remuneration 
policy, details of which can be found on 
pages 122 to 146.

Additionally, major shareholders are routinely 
invited to meet with the Chairman, Chair of the 
Audit Committee and Company Secretary to 
discuss governance at Bunzl. Some of the topics 
that were discussed during our 2023 shareholder 
meetings are outlined below. The outcomes of all 
of the meetings were positive, with no specific 
matters of concern being raised. The Board looks 
forward to continuing its engagement activity in 
the coming year.

Topics discussed in 2023 meetings

Outcome of meetings 

•  Outcomes of the 2023 Board evaluation and 

the Board’s mechanism for tracking 
progress against those outcomes

The outcomes of all of the meetings were 
positive, and the Board will continue its 
engagement activity in the coming year.

•  Succession planning, skills on the Board and 

priorities for the recruitment of new 
directors

•  Talent management priorities and the 

Board’s involvement in relation to talent 
management below Board level

•  The strategic oversight role of the Board 
with regard to capital allocation and the 
acquisition pipeline

•  Diversity of directors on the Board

Board performance review 
The Board believes that maintaining a trajectory of continual improvement of its performance is pivotal to its success. A formal and rigorous Board performance review, evaluating the Board, its 
Committees, the Chairman and each individual director is carried out annually and externally facilitated every three years, with a comprehensive external review having taken place during 2023. 
The process and outcomes of the 2023 performance review, along with actions taken to address the findings of the 2022 review, are outlined below. 

1. Selection

2. Planning

The review was undertaken by Lintstock, an independent advisory firm that does not provide any other services to, or have any connection with, the Company. The Board, following the 
recommendation of the Nomination Committee, felt that engaging Lintstock was appropriate given their in-depth understanding of the Company. Such appointment would also ensure 
consistency and continuity in the presentation of results from year to year, allowing progress to be tracked effectively. 

The objectives, scope and areas of focus of the review were agreed between the Chairman and the Company Secretary and discussed with Lintstock. It was agreed that the performance 
of the Board, its Committees, the Board Chairman, Committee Chairs and each individual director would be reviewed and that it would cover core aspects of governance such as 
information, composition and dynamics, as well as people, strategy and risk areas relevant to the performance of Bunzl. 

3. Surveys and 
Questionnaires

With the agreed scope and objectives in mind, Lintstock invited each director to complete a survey, following which Lintstock held in-depth one-to-one interviews with each of them. 
The Company Secretary coordinated the process and provided Lintstock with the necessary support throughout. 

4. Findings 

Reports on the results of the reviews were presented to the Chairman and Company Secretary and subsequently discussed by the Board and its Committees. Reports on individual 
director performance were presented to the Chairman and a report on the Chairman was provided to the Senior Independent Director, who discussed the findings with the other 
non-executive directors. The contributions, independence and time commitment of each director were found to be effective. 

5. Next steps

Having considered the findings of the review, the Board agreed on key priorities to further improve performance in 2024 and the follow up actions in relation thereto. These actions, 
further details of which are detailed below, have been built into the Board’s agenda and activities for 2024. 

Led by the Senior Independent Director, the non-executive directors meet without the Chairman present at least annually to appraise the Chairman’s performance, including a review of his other 
commitments, to ensure that he is able to allocate sufficient time to the Company to discharge his responsibilities effectively. The Chairman also periodically holds meetings with the non-executive 
directors without the executive directors present. All of these processes were carried out satisfactorily during the year.

Details of progress made in respect of the key priorities identified in 2022, are set out below.

Key priorities identified during 2022

Progress made

Key priorities identified during 2023

Outcome of evaluation

1.  Focusing on management succession planning and 
enhancing the Group’s organisational structure, 
talent management, and diversity and inclusion 
processes.

2.  Continuing Bunzl’s focus on sustainability and 

building this into customer relationships.

3.  Supporting management in acquisition and organic 

growth strategies.

4.  Continued Board oversight of strategic priorities and 

the execution of Bunzl’s strategic plans.

The Board is satisfied that the 
priorities identified following 
the evaluation carried out in 
2022 have been adequately 
addressed during 2023.

See page 89 for further 
information.

1. Supporting the continuing evolution of the Board’s 
composition.

2. Deepening the Board’s understanding of key 
stakeholder developments, including customers.

3. Monitoring management succession and 
development plans to build the long term talent 
pipeline.

4. Continuing to monitor the external context, 
particularly in areas such as sustainability and 
technology.

As a result of the external 
evaluation process carried out 
in 2023, the Board concluded 
that both it and its Committees 
are operating effectively.

Risk management and internal controls overview

The Board has delegated to an Executive Committee, consisting 
of the CEO, CFO and other functional managers, the initial 
responsibility for identifying, evaluating, managing and 
mitigating the risks facing the Group and for deciding how 
these are best managed, as well as responsibility for 
establishing a system of internal controls appropriate to the 
business environments in which the Group operates. The 
principal features of this system include:

Some of the procedures carried out in order to monitor the 
effectiveness of the internal controls system and to identify, 
manage and mitigate business risk are:

•  central management holds regular meetings with business 
area management to discuss strategic, operational and 
financial issues, including a review of the principal risks 
affecting each of the business areas and the policies and 
procedures by which these risks are managed; 

•  a procedure for monitoring the effectiveness of the internal 

controls system through a tiered management structure with 
clearly defined lines of responsibility and delegation of 
authority;

•  a second line of defence Internal Controls team to continually 
develop the Group’s framework and approach to internal 
controls over financial reporting;

•  formal standards of business conduct (including code of 

conduct, anti-bribery and corruption, fraud investigations and 
reporting, and whistleblowing policies) based on honesty, 
integrity, fair dealing and compliance with the local laws and 
regulations of the countries in which the Group operates;

•  strategic plans and comprehensive budgets which are 

prepared annually by the business areas and approved by 
the Board;

•  clearly defined authorisation procedures for capital 

investment and acquisitions;

•  a well-established consolidation and reporting system for the 

statutory accounts and monthly management accounts; 

•  detailed manuals covering Group accounting policies, and 

policies and procedures for the Group’s treasury operations 
supplemented by internal controls procedures at a business 
area level;

•  periodic IT risk assessment aligned with the Group’s IT security 
standard, as well as continual investment in IT systems and 
security to ensure the security of information systems and 
data, business continuity and the production of timely and 
accurate management information; and

•  considering ESG and non-financial reporting and assurance.

•  the Executive Committee reviews the outcome of the 

discussions held at business area meetings on internal 
controls and risk management issues;

•  the Board in turn reviews the outcome of the Executive 
Committee discussions on internal controls and risk 
management issues, which ensures a documented and 
auditable trail of accountability;

•  each business area, the Executive Committee and the Board 

carry out an annual fraud risk assessment. Reporting protocols 
are in place to identify, analyse and respond to actual or 
potential fraud incidents;

•  an annual self-assessment of the status of internal controls 
measured against a prescribed list of minimum standards is 
performed by every business and action plans are agreed 
where remedial action is required;

•  actual results are reviewed monthly against budget, forecasts 
and the previous year and explanations are obtained for all 
significant variances;

•  all treasury activities, including in relation to the management 
of foreign exchange exposures and Group borrowings, are 
reported and reviewed monthly. The Group’s bank balances 
around the world are monitored on a weekly basis and 
significant movements are reviewed centrally;

•  developments in tax, treasury and accounting are continually 

monitored by Group management in association with 
external advisers;

•  regular meetings are held with insurance and risk advisers to 

assess the risks throughout the Group;

•  systems are in place to monitor IT security incidents, analyse 
and remediate any identified weaknesses. Findings are used 
to continually improve defences across all Group companies; 

•  the Internal Audit function periodically performs business 
and risk-themed audit work, makes recommendations to 
improve processes and controls and follows up to ensure 
that management implements the recommendations made. 
The Internal Audit function’s work is determined on a risk 
assessment basis and its findings are reported to Group and 
business area management as well as to the Audit Committee 
and the external auditors;

•  the Audit Committee, which comprises all of the independent 
non-executive directors of the Company, meets regularly 
throughout the year. Further details of the work of the 
Committee, which includes a review of the effectiveness of 
the Company’s internal financial controls and the assurance 
procedures relating to the Company’s risk management 
system, are set out in the Audit Committee report on 
pages 112 to 121;

•  management committees (known as the Group Sustainability 
Committee, the Environment & Climate Change Committee, 
the Health & Safety Committee, and the Supply Chain 
Committee) which oversee issues relating principally to 
environment, health & safety and business continuity planning 
matters, set relevant policies and practices and monitor their 
implementation; and

•  health & safety risk assessments, safety audits and a regular 
review of progress against objectives established by each 
business area are periodically carried out.

Risk management and internal controls
In accordance with the Code, the Board acknowledges that it has overall responsibility for identifying, evaluating, managing and mitigating the principal and emerging risks faced by the Group, and for monitoring 
the Group’s risk management and internal controls systems. Such systems are designed to manage rather than eliminate the risk of failure to achieve business objectives and can only provide reasonable and not 
absolute assurance against material misstatement or loss.

In accordance with the Code and the related guidance, the Company has established the procedures necessary to ensure that there is an ongoing process for identifying, evaluating, managing and mitigating the 
principal risks faced by the Group and for determining the nature and extent of the principal risks it is willing to take to achieve its strategic objectives (its ‘risk appetite’). The directors confirm that such 
procedures have been in place for the year ended 31 December 2023 and, up to the date of approval of these financial statements, that the Group’s risk management and internal controls systems have been 
monitored during the year.

Further information about the Group’s approach to risk management and the principal risks and uncertainties facing the Group can be found on pages 68 to 76.

Financial and business reporting
The responsibilities of the directors in respect of the preparation of the Group and parent company financial statements are set out on page 195 and the auditors’ report on pages 196 to 201 includes a 
statement by the external auditors about their reporting responsibilities. In accordance with provision 30 of the Code and as set out on page 154, the directors are of the opinion that it is appropriate to continue 
to adopt the going concern basis in preparing the financial statements. 

The process of preparing the Annual Report has included the following:

•  comprehensive reviews undertaken at different levels of the Group in order to ensure the accuracy, consistency and overall balance of the Annual Report; and

•  procedures to verify the factual accuracy of the Annual Report.

Fair, balanced and understandable – Bunzl’s assurance framework
In accordance with provision 27 of the Code, the Board confirms that taken as a whole, the 2023 Annual Report is fair, balanced and understandable, and provides the information necessary for shareholders to 
assess the Company’s position, performance, business model and strategy. Considerations of the Board when reviewing whether the 2023 Annual Report, taken as a whole, is fair, balanced and understandable 
and provides sufficient information to enable the reader to assess the Group’s position and performance, business model and strategy, are shown below:

NOMINATION COMMITTEE REPORT

Introduction from Peter Ventress
On behalf of the Board, I am pleased to present 
the Nomination Committee’s report for the 
financial year ended 31 December 2023, which 
outlines the Committee’s role and responsibilities, 
as well as our activities and areas of focus 
during the year.

I am delighted to welcome Jacky Simmonds 
as a member of the Committee, following her 
appointment as a non-executive director on 
1 March 2023. Jacky was appointed after an 
extensive search and selection process, 
considered in the context of the existing 
balance of skills and diversity on the Board. She 
has significant knowledge and experience across 
all aspects of HR, with particular expertise in 
employee engagement, transformational change, 
board and leadership succession planning, 
employee relations, and talent management. 
Additional information concerning the search 
and selection process for Jacky is included in the 
report that follows, and information concerning 
her skills and experience is set out on page 91. 
An overview of Jacky’s induction process can 
be found on page 99.

As I mentioned in my introduction to the 
Corporate governance report, Vanda Murray, 
Senior Independent Director and Chair of the 
Remuneration Committee, has served as a 
director for over nine years and will therefore, 
in accordance with best practice and the Code, 
step down from the Board at the conclusion 
of the AGM on 24 April 2024. A recruitment 
process for a new non-executive director is 
now underway and an announcement will 
be released in due course, once a suitable 
candidate has been identified.

The Nomination Committee dedicated time 
during the year to succession planning for the 
roles of Senior Independent Director and 
Remuneration Committee Chair and an overview 
of the matters considered by the Committee 
as part of its deliberations can be found later 
in this report.

In 2023, the Committee has focused on the 
key priorities identified during the 2022 Board 
evaluation, which included management 
succession planning, enhancing the Group’s 
organisational structure, talent management, and 
the diversity and inclusion process. Information 
on the Committee’s progress in respect of these 
priorities can be found on pages 107 to 109.

The 2023 Board evaluation was externally 
facilitated and concluded that the Committee 
continues to operate effectively and benefits from 
strong internal and external support. 
Recommended areas of focus for 2024 included 
executive succession and talent development, 
as well as ongoing monitoring of the director 
skills matrix in the wider context of the Group’s 
business and strategic needs. For a 
comprehensive summary of the Board evaluation 
process and outcomes, see page 103. An 
overview of the Committee’s priorities for 2024 
can be found on the following page.

The Board’s composition is fully compliant with 
the requirements of the Parker Review on ethnic 
diversity and the gender diversity targets outlined 
in the Hampton-Alexander Review. I am also 
pleased to confirm that, following the 
appointment of Jacky, we exceed the Financial 
Conduct Authority’s new board diversity targets 
implemented under Listing Rule 9.8.6. Further 
information concerning our performance against 
these targets can be found on page 109.

The Committee will continue to champion 
an inclusive and diverse approach to talent 
management and closely monitor Board and 
Committee performance against best practice.

 Jacky Simmonds was appointed as a director on 1 March 2023 
and attended all Committee meetings held between that date 
and the end of the year. 

Key areas of focus in 2024
•  Long term succession planning, with a 

particular focus on the skills matrix for the 
Board and senior executives

•  Executive succession and talent development

•  The balance of internal experience and external 

fresh perspectives on the Board

•  Consideration of the Company’s profile from 

a talent management perspective

Role and support
The Committee’s principal role is to lead the 
process for appointments to the Board, whether 
to fill any vacancies that may arise or to change 
the number of Board members, ensure plans are 
in place for orderly succession to both the Board 
and senior management positions and oversee 
the development of a diverse pipeline for 
succession. The senior management succession 
plans take into account the views of all Board 
members to ensure the plans encompass the 
benefit of all their skills and experience. In the 
performance of its duties, the Committee has 
been authorised to enlist the services of external 
executive search firms to assist with the 
recruitment process, including the identification 
of potential candidates, to fill Board positions 
and vacancies.

It is the Committee’s role to ensure that the 
Board and its Committees maintain the 
appropriate balance of skills, knowledge, 
experience and diversity to ensure their 
continued effectiveness. Information 
concerning the training and development 
activities undertaken by the directors during 
the year can be found on page 99. 

The Committee meets as necessary throughout 
the year to discharge its responsibilities. The 
Committee’s terms of reference are available on 
the Company’s website, www.bunzl.com.

Performance evaluation
The Committee’s performance and effectiveness 
are reviewed annually by both the Committee and 
as part of the Board performance evaluation. The 
Chair of the Committee also meets with each 
Committee member independently to ensure that 
their individual views about the operation of the 
Committee are taken into account. This year, the 
Board evaluation was externally facilitated by 
Lintstock. Additional information concerning the 
results of the 2023 performance evaluation is set 
out on page 103.

Principal responsibilities of the 
Committee

Board structure

•  Reviewing the structure, size and 

composition of the Board with regard to 
maintaining a balance of skills, experience, 
knowledge and diversity

Succession

•  Considering succession planning, taking into 
account the challenges and opportunities 
facing the Company and the skills and 
expertise required by the Board and senior 
management in the future

•  Reviewing annually a succession planning 
presentation in relation to the Company’s 
senior management

Appointments

•  Identifying and nominating appropriate 

individuals to fill Board vacancies as they 
arise

•  Approving the appointment of any senior 
executive who is to report directly to the 
Chief Executive Officer

•  Making recommendations to the Board  
as to the continuation in office and/or 
reappointment of directors

Evaluation

•  Considering the commitment required of 

non-executive directors and reviewing their 
performance

Activities

Evaluation and independence
When determining whether to recommend that 
the directors be reappointed at the 2024 AGM, 
the Committee considered a number of factors, 
including the output of the 2023 external Board 
evaluation. These factors were also considered, 
in 2023, when recommending that the Board 
approve additional three-year terms for Lloyd 
Pitchford, Stephan Nanninga and Vin Murria. 
Having served on the Board for more than six 
years, Lloyd Pitchford and Stephan Nanninga’s 
continued objectivity and independence were 
subject to particularly rigorous review. 

Further details concerning the Board evaluation 
process that was carried out during 2023, which 
identified that the Committee continues to 
operate effectively, can be found in the Corporate 
governance report on page 103. Examples of the 
priorities identified as part of the Committee’s 
2023 evaluation can be found under the Key areas 
of focus in 2024 section on this page.

The Committee also conducted a review of 
individual director conflict authorisations as 
recorded in the Conflicts of Interest register. The 
register is maintained by the Company Secretary 
and sets out any actual or potential conflict of 
interest situations which a director has disclosed 
to the Board in line with their statutory duties. 
To form a view of a director’s independence, 
consideration was also given to other external 
appointments held by each director. 

Jacky Simmonds is currently Chief People Officer 
at Experian plc and Lloyd Pitchford, another of 
Bunzl’s non-executive directors is the Chief 
Financial Officer of Experian plc. The Board is 
mindful that the Code states that where a 
non-executive director holds cross-directorships 
or has significant links with other directors 
through involvement in other companies or 
bodies, this is likely to impair, or could appear to 
impair, a non-executive director’s independence. 

Prior to Jacky Simmonds’ appointment to Bunzl, 
the Nomination Committee and the Board 
considered whether the appointment would 
impair the independence of either director.

The Committee and the Board were satisfied that 
there were no business conflicts between the two 
companies and both directors demonstrate 
independence of thought and will offer challenge, 
including of each other’s views. Further, the 
Committee and the Board were satisfied that 
Jacky Simmonds has sufficient time to discharge 
her duties to the Board and Committees of Bunzl 
and that there were no other factors, which would 
impair either director’s independence. 
Accordingly, the Board does not consider that 
Jacky Simmonds’ and Lloyd Pitchford’s positions 
as independent non-executive directors of the 
Company are adversely impacted by their roles 
at Experian plc and are satisfied that, 
notwithstanding these roles, they are to be 
regarded as independent.

Non-executive directors’ independence of 
thought and judgement is vital to facilitating 
constructive and challenging debate in the 
boardroom and is essential to the operational 
effectiveness of the Board and its Committees. 
The Committee determines a non-executive 
director’s independence in line with the relevant 
provisions of the Code and is satisfied that all 
of the non-executive directors meet the criteria 
for independence and that the Chairman of 
the Board met the criteria on appointment 
to that role.

Succession planning
As previously mentioned, Vanda Murray will 
retire from the Board and its Committees at the 
conclusion of the Company’s upcoming AGM in 
April 2024. Having served on the Board for over 
nine years, Vanda’s departure had been factored 
into the Committee’s director succession plans.

Pam Kirby and Jacky Simmonds will be appointed 
to succeed Vanda in the Senior Independent 
Director and Remuneration Committee Chair 
roles, respectively. Pam is a seasoned director 
with extensive executive and non-executive 
experience in large, listed companies, and was 
a clear candidate for the Senior Independent 
Director role. Jacky has a strong background 
across all aspects of HR, including remuneration, 

and has previously served as Chair of the 
Remuneration Committee of Ferguson plc. 
She has also served as a member of Bunzl’s 
Remuneration Committee since her appointment. 
She was therefore considered to be ideally suited 
to the role of Remuneration Committee Chair at 
Bunzl. The need to refresh the Board but at the 
same time maintain a knowledgeable and 
experienced team of non-executive directors 
is something that the Committee continued to 
address in succession planning discussions 
during 2023. 

The Committee recognises that having the right 
directors and senior management, with the right 
capabilities, experience and Company and 
industry knowledge, is fundamental to the 
Group’s long term, sustainable success. In 
furtherance of this, a key responsibility of the 
Committee is to satisfy itself that a robust and 
rigorous succession planning process is in place, 
over both the medium and long term, to ensure 
there is the right mix of skills and experience on 
the Board as the Company evolves. The 
Company’s succession plans, together with the 
Board skills matrix and tenure tracker, are 
considered regularly. This allows the Committee 
to identify potential gaps, including in relation to 
director rotation and in respect of the skills 
needed to deliver the Group’s strategic priorities. 
Effective and proactive succession planning and 
assessment also enable the Committee and the 
Board to ensure that changes to the Board are 
proactively planned and coordinated. 

Enhancing the Committee’s oversight of executive 
succession planning continued to be a key priority 
for the Committee in 2023 and one which will 
continue to be an area of focus in 2024. The 
Committee also plans to deepen its discussions 
concerning the Board skills matrix, and executive 
succession requirements in the context of longer 
term strategic business requirements.

Recruitment
Appointments to the Board are subject to 
rigorous and transparent procedures, and 
the Committee plays a key role in these. 
The Committee oversees and makes 
recommendations to the Board in respect 
of the identification, assessment and selection 
of candidates for appointment. 

The Committee seeks to follow best practice in 
all the appointments it recommends, agreeing the 
criteria for each role and the most appropriate 
interview panel, before considering a 
comprehensive and diverse list of candidates. 
Shortlisted candidates are interviewed and 

assessed against the chosen criteria and due 
diligence is then undertaken before the 
Committee makes its final recommendation. 
Executive search firms are appointed based on 
their expertise relative to each role, with Russell 
Reynolds Associates being engaged in 2023. 
Russell Reynolds Associates do not provide any 
other services to, or have any connection with, 
the Company or its individual directors. Russell 
Reynolds Associates are a signatory to the 
Voluntary Code of Conduct for Executive Search 
Firms on gender diversity and best practice. 
An overview of the search and selection process 
undertaken in respect of the appointment of 
Jacky Simmonds can be found below.

NOMINATION COMMITTEE REPORT continued

Talent
The Committee takes an active interest in the 
quality and development of the talent and 
capabilities within Bunzl, ensuring that 
appropriate opportunities are in place to develop 
high-performing individuals. As part of its remit, 
during 2023, the Committee continued to monitor 
the development of Bunzl’s Executive Committee, 
which sits below the Board, to ensure that there is 
a diverse supply of senior executives and 
potential future Board members with appropriate 
skills and experience.

The Committee embraces the importance of 
diversity and inclusion in all Board and senior 
management recruitment and challenges external 
search consultants where necessary to ensure 
that diversity of gender, social and ethnic 
backgrounds and cognitive and personal 
strengths is always considered in the selection 
of candidates. In addition, the Committee seeks 
to engage firms that are signatories to the 
Voluntary Code of Conduct of Executive Search 
Firms and encourages them to look further afield 
and access talent from wide and diverse pools.

While taking the important considerations of 
gender and diversity into account, the Committee 
will continue to recommend appointments to the 
Board based on merit and the individual skills and 
experience of each candidate. It is nevertheless 
clear that gender, ethnicity, race and other 
forms of diversity and inclusion must remain 
key parts of our succession planning discussions 
and are critical to the long term sustainable 
success of the business.

The Board and the Committee’s approach to 
inclusion and diversity in respect of the Board and 
senior management is set out in the Board and 
Committee Diversity Policy, which is reviewed 
regularly and can be found on the Company’s 
website at www.bunzl.com. The Board 
Sustainability Committee refreshed the Board 
and Committee Diversity Policy in 2023, 
increasing the explicitly mentioned diversity 
characteristics and adding tangible targets that 
the Board will seek to continue to meet in future. 
Additional information concerning diversity and 
inclusion in Bunzl can be found in the 
Sustainability report on pages 44 to 62 and 
in the Our People section on page 36.

During the year, the Company completed annual 
talent and succession planning reviews with the 
Business Area Heads and HR Directors, a 
summary of which was discussed by the 
Committee. Additionally, the CEO presented his 
annual management succession plan to the 
Committee for its consideration. This included 
information on people review processes, 
functional talent development, specific emerging 
talent pipelines, diversity, equity and inclusion, 
and learning and development initiatives. This 
process ensures that high performing individuals 
within senior management can be developed and 
nurtured in order to strengthen the succession 
pipeline further, while at the same time increasing 
diversity in senior roles across the Group. The 
Committee also maintained regular interaction 
with senior management across the Group and 
within each business area. Such interaction 
enables the Committee to familiarise itself with 
the teams, thereby facilitating the identification 
of high performing talent and informing 
succession planning.

Inclusion and diversity
Boards with an appropriate mix of experience, 
backgrounds and perspectives are widely 
acknowledged to foster robust dialogue of 
differing views and be less susceptible to 
groupthink. The Committee strives to embed 
inclusion in everything that it does, and 
succession planning and the appointment 
process are key in promoting diversity in a way 
that is consistent with Bunzl’s long term strategy.

Performance against targets under LR 9.8.6

The Company is pleased to announce that it already meets the following diversity targets, at the 
reference date of 31 December 2023: 

I. 

 at least 40% of the individuals on the Board of directors are women;

BOARD SUSTAINABILITY COMMITTEE REPORT

Introduction from Peter Ventress
I am pleased to present the first report of the 
Board Sustainability Committee (the ‘BSC’) for 
the financial year ended 31 December 2023. This 
report provides an overview of the Committee’s 
responsibilities and activities throughout the year, 
and demonstrates how our work contributes to 
sustainable value creation for the Company and 
its stakeholders. 

Bunzl is on a journey with respect to 
sustainability, an area of critical strategic 
importance in which the Company aims to be an 
industry leader. Established in 2022, the 
Committee acts as an oversight function for the 
Group Sustainability Committee and provides 
strategic advice to the Board on the objectives, 
targets and priorities of the Group’s sustainability 
strategy. While principal responsibility for 
determining the sustainability strategy and its 
implementation remain decisions for the Board, 
the Committee supplements its work in this area 
to allow for more detailed consideration of 
sustainability-related risks and opportunities. 
This reflects the centrality of sustainability to 
Bunzl’s strategy and the Company’s recognition 
of the increasing importance of sustainability 
matters globally. 

This year, the Committee met three times and 
discussed a range of matters, details of which are 
set out later in this report. Our meetings are 
regularly attended by Bunzl’s Head of 
Sustainability and Director of Group HR who, 
throughout the year have provided valuable 
insights into ESG-related matters, including deep 
dives on the Company’s net zero transition plan, 
responsible sourcing at Bunzl, and the Company’s 
double materiality assessment in 2023 and 
beyond. These sessions have bolstered the 
Committee’s understanding of key sustainability 
issues at play within the Company, enabling the 
Committee to leverage its experience and 
expertise to have meaningful discussions and 
provide informed recommendations to the Board. 

Bunzl’s commitment to sustainability is a source 
of competitive advantage, encouraging innovation 
and long term decision making, aligned with our 
purpose-led strategy. During the year, the 
Committee helped the Company to deliver on this 
commitment by reviewing workstreams such as 
the proposed approach for Bunzl’s supplier 
engagement programme, considering an update 
on the Science Based Target initiative’s (‘SBTi’s’) 
Net Zero Standard (which has formed the basis of 
the Company’s net zero transition plan) and 
assessing performance against the Group’s 
carbon reduction and other sustainability targets. 
The Committee recognises that accountability and 
transparency are key to building trust in the 
Company’s sustainability efforts and endeavours 
to report effectively against sustainability-related 
targets. These disclosures and further 
information regarding Bunzl’s approach to 
sustainability can be found in the Sustainability 
report on pages 44 to 62.

During the year, the Committee also reviewed 
and updated the Board and Committee Diversity 
Policy to widen the diversity characteristics 
explicitly outlined for consideration and to 
incorporate the Company’s diversity targets, 
in relation to both Board and Committee 
appointments. A link to the Board and Committee 
Diversity Policy can be found on the Company’s 
website, www.bunzl.com.

The 2023 Board evaluation concluded that the 
Committee has come together well since its 
formation and I look forward to sustainability 
becoming even further embedded in our 
governance framework going forward.

Q&A:
with James Pitcher, Group Head of 
Sustainability

Q. How has the formation of the BSC 
influenced Bunzl’s governance of 
sustainability related issues?

Sustainability has always been a regular agenda 
item at Bunzl’s Board meetings, but the creation 
of the BSC has allowed for more time to be 
dedicated to discussion of sustainability-related 
matters and more frequent updates to be 
provided to the Board on the progress of our 
key initiatives. This allows Board members to 
consider sustainability-related issues in more 
detail and ask more questions on particular 
topics, for example the development of our 
net zero transition plan. 

The formation of the BSC has also facilitated 
deeper Board-level consideration of emerging 
issues, such as new sustainability reporting 
standards. The Committee’s oversight of this 
area ensures that Bunzl delivers on its 
commitment to clear and transparent 
disclosures and enhances the Group’s 
contribution to a more sustainable future. 

Q. What level of engagement does your team 
have with the BSC? 

As Group Head of Sustainability, I attend and 
present to the Board at Committee meetings, 
supported by other members of the team 
as necessary. 

I then provide updates from meetings to our 
regional sustainability teams so they can 
understand and act on the Committee’s 
feedback as appropriate.

Q. How does the BSC include stakeholder 
considerations in its discussions?

At Bunzl one of our key strengths is being able to 
offer our customers a tailored approach based 
on their individual needs. The local expertise 
and supply flexibility that our decentralised 
structure offers means we are perfectly placed 

to solve the individual problems our customers 
face rather than taking a ‘one size fits all’ 
approach to their sustainability challenges. 
For example, we can provide solutions to suit 
different types of regional or local packaging 
legislation that a customer with a national 
presence needs, and can tailor our deliveries 
to a customer’s network of sites to reduce 
carbon emissions. 

Since the formation of the BSC, we have been 
able to share feedback and examples from our 
customer’s perspectives with the Board and, 
in doing so, give Board members a greater 
appreciation of the sustainability-related 
priorities of our customers and how any issues 
are addressed across Bunzl’s decentralised 
business. The Board is then able to take these 
priorities and issues into consideration and 
make well-informed decisions with the interests 
of Bunzl’s key stakeholders in mind.

AUDIT COMMITTEE REPORT

Introduction from Lloyd Pitchford
I am pleased to present our Audit Committee 
report for the year ended 31 December 2023 
and welcome Jacky Simmonds, who was appointed 
on 1 March 2023, as a Committee member. The 
report provides an overview of the Committee’s 
role and demonstrates how our work contributes 
to the achievement of the Group’s purpose-led 
strategy, further information of which can be 
found on page 26.

Assuring the reliability of our reporting is critical 
to the Group’s long term success and to building 
trust with our stakeholders. The Committee 
assists the Board in fulfilling its responsibilities 
in this regard by monitoring areas such as the 
integrity of financial and non-financial reporting 
and the effectiveness of the risk management 
framework and system of internal controls.

During 2023, the Committee made good progress 
on the key areas of focus that were identified as 
part of its 2022 evaluation, further details of which 
are set out in the report that follows. The 
Committee continues to keep its activities under 
review to ensure they remain appropriate, and 
insights into the Committee’s priorities for the 
forthcoming year can be found on page 113.

External audit tender
In accordance with The Statutory Audit Services 
for Large Companies Market Investigation 
(Mandatory Use of Competitive Tender Processes 
and Audit Committee Responsibilities) Order 2014 
(the ‘CMA Order’), the Company is required to put 
its external audit contract out to tender every 10 
years. As PricewaterhouseCoopers LLP (‘PwC’) 
were appointed as Bunzl’s external auditors in 
2014, it was decided that a formal and competitive 
tender process, overseen by the Committee, 
would be carried out in 2023. 

The tender concluded with the Board accepting 
the Committee’s recommendation that, subject 
to shareholder approval at the Company’s 2024 
AGM, PwC be reappointed as the Company’s 
statutory auditors for the 2024 financial year. 
An overview of the tender process can be found 
on page 120.

Audit and corporate governance 
reforms
During 2023, the Committee monitored the 
draft Companies (Strategic Report and Directors’ 
Report) (Amendment) Regulations 2023 and 
undertook preparatory work to ensure that the 
Company would be well positioned to implement 
the new requirements. While the statutory 
instrument has been withdrawn, the principle of 
increasing the effectiveness of the Company’s risk 
management and internal controls systems 
remains a priority for the Committee.

In addition, the Audit Committees and the 
External Audit: Minimum Standard (the ‘Minimum 
Standard’) was issued by the Financial Reporting 
Council (the ‘FRC’) in 2023. Prior to its 
implementation, a gap analysis was undertaken 
to ensure that the Company’s current practices 
are in line with the requirements set out therein. 
Although the Minimum Standard is not currently 
mandated, I am pleased to share that the 
Company complies with its provisions.

The Committee is also aware of the amendments 
to the UK Corporate Governance Code, which 
were published by the FRC in January 2024. As 
mentioned in the Corporate governance report, 
a full review of the new requirements will be 
undertaken in 2024 and the Committee will report 
formally against the relevant provisions as they are 
brought into effect in 2025 and 2026.

Risk management, internal controls,  
and fraud risk
Bunzl’s internal controls environment is designed 
to protect the business from any material risks it 
faces. Overseen by the Committee, Bunzl’s 
Internal Controls Essentials programme was 
implemented in 2022 to address the UK 
government’s proposed reforms to the audit and 
corporate governance regime. Although some of 
the proposed reforms were withdrawn in October 
2023, the programme was implemented with a 
‘no-regrets’ approach and designed to support 
Bunzl’s growing businesses with a clear global 
framework and guidance but localised design 
and implementation. As such, core programme 

objectives around financial controls remain and 
implementation work continues. Progress in 
respect of the work carried out under the 
programme was considered at each Committee 
meeting during 2023 and the Committee is 
pleased with the positive impact that the 
programme has had on the Group’s risk and 
control environment. The Committee will review 
the Internal Controls Essentials programme 
approach and alignment with the relevant 
provisions of the revised Code in 2024, with 
a particular focus on non-financial controls.

The Internal Controls Essentials programme has 
also brought about more extensive and frequent 
reporting of fraud risk and, in 2023, the 
Committee evaluated a new cross-functional 
Fraud Response and Investigation Standard, 
developed in conjunction with a third party 
security firm. The standard was designed to 
supplement the Group Fraud Policy, which itself 
was refreshed in 2022, with the aim of advancing 
minimum standards and providing best practice 
guidelines on investigation activity. The impact 
of the new standard will be kept under review 
and risk management and internal controls will 
remain an area of focus for the Committee 
throughout 2024. 

Additional information on our governance of risk 
management and internal controls can be found 
later in this report and in the Corporate 
governance report on pages 116 to 117.

Information and cyber security
Bunzl’s information and cyber security 
programmes are vital to the sustainable success 
of the Group’s operations. Ensuring that robust 
and adaptable governance processes are in place 
to detect and respond to ever-evolving cyber 
security risks remained a key focus of the 
Committee in 2023. During the year, the 
Committee received regular updates on the 
Group’s information security internal controls 
framework from both the Group Chief Information 
Officer (‘Group CIO’) and the Group Chief 
Information Security Officer (‘Group CISO’), 
including the output from an externally facilitated 
cyber incident simulation.

AUDIT COMMITTEE REPORT continued

Additional information on the Group’s approach 
to information and cyber security is outlined later 
in this report on page 116.

Financial and non-financial reporting
During the year, the Finance function’s remit was 
expanded to include responsibility for the Internal 
Controls team, as well as ESG and non-financial 
reporting. This is a welcome development, which 
I believe will streamline the Group’s reporting 
processes and further enhance the quality of 
Bunzl’s disclosures. 

Monitoring the integrity of the Group’s financial 
and narrative reporting and the significant 
judgements contained therein continued to be 
a key priority in 2023. The Committee received 
regular updates on legal and regulatory 
developments relating to ESG and non-financial 
reporting and considered existing processes in 
the context of these new requirements and 
emerging best practice. The Committee is aware 
of incoming legislation, such as the Corporate 
Sustainability Reporting Directive, and will monitor 
developments in this area closely to ensure that 
it is well positioned to oversee and, where 
necessary, challenge, the Company’s plans and 
actions to comply therewith.

During the year, a letter was received from the 
Conduct Committee of the FRC relating to its 
limited scope review of the Company’s Annual 
Report for the year ended 31 December 2022. 
Further information was requested in relation to 
two principal areas. However, following our letter 
of response, no substantive changes were 
required to the Company’s disclosures.1

Internal Audit function
In accordance with the internal audit charter, the 
Company’s Internal Audit function was subject to 
a rigorous external quality assessment (‘EQA’) 
process in 2023, facilitated by an independent 
third party. The Committee considered and 
discussed the results of the assessment and I am 
pleased to report that, since the previous EQA, all 
actions identified to mature the approach and role 
of the function have been taken. Further details 
concerning the 2023 EQA process can be found 
on page 119.

Performance evaluation
I am pleased to report that the 2023 Board 
evaluation demonstrated that we are performing 
our duties effectively and providing robust 
challenge and support to management. Further 
information concerning the evaluation can be 
found in the Corporate governance report on 
page 103.

Additional disclosures on the Committee’s 
activities in 2023, and planned areas of focus in 
2024, can be found later in this report. I hope that 
this report and the insights it provides on the 
Committee’s activities assures you that we 
continue to approach our duties with rigour, 
integrity and transparency.

26 February 2024

Composition and experience
The Committee comprises all of the independent 
non-executive directors, who were appointed to 
the Committee by the Board following 
recommendations by the Nomination Committee. 
The Secretary to the Committee is the 
Company Secretary. 

All members contribute to the work of the 
Committee and bring an appropriate balance of 
financial, risk management, commercial acumen 
and experience in multinational organisations, 
combined with a good understanding of the 
Company’s business and are therefore considered 
by the Board to be collectively competent in the 
sector in which the Company operates.

As the serving Chief Financial Officer of Experian 
plc, the Chair of the Committee, Lloyd Pitchford, is 
considered by the Board to have recent and 
relevant financial experience. The Committee 
members are of an independent mindset and 
bring a diversity of perspectives, knowledge and 
experience to the Committee’s deliberations, 
which in turn ensures that the Committee is able 
to provide an appropriate amount of scrutiny, 
challenge and support to management. 
Independent thinking is an essential aspect of the 
Committee’s role and is crucial in assessing the 
work of management and the assurance provided 
by the internal and external audit functions. 
Further information concerning the directors’ skills 
and experience can be found in the Corporate 
governance report on pages 90 to 92.

 The FRC makes suggestions, where it believes the users of the accounts would benefit from improvements to the Company’s existing 
disclosures. Each year, the Company considers any suggestions made by the FRC in preparing the Company’s Annual Report. The 
Company recognises that the FRC’s review was based on a review of its Annual Report for the year ended 31 December 2022 and did 
not benefit from detailed knowledge of the Company’s business or an understanding of the underlying transactions entered into. 
The FRC’s review provides no assurance that the Company’s Annual Report is correct in all material respects; the FRC’s role is not to 
verify the information provided but to consider compliance with reporting requirements.

AUDIT COMMITTEE REPORT continued

Role and support
The role of the Audit Committee is to act 
independently of management to safeguard 
the interests of stakeholders in relation to the 
Company’s financial reporting and internal 
controls arrangements. A fundamental part 
of this role is ensuring that the Company has 
effective governance over the Group’s financial 
reporting, including the adequacy of related 
disclosures, the performance of both the internal 
and external audit functions and the management 
of the Group’s systems of internal controls and 
business risk management and related 
compliance activities.

The Committee provides appropriate oversight, 
review and challenge of the decisions and 
approach taken by management in respect of the 
content and disclosures within the Company’s 
financial reports, including considering whether 
such disclosures are set properly in context.

In the performance of its duties, the Committee 
has independent access to the services of the 
Company’s internal audit function and to the 
external auditors and may obtain outside 
professional advice as necessary. 

The Committee’s terms of reference, which were 
reviewed by both the Committee and the Board 
in 2023, are available on the Company’s website, 
www.bunzl.com.

Training and briefings
Throughout 2023, the Committee considered 
market updates and developments to ensure that 
it was fully cognisant of matters that may affect 
the Group and its operations. This included:

•  Internal Controls Essentials programme and 
fraud updates at every Committee meeting;

•  review of non-financial reporting and 

assurance;

•  updates on the proposed UK corporate 

governance and audit reforms;

•  information security updates;

•  PwC Audit Committee training, including:

Principal responsibilities of the 
Committee

 − accounting update;

 − corporate reporting & governance update; 

and

 − regulatory and public policy matters.

Stakeholder engagement
Our relationship with our stakeholders is a 
fundamental driver of value creation and we place 
considerable importance on ensuring that we are 
aware of and understand their views and 
sentiments. The Committee Chair avails himself 
of all opportunities to engage with Bunzl’s 
stakeholders when appropriate in order to obtain 
their feedback and discuss any concerns that they 
may have concerning the Committee’s operations 
and oversight. In 2023, members of the 
Committee, including the Chair, proactively 
reached out to various institutional shareholders 
to solicit meetings to discuss the work of the 
Committee and to answer any questions that the 
shareholders may have concerning matters within 
the Committee’s remit. Additional information on 
this engagement can be found of page 102.

While the results of the Company’s proactive 
engagement with stakeholders during the year 
did not identify any concerns relating to the 
Group’s risk profile and management thereof, or 
the Committee’s discharge of its responsibilities, 
this is not taken for granted and the Committee 
will continue to monitor stakeholder sentiment 
closely and ensure that engagement is sought 
whenever it is needed. The Chair of the 
Committee will also be attending the Company’s 
forthcoming AGM to answer any questions that 
shareholders may have. Further information 
concerning stakeholder engagement can be 
found on pages 64 to 67.

Group’s financial and narrative reporting and 
the significant judgements contained therein

•  Reviewing non-financial reporting measures, 
including non-financial KPIs, for inclusion in 
the Annual Report

Risk management and internal controls

•  Reviewing:

 − the Group’s risk management processes, 

procedures and controls; 

 − the effectiveness of the Company’s internal 
controls systems including operational, 
compliance and financial controls; and

 − the assurance activities relating to financial 

and non-financial reporting matters.

Internal audit

•  Overseeing the Company’s internal audit 

activities

•  Monitoring and reviewing the effectiveness 

of the internal audit function

and fees for the statutory audit

•  Initiating and supervising a competitive 
tender process for the external audit as 
required from time to time

•  Developing and implementing a policy on the 

engagement of the external auditors to 
supply non-audit services

Financial statements and significant 
accounting matters
During the year and prior to the publication of the 
Group’s results for 2023, the Committee spent 
considerable time reviewing and scrutinising the 
2023 half year financial report and related news 
release, the 2023 Annual Report (including the 
financial statements), the 2023 annual results 
news release and the reports from the external 
auditors on the outcomes of their half year review 
and their audit relating to 2023. Management was 
challenged, where appropriate, on matters such 
as the appropriateness of accounting policies, 
critical accounting judgements and key accounting 
estimates. The appropriateness of the Group’s 
external reporting framework and use of 
alternative performance measures (‘APMs’) were 
also assessed, with the Committee concluding 
that it is satisfied that the APMs reviewed are 
consistent with market practice, and that 
disclosure and reconciliation to statutory 
measures is appropriate. In conjunction with the 
Board, the Committee reviewed the financial 
modelling and stress testing conducted for the 
going concern assessment, as well as the viability 
assessment process undertaken in support of the 
long term viability statement. The Committee also 
challenged the assumptions and scenarios, 
noting the effect they would have during the 
viability period, further details of which can be 
found on page 77. 

As part of its work, the Committee considered 
a number of significant accounting matters in 
relation to the Company’s financial statements, 
together with the adequacy of the associated 
disclosures. These significant accounting matters 
are summarised in the table below and further 
information can be found in the relevant notes 
to the consolidated financial statements. The 
Committee believes that the significant 
accounting matters have been properly recorded 
in the Company’s books and records and 
accounted for appropriately, including relevant 
disclosure in the Annual Report.

Significant matters considered in relation to the financial statements

Matter

Review and conclusion

Accounting for business 
combinations

For business combinations, the Group has a long-standing process for the identification of the fair values of the assets acquired and liabilities assumed, including separate 
identification of intangible assets using external valuation specialists where required. The Committee reviewed this process and discussed with management and the external 
auditors the methodology and assumptions used to value the assets and liabilities of the acquisitions completed in 2023. The Committee concluded that it was satisfied with 
management’s valuations of these assets and liabilities, including the degree to which such valuations are supported by professional advice from external advisers. For 
business combinations where less than 100% of the issued share capital of a subsidiary is acquired and the acquisition includes put and call options over the remaining share 
capital of the subsidiary, the Group has an established process to assess whether a non-controlling interest should be recognised. There were six such business combinations 
during the year. The Committee reviewed the Group’s assessment of these si business combinations, noting that no non-controlling interest had been recognised. The 
Committee concurred with management’s conclusion that the risks and rewards associated with the options to purchase the remaining shares had transferred to the Group 
on each acquisition. Details of the Company’s approach to accounting for acquisitions are set out in Note 9 to the consolidated financial statements.

The carrying value of 
goodwill, customer 
relationships and brands 
intangible assets

Goodwill is allocated to cash generating units (‘CGUs’) and is tested annually for impairment. The Committee critically reviewed and discussed management’s report on the 
impairment testing of the carrying value of goodwill of each of the Group’s CGUs. The Committee also critically reviewed and discussed management’s consideration of the 
impairment risk relating to customer relationships, brands and technology intangible assets. In both regards, the Committee considered the sensitivity of the outcome of 
impairment testing to the use of different assumptions and considered the external auditors’ testing thereof.

After due challenge and debate, the Committee concluded that it was satisfied with the assumptions and judgements applied in relation to the impairment testing and agreed 
that there was no impairment of goodwill or customer relationships, brands and technology intangible assets. Details of the key assumptions and judgements used are set out 
in Note 13 to the consolidated financial statements.

Defined benefit pension 
schemes

The Committee considered reports from management and the external auditors in relation to the valuation of the defined benefit pension schemes and reviewed the key 
actuarial assumptions used in calculating the defined benefit pension liabilities, especially in relation to discount rates, inflation rates and mortality/life expectancy. The 
Committee discussed the reasons for the movement in the net pension surplus and was satisfied that the assumptions used were appropriate and were supported by 
independent actuarial experts.

Inventory and receivable 
provisions

The Committee considered the analysis from management detailing the provision percentages and reconciliation of the provision balance from 31 December 2022 to 
31 December 2023 and noted that, during the year, the Group had a net utilisation of approximately £25 million in trade receivables and slow-moving inventory provisions, 
with usage of these provisions exceeding net charges to increase the provisions.

The Committee also noted that the Group had some utilisation of the additional provisions set up in the prior year as a result of market price movements on certain 
Covid-19 products.

AUDIT COMMITTEE REPORT continued

Risk management
The Board approves the Group’s risk management 
framework and sets the risk appetite, which in 
turn guides management to proactively identify, 
monitor, and manage the material and emerging 
risks that could impact Bunzl. During 2023, the 
Committee continued its regular review of risk 
reporting to ensure the balance between risk and 
opportunity remained in line with the Group’s risk 
appetite and tolerance.

In 2023, the Committee reviewed the process by 
which significant current and emerging risks had 
been identified by management and the Board, 
the key controls and other processes designed to 
manage and mitigate such risks, including the 
assurance provided by the internal audit function, 
the external auditors and other oversight from 
management and the Board. The Committee uses 
a number of tools to review the Group’s risk 
management processes, including the Group’s 
Risk and Assurance Map. These tools are reviewed 
regularly to ensure that they remain fit for 
purpose and continue to meet the needs of the 
business. External assurance reviews, which are 
focused on the maturity of the Group’s risk 
management procedures, are held every five 
years, with the latest taking place in 2022. In 2023, 
the Committee reviewed the output of annual 
internal reviews of the maturity of the Group’s risk 
management procedures, which have been used 
to develop the Group’s ERM framework further 
and set goals for the future.

Cyber risk 
We have continued to strengthen our cyber 
security controls and governance in recent years 
in response to the increasing threat cyber risks 
pose to our businesses, including further 
developing our security policies, practices and 
training. We have remained focused on increasing 
the maturity of our cyber security capabilities and 
have invested heavily in the resources and 
initiatives necessary to maintain and improve our 
information security framework, including 
preventative technologies such as end point 
detection systems, user training and carrying out 
regular health checks and testing. 

We believe that having an overlapping strategy 
based on security tools, people, and processes 
yields the most effective defences. Our layered 
approach to cyber security provides multiple 
opportunities for threats to be identified and 
addressed before they can cause significant harm.

Fundamental to the success of our digital security 
and strategy is our digital security culture, which is 
fostered and embedded through several 
channels. We recognise that a culture of security 
has to start at the top and the Board and 
Committees lead by example by dedicating 
considerable time and attention to the risks 
associated with cyber and information security. 
The Group CIO, Group CISO and the Head of 
Internal Audit and Risk are regularly invited to 
Committee meetings to give an assessment of 
cyber risk and provide updates on the measures 
being taken by management to mitigate the cyber 
and information security risks and other evolving 
threats faced by the business. 

Making security a part of everyone’s 
responsibilities is a key part of instilling Bunzl’s 
security culture and seeing senior management 
embody the security culture through their words 
and actions has been an important part of this. 
Regular communications and presentations from 
the Group CIO and Group CISO also increase 
employees’ awareness and understanding of 
cyber risks and reinforce the significance security 
has for the entire Group. Similar to many large 
companies, Bunzl is the subject of regular cyber 
threats and attacks, none of which were 
considered material and all of which were 
managed effectively by our Group Information 
Security teams in 2023.

In 2023, the Committee received reports on a 
cyber incident simulation exercise facilitated by a 
third party. A cross-functional group undertook 
the exercise, considering how they would address 
the simulated incident at each stage of the 
process. At the end of the simulation, key 
learnings and future actions were summarised 
with additional feedback provided by the third 
party to further improve each function’s approach 
to addressing potential cyber security incidents.

The Committee also received updates on the 
Group’s information security risk assessment 
process and an internal controls overview, 
supported by a detailed internal audit of the 
current information security internal controls 
framework. External assurance reviews of our 
information security systems are undertaken 
regularly, with the last review being carried out in 
2022, and the next one scheduled for 2024.

We believe that having an overlapping strategy 
based on security tools, people, and processes 
yields the most effective defences. Our layered 
approach to cyber security provides multiple 
opportunities for threats to be identified and 
addressed before they can cause significant harm.

AUDIT COMMITTEE REPORT continued

Internal audit
The work of the internal audit function provides 
the Committee with a further means of 
monitoring the processes and actions to manage 
and mitigate those risks identified as posing the 
greatest threat to the Company.

The scope of work covers all systems and 
activities of the Group and work is prioritised 
according to the Company’s risk profile. The 
internal audit plan is approved by the Committee 
annually and is reviewed regularly thereafter to 
ensure that it continues to be fit for purpose and 
to enable the Committee to assess how internal 
audit is delivering against the plan. 

The quality and effectiveness of the internal audit 
function’s work is monitored continually using a 
variety of formal and informal inputs, including 
discussions with management, reviews and 
assessments of the quality of testing results and 
reporting, questionnaires, and feedback from the 
external auditors. This year, an externally 
facilitated evaluation of the effectiveness of the 
internal audit function was undertaken by a 
third party.

The external audit partner and the Head of 
Internal Audit and Risk attend and table reports at 
each scheduled Audit Committee meeting, which 
ensures that the Committee members have the 
opportunity to provide real-time feedback and, 
where appropriate, challenge in relation to all 
audit related matters. The internal audit reports 
include details of the audit findings, the relevant 
management actions required in order to address 
any issues arising, as well as updates on 
management’s progress in addressing any 
outstanding recommendations from previously 
reported findings. The reports also highlight any 
significant issues relating to the processes for 
controlling the activities of the Group and the 
adequacy and effectiveness of such processes. 

A detailed questionnaire is circulated annually to 
gather feedback from a broad range of internal 
stakeholders, including directors and senior 
management at Group and business area levels 
who have regular contact with the internal audit 
function. In 2023, the questionnaire covered a 

total of 35 different aspects of the internal audit 
function, including: purpose, authority and 
responsibility; independence, objectivity and 
proficiency; quality assurance processes; 
adequacy of resources; auditors’ skills and 
capabilities; and the quality of reporting. Taking 
all of these elements into account, the Committee 
concluded that the Internal Audit function 
continued to be effective, efficient and 
appropriately resourced.

The Head of Internal Audit and Risk has direct 
access to the Committee Chair, with whom a 
number of meetings were held during the year 
outside formal Committee meetings. The Chair 
of the Committee also liaises with the CFO as 
necessary to ensure robust oversight and 
challenge in relation to financial control and risk 
management and to ensure that the Committee 
is kept informed of any changes in response to 
new issues or changing circumstances.

In 2023, the Committee considered an external 
quality assessment report on the Internal Audit 
function. The findings of the report were positive, 
revealing that the function benefitted from 
support from the Board, had embedded quality 
assurance processes, and engaged effectively 
with the business while maintaining 
independence and objectivity. The report outlined 
actions to further strengthen and mature the 
Internal Audit function, all of which will be 
addressed as part of the function’s future work 
programme. The Committee will carry out an 
internal effectiveness review of the Internal Audit 
function in 2024.

External auditors
An important part of the Committee’s work 
consists of overseeing the Group’s relationship 
with the external auditors. The Committee is 
responsible for ensuring that the three-way 
relationship between the Committee, the external 
auditors and the Company’s management is 
appropriate and that the independence, quality, 
rigour, and challenge of the external audit process 
is maintained. 

As part of its decision making process concerning 
whether to tender, offer, or continue an audit 
engagement, there are a number of key 
considerations that the Committee takes into 
account, the principal elements of which are set 
out below and on pages 120 to 121.

Details of the fees paid to the external auditors 
in 2023 in respect of the audit and for non-audit 
services are set out in Note 5 to the consolidated 
financial statements. The fees relating to 
non-audit services work in 2023 equated to 7.2% 
of the fees relating to audit services.

Conflicts of interest
In assessing the independence of the auditors 
from the Company, the Committee takes into 
account the information and assurances provided 
by the auditors confirming that all its partners and 
staff involved with the audit are independent of 
any links to the Company.

PwC confirmed during the year that all its 
partners and staff complied with its ethics and 
independence policies and procedures which are 
consistent with the FRC’s Revised Ethical Standard 
(2019) and other relevant regulatory and 
professional requirements, including that none of 
its employees working on Bunzl’s audit hold any 
shares in Bunzl plc. PwC is required to provide an 
independence confirmation letter at the 
completion stage of the audit, including any 
relationships that may reasonably be thought to 
have an impact on its independence and the 
integrity and objectivity of the audit engagement 
partner and the audit staff.

Non-audit services
Bunzl has a detailed policy relating to the 
provision of non-audit services by the external 
auditors which is overseen by the Committee.  
It is the Company’s policy to assess the non-audit 
services to be performed by the Company’s 
auditors on a case-by-case basis to ensure 
adherence to the prevailing ethical standards 
and regulations.

Principally, Bunzl uses other firms to provide 
non-audit services. However, if the provision of 
a service by the Company’s auditors is permitted 
and adequate safeguards are in place, it is 
sometimes appropriate for this additional work 
to be carried out by the Company’s auditors. 

Tenure and effectiveness
The Committee takes into account the tenure of 
the auditors in addition to the results of its review 
of the effectiveness of the external auditors and 
considers whether there should be a full tender 
process, either as a result of that review or as may 
be required by the relevant regulations. As 
previously mentioned, a tender process for the 
external audit was undertaken in 2023 and an 
overview of this process can be found on the 
following page. There are no contractual 
obligations restricting the Committee’s choice of 
external auditors. The Company confirms that it 
has complied with the provisions of the CMA 
Order for the 2023 financial year.

Given the continuing effectiveness of PwC in its 
role as external auditors, the Committee believes 
it is in the best interests of shareholders for PwC 
to remain in the role for the next year. Neil Grimes 
took over the position as audit partner with effect 
from 1 January 2019 and remained the audit 
partner throughout 2023. Having acted as audit 
partner to the Company for five years, Neil Grimes 
will rotate off as audit partner in 2024, being 
replaced by Simon Morley, in line with the Auditing 
Practices Board’s Ethical Standards.

The Committee was satisfied with the results of its 
review of the external auditors’ activities, and 
performance throughout the tender process, 
during the year. The Committee has therefore 
recommended to the Board, that a resolution 
proposing the reappointment of PwC as external 
auditors for the year ending 31 December 2024 
be put to shareholders at the forthcoming AGM. 
Additional information on the 2023 external 
auditor effectiveness review can be found on 
page 121.

AUDIT COMMITTEE REPORT continued

External audit tender process

Scope
Bunzl is required to undertake an external audit tender every 
10 years and rotate audit firms every 20 years. Given PwC 
was appointed in 2014, the Audit Committee initiated and 
supervised a competitive tender process for the Company’s 
external audit. The Committee approved a project plan for the 
tender and the selection criteria that would be used.

A Selection Panel comprising the individuals listed below was 
established to facilitate the tender process:

Members

Lloyd Pitchford

Peter Ventress

Vin Murria OBE

Pam Kirby

Richard Howes

Ian Burrows

Chair of the Audit Committee

Chairman of the Board

Non-executive director

Non-executive director

Chief Financial Officer

Group Financial Controller

The Selection Panel was responsible for identifying audit firms to 
potentially participate in the tender and subsequently evaluating 
participating firms’ performance using transparent and 
non-discriminatory criteria. Committee members were involved 
throughout the tender process, with regular updates being 
provided by the Selection Panel. Participating firms were 
provided with an information pack covering key information 
about the Group and were provided access to discussions with 
senior managers at Group and local business level.

Evaluation
All members of the Selection Panel attended oral presentations 
by candidate firms held at the Bunzl plc registered office on 
9 June 2023.

The resources that were available to the Selection Panel in the 
evaluation process included the proposal documents received 
from the three candidate firms, the feedback received from 
Bunzl management following the meetings with each firms’ 
representatives, an extract from the FRC’s published quality 
reviews of each firm and an analysis of the fees proposed by 
each firm in relation to proposed audit scopes.

The Selection Panel evaluated the proposals according to five 
non-financial criteria:

•  audit firm capability and service delivery;
•  audit team capability;
•  understanding our business;
•  audit approach and materiality; and
•  audit quality.

The candidate firm fee proposals were also considered in the 
context of whether they were competitive and offered strong 
value to Bunzl, although the principal focus of the evaluation 
was on maximising future audit quality. 

Decision
A report setting out the results of the evaluation was presented 
to the Committee by the Selection Panel. 

Having considered the report, the Committee submitted two 
possible audit firm options to the Board, with PwC being the 
preferred candidate.

Key factors in the decision to recommend the reappointment of PwC 
included:

•  strong performance against the evaluation criteria;
•  continuity in the audit approach and experience of working 

with Bunzl;

•  understanding of Bunzl’s culture and decentralised business;
•  a demonstrable desire to evolve and improve the existing audit 

approach; and

•  detailed improvement proposals and recommendations to the 

non-financial audit approach.

The recommendation made by the Committee to the Board was 
free from third party influence and there were no contractual 
restrictions on the choice of auditor. 

After due consideration, the Board approved the reappointment 
of PwC as the Company’ statutory auditors for the 2024 financial 
year. The reappointment is subject to shareholder approval at 
the Company’s 2024 AGM.

The Committee will continue to undertake annual effectiveness 
reviews of the external auditors’ performance and consider the 
FRC’s annual Audit Quality Inspection and Supervision reports.

Tender response requirements
The Audit Committee Chair reviewed and 
approved the invitation to tender letter and 
tender response requirements. Large and 
challenger firms were invited to participate in the 
tender process; however, due to the size and 
geographical spread of the Group, none of the 
challenger firms accepted the invitation. 
Participating firms were required to submit a draft 
audit plan and audit proposal.

Draft audit plan
•  Demonstrates an understanding of Bunzl’s 

business and risks

•  Outlines a proposed audit approach, 

Audit proposal
•  Demonstrates capability to serve clients of 
large and international scope of similar 
complexity to Bunzl

specifically considering the 2024 half year 
review and year end audit

•  Details the experience and technical

AUDIT COMMITTEE REPORT continued

Effectiveness of the statutory external audit process

PwC presented the Committee with its detailed audit plan for 
the forthcoming financial year, which outlined its audit scope, 
planning materiality and its assessment of key audit risks. The 
identification of key audit risks is critical in the overall 
effectiveness of the external audit process. 

The Committee was provided with updates on PwC’s progress 
against the audit scope at subsequent Committee meetings, 
providing Committee members with the opportunity to 
challenge management and PwC and raise questions where 
necessary. 

As part of the ongoing monitoring process, the Committee 
considers the results of any periodic reviews by the FRC’s Audit 
Quality Review Team of PwC’s audit of the Company, as well as 
the results of the FRC’s reviews of PwC’s audits more broadly, 
and challenges PwC to ensure continuous improvement.

In assessing the adequacy of the audit plan, the Committee 
considers and, where necessary, challenges the auditors on 
how far the scope of the audit addresses the Board’s 
assessment of risks.

Regular dialogue between the Committee and the auditors 
ensures that any significant issues are identified, and the 
appropriate audit responses are discussed, at the earliest 
opportunity. The external auditors also have direct access to the 
Chair of the Committee who held a number of meetings with 
PwC during the year outside formal Committee meetings.

Prior to the Board’s approval of the annual financial statements, 
the Committee provided the Board with its views on the 
outcome of the statutory audit. Such feedback generally covers: 
the outcome of the auditors’ assessment of key audit matters; 
management’s key accounting issues and judgements; other 
areas of audit focus; and how the statutory audit has 
contributed to the integrity of the financial reporting process. 

The Committee also discusses the outcome of any quality 
monitoring processes that may have been undertaken by the 
auditors’ own firm, including any lessons learnt and the actions 
taken to address those areas identified for improvement.

Following the completion of the audit, those involved in the 
process were invited to provide feedback on PwC’s 
performance. This involved the completion of a questionnaire 
by the Committee members, key members of senior 
management and those who regularly provide input into the 
Committee or have regular contact with the auditors. 

The questionnaire covered a total of 24 different aspects of the 
external audit process, grouped under four separate headings: 
the robustness of the audit process; the quality of delivery; the 
quality of people and service; and the quality of reporting. The 
responses were collated and a summary was presented to the 
Committee for consideration.

During the year, private meetings were held between the 
Committee and PwC without management present to 
encourage open and honest feedback by both parties on any 
matters they wished to raise. This afforded the Committee the 
opportunity to obtain greater insight concerning the extent to 
which management’s analysis and presentation of information 
had been challenged by the auditors.

Based on the feedback received and the results of the Committee’s ongoing audit monitoring throughout the year, the Committee 
concluded that PwC had demonstrated appropriate focus and challenge on the primary areas of the audit and had applied robust 
challenge and scepticism throughout the process, with additional measures for further enhancement encouraged.

DIRECTORS’ REMUNERATION REPORT

Introduction from Vanda Murray
I am pleased to present the Directors’ 
remuneration report for the year ended 
31 December 2023. As we are seeking 
shareholder approval of our directors’ 
remuneration policy (‘Policy’) at the forthcoming 
AGM, it has been a particularly busy year for the 
Committee; we have undertaken an extensive and 
very helpful shareholder consultation exercise in 
addition to the usual business of setting pay and 
assessing performance. It has also been my last 
full year as chair of the Committee and I will be 
handing over Chair responsibilities to Jacky 
Simmonds following the 2024 AGM.

Context of remuneration
2023 continued to provide a challenging 
performance context for Bunzl. The Group has 
faced the dual headwinds of ongoing post-
pandemic product deflation in some parts of the 
world and continuing high cost inflation in others. 
We have also been managing the impact of a 
continuing tight labour market and the pressures 
of a cost of living crisis which has impacted 
consumer demand for some products and 
therefore customer behaviour. 

Amidst all these challenges Bunzl’s business 
performance was strong. Although the pressure 
of deflation and the continuation of post-Covid 
normalisation meant that revenues were slightly 
down, disciplined cost management coupled with 
a strong focus on margin and working capital 
meant that we improved our adjusted operating 
profit by 6.2% at constant exchange.

We were also able to make significant progress 
with our strategic objectives. 19 acquisitions 
were completed during the year, and with the 
acquisition of Pamark in January 2024 we have 
added two more countries to our global presence. 
We continued our progress against our 
sustainability goals, including the expansion 
of our audit programme in high risk countries, 
the engagement of our key suppliers on the 
measurement of scope 3 carbon emissions, 
and the increase in leadership roles occupied 
by females.

In summary, the Group has delivered another 
strong set of all-round business results, and this 
has been reflected in the outturns for both the 
annual bonus, the final performance shares 
granted in 2020, and the first cycle of the 
Restricted Share Awards granted in April 2021.

Performance and reward for 2023
Annual bonus
Annual bonus payments were based on a 
combination of key financial measures (70%) 
comprising adjusted earnings per share (‘eps’), 
return on average operating capital (‘RAOC’) and 
operating cash flow, with 20% based on personal 
objectives and 10% on ESG objectives. In setting 
our incentive targets, we have regard to the 
performance potential of the different parts of 
the business and of the whole Group. The 
on-target performance level for the financial 
elements of the bonus for 2023 was set at, or 
close to, the budgeted level of performance. The 
personal and ESG objectives selected are closely 
aligned to the strategic priorities for the business 
and are clearly measurable. 

The Committee’s evaluation of the annual bonus 
targets resulted in a payment of 89.8% of 
maximum for Frank van Zanten and 89.8% of 
maximum for Richard Howes. As outlined above, 
this was a strong all-round performance from the 
business and the leadership team and the 
Committee is confident that the variable pay 
awarded has been aligned with this performance. 
On the financial elements, no discretion was 
applied by the Committee to adjust the bonus 
outcomes, as overall payments reflected business 
performance. The Committee conducted a 
detailed review of the evidence to support the 
evaluation of the personal and ESG objectives. 
In line with the Policy, 50% of the annual bonuses 
will be delivered in shares, subject to a three year 
deferral period. 

Long Term Incentive Plans (‘LTIPs’)
Under the previous 2020 Policy, our practice was 
to grant both market value share options (LTIP A) 
and performance shares (LTIP B). Performance 
shares were granted biannually with half the 
award subject to eps growth and half to relative 
Total Shareholder Return. The eps element of the 
awards granted in April and October 2020 
concluded on 31 December 2022 and was 
reported in last year’s report. The TSR element 
concluded in the 2023 financial year based on 
performance to 31 March and 30 September 
2023. Bunzl’s TSR of 68.7% and 30.2% respectively 
resulted in vestings of 100% (April 2020 award 
and 75.19% (October 2020 award). As noted last 
year, the Committee was also satisfied that there 
had been no ‘windfall’ gain in these awards as the 
original grants were made in both the spring and 
the autumn and the average grant prices during 
2020 were less than 10% below 2019 prices. 

The first Restricted Share Awards (‘RSAs’) were 
granted in 2021 and will vest in April 2024 based 
on satisfaction of the performance underpin (as 
worded in the 2021 policy) relating to the period 1 
January 2021 to 31 December 2023. Having 
reviewed the wide range of financial and non-
financial metrics in the underpin and having 
identified no material underperformance, risk 
issues or regulatory failures, I can confirm that the 
Committee has determined that these shares 
should vest in full. Specific factors considered in 
assessing the underpin for this award included:

•  Financial health of the business (revenue, 

profitability, cashflow, returns)

•  Delivery of strategic priorities

•  Stakeholder experience

•  Progress towards ESG goals

More detail can be found on page 140

Shareholders should note that reporting 
requirements mean that both the 2020 LTIP B 
awards and the 2021 restricted share awards are 
included in the Single Figure table for 2023 in this 
report. This means that the total remuneration 
shown for both directors is artificially high this 
year. This will be normalised in 2024’s report.

Vanda Murray OBE 
Chair of the Remuneration  
Committee

Bunzl delivered a strong 
performance against a 
backdrop of ongoing post-
Covid adjustments in the 
market. The 2023 outturns 
reflect this, and the 
proposed adjustments to 
our Policy support our 
continuing strategy of 
growth.”

Review of the directors’ 
remuneration policy
Background
Frank van Zanten was appointed as CEO in 2016 
and, under his tenure, he has built a very capable 
leadership team containing broad experience and 
significant market and sector expertise. The 
consistent and proven compounding strategy 
based on growing organically (by expanding and 
developing business with existing customers and 
gaining new revenue with additional ones), 
continuously making operating model 
improvements and applying strong discipline in 
selecting the right acquisitions has driven 
geographic and market expansion and 
significantly increased the size and scale of the 
Group. Specifically:

•  Bunzl now has a presence in 33 countries, in six 
core market sectors with approximately 150 
operating companies and thousands of 
suppliers globally. Almost 60% of revenue is 
generated in North America.

•  The Group has made over 200 acquisitions 
since 2004 with the annual spend reaching 
£468m in 2023. There have been 114 high 
quality acquisitions and a total committed 
acquisition spend of over £3.1bn since 2015. 
The pipeline remains active and the consistent 
quality of our cash generation and our strong 
balance sheet provide us with headroom for 
further acquisitions and wider capital 
allocation options. 

•  Since 2015, revenue and adjusted operating 

profit increased by more than 80% and annual 
dividend growth has been maintained for 31 
years. Market value has increased by over 70% 
and shareholder return by almost 80% 

•  The Group has also made significant progress 

towards its objectives on sustainability, 
centred around some clear public 
commitments. This includes diversity and 
inclusion, with a significant improvement in the 
proportion of leadership roles occupied by 
females, which is now over 22%.

Changes to Policy proposed for 2024
The Committee has reviewed directors’ 
remuneration ahead of the binding shareholder 
vote at the 2024 AGM. We sought views from 
our largest shareholders and the major proxy 
agencies and are grateful for the feedback 
received which has helped revise and shape 
our proposals.

In overall terms, the Committee has concluded 
that the policy framework introduced in 2021 
remains appropriate, and specifically that 
Restricted Share Awards, which were first 
introduced then, continue to be instrumental in 
ensuring that the leaders of the business focus 
on actions that deliver long-term growth in an 
unpredictable market context. They have created 
greater simplicity, clarity and predictability of 
outcome and, importantly, they help to 
discourage any actions which unduly focus on 
short-term impacts but instead encourage a 
mindset which is aligned to the longer-term 
shareholder experience through value creation. 

The Committee also concluded that the triennial 
Policy review should provide the opportunity to 
assess whether the quantum remains sufficiently 
competitive against the market, particularly given 
the requirement to attract and retain first class 
talent in a global context. We have proposed 
changes in quantum for the annual bonus and 
Restricted Share Award levels for both the Chief 
Executive Officer and Chief Financial Officer in 
order to reflect the increasing scale, complexity 
and performance of the business, and to align 
them with the market. Alongside this, a more 
robust underpin for the RSAs will apply from 
2024 so that it is clearer how the awards have 
been assessed. 

The policy review was concluded at a time when 
there has been much discussion regarding 
whether the current state of executive 
remuneration for UK-listed companies, and in 
particular, those with significant US influence and 
exposure such as ours, needs a reset. This 
includes various calls from stakeholders for UK 
pay to become more flexible in terms of both 
quantum and structure. In this regard, a number 

of our investors raised with us whether a hybrid 
structure (granting both performance shares and 
restricted shares) had been considered. While a 
hybrid structure provides the benefits of both 
performance assessment and stewardship, it 
adds complexity and, at the current time, remains 
rare in the UK. After some consideration, the 
Committee decided that such an approach was 
not preferred for Bunzl at this time but we will 
continue to monitor progress and market practice 
in this area with interest.

companies remains appropriate. In this context, 
the Committee considered other FTSE 11-100 
companies (excluding financial services) with 
significant international and US presence (i.e. 
based on those companies with more than 20% 
of revenue generated from North America). At the 
time of the review Bunzl was ranked at c.40 in the 
FTSE 100 and has circa 60% of revenue coming 
from North America. The proposed incentive 
levels are in line with the median of our chosen 
benchmarking peer group.

I set out below more detail on the proposed 
changes alongside views received from 
shareholders during the consultation exercise.

1.  Incentive quantum increases
The Committee considered the strong 
performance of the business as set out above, 
the individual performance of members of the 
leadership team, the pipeline of succession talent 
and Bunzl’s ability to recruit in a highly 
competitive international labour market when 
undertaking the current review. 

Our review showed that a significant gap had 
developed between the Company and the wider 
market with regards to total remuneration. In 
particular, the value of the key elements of 
variable pay are seen as trailing the market. As 
such, the Committee proposes the following 
policy adjustments:

Current 
Annual 
Bonus 
maximum 

Proposed 
Annual 
Bonus 
maximum 

Current 
RSA 
maximum 

Proposed 
RSA 
maximum 

CEO 
CFO 

180% 
160% 

200% 
175% 

125% 
100% 

175% 
125% 

External benchmarking data was used to help 
provide various reference points to assist the 
Committee with determining the competitiveness 
of the current packages of the executive directors. 
Despite being a truly global business with the 
majority of our revenue and profit coming from 
the US and the need to compete for US talent at 
all levels (where incentive quantum is significantly 
higher than in the UK), the Board recognises that 
Bunzl is headquartered and listed in the UK and 
therefore comparison with other global FTSE 

The gap in incentive quantum currently partly 
reflects the increased size and scale of Bunzl since 
the last Policy was approved but also the approach 
to setting quantum when RSAs were first 
introduced in 2021. At the time, Restricted Shares 
replaced dual grants of performance shares and 
share options and a conservative approach was 
taken which resulted in a relatively modest 
restricted share award exchange. For the CEO, this 
involved replacing share options (175% of salary) 
and performance shares (225% of salary) with a 
single 125% of salary restricted share grant. Since 
2017, the performance shares have on average 
vested at 62% and share options at 99%. The 
Committee is satisfied that the proposed Policy 
incentive levels reflect a more appropriate 
exchange and are in line with market norms.

While Restricted Shares provide greater certainty, 
we consider them to be variable rather than fixed 
in nature as quantum can be scaled back either 
at grant or at vesting (including to zero) through 
testing of the underpin. Furthermore, Restricted 
Shares are long term in nature (value delivered 
after five years) and their value mirrors the rise 
and fall in share price, thereby providing long-
term shareholder alignment.

Reflecting the comments received from a small 
minority of shareholders, the Committee has 
decided, for 2024, not to operate at the proposed 
Policy levels in respect of the Annual Bonus, but to 
instead retain the bonus maxima at 180% of salary 
for the Chief Executive Officer and 160% of salary 
for the Chief Financial Officer, with an increase to 
the maxima expected to apply from 2025.

2.  A more robust performance underpin 
For the first awards to be granted under the 2024 Policy, the performance underpin will be reorganised 
so that a formal framework is established upfront which will set out clearly for each award the key 
elements which will need to be assessed for the award to vest. As is current policy, the Committee will 
review specific indicators to help form a view of ‘in the round’ performance. In addition, the Committee 
has the discretion to scale back awards (including to zero) if it concludes there is material 
underperformance over the course of the vesting period.

Factors to be considered (not limited to)

Financial health of 
the business, 
considering key 
financial indicators

•  Revenue growth

•  Operating margin

•  Adjusted earnings per share

•  Return on capital (RAOC/ROIC)

•  Cash conversion

•  Balance sheet strength

Strategic priorities

Delivery of key strategic objectives over the vesting period including 
operational and individual performance

Stakeholder 
experience

ESG progress

Consideration of our key stakeholders including employees, customers, 
suppliers and shareholders

Progress towards key achievement of ESG objectives including climate change 
ambitions, ethical supply, investing in our people and diversity

The new framework provides the Committee with a better defined and more rigorous process when 
assessing vesting levels, and more clarity to participants and investors. The framework provides the 
same broad focus on overarching performance but now focuses more explicitly on the key indicators 
reflecting financial health (including return on capital), strategic priorities, stakeholder experience and 
ESG progress.

In assessing the stakeholder experience, the Committee will also consider the return to shareholders in 
the form of the dividend policy for a particular year.

3. Higher shareholding guidelines
Reflecting on the proposed increase to the RSA grant level, the Committee has agreed to increase the 
in-employment shareholding guideline from 300% to 350% of salary for the Chief Executive Officer and 
from 200% to 250% of salary for the Chief Financial Officer The new guidelines are double the proposed 
restricted share award grant levels. This will provide further alignment between executives and 
shareholders. The post-cessation guideline of 300% and 200% of salary shall remain unchanged.

Employee Pay
The Committee always considers the broader 
context of employee pay across the Group when 
reviewing and implementing the policy for 
directors. It closely monitors base pay increases, 
bonus awards and other pay elements, including 
“one off” awards such as the cost of living 
payments made in 2022. In the broader context, 
it is worth noting that almost 8,500 employees 
across the Group will receive a bonus for 2023. 
In addition, some of the increases in quantum 
proposed for the Executive Directors in the new 
policy will also apply to other members of the 
senior leadership team. As required by the 
Regulations we have again disclosed in this year’s 
Directors’ remuneration report the ratio between 
the Chief Executive Officer’s remuneration and 
the median, lower quartile and upper quartile of 
UK employees. 

Implementing the policy for the 2024 
financial year
Base salary 
The base salaries for the executive directors, 
Frank van Zanten and Richard Howes, have been 
increased by 4%, effective from 1 January 2024. 
Both these increases are lower than those 
budgeted for the Bunzl plc head office and UK 
leadership team which were 5%. The average pay 
awards for the Group leadership team ranged 
from 3.5% to 5.7% excluding market adjustments. 

Annual bonus
For the 2024 financial year, as stated above, the 
Committee has elected not to implement the 
policy maximum awards, and the maximum 
annual bonus opportunity will remain unchanged 
at 180% of base salary for the Chief Executive 
Officer and 160% for the Chief Financial Officer, 
with on-target bonus at 50% of the maximum. 

The annual bonus performance measures 
continue to be a balanced scorecard of key 
financial metrics – adjusted eps, RAOC and 
operating cash flow. For 2024, following 
shareholder feedback, the Committee has slightly 
increased the weighting given to RAOC. 20% of 
the bonus opportunity will be dependent on 

personal performance linked to certain specified 
strategic non-financial goals and again, 10% of the 
opportunity for both directors will be dependent 
on the achievement of specific ESG objectives, 
based on the four key pillars of the transition to 
Alternative Products, Climate Change, Ethical 
Sourcing, and Diversity. The objectives agreed 
for 2024 are a clear build on those used for the 
2023 targets and reflect the long-term nature 
of the roadmap.

50% of any bonus awarded will be deferred into 
shares for a period of three years.

LTIP
Subject to the approval of the Policy, the 
Committee expects to make further grants of 
Restricted Shares to the executive directors and 
other participants. These will vest in 2027, subject 
to continued employment and the assessment of 
the underpin. Vested awards will be subject to a 
two-year holding period. The Committee may 
scale back the awards (including to zero) if it is not 
satisfied that the underpin has been met. 

Priorities for 2024
I am confident that if the proposed revisions to 
our Policy are approved, then the right reward 
framework will be in place to support the next 
phase of growth for Bunzl, delivered by a 
motivated and incentivised leadership team which 
is focused on taking the right longer-term 
decisions. Whilst the geo-political and economic 
outlook is still uncertain, Bunzl is well positioned 
to take advantage of growth opportunities as they 
arise, across the full range of our geographies and 
market sectors. The Committee will also continue 
to monitor external market trends and 
developments in executive pay with interest.

Conclusions
Despite the market headwinds, this has been 
another strong year of performance and we see 
significant opportunities for further growth 
moving forward. The Committee’s focus has been 
to incentivise leadership appropriately to 
recognise significant performance and growth of 
the business but also focus them on long term

Chair of the Remuneration Committee 
26 February 2024

The responsibilities and operation 
of the Committee
Committee membership role and remit
The Committee comprises all of the independent 
non-executive directors of the Company. While 
neither the Chairman nor the Chief Executive 
Officer are members of the Committee, they 
attend meetings by invitation. The Director of 
Group Human Resources also attends meetings. 
The Committee’s terms of reference, which were 
reviewed by both the Committee and the Board in 
2023, but remain unchanged, are available on the 
Company’s website, www.bunzl.com.

No director plays any part in determining his or 
her remuneration. During the year ended 31 
December 2023, both the Chief Executive Officer 
and the Chairman were consulted and invited to 
attend meetings of the Committee but were not 
present during any part of the meeting when their 
own remuneration was under consideration.

The independent non-executive directors who 
were members of the Committee during 2023 
are listed opposite.

The primary role of the Committee is to 
determine the framework and broad policy for 
the remuneration of the Chairman, the executive 
directors of the Board and the senior 
management group directly below Board level. 
The Committee proposes the directors’ 
remuneration policy for shareholder approval at 
least every three years. It also governs the 
implementation of the policy, ensuring that the 
remuneration of the executive directors and 
senior management supports the sustainable 
performance of the business and that it is aligned 
with the Company’s shareholders’ interests. 
The Committee considers market practice, 
shareholders’ views and the Group’s broader 
remuneration arrangements when setting the 
Group’s performance-related incentives and 
ensures compliance with UK corporate 
governance good practice.

The key responsibilities of the  
Committee include:
•  ensuring that executive directors and senior 

executives are properly incentivised to attract, 
retain and fairly reward them for their individual 
contribution to the Company, having due 
regard to the policies and practices applied to 
the rest of the employees within the Group;

•  determining the framework and broad policy 

for the remuneration of the Chairman and the 
executive directors of the Board; 

•  ensuring that remuneration is aligned with 
and supports the Company’s strategy and 
performance, having due regard to the 
interests of the shareholders and to the 
financial and commercial health of the 
Company, while at the same time not 
encouraging undue risk taking; 

•  communicating and discussing any 

remuneration issues with the Company’s 
stakeholders as and when appropriate;

•  setting and reviewing the executive directors’ 
remuneration and benefits including, but not 
limited to, base salary, bonus, long term 
incentive plans and retirement benefits;

•  ensuring that all remuneration paid to the 
executive directors is in accordance with 
the Company’s previously approved 
remuneration policy; 

•  ensuring all contractual terms on termination, 

and any payments made, are fair to the 
individual and the Company;

•  monitoring the policies and practices applied 

in respect of the remuneration of senior 
executives directly below Board level and 
making recommendations as appropriate; 

•  overseeing the Company’s long term incentive 

plans for all employees; and

•  ensuring that provisions relating to disclosure 
of remuneration as set out in the relevant 
legislation, the Financial Conduct Authority’s 
Listing Rules and the Code are fulfilled.

DIRECTORS’ REMUNERATION REPORT continued

Directors’ remuneration policy 

The 2021 shareholder-approved policy requires renewal at the 2024 AGM. A new Policy will be put to a 

binding vote at the 2024 meeting and will be effective from the date of approval. It is expected to remain 

in place until its normal renewal which will be the 2027 AGM at the latest.

Objectives of the Policy
The objectives of the new proposed Policy remain unchanged from the current one and are as follows:

•  Clarity: maintain transparency, clear alignment with shareholder value and promotion of longer term, 
sustained performance. For example, the restricted share plan encourages a focus on the longer 
term success of the business;

•  Predictability: continue to ensure that targets are stretching (but realistic), the quantum of reward 
reflects both Company and individual performance and there are appropriate award caps and 
Committee discretions in place. For example, the underpin is broad and encourages the Committee 
to focus on ‘in the round’ performance;

•  Support for the Company’s business strategy: for example, aligning the executive directors’ and 

management’s incentives with the Company’s growth objectives;

•  Simplicity: ensure that the remuneration structures avoid unnecessary complexity. For example, the 

restricted share plan has only a single annual grant of shares;

•  Risk is appropriately managed: variable pay should drive performance within the Company’s risk 

appetite and encourage a prudent and balanced approach to the business;

•  Alignment to culture: the remuneration principles encourage the behaviour from the executive 

directors that the Committee expects to see throughout the business; and

•  Proportionality: the link between individual awards, the delivery of strategy and long term 

performance of the Group is clear.

In setting the remuneration policy for the executive directors, the Committee also takes into 
consideration a number of different factors:

•  The Committee applies the principles set out in the Code and also takes into account best practice 
guidance issued by the major UK institutional investor bodies, the Financial Conduct Authority 
(including the provisions of any applicable remuneration codes) and other relevant organisations;

•  The Committee has overall responsibility for the remuneration policies and structures for employees 

of the Group as a whole and it reviews remuneration policy on a Group wide basis. When the 
Committee determines and reviews the remuneration policy for the executive directors it considers 
and compares it against the pay, policy and employment conditions of the rest of the Group to 
ensure that there is alignment between the two; and

•  The Committee considers the external market in which the Group operates and uses comparator 
remuneration data from time to time to inform its decisions. However, the Committee recognises 
that such data should be used as a guide only (data can be volatile and may not be directly relevant) 
and that there is often a need to phase-in changes over a period of time. The Committee has 
reviewed a range of relevant benchmarking data to guide the 2024 review. 

•  Specifically, it has looked at FTSE 11-100 companies with greater than 20% of revenue generated from 
the United States. The peer group comprises RS Group, Convatec, Melrose Industries, Smiths Group, 
Pearson, Intertek, Smurfit Kappa, Halma, Spirax-Sarco, Burberry, Rolls-Royce, Informa, 
Intercontinental Hotels, Croda, WPP, Smith & Nephew, Rentokil, Imperial Brands, Flutter, Ashtead, 
Experian, BAE Systems, CRH, Haleon, Compass, National Grid, Reckitt Benckiser and RELX.

The Committee’s overall policy, having had due regard to the factors above, continues to be for a 
proportion of total remuneration to be based on variable pay. This is achieved by setting base pay and 
benefits by reference to mid-market levels, with annual bonus linked to the achievement of demanding 
performance targets and long term incentives which vest over the medium term and are designed 
to align the interests of the directors with those of shareholders and the long term sustainable success 
of the business. 

Changes to Policy proposed for 2024
The Committee is proposing to make some revisions to the policy, within the current overall framework, 
which can be summarised as follows:

1.   An increase to the quantum of Annual Bonus and Restricted Share Award levels for both the Chief 

Executive Officer and Chief Financial Officer in order to align them with the market and to reflect the 
increasing scale, complexity and performance of the business. For the Chief Executive Officer the 
Annual Bonus potential increases to 200% of salary (although remains at 180% of salary for 2024) 
and the Restricted Share Award increases to 175% of salary. For the Chief Financial Officer the 
Annual Bonus potential increases to 175% of salary (although remains at 160% of salary for 2024) 
and the Restricted Share Award increases to 125% of salary.

2.   A revision to the “underpin” attached to Restricted Share Awards so that it is clearer how that 

element of the award will be assessed. See page 146 for more detail. 

3.   An increase to the in-employment shareholding requirement for both the Chief Executive Officer 

and the Chief Financial Officer to 350% and 250% of salary respectively.

4.   A minor revision to the process for reviewing the Chairman’s fee whereby the Committee proposes 
to create alignment with the process for other non-executive Directors and review the fee annually 
rather than biennially. More detail on these proposals is contained in the table below. 

The Committee conducted a thorough consultation on the proposals with the Group’s key 
shareholders. It is very grateful for the positive support received, and for the constructive feedback 
which was carefully considered and input into the final proposals outlined below.

DIRECTORS’ REMUNERATION REPORT continued

Remuneration policy for executive directors
The following table summarises each element of the remuneration policy for the executive directors, 
explaining how each element operates and links to the corporate strategy. 

Base salary

Purpose

•  Recognise knowledge, skills and experience as well as reflect the scope and size of 

the role

•  Reward individual performance without encouraging undue risk

Operation

•  Paid in 12 equal monthly instalments during the year

•  Normally reviewed annually in December (with any changes usually effective from 
January). An out-of-cycle review may be conducted if the Committee determines 
that it is appropriate

•  Takes into consideration a number of factors including (but not limited to) 
individual and Group performance, the size and scope of the individual’s 
responsibilities, salary increases across the Group, typical salary levels for 
comparable roles using appropriate comparator groups, for example similarly 
sized companies with a large international presence

•  Pensionable

Maximum 
potential  
value

•  While there is no maximum salary level, salary increases are normally considered 

in relation to the salary increases of other employees in the Group and 
performance of the individual. Higher salary increases may be made under 
certain circumstances, such as when there has been a change in role or 
responsibility, a major market movement or when a director has been appointed 
to the Board at a lower than typical salary initially

Maximum 
potential  
value

Performance 
metrics

•  While there are no performance conditions attached to the payment of base 
salary, individual performance in the role, as well as the performance of the 
Group and achievements related to environmental, social and governance issues, 
are all taken into consideration

Annual bonus

Purpose

•  Incentivise the attainment of annual corporate targets

•  Retain and reward high performing employees

•  Align with shareholders’ and wider stakeholders’ interests

Operation

•  Bonus awards are based on performance targets and objectives set by the 

Committee for the financial year

•  At the end of the performance period, the Committee assesses the extent to 
which the performance measures have been achieved. The level of bonus for 
each measure is determined by reference to the actual performance against the 
relevant performance targets

•  Up to half the bonus is paid in cash and the remainder in shares (with the shares 

normally deferred for three years under the Deferred Annual Share Bonus 
Scheme (‘DASBS’)) in respect of which dividend equivalents may apply to the 
extent that such deferred awards vest. If a director resigns during the period of 
deferral any outstanding DASBS awards would normally lapse

•  Malus and clawback provisions apply and are set out in more detail below,

•  Bonus awards are non-pensionable and are payable at the Committee’s 

discretion

•  The annual bonus policy maximum is 200% of base salary (175% for the Chief 

Financial Officer)

•  For 2024, the maximum bonus opportunity will be 180% for the Chief Executive 

Officer and 160% for the Chief Financial Officer

•  The annual target bonus opportunity is normally set at 50% of the maximum

•  The level of annual bonus for threshold performance is up to 25% of the 

maximum

Annual bonus

Long term incentives

Maximum 
potential  
value

•  The individual restricted share limit per financial year is 175% of base salary

•  The Chief Executive Officer may receive restricted shares per financial year with 

a face value of up to 175% of salary

•  The Chief Financial Officer may receive restricted shares per financial year with 

a face value of up to 125% of salary

Performance 
metrics

•  Restricted share awards are not subject to performance measures but vesting 
is subject to the achievement of an underpin normally reviewed over the three 
financial years commencing with the financial year in which awards are granted

•  In assessing the underpin, in normal circumstances the Committee may consider 

the Group’s overall performance, including financial and non-financial 
performance over the course of the vesting period and any material risk/
regulatory failures identified. Specifically, it will seek evidence of positive progress 
against the Group’s financial and strategic objectives as follows: 

•  Financial health of the business, considering financial indicators

•  Strategic priorities

•  Stakeholder experience

•  ESG progress

•   In considering these factors, the Committee will assess performance in the round, 

with the expectation of full vesting unless there has been a lack of material 
progress towards a stated objective, or it has identified material 
underperformance over the period. The Committee may scale back the awards 
(including to zero) if it is not satisfied the underpin has been met, and there is 
no threshold level of vesting.

Performance 
metrics

Metrics will be set each year by the Committee taking into account the Company’s 
key strategic objectives for the year.

For example, bonus metrics may include:

•  Financial measures chosen to align bonus outcomes with the underlying financial 
performance of the business, such as profit, return on average operating capital 
(‘RAOC’) and cash flow;

•  Non-financial measures are linked to the achievement of personal goals or certain 
specified strategic goals, including environmental, social and governance matters;

•  The performance metrics and targets are reviewed each year to ensure that they 

remain appropriate. The Committee retains the discretion to set alternative 
metrics as appropriate; and

•  The specific targets will be disclosed on a retrospective basis following the end of 

the financial year unless they are deemed to be commercially sensitive. 

The Committee sets targets that are appropriately stretching in the context of the 
business outlook and taking into account internal and external factors. The 
achievement of quantifiable financial targets will always drive the majority of the 
bonus outturn. Targets are set to ensure that there is appropriate alignment 
between stakeholder outcomes and to ensure that they do not drive unacceptable 
levels of risk taking.

Long term incentives

Purpose

•  Incentivise long term decision making as the basis for sustainable growth

•  Align with shareholders’ interests

•  Recruit and retain senior employees across the Group

Operation

Executive directors receive restricted share awards as the long term variable 
element of remuneration: 

•  Restricted share awards are discretionary and will normally vest subject to 

continued employment and the satisfaction of the underpin after no less than 
three years; 

•  A holding period will apply which means that restricted shares may not ordinarily 
be sold until at least five years after the grant date (other than to pay relevant 
taxes due on vested awards);

•  Malus and clawback provisions apply and are set out in more detail below.

•  Dividend equivalents shall accrue in respect of restricted share awards to the 

extent that they vest, including in relation to any holding periods; and

•  All awards are subject to the discretions contained in the relevant plan rules.

Long term incentives – previous policy applied for awards up to and including December 2020

Purpose

•  Awards issued under the previous policy with respect to long term incentives 

continued to vest until October 2023, and therefore the policy described below 
applied for the final time to outturns reported in this report.

Performance 
metrics

•  Performance and service conditions must be met over a three year performance 

period. Metrics and targets are set each year by the Committee. The current 
metrics are as follows:

Operation

•  Discretionary biannual grants of executive share option awards and performance 
share awards which vest subject to performance conditions measured over three 
years and subject to continuous service. 

•  A malus and clawback facility is in operation under which part or the full amount 
of a vested award may be recovered, by a reduction in the amount of any future 
bonus, subsisting award, the vesting of any subsisting award or future share 
awards and/or a requirement to make a cash payment, for a period of three years 
from the relevant performance year, to the extent that the value of a vested 
award is subsequently found to have been overstated as a result of a material 
misstatement of performance or there has been a significant failure of risk control 
or serious misconduct

•  Two year post-vesting holding requirement for shares that vest, net of sales to 

settle tax or other withholding due on vesting or exercise of awards

•  If any executive resigns during the period before vesting, awards would 

normally lapse

•  All awards are subject to the discretions contained in the relevant plan rules

Maximum 
potential  
value

Executive share options
•  Maximum annual award of 225% of base salary

•  Annual grant levels for executive directors will not normally exceed 200% of 

base salary

•  For 2020, grants did not exceed 200% of base salary for the incumbent executive 

directors

Performance shares
•  Maximum annual award of 175% of base salary

•  For 2020, awards did not exceed 150% of base salary for the Chief Executive 

Officer and 120% for the Chief Financial Officer

Executive share options
•  The eps performance measure relates to the absolute growth in the Company’s 

eps against the targets set for the performance period

•  The vesting is scaled as follows:

 − no vesting for performance below the threshold target;

 − 25% of an award will vest for achieving the threshold target;

 − 100% of an award will vest for achieving or exceeding the maximum target; and

 − for performance between these targets, the level of vesting will vary on a 

straight line sliding scale.

•  The Committee annually reviews the performance conditions outlined above 
and, in line with the rules of the LTIP, reserves the right to set different targets 
for forthcoming annual grants provided it is deemed that the relevant 
performance conditions remain appropriately challenging in the prevailing 
economic environment

Performance shares
•  The TSR performance measure (50% of the total award) compares a combination 

of both the Company’s share price and dividend performance during the 
performance period against a comparator group of the constituents of the FTSE 
11–100. It aligns the rewards received by executives with the returns received 
by shareholders

•  The other 50% of the award is subject to an eps performance measure which 

relates to the absolute growth in the Company’s eps against the targets set for 
the performance period

•  The vesting for both performance measures is scaled as follows:

 − no vesting for performance below median performance (TSR) or below the 

threshold target (eps);

 − 25% of an award will vest for achieving median performance (TSR) or the 

threshold target (eps);

 − 100% of an award will vest for achieving or exceeding upper quartile 

performance (TSR) or the maximum target (eps); and

 − for performance between these targets, the level of vesting will vary on a 

straight line sliding scale.

•  The Committee annually reviews the performance conditions outlined above and, 

in line with the rules of the LTIP, reserves the right to set different targets for 
forthcoming annual grants provided it is deemed that the relevant performance 
conditions remain appropriately challenging in the prevailing economic 
environment

All employee share plans

Other benefits

Purpose

•  Encourage employees, including the executive directors, to build a shareholding 
through the operation of all employee share plans such as the HM Revenue & 
Customs (‘HMRC’) tax advantaged Sharesave Scheme and the Internal Revenue 
Service (‘IRS’) approved Employee Stock Purchase Plan (US) (‘ESPP’) in the US

Operation

•  Executive directors may participate in all employee schemes on the same basis as 

other eligible employees

•  The Sharesave Scheme has standard terms under which participants can 

normally enter into a savings contract, over a period of either three or five years, 
in return for which they are granted options to acquire shares at a discount of up 
to 20% of the market price prevailing on the day immediately preceding the date 
of invitation to apply for the option. Options are normally exercisable either three 
or five years after they have been granted

•  In the UK, the Sharesave Scheme is linked to a contract for monthly savings 

within the HMRC limits over a period of either three or five years (currently £500 
per month)

•  Service conditions apply

Retirement benefits

Purpose

•  Provision of retirement benefits

•  Retain executive directors

Operation

•  All defined benefit pension plans in the Group have been closed to new entrants 
since 2003 with any new recruits being offered defined contribution retirement 
arrangements and/or a pension allowance.

•  Pension contributions and allowances are normally paid monthly

Maximum 
potential  
value

•  Company pension contributions to defined contribution retirement arrangements 
or cash allowances are capped at 5% of base salary for current and new executive 
directors 

Performance 
metrics

•  Not applicable

Purpose

•  Provision of competitive benefits which helps to recruit and retain 

executive directors

Operation

•  Benefits may include a car allowance or a car which may be fully expensed, 

various insurances such as life, disability and medical and, in some jurisdictions, 
club expenses and other benefits provided from time to time.

•  Some benefits may only be provided to reflect hybrid working and/or overseas 

relocation, such as removal expenses, and in the case of an international 
relocation might also include fees for accommodation, children’s schooling, home 
leave, tax equalisation and professional advice etc.

Maximum 
potential  
value

•  The value of benefits is based on the cost to the Company and varies according to 

individual circumstances. For example, the cost of medical insurance varies 
according to family circumstances and the jurisdiction in which the family is based

Performance 
metrics

•  Not applicable

Shareholding requirement

Purpose

•  Strengthen the alignment between the interests of the executive directors and 

those of shareholders

Operation

•  In employment guideline: executive directors will normally be expected to retain 

shares, net of sales to settle tax, through the exercise of awards under the DASBS 
and the LTIP until they attain the required holding. Three years is the typical 
expectation for executives who are promoted from within the Company to 
achieve the required shareholding. It is recognised that a longer time period may 
be required for externally recruited executives to achieve the expected 
shareholding. Unvested deferred shares held under the DASBS will count towards 
the guideline (net of the expected sales for tax that would apply on vesting)

•  Post-cessation guideline: Upon cessation of employment, executive directors 
should maintain a shareholding for two years thereafter at a level equal to the 
lower of the in-employment guideline and the number of shares vested as at 
cessation (net of tax) under restricted share awards granted. 

•  Shares held by or to the benefit of an executive director’s spouse, civil partner or 
children (or with them as relevant) may count for the purposes of the guidelines.

Maximum 
potential  
value 

•  The Chief Executive Officer’s in-employment shareholding requirement is 350% of 

base salary. The in-employment requirement for other executive directors is 
250% of base salary

•  The Chief Executive Officer’s post-employment shareholding requirement is 300% 
of salary. The post-employment shareholding requirement for other executive 
directors is 200%.

Fees policy for Chairman and non-executive directors (the ‘NEDS’)
The following table summarises the fees policy for the Chairman and the NEDs.

Fees

Purpose

•  Provision of a competitive fee to attract NEDs who have a broad range of 

experience and skills to oversee the implementation of the Company’s strategy

Operation

•  Determined in light of market practice and with reference to time commitment 

and responsibilities associated with the roles

•  Annual fees are paid in 12 equal monthly instalments during the year

•  The Senior Independent Director and Chairs of the Audit and Remuneration 
Committees are paid an extra fee to reflect their additional responsibilities

•  The NEDs and the Chairs are not eligible to receive benefits and do not participate 

in pension or incentive plans. Expenses incurred in respect of their duties as 
directors of the Company are reimbursed

•  The NEDs’ and Chairman’s fees are reviewed annually in January each year, 
the latest review being with effect from January 2024 for NED fees and the 
Chairman’s fees

•  The Board as a whole considers the policy and structure for the NEDs’ fees on the 
recommendation of the Chairman and the Chief Executive Officer. The NEDs do 
not participate in discussions on their specific levels of remuneration; the 
Chairman’s fees are set by the Committee

Maximum 
potential  
value

•  Determined within the overall aggregate annual limit of £1,500,000 authorised by 
shareholders with reference to the Company’s Articles of Association approved at 
the 2021 AGM

Performance 
metrics

Taxable 
benefits and 
expenses

•  Not eligible to participate in any performance related elements of remuneration

•  Taxable expenses incurred in the course of carrying out NED duties are 

reimbursed and grossed up to include tax payable

Notes to the Policy Table
Malus and Clawback Provisions
Malus and clawback provisions apply to the cash and deferred elements of the bonus and the RSA 
awards. The malus and clawback provisions may be enforced in the event of material misstatement, 
errors in assessment of conditions, significant failure of risk control, serious misconduct, corporate 
failure (entailing the appointment of an administrator or liquidator) and serious reputational damage or 
where there has been a material failure in the management of the company to which the relevant 
individual has made a direct contribution. Malus or clawback as relevant may be affected by a reduction 
in the amount of any future bonus or subsisting award, the vesting of any subsisting award or future 
share award and/or a requirement to make a cash payment. In respect of bonus or deferred bonus the 
relevant discovery period expires three years after the end of the relevant performance period. In 
respect of RSA awards (and legacy performance shares and options) the relevant discovery period 
expires on the third anniversary of the vesting of the awards.

Selection of performance measures and targets
The Committee determines the performance measures, and the weighting of each, applying to the 
annual bonus based on the strategic priorities of the Group at the time. The bonus measures in place 
normally include the use of profit, RAOC and cash flow measures, but the precise metrics and their 
weightings may change from year to year. Each of these measures is aligned with the Group’s key 
performance indicators (‘KPIs’) and has been chosen as, alongside growing profitability, a focus on cash 
and effective investment of capital are particularly important. The management of capital employed 
together with profitability and cash flow ensures the focus on cash generation, enabling the Group to 
pay dividends and to support the growth strategy by making acquisitions and reinvesting in the 
underlying business. Strategic non-financial goals reward individual contribution to the success of the 
Group and allow a focus each year on important operational goals and strategic milestones, with a 
focus on the Environmental, Social and Governance agenda. This combination of performance 
measures provides a balance relevant to the Group’s business and market conditions as well as 
providing a common goal for the executive directors, senior managers and shareholders. 

Statement of consideration of shareholder views
The Committee considers shareholder feedback received in relation to the AGM each year and 
guidance from shareholder representatives more generally. In addition, the Committee consults 
proactively with its major shareholders prior to making significant changes to its policy, as it did this 
year when a comprehensive shareholder consultation was undertaken. This was conducted through 
meetings, calls and correspondence and the views received helped to shape the policy proposals.

Discretions retained by the Committee in operating the incentive plans 
The Committee operates the Group’s various incentive plans according to their respective rules and in 
accordance with HMRC and IRS rules where relevant. To ensure the efficient administration of these 
plans, the Committee may apply certain operational discretions. These include the following:

•  selecting the participants in the plans;

•  determining the timing of grants and/or payments;

•  determining the quantum of grants, reference pricing basis and/or payments (within the limits set out 

in the policy table above);

•  determining the extent of vesting based on the assessment of performance, including the vesting 

of restricted share awards;

•  determining the appropriate treatment of leavers and the extent of vesting in the case of the share 

based plans;

•  determining the extent of vesting of awards under share based plans in the event of a change 

of control;

•  making the appropriate adjustments required in certain circumstances (e.g. rights issues, corporate 

restructuring events, variation of capital and special dividends); 

•  determining the appropriate choice of measures, weightings and targets for the annual bonus plan 

from year to year, including discretion to amend the bonus outcome, as appropriate; and

•  varying the performance conditions applying to share based awards if an event occurs which causes 

the Committee to consider that it would be appropriate to amend the performance conditions, 
provided the Committee considers the varied conditions are fair and reasonable and not materially 
less challenging than the original conditions would have been but for the event in question.

Legacy arrangements
The proposed and previous directors’ remuneration policies give authority to the Company to honour 
any commitments entered into with current or former directors (that have been disclosed to 
shareholders in previous remuneration reports) or internally promoted future directors (in each case, 
such as the payment of a pension or the unwind of legacy share plans). Details of any payments to 
former directors will be set out in the relevant remuneration report as they arise.

Executive directors’ external appointments
With the specific approval of the Board in each case, executive directors may accept external 
appointments as non-executive directors of other companies and retain any related fees paid to them.

Recruitment of executive directors – approach to remuneration
Executive directors
For the ongoing stability and growth of the Group, it is important to secure, as necessary, the 
appointment of high calibre executives to the Board by either external recruitment or internal 
promotion. The overarching principles applied by the Committee in developing the remuneration 
package will be to set an appropriate base salary together with retirement and other benefits and short 
and long term incentives taking into consideration the skills and experience of the individual, the 
complexity and breadth of the role, the particular needs and situation of the Group, internal relativities, 
the marketplace in which the executive will operate and an individual’s current remuneration package 
and location. In addition, the Committee recognises that it may need to meet certain relocation 
expenses or expatriate benefits as appropriate. 

Any fixed or variable pay awards for new executive directors will not exceed the maximum limits set out 
in the policy table above. However, in addition, for external appointments the Committee may consider 
offering additional cash and/or share based elements to replace deferred remuneration forfeited by 
the individual on leaving their existing employment when it considers these to be in the best interests 
of the Company and its shareholders. Such elements, as appropriate, may be made under section 9.4.2 
of the Listing Rules and would normally take account of the nature, time horizons and performance 
requirements attached to the awards forfeited. 

Depending on the timing of the appointment, the Committee may deem it appropriate to set different 
annual bonus performance conditions for the first performance year of appointment. A long term 
incentive award can be made shortly following an appointment (or as soon as is practical if the 
Company is in a close period).

Non-executive directors
On appointment of a new Chairman of the Board or non-executive director, the fees will be set taking 
into account the experience and calibre of the individual and the prevailing rates of the other non-
executive directors at the time. 

Executive directors’ service contracts
The service contracts for Frank van Zanten and Richard Howes provide for an equal notice period from 
the Company and the executive of a maximum 12 months’ notice and any contracts for newly 
appointed executive directors will provide for equal notice in the future. The date of each service 
contract is noted in the table below:

Chief Executive Officer’s single figure history 
The table below summarises the Chief Executive Officer’s single total figure of remuneration, annual bonus and long term incentive payout as a percentage of maximum opportunity for 2023 and the previous 
nine years. The total remuneration figure for 2023 includes both the 2020 LTIP B awards and the 2021 Restricted Share Award due to reporting requirements. This means the total remuneration is artificially high 
and will normalise in 2024.

Notes
a)    The data for 2016 includes the amounts relating to Michael Roney (‘MR’) from 1 January 2016 to 19 April 2016 and also includes the LTIP awards made to him that vested in the period from 20 April to 31 December 2016. There was no bonus award for Michael Roney in relation 

to 2016.

b)   The data for 2016 also includes the amounts relating to Frank van Zanten (‘FvZ’) from 20 April to 31 December 2016 including the bonus award for that period and the international relocation package with accommodation benefit support, but excludes the LTIP awards made 

to him in his previous role that vested during the period from 20 April to 31 December 2016.

c)   All years prior to 2016 relate to the former CEO Michael Roney.
d)   The single total figure of remuneration in relation to 2022 has been restated from the figure shown in the 2022 Annual Report to reflect the difference between the grant price and the estimated value of vesting using the three month average share price to 31 December 

2022 and the value of the relevant LTIP awards on the actual date of vesting as detailed in Note (f) to the table of the single total figure of remuneration 2023 on page 136.

Percentage change in each director’s remuneration
The table below sets out the annual changes from the prior year, for the years 2020 through to 2023, in the salary, benefits, and bonus values of all directors and employees of the legal entity which employs the 
Chief Executive Officer, Bunzl plc. Where it is not possible to compare employees from Bunzl plc between years due to employees joining or leaving the Company or moving role, these employees have been 
removed from the data to prevent distortion.

Chief Executive Officer pay ratio
The table below sets out the comparisons between the 25th, median, and 75th percentile employees 
in the UK, with reference to 31 December 2023, and the Chief Executive Officer’s salary and total 
remuneration as detailed in the single figure table. To calculate these ratios, the Company has used 
Option A and determined full time equivalent total remuneration as this is the most statistically robust 
method. This includes scaling up salary for part time employees. Each employee’s pay and benefits are 
calculated using each element of employee remuneration consistent with the Chief Executive Officer 
and no element of pay has been omitted.

2024 bonus measures
The structure for Frank van Zanten’s and Richard Howes’ annual bonus for 2024 is a balanced 
scorecard of performance measures, based on adjusted eps, RAOC, operating cash flow and specified 
strategic goals. The weighting of these measures remains 70% financial measures and 30% non-
financial measures (20% strategic goals and 10% ESG goals).

Following feedback from shareholders, the weighting of RAOC will increase by 5% to 15% and the 
weighting of eps will decrease by 5% to 30%. The relevant performance points are: threshold, target, 
and maximum (the level at which the bonus for that measure is capped). These performance points are 
determined at the start of the year and no elements of the bonus are guaranteed. As in previous years, 
the performance measures, including the financial targets, are commercially sensitive and therefore are 
not disclosed until the following year.

The total remuneration ratios for 2023 are higher due to the inclusion of both the LTIP B vests and RSA 
vest in the single figure table for the Chief Executive Officer’s remuneration. The median salary ratio 
remains broadly consistent as the Chief Executive Officer’s salary increase was in line with the wider UK 
workforce. 
Note
The single total figure of remuneration in relation to 2022 has been recalculated to reflect the difference between the grant price and 
the estimated value of vesting of the relevant LTIP awards on the actual date of vesting as detailed in Note (f) to the table of the single 
figure of remuneration 2023 on page 136. The 2022 salary ratio has not been restated because there was no difference to report. 

Relative importance of spend on pay
The table below shows a comparison between the overall expenditure on pay and dividends paid to 
shareholders as well as adjusted earnings per share for 2022 and 2023 (as stated in Note 26, Note 22 
and Note 3 to the consolidated financial statements on pages 185, 182 and 161 respectively).

DIRECTORS’ REMUNERATION REPORT continued

Underpin and pricing basis for long term incentives to be awarded in 2024
For the first awards to be granted under the 2024 Policy, the performance underpin will be reorganised 
so that a formal framework is established upfront which will set out clearly for each award the key 
elements which will need to be assessed for the award to vest. As is current policy, the Committee will 
review specific indicators to help form a view of ‘in the round’ performance. In addition, the Committee 
has the discretion to scale back awards (including to zero) if it concludes there is material 
underperformance over the course of the vesting period.

Performance underpin 
framework

Financial health of the 
business, considering key 
financial indicators

Factors to be considered (not limited to)

•  Revenue growth 

•  Operating margin 

•  Adjusted earnings per share 

•  Return on average operating capital (RAOC/ROIC)

•  Cash conversion 

•  Balance sheet strength

Strategic priorities

Delivery of key strategic objectives over the vesting period including 
operational and individual performance 

Stakeholder experience

Consideration of our key stakeholders including employees, customers, 
suppliers and shareholders 

ESG progress

Progress towards key achievement of ESG objectives including climate 
change ambitions, ethical supply, investing in our people and diversity

The Committee conducts an annual review of the underpin and overall performance to determine if the 
shares should vest in full at the end of three years. Under the proposed new policy there will be an 
increase to quantum of restricted shares granted. In 2024 Frank van Zanten, subject to shareholder 
approval, will be granted a restricted share award to the value of 175% of his salary and Richard Howes 
will be granted a restricted share award to the value of 125% of his salary. In respect of determining the 
number of awards to be granted in 2024, the 60-day average share price preceding the first grant date 
will be used.

Chairman’s and non-executive directors’ fees for 2024
The Chairman’s fee is reviewed every two years and the non-executive directors’ fees are reviewed 
annually with the most recent reviews for both taking effect from 1 January 2024. The current fee 
structure for the Chairman and the non-executive directors is shown below:

The 8.5% increase to the Chairman’s fee reflects the time commitment related to the role and the 
biannual approach to increases. 

Advisers to the Remuneration Committee
In carrying out their responsibilities, the Committee seeks external remuneration advice as necessary. 
During the year the Committee received advice from Willis Towers Watson (‘WTW’) and FIT 
Remuneration Consultants LLP (‘FIT’). WTW provided external survey data on directors’ remuneration 
and benefit levels and FIT advised the Remuneration Committee on senior executive pay. 

The fees payable to each adviser, based on hourly rates, were: £18,090 (WTW), and £72,421 (FIT) 
respectively for such work undertaken in 2023. Advisers are appointed by the Committee and 
reviewed periodically. A tender exercise was conducted in 2020 and FIT were selected to provide 
independent advice to the Remuneration Committee on senior executive pay matters. The Committee 
conducts regular reviews of the effectiveness of the advisers and is satisfied that they remain objective 
and independent.

Statement of voting at the 2023 AGM for the remuneration report 
The remuneration report and remuneration policy respectively received the following shareholder 
votes at the 2023 AGM held on 26 April 2023 and the 2021 AGM held on 20 April 2021 these being the 
years they were last voted on by shareholders:

OTHER STATUTORY INFORMATION

Annual General Meeting
The Notice convening the Company’s Annual 
General Meeting (‘AGM’), to be held at 60 Victoria 
Embankment, London, EC4Y 0JP on Wednesday 
24 April 2024 at 11.00 am, is set out in a separate 
letter from the Chairman to shareholders. 

Dividends
An interim dividend of 18.2p was paid on 
3 January 2024 in respect of 2023 and the 
directors are recommending a final dividend of 
50.1p, making a total for the year of 68.3p per 
share (2022: 62.7p). Dividend details are given in 
Note 22 to the consolidated financial statements. 
Subject to shareholder approval at the 2024 AGM, 
the final dividend will be paid on 2 July 2024 to 
those shareholders on the register at the close 
of business on 17 May 2024.

Share capital
The Company has a single class of share capital 
which is divided into ordinary shares of 32¹⁄ ⁷p 
each which rank pari passu in respect of 
participation and voting rights. The shares are in 
registered form, are fully paid up and are quoted 
on the London Stock Exchange. In addition, the 
Company operates a Level 1 American Depositary 
Receipt programme with Citibank N.A. under 
which the Company’s shares are traded on the 
over-the-counter market in the form of American 
Depositary Receipts.

Details of changes to the issued share capital 
during the year are set out in Note 21 to the 
consolidated financial statements.

Bunzl Group General Employee 
Benefit Trust
The trustee of the Bunzl Group General Employee 
Benefit Trust (the ‘EBT’) holds shares in respect of 
employee share options and awards that have not 
been exercised or vested. The EBT abstains from 
voting in respect of these shares. The trustee has 
agreed to waive the right to dividend payments 
on shares held within the EBT. Details of the 
shares so held are set out in Note 21 to the 
consolidated financial statements.

Rights and obligations attaching 
to shares
Subject to the provisions of the Companies Act 
2006 and without prejudice to any rights attached 
to any existing shares, the Company may resolve 
by ordinary resolution to issue shares with such 
rights and restrictions as set out in such 
resolution or (if there is no such resolution or so 
far as it does not make specific provision) as the 
Board may decide. Subject to the provisions of 
the Companies Act 2006 and of any resolution of 
the Company passed pursuant thereto and 
without prejudice to any rights attached to 
existing shares, the Board is duly authorised to 
issue and allot, grant options over or otherwise 
dispose of the Company’s shares on such terms 
and conditions and at such times as it thinks fit. If 
at any time the share capital of the Company is 
divided into different classes of shares, the rights 
attached to any class may be varied or abrogated 
by special resolution passed at a separate general 
meeting of such holders. Subject to the rights 
attached to any existing shares, rights attached to 
shares will be deemed to be varied by the 
reduction of capital paid up on the shares and by 
the allotment of further shares ranking in priority 
in respect of dividend or capital or which confer 
on the holders more favourable voting rights than 
the first-mentioned shares, but will not otherwise 
be deemed to be varied by the creation or issue 
of further shares.

Power to issue and allot shares
The directors are generally and unconditionally 
authorised under the authorities granted at the 
2023 AGM to allot shares in the Company up to 
approximately one third of the Company’s issued 
share capital or two thirds in respect of a rights 
issue. The directors were also given the power to 
allot ordinary shares for cash up to a limit 
representing approximately 10% of the 
Company’s issued share capital as at 9 March 
2023, without regard to the pre-emption 
provisions of the Companies Act 2006 (however, 
more than 5% can only be used in connection 
with an acquisition or specified capital 
investment). No such shares were issued or 

allotted under these authorities in 2023, nor is 
there any current intention to do so, other than 
to satisfy share options under the Company’s 
share option schemes and, if necessary, to 
satisfy the consideration payable for businesses 
to be acquired. 

These authorities are valid until the conclusion 
of the forthcoming AGM and the directors again 
propose to seek equivalent authorities at 
such AGM.

Restrictions on transfer of shares
Dealings in the Company’s ordinary shares by its 
directors, persons discharging managerial 
responsibilities, certain employees of the 
Company and, in each case, any persons closely 
associated with them, are subject to the 
Company’s Share Dealing Code.

Certain restrictions, which are customary for a 
listed company, apply to transfers of shares in the 
Company. The Board may refuse to register an 
instrument of transfer of any share which is not 
a fully paid share and of a certificated share at its 
discretion unless it is:

•  lodged, duly stamped or duly certified, at the 

offices of the Company’s registrar or such other 
place as the Board may specify and is 
accompanied by the certificate for the shares to 
which it relates and such other evidence as the 
Board may reasonably require to show the right 
of the transferor to make the transfer;

•  in respect of only one class of share; and

•  in favour of not more than four transferees.

Registration of a transfer of an uncertificated 
share may be refused in the circumstances set 
out in the uncertificated securities rules, and 
where, in the case of a transfer to joint holders, 
the number of joint holders to whom the 
uncertificated share is to be transferred 
exceeds four.

In addition, no instrument of transfer for 
certificated shares shall be registered if the 
transferor has been served with a restriction 
notice as defined in the Company’s Articles of 
Association (the ‘Articles’) after failure to provide 

the Company with information concerning 
certain interests in the Company’s shares 
required to be provided under the Companies Act 
2006, unless the transfer is shown to the Board 
to be pursuant to an arm’s length sale. The Board 
has the power to procure that uncertificated 
shares are converted into certificated shares 
and kept in certificated form for as long as the 
Board requires.

The Company is not aware of any 
agreements between shareholders that may 
result in any restriction of the transfer of shares 
or voting rights.

Restrictions on voting rights
A member shall not be entitled to vote, unless the 
Board otherwise decides, at any general meeting 
or class meeting in respect of any shares held by 
them if any call or other sums payable remain 
unpaid. Currently, all issued shares are fully paid. 
In addition, no member shall be entitled to vote if 
they have been served with a restriction notice 
after failing to provide the Company with 
information concerning certain interests in the 
Company’s shares required to be provided under 
the Companies Act 2006. Votes may be exercised 
in person or by proxy. The Articles currently 
provide a deadline for submission of proxy forms 
of 48 hours before the relevant meeting, 24 hours 
before a poll is taken if such poll is taken more 
than 48 hours after it was demanded or during 
the meeting at which the poll was demanded if 
the poll is not taken straight away but is taken not 
more than 48 hours after it was demanded.

Purchase of own shares
At the 2023 AGM, shareholders gave the Company 
authority to purchase up to a maximum amount 
equivalent to approximately 10% of its issued 
share capital. During the year ended 31 
December 2023, the Company did not purchase 
any of its own shares pursuant to this authority 
or the authority granted at the 2022 AGM and 
no shares have been purchased between 
31 December 2023 and 26 February 2024.  
As a result, directors again propose to seek the 
equivalent authority at the 2024 AGM.

Strategic report and Directors’ report
Pages 2 to 87 inclusive consist of the Strategic 
report and pages 88 to 149 inclusive consist of the 
Directors’ report. These reports have been drawn 
up and presented in accordance with, and in 
reliance upon, applicable English company law 
and any liability of the directors in connection 
with these reports shall be subject to the 
limitations and restrictions provided by such law.

The Company has chosen, in accordance with 
section 414C(11) of the Companies Act 2006, to 
include certain matters in its Strategic report that 
would otherwise be required to be disclosed in 
this Directors’ report. These matters are referred 
to above and are explained in more detail in the 
Strategic report on pages 2 to 87.

Under the Companies Act 2006, a safe harbour 
limits the liability of directors in respect of 
statements in and omissions from a strategic 
report and a directors’ report. Under English law, 
the directors would be liable to the Company, but 
not to any third party, if the Strategic report or the 
Directors’ report contain errors as a result of 
recklessness or knowing misstatement or 
dishonest concealment of a material fact, but 
would not otherwise be liable.

The Strategic report and the Directors’ 
report were approved by the Board on 
26 February 2024.
