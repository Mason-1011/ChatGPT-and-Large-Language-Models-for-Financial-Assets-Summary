This review refers to alternative performance measures which exclude charges for customer relationships, brands and technology amortisation, acquisition 
related items, non-recurring pension scheme charges and the profit or loss on disposal of businesses and any associated tax, where relevant. None of these 
items relate to the trading performance of the business. Accordingly, these items are not taken into account by management when assessing the results of 
the business and they are removed in calculating the profitability measures by which management assesses the performance of the Group. Further details 
of these alternative performance measures can be found in Note 3 to the consolidated financial statements on page 160.

Growth at constant exchange rates is calculated by comparing the 2023 results to the results for 2022 retranslated at the average exchange rates  
used for 2023.

CHAIRMAN’S STATEMENT

Bunzl has had another successful year, delivering 
good adjusted operating profit growth and 
making further strategic progress across the 
business, including surpassing the milestone of 
£5 billion of committed acquisition spend since 
2004, and extending its track record of 
consecutive annual dividend growth to 31 years. 

At constant exchange rates, revenue in 2023 
declined by 1.9% (2.0% at actual exchange rates) 
and declined by 0.4% compared to the prior year 
excluding the disposal of the UK healthcare 
business. Adjusted operating profit grew by 
6.2% at constant exchange rates (6.6% at actual 
exchange rates), with 7.6% growth excluding the 
disposal. An operating margin of 8.0% was 
supported by good margin management, 
including increasing penetration of own brands, 
higher margin acquisitions, operational 
efficiencies and inventory driven one-off benefits 
in the second half of 2023. At constant exchange 
rates, adjusted operating profit was 46.3% higher 
than the comparable period in 2019, and is 
equivalent to a c.10% Compound Annual Growth 
Rate (‘CAGR’) over that period. This performance 
gives me continued confidence in the Group’s 
ability to continue to deliver long term growth, 
supported by the agility of our people, the 
diversification of our portfolio, the strength of our 
culture and our dedication to customer service.

CHAIRMAN’S STATEMENT continued

Strategic priorities
We continue to pursue a strategy of developing 
the business through a combination of organic 
growth, operational improvements and 
acquisition-led growth. The Group agreed 
19 acquisitions in the year, across 11 countries 
and five sectors, highlighting the breadth of 
Bunzl’s consolidation opportunities. This included 
the Group’s first acquisition in Poland, Safety 
First, one of the country’s largest distributors 
of personal protection equipment (‘PPE’). This 
anchor acquisition provides a good platform 
from which to develop Bunzl’s operations in this 
attractive market. Total committed spend for 
the year was £468 million, resulting in a total 
committed spend of £1.7 billion over the last 
four years. Bunzl’s acquisition momentum has 
continued into 2024, with the announcement of 
two new acquisitions today, Nisbets and Pamark 
Group. Nisbets is a well-established, high quality 
and own brand focused omnichannel distributor 
of catering equipment and consumables that 
operates in the UK and Ireland, Northern Europe, 
and Australasia. The second acquisition is our 
anchor acquisition in Finland, a leading distributor 
called Pamark. This takes the number of countries 
in which we operate to 33. Bunzl’s depth of 
opportunity is significant and further 
consolidation of the Group’s fragmented end 
markets is a key growth opportunity. The 
continued sector and geographic expansion 
further enhances our available acquisition 
opportunities. 

Bunzl’s operating companies have continued to 
develop their value-added services to customers, 
supporting organic growth, customer retention, 
and margin opportunities. Alongside our 
sustainability and digital capabilities, developing 
innovative, own brand ranges is an area that 
continues to strengthen Bunzl’s competitive 
advantage, with penetration today at c.25% of 
Group revenue. We also continue to collaborate 
with our strategic third-party branded suppliers, 
to provide unparalleled choice for our customers. 
The proportion of total Group revenue 
attributable to non-packaging products or 
packaging made from alternative materials 

remained high at 85%, while 72% of customer 
orders were received digitally. The Group also 
continues to drive operational efficiencies, 
including further warehouse relocations and 
consolidations which partially offsets property 
cost inflation, as well as making further 
investments into automation. Bunzl ended 
the year with a net debt to EBITDA of 1.1 times, 
providing substantial headroom for further 
self-funded acquisitions and other capital 
allocation options.

People and culture 
Bunzl’s most important asset is its people, who 
remain committed to providing customers with 
a reliable and value-added service. People 
continue to find Bunzl a fulfilling place to work, 
as demonstrated by the results from the Group’s 
participation in the external ‘Great Place to Work’ 
scheme in 2023. After an initial trial in Continental 
Europe in 2022, the Group opened up the scheme 
more broadly in 2023. Around 75% of our 
operating companies that participated were 
accredited by the ‘Great Place to Work’ 
programme. We also continued to accelerate 
our diversity and inclusion agenda to ensure that 
we have a working environment which supports 
individual well-being, growth and career 
progression. In 2023, the percentage of women 
within our senior leadership team of 506 leaders 
(defined as those receiving long term incentives) 
was 22%. This is an increase of two percentage 
points compared to the equivalent population 
in 2022.

Shareholder returns
The Board is recommending a final dividend of 
50.1p, 10.4% higher than the prior year, resulting 
in a full year dividend of 68.3p. This represents 
an 8.9% increase in the total dividend compared 
to 2022 and is Bunzl’s 31st consecutive year 
of annual dividend growth. The Group 
remains committed to ensuring sustainable 
dividend growth. 

Since 2004, Bunzl has returned £2.2 billion 
to shareholders through dividends and has 
committed over £5 billion to self-funded 
acquisitions to support a growth strategy that 
has delivered an adjusted earnings per share 
CAGR of c.10% over that period and achieved 
a return on invested capital of 15.5% in 2023.

Governance
Vanda Murray joined the Board in February 2015 
and is currently the Chair of the Remuneration 
Committee and the Senior Independent Director. 
She has served on the Board for just over nine 
years and her term of office will end after the 
2024 AGM. Vanda’s independent advice and 
significant contribution to the Board’s 
deliberations over the years have been greatly 
appreciated and she will leave with our best 
wishes. A robust recruitment process for a new 
non-executive director is now underway and an 
announcement will be released in due course, 
once a suitable candidate has been identified.

On the 1st of March 2023, Jacky Simmonds  
was appointed as a non-executive director  
of the Group. She has significant knowledge and 
experience of working in international and listed 
companies, and across all aspects of HR, with 
particular expertise in employee engagement, 
talent and succession planning. The proportion 
of female directors on the Board is now 44%, 
while representation on our Executive Committee 
remains at 40%. 

Vanda will be succeeded as Chair of the 
Remuneration Committee by Jacky, and Pam Kirby 
will succeed her as the Board’s new Senior 
Independent Director. The timing of the changes 
allows for a meaningful handover period with 
Vanda as part of a planned succession.

Peter Ventress 
Chairman

CHIEF EXECUTIVE OFFICER’S REVIEW

Frank van Zanten 
Frank van Zanten 
Chief Executive Officer 
Chief Executive Officer 

A year of resilience, delivering 
growth and margin improvement

Overview
The Group delivered a strong operating margin 
in 2023, despite revenue performance being 
impacted by a reducing benefit from inflation, 
volume loss in the North America foodservice 
redistribution business and some post-pandemic 
related normalisation trends. I am proud of the 
success our teams have had with margin 
management initiatives which have contributed 
to the margin performance, such as increasing 
the penetration of our own brand products, and 
continued strategic focus on operational 
efficiencies. 

We have achieved overall good outcomes from 
the elevated number of customer tenders we 
have seen following a period of reduced activity, 
which is a testament to the strong value 
proposition we provide our customers, supported 
by the strength of our supply chain. While the 
Group’s financial strength had enabled our teams 
to invest in inventory during the supply chain 
disruption over the last few years, as this has 
eased, our teams have also demonstrated a 
strong commitment to operational discipline, 
delivering a meaningful reduction in inventory 
days towards 2019 levels, particularly in the first 
half of the year. I am also very pleased with the 
continued success of our acquisition strategy, 
including surpassing the milestone of £5 billion 
of committed spend since 2004.

Our performance in 2023 continues to highlight 
the strength of Bunzl’s compounding growth 
strategy and this strengthens my confidence in

CHIEF EXECUTIVE OFFICER’S REVIEW continued

the Group’s medium term outlook. Our organic 
revenue growth will continue to be supported 
by investments in our value-added proposition, 
and a net inflationary environment is potentially 
a further medium term support. Furthermore, 
we continue to see substantial opportunities for 
consolidation of our fragmented markets, and 
the Group has achieved a step-change in the level 
of committed acquisition spend in recent years. 
The expansion of our footprint resulting from 
acquisitions continues to enhance the number of 
future opportunities available through our locally 
driven approach to sourcing acquisitions.

Operating performance
With approximately 90% of adjusted operating 
profit generated outside the UK, profits and 
earnings were positively impacted between 
0% and 3% by currency translation in 2023. 
The commentary below is stated at constant 
exchange rates unless otherwise highlighted. 
Performance in 2023 also reflects the disposal 
of our UK healthcare business in December 2022, 
which had revenue of £176 million in 2022.

Over 2023, revenue declined by 1.9% (2.0% 
at actual exchange rates) to £11,797.1 million. 
Within this, acquisition growth of 2.5% was offset 
by underlying revenue decline of 2.9% and the 
impact of the UK healthcare business disposal in 
December 2022 which impacted revenue by 1.5%. 
Within the underlying revenue decline of 2.9%, 
the decline in Covid-19 related sales impacted 
underlying revenue by 1.4%, with Covid-19 related 
sales now broadly in line with 2019 levels. The 
base business contributed 1.5% of the decline, 
driven by volume loss in the North America 
foodservice redistribution business due to 
deflationary pressure increasing price 
competition, post-pandemic normalisation 
trends, as well as a reducing benefit from inflation. 
Furthermore, volumes were impacted by planned 
strategic actions in the North America retail 
business to focus on more profitable customers 
and the decision to transition ownership of 
customer specific inventory to certain customers, 
as well as some volume weakness in Continental 
Europe and UK & Ireland. 

In recent years, the Group has managed inflation 
on paper, plastics and chemicals well, and 
successfully implemented product cost driven 
selling price increases. Over the year, the benefit 
of inflation continued to reduce, with some 
deflation in the final quarter, particularly in 
North America, which was no longer fully offset by 
inflation benefit elsewhere. While other regions 
saw lagged inflation compared to North America, 
all regions experienced a reducing benefit over 
the course of the year. During the year, we 
achieved good overall outcomes from the 
elevated number of customer tenders, following 
reduced activity during the pandemic. We saw 
moderating operating cost inflation in North 
America with wage inflation back to more 
typical levels. Property cost inflation linked to 
lease renewals remained high, but was partially 
offset by fuel and freight rates declining 
meaningfully. Wage inflation in UK & Ireland 
and Continental Europe increased over the year 
but was manageable. 

The foodservice and retail businesses combined 
saw underlying revenue decline by 8% compared 
to the prior year. There was volume weakness in 
North America foodservice due to deflationary 
pressure increasing price competition, which 
alongside process changes in the business to 
drive more own brand penetration, resulted in 
lower volumes. We also saw an impact to volumes 
from post-pandemic normalisation trends, driven 
by a reduction in takeaway packaging sales as 
dining habits have continued to shift following the 
pandemic, and customer destocking activity early 
in the first half. The retail sector saw a decline in 
revenues, mainly in North America, as a result of 
planned strategic actions to focus on more 
profitable customers and transitioning ownership 
of customer specific inventory to certain 
customers. In addition, there was a reduction in 
Covid-19 related sales in most business areas. 
Total underlying revenue in the grocery and other 
sectors grew by 2%, driven by further year-on-
year inflation benefit. Overall, total underlying 
revenue in the healthcare, safety and cleaning & 
hygiene sectors declined by 1% year-on-year, with 
an impact from lower Covid-19 related sales. 

We saw good outcomes of 
tendering activity in the year, 
supported by our continued 
demonstration of our 
value-added services and 
the strength of our own 
brand proposition.”

Our safety base businesses have seen a slight 
decline, with continued recovery in some business 
areas offset by normalising Covid-19 related sales. 
Increased infrastructure spend in North America 
is a potential medium term support for our safety 
business. The cleaning & hygiene sector saw 
some growth over the year, mainly due to 
acquisitions and inflation benefits in UK & Ireland 
and Continental Europe. 

Adjusted operating profit was £944.2 million, an 
increase of 6.2% (6.6% at actual exchange rates), 
and operating margin increased to 8.0% 
compared to 7.4% in the prior year. The Group’s 
operating margin was supported by good margin 
management, including increasing penetration of 
own brands, higher margin acquisitions, 
operational efficiencies, and inventory driven 
one-off benefits in the second half of 2023. 
Operating margins remain substantially higher 
compared with the 6.9% achieved in 2019, at 
constant exchange rates. Of the 110bps increase, 
around half is driven by margins attributable to 
acquisitions made over that period. Excluding the 
UK healthcare disposal, adjusted operating profit 
grew by 7.6%. Reported operating profit was 
£789.1 million, an increase of 11.0% (12.5% at 
actual exchange rates), reflecting the 6.2% 
increase in adjusted operating profit (at constant 
exchange rates) and a reduction in customer 
relationships, brands and technology 
amortisation and acquisition related items 
compared to the prior year.

CHIEF EXECUTIVE OFFICER’S REVIEW continued

Decarbonisation impact by lever (2050)

We believe that long term net zero targets need to be aligned with 
climate science and as such we have followed the SBTi’s Net Zero 
Standard to develop our transition plan during 2023. As with our 
near term carbon reduction targets, we have submitted our net 
zero transition plan for approval with the SBTi.

1.   We anticipate that beyond the reductions associated with the five key decarbonisation levers, further innovation and technology improvements, particularly 

related to product design and technology, transportation solutions and waste treatment will result in additional emissions reduction.

2.   Residual emissions are those emissions that remain at the point of net zero, despite abatement efforts. We are committed to neutralising any residual 

emissions at the net-zero target year.

Adjusted profit before income tax was £853.7 
million, an increase of 3.4% (4.4% increase at 
actual exchange rates). Adjusted profit before 
income tax was impacted by a £27.2 million 
increase in net finance expense, at constant 
exchange rates, to £90.5 million, driven by 
increases in interest rates and fair value 
movements on interest rate derivatives, 
partly offset by lower average debt during the 
year. Reported profit before income tax was 
£698.6 million, an increase of 7.8% (10.1% 
at actual exchange rates).

The effective tax rate of 25.0% was higher than 
the 24.6% in the prior year, reflecting the UK 
corporate tax increase. This will also have a 
further impact next year, so the effective tax 
rate is expected to be around 26% in 2024. 

Adjusted earnings per share were 191.1p, an 
increase of 2.7% (3.7% at actual exchange rates). 
Reported basic earnings per share were 157.1p, an 
increase of 8.2% (10.9% at actual exchange rates).

The Group’s cash generation continues to be 
strong, with 96% cash conversion (operating cash 
flow as a percentage of lease adjusted operating 
profit) ahead of our 90% target, and £643.5 
million free cash flow generated. The level of cash 
generated remains strong, but a higher cash 
outflow relating to income tax and interest paid 
resulted in free cash flow declining 8.8% at actual 
exchange rates compared to 2022. The strength 
of our underlying free cash flow generation 
continues to enable our investment in the 
business, progressive dividends and acquisitions.

The Group ended the year with net debt, 
excluding lease liabilities, of £1,085.5 million 
compared to £1,160.1 million in December 2022. 
Net debt to EBITDA, calculated at average 
exchange rates and in accordance with the 
Group’s external debt covenants, which are based 
on historical accounting standards, was 1.1 times 
compared to 1.2 times at the end of 2022. This 
provides the Group with substantial capacity to 
fund further acquisitions and to consider other 
potential capital allocation options. 

The structure of recent acquisitions, with 
increasing earn outs and options to be exercised 
to buy out minorities in future years, gives rise to 
both deferred consideration payable and future 
contingent consideration. At the end of the year, 
a deferred consideration payable of £175.6 million 

was held on our balance sheet compared to 
£139.9 million at the end of 2022; deferred 
consideration is not included within the Group’s 
external debt covenant definition. The total 
amount of deferred and contingent consideration 
relating to acquisitions was £258.8 million at the 
end of the year compared to £216.2 million at the 
end of 2022. The incremental leverage from 
deferred and contingent consideration expected 
to be paid was c.0.2 times.

Return on average operating capital increased 
moderately to 46.1% compared to 43.0% at 31 
December 2022, mainly due to higher returns in 
the underlying business driven by an increase in 
operating margin. Return on invested capital was 
15.5% compared to 15.0% at 31 December 2022, 
similarly due to higher returns in the underlying 
business driven by an increase in operating profit.

CHIEF EXECUTIVE OFFICER’S REVIEW continued

Organic growth and 
operational efficiency
We remain committed to delivering growth 
through our consistent compounding strategy, 
which focuses on organic growth, operational 
efficiency and acquisitions. Our colleagues have 
continued to focus on increasing digital sales, 
which accounted for 72% of orders over 2023 
compared to 69% in 2022. We also continue to 
provide our customers with innovative products 
and services, including those within our strong 
sustainability offering, which enhance our 
competitive advantage supporting the overall 
good outcome of recent tenders.

Our continued focus on operational efficiencies 
included the consolidation of 13 warehouses and 
the relocation of 11 warehouses, as well as 
continuing to implement new technologies and 
automation that drive more efficient processes. 

Acquisitions
Over the year, Bunzl agreed 19 acquisitions with 
a total committed spend of £468 million, adding 
estimated annualised revenue of £325 million. 
These acquisitions, which span 11 countries and 
five sectors, further expanding our customer 
reach, strategic capabilities, geographic and 
sector diversification and highlight the breadth 
of our consolidation opportunities. We are 
pleased with the acquisition of Safety First, one 
of the largest distributors of PPE in Poland. This is 
our first acquisition in Poland, providing access to 
a potential market of more than 38 million people. 
Following this acquisition, there are significant 
opportunities for Bunzl to grow in this market. 
Bunzl continued to expand its digital capabilities 
with the acquisitions of specialist online 
distributors in Germany (Arbeitsschutz-Express) 
and the Netherlands (EcoTools.nl). Bunzl also 
completed three acquisitions in Brazil, adding 
a further c.£124 million of annualised revenue in a 
country in which we have grown revenue CAGR by 
17% since 2019, with plenty of further 
opportunities for growth.

CHIEF EXECUTIVE OFFICER’S REVIEW continued

Overall, acquisitions made during the year have 
enhanced the Group’s digital capabilities and 
expanded our geographic coverage, own brand 
ranges and expertise.

The strength of the Group’s cash conversion and 
balance sheet continues to enable the Group to 
fund further acquisitions, largely through cash 
generated in the year. This ongoing strength has 
supported the self-funding of one of Bunzl’s most 
successful acquisition periods. Over the last four 
years combined committed spend on acquisitions 
was approximately £1.7 billion.

Bunzl ended 2023 with net debt to EBITDA of 
1.1 times, providing the Group with substantial 
capacity to self-fund further acquisitions. 
Our pipeline is active, and we see significant 
opportunities for continued acquisition growth in 
our existing markets where we have opportunity 
to increase our presence, as well as potential to 
expand into new markets.

Today, Bunzl announces the acquisitions of 
Nisbets and Pamark Group. Nisbets is a leading 
omnichannel distributor of catering equipment 
and consumables in the UK and Ireland, Northern 
Europe, and Australasia. This is a high quality 
business that will complement the Group’s 
existing businesses in the catering distribution 
sector. Their extensive range of own brand 
products are a good addition to our portfolio and 
their digital marketing and sales capabilities will 
complement other online-focused businesses 
within the Group. Pamark is Bunzl’s first 

15.5%

acquisition in Finland, bringing the Group’s 
operations to a total of 33 countries. It is a leading 
distributor that provides us with opportunities to 
expand in multiple end markets, including cleaning 
& hygiene, healthcare, foodservice and safety.

Capital allocation 
Our capital allocation priorities remain unchanged 
and focused on the following: to reinvest our cash 
into the business to support organic growth and 
operational efficiencies; to pay a progressive 
dividend; to self-fund value accretive acquisitions; 
and to distribute excess cash. Our framework 
favours the first three methods of investment, 
with £2.2 billion of cash distributed to 
shareholders through dividends and £5.2 billion 
committed acquisition spend between 2004 and 
2023, while maintaining a good return on invested 
capital of 15.5% (2022: 15.0%). With the strength 
of Bunzl’s performance in recent years resulting in 
a comfortable leverage position compared to a 
net debt to EBITDA target of 2.0 to 2.5 times, there 
is significant financial headroom remaining to 
commit to self-funded value accretive acquisitions 
in our active pipeline of attractive opportunities. 
The Board is committed to an efficient balance 
sheet which supports investment into the 
business and maintains flexibility for value 
accretive acquisitions, and also continually 
assesses the appropriateness of the return 
of excess capital to shareholders. 

Equitable and sustainable growth
Sustainability remains a key strategic priority, 
and the Group is committed to helping lead the 
transition to a more sustainable and equitable 
future by continuing to direct our efforts into the 
four key areas where we believe we can make 
the greatest positive contribution: providing 
alternative packaging solutions; ensuring 
responsible supply chains; investing in our people; 
and taking action on climate change. 

The Group remains focused on transitioning 
customers to packaging that is better suited to 
a circular economy, with revenue from packaging 
made from alternative materials accounting for 
55% of the Group’s total packaging sales. 

The proportion of total Group revenue 
attributable to non-packaging products or 
packaging made from alternative materials 
remained high at 85%, with a further 10% of the 
Group’s revenue attributable to single-use plastic 
consumables which are likely to transition to 
products made from alternative materials. We 
continue to increase our competitive advantage 
by sourcing innovative products, including from 
within our own brand portfolio, as well as with our 
expert advice, data tools and investments in our 
supplier auditing programme.

We have made good progress towards our 2030 
scope 1 and 2 carbon emissions reduction targets 
that were approved by the Science Based Targets 
initiative (‘SBTi’) in 2022. Currently we are 
progressing well to achieve our target of a 27.5% 
absolute emissions reduction and becoming 50% 
more carbon efficient by 2030, having reduced 
absolute emissions by 18% and become 30% 
more carbon efficient against a 2019 baseline. 
We continue to aim to be net zero by 2050 at the 
latest, inclusive of scope 3 emissions. We believe 
that long term net zero targets need to be aligned 
with climate science and as such we have followed 
the SBTi’s Net Zero Standard to develop our 
transition plan, which details how we will achieve 
our 2050 net zero commitment. As with our near 
term carbon reduction targets, we have 
submitted our net zero transition plan for 
approval with the SBTi.

The Group continues to carry out ethical and 
quality audits of its suppliers. In 2023, 1,022 of 
these audits were completed through our 
Shanghai based Global Supply Chain Solutions 
team. The majority took place in Asia, as this is the 
most significant high risk sourcing market for 
Bunzl by spend, but audits were also performed 
in other high risk regions. In total, c.96% of our 
overall purchasing spend today is either 
purchases from low risk regions or with assessed 
or compliant suppliers in high risk regions, or on 
other non-product related costs.

Our people strategy also continues to drive 
strong engagement, as indicated by 75% of our 
operating companies that participated in the 

‘Great Place to Work’ programme becoming 
accredited. We continue to see encouraging 
retention levels across the Group and good 
progress was made on our diversity plans. 

Prospects
We are maintaining our 2024 profit guidance 
published in our pre-close statement1.

Following a slower than expected start to the year 
in North America, we now expect to deliver slight 
revenue growth in 2024, at constant exchange 
rates, driven by acquisitions announced in 2023; 
with underlying revenue, which is organic revenue 
adjusted for trading days, declining slightly. Group 
operating margin is now expected to be slightly 
below 2023. 

Looking ahead, the Group’s longer term 
prospects remain attractive, with the Group 
committed to its proven and consistent strategy 
which supports Bunzl’s continued track record 
of value creation. Organic growth, is supported 
by new business opportunities, continual product 
innovation, sustainability expertise, and the 
Group’s daily focus on becoming more efficient. 
Our acquisition growth is driven by our position 
as the leading operator of scale in highly 
fragmented markets, with a strong balance sheet 
and demonstrable track record of our ability to 
consolidate. We believe the merits of joining the 
Bunzl family have only been strengthened as a 
result of the pandemic and supply chain 
disruptions, and this is reflected in our recent 
acquisition success. We have an active pipeline of 
acquisition opportunities in our existing markets, 
supplemented by potential acquisitions in new 
geographies and adjacent sectors. Our capital 
allocation and portfolio optimisation discipline 
ensures we are investing to drive a strong return.

OPERATING REVIEW

North America

Jim McCool 
Chief Executive Officer,  
North America

Our strong operating 
margin increase was 
primarily driven by good 
margin management 
initiatives and growth 
in own brands.”

Overview
In North America, revenue declined 5.3% to 
£6,973.5 million, with underlying revenue 
declining by 5.6%. The benefit of a significant 
new business win in our processor segment in 
the second half of 2022 and modest growth from 
current year acquisitions was more than offset 
by volume loss in the foodservice redistribution 
business. In retail, revenue was also impacted by 
planned strategic actions to focus on more 
profitable customers and transitioning ownership 
of customer specific inventory to certain 
customers. Finally, we saw a further decline in 
Covid-19 related product sales, driven by the 
return to historical price levels of disposable glove 
categories. Despite the revenue decline, adjusted 
operating profit improved by 2.9%, to £528.0 
million with operating margin increasing to 7.6%, 
up from 6.9% in the prior year. This was primarily 
driven by margin management initiatives and 
strong growth in own brands, particularly in our 
grocery and foodservice segments, which more 
than offset moderating operating cost inflation, 
driven by wage inflation being at a more typical 
level. Property cost inflation linked to lease 
renewals remained high, but was partially offset 
by fuel and freight rates declining meaningfully.

Our business which supports the US grocery 
sector, declined modestly as we experienced 
reducing inflation benefit and some price 
deflation towards the end of the year, primarily 
driven by the carrier bag and disposable glove 
categories. Strong margin management, as well 
as strong growth in own brands, drove overall 
improvement in operating margin and adjusted 
operating profit. Our convenience store sector 
declined moderately.

Our foodservice redistribution business declined. 
Deflationary pressure increased price 
competition, which alongside process changes 
in the business, to drive more own brand 
penetration, resulted in lower volumes. We also 
saw an impact on volumes from post-pandemic 
normalisation trends, as a result of a reduction 
in takeaway packaging sales as dining habits have 
continued to shift following the pandemic and 

customer destocking activity early in the first half. 
Our food processor sector grew modestly, as the 
favourable impact of a large customer win in 
Q3 2022 more than offset continued temporary 
market weakness in the segment. Our businesses 
serving the agriculture sector saw revenues 
decline significantly due to the flooding in 
California in the first half of 2023 and year-on-year 
price deflation as a result of the normalisation 
of supply chains.

Our cleaning & hygiene business declined 
moderately, as year-on-year product costs 
reduced, along with Covid-19 related sales 
and the impact from continued high levels 
of remote working.

Revenue in our retail supplies business declined 
following planned strategic actions taken to focus 
on more profitable customers, transitioning 
ownership of customer specific inventory to 
certain customers, and some lost business. 
However, adjusted operating profit declined only 
modestly, amidst a favourable mix shift toward 
higher margin packaging and value added 
services, increased own brands and well-
controlled operating costs.

Our safety business revenue declined, due to a 
reduction in Covid-19 related sales, although 
operating margins and operating profit improved 
as a result of good margin management as supply 
chains stabilised and strong growth in our asset 
protection business.

Finally, our business in Canada experienced 
slight revenue growth, with Covid-19 related 
sales decreases offset by growth driven by the 
2023 acquisitions of Capital Paper and PackPro, 
with operating profit improved due to increased 
product margins and well controlled 
operating costs.

OPERATING REVIEW continued

Continental Europe

Alberto Grau 
Managing Director,  
Continental Europe

Our overall revenue 
and adjusted operating 
profit growth were mainly 
driven by the positive 
contributions from 
acquisitions made in 2022 
and throughout 2023.”

Overview
Revenue in Continental Europe grew by 8.4% to 
£2,354.9 million, primarily driven by the benefit 
of acquisitions. Underlying revenue grew by 1.0%, 
with the support of product cost inflation partially 
offset by volume weakness in most markets and 
the decline in Covid-19 related sales. 

Adjusted operating profit increased by 14.1% to 
£224.7 million, with operating margin increasing 
from 9.0% to 9.5% driven by good margin 
management, and a focus on improving our 
businesses in Turkey to drive profitability in a 
hyperinflationary environment. Overall revenue 
and adjusted operating profit growth were mainly 
driven by the positive contributions from 
acquisitions made in 2022 and throughout 2023 
and good margin management.

In France, there was some revenue growth in our 
cleaning & hygiene businesses. Good growth with 
foodservice and healthcare customers and a 
benefit from product inflation was largely offset 
by the expected decline in Covid-19 related sales 
and reduced activity with public sector 
customers. Our safety business saw a significant 
reduction in sales of Covid-19 related products, 
as well as an impact from reduced public sector 
activity, but successfully moved to a new IT 
platform enabling more efficient digital tools to be 
used to support its operations. The foodservice 
specific businesses have grown sales, supported 
by inflation.

In the Netherlands, there was very strong 
growth in our foodservice business, driven 
by hotel, travel and leisure customers, and also 
in our non-food retail business, where we had 
a number of new business wins. We saw some 
volume weakness in other sectors, with the prior 
year benefitting very strongly from the reduction 
in Covid-19 restrictions and deflation impacting 
our e-commerce fulfilment businesses. Our 
grocery and e-commerce fulfilment businesses 
successfully consolidated a number of 
warehouses into a new facility in the second half 
of the year. In Belgium, our cleaning & hygiene 
businesses have grown moderately with contract 
cleaning and catering customers. In Germany, 

growth has been driven by our foodservice 
business, which has grown significantly across 
all sectors but with hotel customers in particular, 
and has also launched a new web platform 
targeting smaller customers.

In Denmark, we have seen a slight decline in our 
foodservice business as inflation benefits were 
more than offset by a reduction in Covid-19 
related product sales. Revenues in our safety 
business have grown very strongly due to 
increased activities from customers in the 
renewable energy and pharmaceutical sectors. 

Sales in Spain saw very strong growth, driven by 
an acquisition and good organic growth despite 
a reduction in Covid-19 related sales and reduced 
activities with industrial packaging customers. 
Our safety end user and redistribution businesses 
were impacted by the reduction of Covid-19 
related sales but still delivered growth overall 
with increased volumes in the base business. 
Our online healthcare business has grown 
strongly on the back of improved pricing 
management and better inventory availability.

In Turkey, volumes have declined as we focus 
on business that can be profitable in a 
hyperinflationary environment, while in Israel, 
where we have two small businesses, sales 
have declined significantly since the start of 
the Gaza conflict.

In all other countries we have seen a decline in 
foodservice aided by inflation and volume growth 
but partially offset by lower Covid-19 related sales. 
We have continued to increase the percentage of 
digital orders from customers and have launched 
a number of new webshops, supporting improved 
customer retention and enhancing the efficiency 
of our business. Our digital capabilities have 
also been enhanced through recent acquisitions 
(Arbeitsschutz-Express and EcoTools.nl) and the 
introduction of digital and demand 
management tools.

OPERATING REVIEW continued

UK & Ireland

Andrew Tedbury 
Managing Director,  
UK & Ireland

Our underlying revenue 
growth is driven by strong 
product cost inflation, 
alongside continued 
recovery in certain markets, 
in particular grocery, 
foodservice and cleaning & 
hygiene.”

Overview
In UK & Ireland, revenue declined by 5.4% as 
a result of the disposal of the UK healthcare 
business. Excluding the impact of acquisitions and 
last year’s disposal of the UK healthcare business, 
underlying revenue increased by 6.1%. This 
growth was driven by strong product cost 
inflation, alongside continued recovery in certain 
markets, in particular grocery, foodservice and 
cleaning & hygiene. This positive sales growth, 
supported by a continual focus on developing 
own brands and good margin management, 
delivered a significant increase in operating 
margin which improved from 6.6% to 7.6%, 
with adjusted operating profit increasing by 
8.4% to £103.4 million, and by 21.2% excluding 
acquisitions and the UK healthcare disposal. 

Our cleaning & hygiene and care businesses 
continued to grow with the full year effect of new 
customer wins and category additions. The 
benefit of inflation reduced in the second half of 
the year, reflecting the timing of price increases 
in the equivalent period last year. Our carbon 
forecasting tools alongside the introduction of 
many environmentally friendly products have 
enabled our customers to further improve upon 
their own climate targets. The launch of some 
new labour-saving cleaning technologies has also 
allowed our customers to invest for the future. 
Within our care businesses we have also seen 
growth with the onboarding of some large 
exclusive supplier contracts that launched 
in the second half of the year.

Our safety businesses grew despite a reduction 
in government infrastructure spending and the 
slowdown in house building, as a result of new 
wins in the transport and building materials 
sectors. Work continues in developing a strong 
sustainable range of own brand products as 
demand in this area grows. The business has 
continued to invest in new operationally efficient 
locations to deliver outstanding levels of service 
to customers alongside an increasing shift 
towards buying online.

Our grocery and non-food retail businesses saw 
slight growth from more business with existing 
customers and the securing of a large new 
category from an existing grocery customer. 
We continued to invest in improving our sourcing 
credentials and expanded our work with sister 
companies to provide pick and pack services 
in-house to enhance the levels of service 
available. We saw some new customer wins in our 
national online packaging business leveraging our 
ability to source globally delivered cost-effective 
solutions. Our other packaging businesses 
achieved good outcomes on customer tenders 
to secure long term contracts with many existing 
customers, despite the deflationary environment. 

Our foodservice businesses saw a softening of 
demand as the cost-of-living issues coincided 
with high cost inflation in both food supplies 
and labour. Despite this trend, these businesses 
delivered strong growth as a result of good 
customer tender retention and new customer 
wins, with customers impressed with our 
sustainability offering, including our ability to 
provide sustainable product alternatives. The 
quality of our data has also allowed us to work 
closely with customers as they seek to reduce 
their impact on the climate and their emissions. 
Increased focus on developing more cost-
effective and sustainable own brands is also 
making an impact as sales of these products 
continued to improve. 

Our businesses in Ireland continued to see 
good growth, driven by increasing business 
with existing customers and by securing new 
customers. We have continued to invest in 
developing our operations with the introduction 
of new warehouse management systems, which 
have further enhanced our service following 
the recent launch of innovative inventory 
management technology. Data provides us with 
valuable insights into our customers’ purchasing 
habits, which allows us to recommend valuable 
and sustainable delivery solutions to support 
a growing need to reduce carbon emissions. 
The launch of several new own brand and 
sustainable product ranges has landed well 
with customers seeking stronger environmental 
solutions for the future.

OPERATING REVIEW continued

Rest of the World

Jonathan Taylor 
Managing Director,  
Latin America

Scott Mayne 
Managing Director,  
Asia Pacific

Overview
In Rest of the World, revenue increased by 5.7% 
to £1,103.2 million, driven by acquisitions, with 
underlying revenue declining by 3.2%, caused by 
further normalisation of Covid-19 related product 
sales, largely in Asia Pacific, reflecting the 
non-repeat of some large orders that were 
fulfilled in the prior year. The Latin America 
businesses were also impacted by lower selling 
prices resulting from reduced inbound freight 
costs and currency movements over the year. 
Overall, the Rest of the World’s adjusted operating 
profit increased by 7.5% to £119.6 million with 
operating margin increasing from 10.6% to 10.8%, 
driven by acquisitions. 

In Brazil, our safety businesses experienced 
some organic sales growth and strong margins 
as market conditions remained stable. Our 
healthcare businesses had mixed results with 
difficult trading in our private label import 
business as prices post-pandemic continued to 
normalise, contrasting with strong performances 
from our more technical branded medical 
distributors. Our hygiene and foodservice 
businesses saw lower sales due to increased 
competitive pressure, but in both cases margins 
increased. Our safety, hygiene and healthcare 
presence in Brazil has been significantly 
bolstered by three new acquisitions completed 
during the year.

In Chile, our safety businesses saw mixed results. 
Our full-range PPE business experienced good 
organic growth and improved margins while our 
specialty footwear business saw more difficult 
trading due to weaker demand in the retail 
channel. Our foodservice business also declined 
due to weaker consumer demand across the 
country and higher competition, although 
profitability is still well ahead of 2019.

Our largest business in Asia Pacific, Bunzl 
Australia and New Zealand, experienced a 
temporary decline in healthcare revenue in the 
first half of the year as both the government and 
private sectors utilised excess Covid-19 related 
inventory. However, the business experienced 
very strong growth in cleaning & hygiene and 
has continued developing specialisation in its 
core market sectors, which has resulted in a 
strong pipeline of new business. The acquisition 
of Melbourne Cleaning Supplies in November 
2023 further strengthened our cleaning & 
hygiene businesses.

Our Australian speciality healthcare business 
was impacted by reduced government and private 
spending, as these customers continue to utilise 
inventory procured during the pandemic, but 
remained focused on delivering improvements in 
its supply chain and continued exploring potential 
new opportunities.

Our Australian safety business realised sales 
growth in its underlying business, benefitting 
from several new business wins in its direct to 
end user division. However, this was offset by a 
reduction in Covid-19 related product sales and 
customers reducing their inventory holdings 
in our redistribution division. Our emergency 
services business had a very strong finish to 
the year, securing several key government orders 
in the fire and rescue segment. 

In New Zealand, our MedTech and specialist 
healthcare businesses had strong results for the 
year as demand returned in the public health 
sector. Both businesses benefitted from improved 
supply chains and a strong portfolio of brands 
that are well supported in our specialist segments.

CASE STUDY: 

Q&A:

Safety – A consistent leader  
in the market
Bunzl’s safety businesses have own brand 
penetrations that are much higher than the 
Group’s average level, with most of our safety 
businesses having over 80% penetration. Our 
products span the full spectrum of both value 
and premium positioning, covering full head-to-
toe protection, as well as expanding into attractive 
adjacencies like asset protection.

Our own brand focused safety businesses occupy 
a position higher up in the value chain, as brand 
owners. We design products and own the 
intellectual property and licenses for leading 
proprietary fabrics. The manufacturing is then 
outsourced to third-party suppliers, on contracts 
which are highly flexible.

Our products and brands are known for their 
high levels of compliance, quality and reliability. 

Some of our brands include:

MCR Safety
PPE provider established over 50 years ago, 
currently offering over 5,000 SKUs

Tillman
Established 90 years ago. Exceptionally strong 
position in welding PPE, with over 1,000 SKUs

Kishigo
Over 50 years of experience specialising  
in top quality high visibility clothing 

Tingley
Established 1896, specialists in rubber 
footwear and clothing

Cleanline – Own brand focus to 
enhance our customer proposition
Cleanline is Bunzl’s own brand range of highly 
specialised workplace and industrial cleaning 
solutions sold throughout the UK & Ireland. Prior 
to 2019, the brand was viewed as a cost-effective 
alternative to third-party branded suppliers. 

Over the last five years, Bunzl has strategically 
focused on innovating the products and brands, 
such as Cleanline, across our own brand portfolio 
in order to compete more effectively across the 
entire value spectrum and thereby improve our 
overall proposition for customers.

Innovative SKUs  
developed

Amy McLauchlan, Exclusive Brand 
Manager, Bunzl UK & Ireland
Q. What have been the key factors 
in the successful growth of Cleanline 
during the last few years?

We noticed that the products Cleanline 
competes with are manufactured 
internationally, so they are not really tailored 
to the UK market. We were able to be more agile 
with our product development and focused on 
adapting and improving our existing products 
competing in this market, increasing their 
effectiveness and compliance. This ranged 
from bringing in innovations, such as adding 
QR codes to labels which linked users through 
to dedicated product microsites showing how to 
use our products safely, to switching 
manufacturers, allowing us to upgrade the 
performance and specifications of our products.

Q. How do you find and develop 
product innovations to maintain 
your competitive edge?

We rely on the expertise of our purchasing 
and sales managers to identify potential 
opportunities in the market for product 
development. They have close relationships 
with our customers, and understand the 
problems that they face, and we are able to 
use our deep network of suppliers to source 
and offer solutions.

Q. What role does sustainability 
play in continuing growth?

Increasingly, we are developing more 
sustainable solutions to incorporate into our 
offering. For example, we have introduced 
new concentrate ranges, which reduce waste 
from the packaging, transport, and storage 
of products. We have rich sources of customer 
and product data which we input into our 
sustainability calculators to show customers 
the impact of switching to a more sustainable 
solution. We are increasingly finding that when 
customers want to reduce their plastic waste, 
they come to us to find them a solution.

Healthcare

Safety

•  Healthcare declined in Rest of the World, 
driven by normalising Covid-19 related 
sales in Asia Pacific and continued 
deflation in Latin America, which offset 
growth in the other business areas

•  There was a slight decline in safety, 
with continued recovery in some 
business areas offset by normalising 
Covid-19 related sales. Infrastructure 
spend in North America is a potential 
medium term support

Cleaning  
& Hygiene

•  Continued recovery across most business 
areas, particularly in UK & Ireland and 
Rest of the World

Grocery2

•  Continued support from inflation in 

Continental Europe and UK & Ireland 

Foodservice •  Volume weakness in North America 

foodservice due to deflationary pressure 
increasing price competition, which 
alongside process changes to drive more 
own brand penetration, resulted in lower 
volumes. In addition, there was a reduction 
from post-pandemic normalisation trends. 
Partially offset by strong growth in UK &

Product cost driven selling price inflation
•  Remained supportive, but with a reducing 

benefit over the year 

•  Inflation in North America fully annualised in H2

•  Overall good tender outcomes from elevated 
activity in 2023, following reduced activity 
during the pandemic

Operating cost inflation
North America 
•  Moderating operating cost inflation driven

Route optimisation software in  
North America 
In 2023, we implemented improved route 
mapping software in our North American 
Distribution Division. The platform has improved 
route automation capabilities compared to our 
prior solution.

The platform fully automates daily routing 
to eliminate delivery miles, maximise product 
delivered per truck, and optimise the number 
of fleet trucks needed per day, resulting in cost 
savings and a reduction in both our own and 
our customers’ carbon footprints.

Additionally, use of the platform identified 
opportunities in some locations within our 
network to further optimise our delivery routes 
on a weekly basis by maximising daily route 
density. This required working in collaboration 
with our customers to reorganise and agree new 
delivery schedules, which have enabled us to 
achieve even further cost savings at these 
locations (including carbon reductions). Further 
implementations are ongoing in collaboration 
with customers for 2024.

Results achieved since implementation:
•  Average increase in cubic volume per route 6%

•  Average decrease in delivery cost as a % of 

sales in this area 0.4%

STRATEGY IN ACTION continued

Acquisition growth

We seek out businesses that 
satisfy key criteria, including 
having good financial returns, 
while at the same time providing 
opportunities to extract further 
value as part of the Bunzl Group.
Our strong track record of acquiring businesses 
continued in 2023 with our total committed 
spend of £468 million exceeding our average 
of c.£425 million committed spend over the last 
three years. The opportunity for growth is 
significant because: 

•  our fragmented markets offer consolidation 

opportunities;

•  strong potential for growth across our 

end markets;

•  our disciplined capital allocation and 

commitment to portfolio optimisation; and

•  our balance sheet is strong and we have 

significant financial headroom.

We continue to explore opportunities in new 
attractive end markets. Before entering into a 
new country we consider a number of different 
criteria, including a detailed analysis of our market 
sectors, the local macroeconomic indicators and 
the ease of doing business in, and the political 
risks and business practices.

STRATEGY IN ACTION continued

Rapid growth in Brazil with strong 
opportunities for further expansion
Brazil is one of the top 10 largest economies 
in the world, and is a highly attractive and 
fragmented market in which we see plenty 
of opportunities for both further organic and 
acquisition growth. Bunzl first entered this 
market in 2008 with the acquisition of Prot-Cap, 
since which we have completed a further 17 
acquisitions to build a business which generated 
c.£400 million revenue in 2023.

In 2023, we completed three new acquisitions in 
Brazil, adding a further c.£124 million annualised 
revenue which:

•  further consolidate fragmented markets; 

•  enhance our presence and geographic 

coverage in the Brazilian market; 

•  expand our own brand offering; and 

•  provide further synergy opportunities.

A distributor of surgical and medical devices and 
provider of value-added logistics services to 
health providers in Brazil, which, enhances Bunzl’s 
national presence and expand our product 
offering. In 2022, this higher margin business 
generated revenue of BRL 269 million 
(c.£42 million).

Q&A:
With Groveko’s Managing Director,  
Romke Romkes
Q. Can you give us an introduction to 
yourself and your company?

Groveko is an innovative and leading provider 
of cleaning & hygiene solutions based in the 
Netherlands. Alongside wholesale cleaning 
products, the company is also focused on 
innovative robotic and smart cleaning solutions. 
This focus on continuous innovation has fuelled 
the company’s growth in the last few years, with 
increasing demand for robotics and smart 
solutions that reduce the manual labour on 
heavy cleaning tasks like scrubbing and 
vacuuming. We also have a digital solution that 
helps optimise customer inventory and 
eliminates manual ordering. I joined Groveko 
in October 2017 initially as Finance Director and 
became the Managing Director three years later, 
before selling to Bunzl in August 2023.

Q. Why did you choose to sell  
to Bunzl in particular?

The cultural and strategic match between 
Groveko and Bunzl was very important. 
Bunzl offers international knowledge and 
support on sustainability, digital innovation 
and IT, and also provides cross selling 
opportunities and purchasing synergies, but 
they leave us with enough commercial freedom 
to keep the Groveko label and our team’s 
entrepreneurial spirit. 

Q. What are your plans for the future now 
that you are a part of Bunzl?

We are very focused on achieving profitable 
growth as part of Bunzl. In the short term this 
means focusing on achieving purchasing 
synergies and implementing cross selling 
opportunities with other Bunzl businesses, 
some of which have already started looking at 
our cleaning robots. We will also leverage the 
expertise within Bunzl to improve our operating 
model and we are already discussing specific 
potential acquisition targets. 

Digitalisation is also high on our radar and we 
are looking to increase the percentage of digital 
orders further. Being part of Bunzl is helping to 
provide a clear evolution in our processes and 
more structured approaches in many areas, 
such as health and safety, sustainability, IT and 
finance. This is helping us to grow the company 
in a sustainable way. On sustainability, we hope 
to become the front runner in our market, 
with knowledge of how to translate new laws 
and regulations into more sustainable 
commercial offers.

Safety First acquisition

Our first acquisition 
in Poland, one of two 
new countries 

In July, Bunzl signed an agreement to acquire 
Safety First, one of Poland’s largest distributors 
of Personal Protective Equipment products to 
a range of end markets. This is Bunzl’s anchor 
acquisition in Poland, achieving our first entry into 
the country, which has been a key target for 
expansion. Safety First generated PLN 121 million 
(c.£22 million) of revenue in 2022.

As a result of this acquisition, and the recently 
announced acquisition of Pamark Group, Bunzl's 
first in Finland, Bunzl now has operations in a total 
of 33 countries around the world. With many of 
our deals being sourced by local teams, each new 
market we enter opens up a wealth of new 
acquisition opportunities for Bunzl to further 
consolidate our fragmented markets.

The acquisition in Poland will provide us with 
access to a potential market of more than 
38 million people. Following this anchor 
acquisition, there are significant opportunities 
for Bunzl to grow in this market.

Bunzl’s specialist online business

Investing in fast growing, high margin 
specialist online distributors
Over the last few years, we have acquired a 
number of similar specialist digital businesses. 
Overall, they now account for around £260 million 
of annualised revenue, with a double digit margin. 

These businesses are operating in especially 
fragmented markets, which gives them great 
growth potential. They are focused on targeting 
smaller B2B customers, who require the expert 
advice and specialist customer support that they 
can provide. 

The digital specialists within these companies also 
contribute to the Group’s overall development of 
its digital capabilities, generating opportunities 
for synergies, and helping to accelerate the 
growth of our other businesses.

CASE STUDY: 

Acquisition integration training
During the year, a global team of experts from 
across the Group worked cross-collaboratively 
to share their experiences and best practices to 
create a training programme for ensuring the 
smooth onboarding of new acquisitions. The 
training has been rolled out across the Group, 
and has been used to help onboard recent 
acquisitions, such as Melbourne Cleaning 
Supplies (MCS) in Australia.

The training series is very comprehensive and 
has six modules, Culture & People, Finance, 
Procurement, Sales, Operations, and Information 
Technology, that cover core focus areas, tools, and 
best practices of acquisition integration. 

For example, the Culture & People module covers 
key points on managing changes in leadership 
and the importance of creating and delivering an 
effective communication strategy to engage with 
the new Bunzl team members. 

In the case of MCS, besides being used to 
welcome our new colleagues to the Group, there 
has also been a specific focus on identifying initial 
purchasing synergies, to ensure supply chain 
continuity and early cost saving opportunities 
were prioritised.

The Procurement training module leads the teams 
through how to create a combined team based 
approach to achieve the potential synergies which 
had been identified during the acquisition process. 
The training is designed to help the category 
teams collect and review data to understand the 
acquired company’s current supplier, product, and 
pricing information and how to negotiate terms 
and pricing improvements, keeping an eye out for 
both short term wins and longer term advantages.

The acquisition training 
has helped our team ensure 
that MCS has a smooth and 
successful transition into 
Bunzl. I especially liked the 
real life Case Studies used 
in the training to learn 
first hand from other 
Bunzl Leaders across 
the Group about their 
acquisition experiences.”

transition into Bunzl

Q&A:
Alastair McLaughlin, Managing 
Director, Bunzl Ireland

Q. Could you give us a bit of background 
to your role and how you joined Bunzl?

I joined our family hotel supply business, 
Thomas McLaughlin Ltd., in 1983 for a one-year 
project from university to computerise the 
business. I never returned to university! I 
continued to work with my father and brothers 
as we developed a successful and market 
leading business. Bunzl approached us and 
acquired the business in December 2002. I was 
appointed MD for Ireland in 2005. We have 
made six acquisitions and also achieved 
significant organic growth in Ireland since.

Q. What have you enjoyed most about 
your time at Bunzl? 

I enjoy working in a business of Bunzl’s scale 
and resources, however, the decentralised 
management structure has been key. Our local 
teams have grown successfully with the ability 
to tap into wider group knowledge and 
experiences as required.

Q. What has been the most useful lesson you 
have learned during your career at Bunzl?

Always provide great products and services, 
and employ great people to look after your 
customers. In turn those customers will 
remain loyal and continue to buy from us 
year after year.

Q. What have you been most proud  
of during your career with Bunzl?

Expansion of the Irish business – I now manage 
a business 12 times the size of our original family 
business, backed by the investment and 
development of the Bunzl infrastructure in 
Ireland. The continual development of our 
people and management teams throughout 
each of our five operating companies in Ireland 
has also been really fulfilling to see.

OUR PEOPLE

Investing in a diverse workforce 
is fundamental to our success 

At Bunzl we believe that motivated people create 
happy customers. In 2023 we have continued our 
work on monitoring employee engagement and 
developing our employees to ensure that they are 
able to fulfil their full potential 

Diana Breeze 
Director of Group  
Human Resources

Recognising the importance 
of employee voice is vital in 
facilitating prolonged and 
sustainable company growth. 
In 2023, we have continued to 
encourage an open, honest and 
transparent environment and 
believe that this helps us to make 
Bunzl a positive and productive 
workplace. Extending our use of 
the Great Place to Work survey 
has provided us with further data 
and insights into how it feels to 
work for Bunzl.” 

Following the successful pilot of the Great Place 
to Work survey in Continental Europe in 2022, 
we extended the survey to all regions. We 
surveyed 10,300 of our people, representing 
approximately 45% of our global population to 
give us a greater insight into their views on both 
what makes Bunzl a great place to work and how 
we can make improvements. 

We plan to use the insight from this survey along 
with those from our 2022 communication pulse 
survey, to determine our approach to effectively 
measuring and analysing employee voice 
going forward.

OUR PEOPLE continued

Great Place to Work Survey
The Great Place to Work survey is a recognised 
tool for assessing employee’s perception. The key 
principle of the survey is that it measures the level 
of trust that employees have in their company 
and its leadership. 

The survey measures 5 key pillars of trust: 

Credibility

Respect

Integrity, communication and 
competencies 

Support, collaboration and 
consideration

Pride

In your job, team and company 

Camaraderie Feeling of welcoming and 
belonging 

Fairness

Equality, impartiality  
& justice

Great Place to Work in action 
in Bunzl Continental Europe 

Following the first Great Place 
to Work survey in 2022, several 
initiatives and improvements 
were made which we believe 
helped the region further improve 
their scores in 2023. Some of the 
key initiatives and improvements 
are summarised here. 

Communications
•  Our digital tool Connect has become the 

essential tool for internal communications and 
training across the region.

•  The average monthly activity usage rate 
is 74% with 6,600 activated accounts 
across 15 countries.

•  It is used at regional level for communications, 

training and surveys and at local level for 
onboarding of new employees, sharing news, 
employee access to training academies and 
as a policy and benefits hub. 

Leadership Development 
•  Continuing to develop leaders and future 

leaders through programmes such as BCE 
Leadership Programme, Grow Together in 
Central and Eastern Europe, Bunzl France 
Academy and Bunzl University in Spain. 

Diversity, Equity & Inclusion 
•  Diversity, Equity & Inclusion training has been 
delivered to all Continental Europe employees. 

•  We have continued to run the successful Wings 
programme in Central & Eastern Europe. 46% 
of employees in this region are now female and 
the number of female leaders has increased to 
42% from 30% in 2022. In Romania, 60% of our 
leadership population is now female.

•  France and Spain have signed and committed 

to the European Commission’s Diversity 
Charter to raise awareness of discrimination 
and encourage diverse representation.

•  Bunzl France has teamed up with Nos Quartiers 

ont du Talent (“Our Neighbourhoods Have 
Talent”) to support young graduates from 
disadvantaged social backgrounds. The 
individuals benefit from mentorship, coaching 
and networking opportunities.

•  In France, Groupe Pierre le Goff have 

introduced a Disability Policy. They have 
held awareness sessions, assigned disability 
champions and introduced tools to monitor 
the implementation of the policy. They have 
also introduced some ‘Open Our Eyes’ sessions 
where prospective candidates are interviewed 
without CVs to ensure that recruitment is 
focused on their potential rather than past 
experience and have encouraged their 
employees to take time out of their work day 
to help with community projects, such as beach 
cleaning and distributing meals.

Our people are key to our 
success. Following the Great 
Place To Work survey in 2022, 
we initiated actions in all 
teams to further develop 
employee engagement, pride 
and belonging. We achieved 
our certificate in 2023 and can 
proudly say that 92% of our 
employees consider MultiLine 
as a great place to work.”

Developing talent across  
the world

For Bunzl to achieve its ambition 
to grow both organically and via 
acquisition, the approach to talent 
management needs to be both 
agile and strategic. We are 
constantly looking at the best ways 
of building the capabilities we need 
through the development of an 
effective employer brand, a 
proactive approach to recruitment 
and consistent investment in our 
own workforce. 

We recognise that the employees of the future have 
different expectations of their employer. For example 
they seek more flexibility in their working lives, 
ongoing opportunities to develop their skills, a truly 
inclusive culture and a clear sense of organisational 
purpose. With this in mind, and given our 
decentralised model, we have worked hard to 
articulate Bunzl as an exciting place to build a career 
and experience a customer focused, transparent and 
inclusive culture. 

We have also spent some time looking to the future 
and establishing the key capabilities which will 
underpin the delivery of Bunzl’s 2030 Vision. These 
include deeper expertise around sustainability, data 
analytics, customer insights and transformational 
change delivery. We are making major strides 
forward in all of these areas, supported by the 
creation of collaborative networks, specific 
recruitment campaigns and further investment 
in learning and development. 

Growing our capabilities for the future

Whilst there are some Global initiatives to build these capabilities, for example the creation of a 
Global Data forum to share knowledge and learning with over 500 Bunzl leaders, most are regional 
driven to fit their local situation and opportunities, some examples are: 

•  In Australasia new 

development products for 
sales leaders/managers 
have been introduced.

•  Targeted recruitment of 

graduates and early career 
employees to join and be 
developed as sales 
professionals.

•   The teams in the Nordics 

have been piloting new sales 
capability training.

•  Establishing a Project 
Management Office in 
Continental Europe to 
ensure consistent 
methodology is used.

•  Continental Europe 

have introduced a digital 
marketing bootcamp 
for all businesses.

•  The Young Talent 

•  Increased the network 

programme in Continental 
Europe established it’s 
third cohort, expanding the 
geographic reach across 
the region.

•  Early career recruitment 

and development schemes 
according to the needs of 
the division have been 
established in UK & Ireland 
region, including the Retail 
Management Academy.

of sustainability experts 
and ambassadors who 
work closely with our 
customers to help them 
achieve their targets.

•  Identification of individuals 
who are passionate about 
sustainability who want to 
support the subject 
alongside their existing role.

•  Development of training 
materials to engage the 
wider teams in their region.

Attracting and 
developing 
people in APAC

The team in our Asia Pacific 
region (APAC) are committed 
to attracting, retaining and 
upskilling employees through 
the actions they take at every 
stage of their career. 

The formal learning programs targeted at 
different groups of employees are Spark, Ignite, 
and Accelerate. These are coupled with a diverse 
array of learning offerings through the Grow With 
Bunzl digital learning platform, empowering 
employees to invest in their professional growth.

Building the We Believe employer brand used in 
engaging recruitment videos and creating a 
vibrant LinkedIn presence , the APAC region have 
had great success in a competitive recruitment 
market. The increased recognition of the business 
in the region has enabled direct recruitment to 
senior positions and reduced the reliance on third 
parties to source candidates. Most recently the 
Graduate programme has demonstrated their 
ability to attract high-potential talent. In 2023 the 
programme received nearly 500 applicants and all 
successful applicants have now moved from the 
programme to permanent roles within the region. 

Spark 

Supply Chain and 
Business qualification 
for Customer Service 
and Warehousing 
employees to kick 
start their career. 
All new employees 
complete this tailored 
programme ensuring 
they are set up 
for success.

Ignite 

Over 120 people have 
participated in face 
to face training for 
emerging leaders 
in Australia and 
New Zealand. This 
programme contains 
leadership theory and 
practical case study 
application.

Accelerate

60 senior leaders 
across the region have 
benefitted from this 
development 
programme. 
Accelerate prepares 
current leaders for the 
next step into General 
Management. It has 
a strong focus on 
delivering results and 
developing people.

CASE STUDY:
Scott Mayne – Journey at Bunzl

Scott found this 
development opportunity 
hugely beneficial for the 
transition he was making 
and has had the 
opportunity to apply the 
custom designed content 
to current opportunities 
and challenges.

In my first year as Managing 
Director of APAC the Senior 
Leadership Development 
Programme has provided 
me with a great opportunity 
to collaborate with other 
leaders from around the 
world. I will continue to 
benefit from this network 
and their experiences as we 
grow the APAC region.”

Scott Mayne was appointed 
in January 2023 to lead the 
APAC region in January, 
following an extensive 
selection process and a six 
month handover from Kim 
Hetherington. Kim, who had 
an impressive 33 years with 
Bunzl, continues to have 
oversight of the Global 
Sourcing operation and 
provides ongoing support 
to Scott and the region in an 
advisory capacity.

Scott’s career with Bunzl 
began in 2016 when he 
joined the business as the 
Regional General Manager 
of Bunzl Australia and New 
Zealand (BANZ) New South 
Wales and was promoted to 
MD Bunzl Safety two years 
later. Scott has benefited 
from the Group’s investment 
in development and 
completed the Senior 
Leadership Development 
Programme in 2023.

Taking advantage of sustainability mega-trends, 
we have focused on developing sustainable own 
brand ranges to help our customers with the shift 
to alternative packaging materials and the 
transition to a more circular economy. Our 
approach to finding these sustainable solutions:

•  We have designed various calculators to 
quantify the environmental benefit of 
transitioning from one product to another. 

•  We proactively work with customers to 
inform and educate them to support 
their transition towards more 
sustainable behaviours.

•  We work closely with our supply chain to 
phase out banned products and identify 
more sustainable alternatives that meet 
both new legislative requirements and 
customer needs.

CASE STUDY:
WorldStar Winner:  
Sustain OzHarvest Collection
Sustain’s OzHarvest Collection is a range of 
certified Australian compostable cups (made 
from FSC-certified wood-pulp paper) promoting 
sustainability through unique decoration and 
innovative production, which increases its 
recyclability potential. 

Collaborating with OzHarvest, Bunzl has donated 
the equivalent of two meals to Australians in need 
with every carton sold, providing a quantifiable 
achievement and purposeful product delivering 
real change.

>6,800

Meals since launch 

In today’s competitive landscape, differentiation 
is key, and our answer lies in the strategic 
development of our own brands. Gone are the 
days when Bunzl’s own brands merely competed 
on price alone; they now serve as a powerful 
avenue for us to offer higher quality goods and 
services, still at competitive prices. It is an 
opportunity for us to leverage our expertise 
to build market-focused solutions. 

In the European foodservice market for example, 
we saw our customers’ need for transparent 
advice in sustainable packaging and built Verive 
as the solution. We leverage our position in the 
supply chain, and we have the advantage of being 
material and solution agnostic, to be able to 
confidently advise our customers on a case by 
case basis on the optimal solution for them and 
the environment, whether this is one of our own 
brands or a product from one of our international 
branded supplier partners.

Creating our own brands means that we can 
offer our customers access to more affordable 
solutions in sustainability, while giving our 
operating companies the opportunity to drive 
organic sales growth. Owning our brands allows 
us to create enduring added value for customers, 
fostering strong relationships, resulting in long 
term loyalty. 

Having an own brand strategy is our commitment 
to building resilient brands that transcend 
economic volatilities. Bunzl’s unique position in 
the supply chain, coupled with our global 
knowledge on branding, marketing, legislation, 
sustainability, and supply chain, enables us to 
craft brands that not only serve our current 
customers better but also stand independently 
in the market, driving opportunities to capture 
new business. This strategic evolution is not just 
about products; it’s about future-proofing our 
strength in the supply chain.

CASE STUDY:
Reducing carbon footprint for 
Aramark in Spain
•  In Spain, Bunzl have partnered with Aramark 
to reduce the carbon footprint associated 
with delivering to their 2,400+ sites.

•  Bunzl’s proprietary Carbon Footprint 

calculator1 was used to analyse routes in 
detail to calculate and simulate the carbon 
footprint of product deliveries.

•  The data obtained identified opportunities 
to change ordering patterns to reduce the 
volume of small orders by 34%.

•  We have also implemented a custom 
Last Mile Innovation project so that 
deliveries to Aramark centres in 
Barcelona are zero emission.

James Pitcher 
Group Head of Sustainability

Despite the issues faced by our businesses, 
stakeholders and society this year, our focus and 
commitment to sustainability remains unchanged. 
It is firmly embedded in how we do business at 
Bunzl and our businesses have continued to 
reduce their impact on the environment, address 
social inequalities and drive the transition towards 
a more circular economy. 

Although our operating companies’ contributions 
to sustainability are individual and centred around 
the challenges their respective customers face 
(which in turn reflect the different sustainability 
opportunities and challenges present in their 
regions and markets), it is their collective efforts 
that help us to achieve our Group wide goals. 

They have played a crucial role in ensuring our 
near term science-based carbon reduction 
targets remain well ahead of plan, increasing the 
coverage of our industry-leading ethical auditing 
programme and driving the success of our 
sustainability value proposition; providing 
customers with the data, expertise and tailored 
product solutions they need to meet their targets.

As well as describing the progress we have made 
across our four key pillars, this sustainability 
report also gives examples of how our businesses 
are taking action (both in their own operations 
and with their customers) and introduces new 
aspects of our programme and focus areas for 
next year.

Double materiality
Reflecting how quickly the world around us can 
change and to prepare for future reporting 
legislation, we have repeated our materiality 
assessment first conducted in 2020 to ensure our 
activities continue to focus on the right areas and 
identify any emerging issues we need to consider.

This process was more comprehensive and 
complex than our first materiality assessment 
which focused only on one side of materiality; 
how our organisation impacted people and the 
environment. Our new approach, a double-
materiality assessment aligned with the European 
Sustainability Reporting Standards (‘ESRS’)1, goes 
beyond what is known as ‘impact materiality’ and 
also identifies how the different sustainability 
matters impact Bunzl’s business financially; 
known as ‘financial materiality’. 

During the assessment we sought insights on 
the potentially material impacts, risks and 
opportunities from stakeholders across our 
value chain, including our biggest suppliers of 
key commodities (e.g. paper & pulp, plastics 
and chemicals), large customers from across all 
of our business areas, key investors and internal 
stakeholders such as members of the Bunzl 
finance, procurement and sales teams.

The assessment demonstrated that the themes 
identified in our existing strategy remain key to 
our stakeholders, with climate change and our 
work to lead the transition to a more circular 
economy the top priorities. Our last assessment 
positioned the circular economy and action on 
single-use plastics as the single most important 
issue, but this has now been superseded by 
climate change with all stakeholders recognising 
the importance of the issue. The protection of 
workers in our value chain and the promotion 
of diversity, equity and inclusion across our 
organisation were also identified as important 
topics that will continue to be key focus areas for 
the Group. The order of this sustainability report 
follows the results of our materiality assessment, 
with our most important issue (climate change) 
covered first, followed by our other key topics. 

Double materiality methodology

Our approach consisted of four stages:

Assessment 
stage

1. Defining the boundaries 
and business context

Activities 
completed

•  Consideration of the 

actual and potential ESG 
impacts present across 
the entire value chain.

•  Both positive and 
negative impacts 
identified with 
consideration given to 
impacted stakeholders 
at each stage (even 
though Bunzl’s role is 
limited to connecting 
one with another).

•  Assessment has been 

designed in a 
disaggregated way to 
consider the impacts 
that might relate to 
individual geographies 
and market sectors.

2. Identification of 

3. Engagement with 

potentially material 
topics, impacts, risks 
and opportunities

relevant stakeholders

•  ESRS list of sustainability 
topics, sub-topics and 
sub-sub-topics used as 
a starting point for our 
assessment.

•  Gathered insights from 
suppliers, customers, 
investors and other 
key stakeholders across 
the Group.

•  This list was 

•  Assigned relevant 

sustainability topics 
to each stakeholder 
group and tailored the 
questions to match 
those who were 
expected to be impacted 
by a sustainability issue 
or were in a position to 
provide unique insight 
on a particular topic. 

supplemented with 
information from our 
previous materiality 
work, SASB standards, 
legal requirements, 
peer benchmarking 
and feedback from key 
stakeholders.

•  Final list of potentially 

material impacts 
developed and peer 
reviewed prior to 
engagement with 
stakeholders.

4. Determining materiality 
using a defined scoring 
methodology and 
thresholds

•  Developed a quantitative 
approach and scoring 
criteria, aligned to 
Bunzl’s risk assessment 
process, to determine 
whether an impact, risk 
or opportunity is 
material for Bunzl.

•  Impact materiality 
has been assessed 
based on two factors: 
severity and likelihood. 
Financial materiality has 
been assessed by 
reviewing potential 
magnitude of financial 
effects and likelihood.

Emerging topics

Supply chain emissions
Our suppliers, customers and investors all 
recognised that failing to take action on climate 
change within our supply chain would result in 
negative impacts to the local ecosystems and 
biodiversity in the regions we source products 
from. In extreme situations, this in turn could 
affect the availability of raw materials, thus 
impeding our ability to meet customer 
requirements.

We recognise that reducing our supply chain 
emissions is imperative to achieving our net 
zero goal and have set science-based targets, 
implemented a new software solution to 
effectively engage key suppliers and introduced 
new governance to support our work in this 
important area (see page 52 and 62 for more 
information). 

In 2024 we will be commissioning a supply chain 
risk assessment exercise to review the climate 
risks present in our sourcing regions in more 
detail (expanding the scope of our climate risk 
assessment work to date, see page 54 for more 
details) and to understand the other ESG risks 
we need to consider.

Bunzl Asia Pacific and its Australian-based 
operating companies actively participate in 
initiatives including creating employment 
opportunities and providing substantial support 
for the growth of businesses owned by First 
Nations. In our supply chain, we champion 
diversity and inclusion, fostering partnerships 
with Aboriginal and Torres Strait Islander 
businesses. Our RAP can be viewed here 

In the UK & Ireland, our stakeholders were keen 
for Bunzl to support social value through day to 
day business activities focused on the well-being 
of individuals and communities, social capital and 
the local environment. Employees at Bunzl 
Cleaning & Hygiene Solutions (‘BCHS’) in the UK 
took part in 142 days of volunteering in 2023 and 
supported initiatives like painting, redecorating 
and gardening for Emmaus Communities across 
the UK and sorting donations at Carlisle Food 
Bank and London Outreach, driving over £19,0001 
of social value. With social value becoming a more 
important issue in local Government tenders, two 
of our UK businesses have joined the Social Value 
Portal2 to help them measure, report and 
calculate the financial value of their social 
activities in a more effective and streamlined way.

Healthcare and PPE products
The provision of quality-assured Personal 
Protective Equipment ‘PPE’ and healthcare 
products that support the well-being and safety 
of end users emerged as a positive ESG impact 
for the business. As one of the world’s largest 
suppliers of PPE, our customers recognised the 
expertise and knowledge provided by our 
specialist safety businesses and also appreciated 
the role of our Global Supply Chain Solutions 
Team in respect to their PPE testing and 
inspection work.

Details of Bunzl’s Health & Safety performance 
can be found on page 217 in the ESG Appendix.

Regional impacts
Lastly, there were some regional impacts raised 
by our customers relating to the individual 
geographies in which we operate. These impacts 
are not material when aggregated at a central 
level but the following examples show how Bunzl 
have been working to address the points that 
were of interest to our regional stakeholders.

In Asia Pacific, customers were keen to 
understand how Bunzl is respecting, promoting 
and honouring Indigenous Peoples and their 
rights, cultural heritage and knowledge. Bunzl 
Asia Pacific is actively promoting reconciliation 
by developing an Innovate Reconciliation Action 
Plan ‘RAP’. This plan stands as a firm commitment 
to narrowing the gap between Indigenous and 
non-Indigenous people in Australia, through 
economic development and increased 
participation. Bunzl’s RAP is accredited by 
Reconciliation Australia, highlighting the 
Company’s dedication. The RAP offers 
assurance to customers eager to understand 
how Bunzl respects, promotes, and honours 
Indigenous Peoples, their rights, cultural 
heritage, and knowledge.

CASE STUDY:
Supporting the well-being of end 
users and the environment

Obex Medical in New Zealand supplies pumps 
to prevent Deep Vein Thrombosis (‘DVT’) 
during surgery and recovery. These are worn 
on patients’ legs and have air pumped into 
them to improve blood flow. Obex work closely 
with a New Zealand owned company, Medsalv, 
to arrange for the DVT Sleeves to be 
remanufactured after every use. The used 
sleeves are collected from hospitals by 
Medsalv who clean the garment, test for 
contamination and function before 
repackaging. The devices are packaged in large 
reusable storage bins further reducing 
packaging waste. This form of remanufacturing 
allows for the reuse of these medical devices 
and prevents them from being sent to landfill 
after only one use. Obex supplies both the 
remanufactured DVT Sleeves alongside new 
ones from the original manufacturer.

SUSTAINABILITY continued

We have identified 20 risks and opportunities that 
are important from a stakeholder and business 
perspective. All stakeholders reached consensus 
on 8 impacts (impacts 1 to 8) and these all relate 
to climate change and the circular economy. 
These can be considered our top priorities and 
we will continue to monitor these issues closely.

The risks with the highest financial materiality 
score (relating to climate change and the circular 
economy) align to those identified in our principal 
risks and uncertainties assessment (sustainability 
driven market changes and climate change risk). 
See page 68 for more details.

We know that our materiality assessment needs 
to be dynamic in order to reflect changes in the 
external world and our businesses. We will 
therefore monitor emerging topics and reporting 
legislation and repeat our assessments on a 
regular basis to take account of and be in 
alignment with these.

Taking action on climate change

Our roadmap to net zero
The severity, rate and unpredictability of extreme 
weather events have been increasing as a result 
of climate change and given the increased 
frequency and magnitude, it is forecast that the 
economic costs of extreme weather events could 
nearly double this decade1. 

The planet's glaciers and oceans have also 
experienced changes; our ice caps are melting, 
sea levels are rising and oceans are warming and 
becoming more acidic. All of these changes and 
extreme weather events can be attributed to 
anthropogenic global warming and as these 
become more pronounced in the coming 
decades, without concerted and ambitious 
action from companies and governments, they 
will present significant challenges to our society 
and our environment.

At Bunzl we know that our direct operations, 
distribution activities and supply chains are all 
part of the challenge and in addition to assessing 
the long term risks climate change presents to the 
business we have continued to deliver against our 
near term carbon reduction targets that were 
approved by the Science Based Targets initiative 
(‘SBTi’) in November 2022.

In October 2021 Bunzl joined the United Nations 
‘UN’ Race to Zero initiative and we committed to 
achieve net zero emissions, including scope 3, by 
2050 at the latest. As more companies set similar 
ambitions, we recognise that the importance of 
having tangible net zero transition plans that 
follow a robust, recognised methodology, include 
all sources of emissions and transparently report 
on progress is increasing.

We believe that long term net zero targets need 
to be aligned with climate science and as such we 
have followed the SBTi’s Net Zero Standard to 
develop our transition plan during 2023. As with 
our near term carbon reduction targets, we have 
submitted our net zero transition plan for 
approval with the SBTi. 

Achieving net zero represents an opportunity for 
Bunzl to build a more resilient business and our 
transition plan is a key part of our purpose-led 
strategy; to deliver essential business solutions 
around the world and create long term 
sustainable value for the benefit of all our 
stakeholders. Reaching net zero represents a 
significant challenge; we will not only need to 
assess and change our own operations but 
collaborate with hundreds of customers and 
suppliers to achieve the deep emissions 
reductions required to meet the goals of the 
UN Framework Convention on Climate Change 
(‘UNFCCC’) Paris Agreement. We will continue to 
leverage our position in the supply chain to drive 
change and use our influence where we can to 
bring other businesses on the journey.

weather-economic-cost-wef23/.

During 2023, the world has again witnessed 
real, observable changes in the climate with 
flooding, droughts and severe heat waves 
continuing to affect the ecosystems and 
communities least able to withstand them.

Emissions in scope
The baseline year for our net zero roadmap is 
2019 and we will report our progress against the 
total emissions from that year. We recalculate the 
emissions in the baseline year to take into account 
the impact associated with acquisitions and 
disposals after 2019. More detail on our scope 1, 
2 and 3 emissions can be found on pages 215 and 
216. All of our climate change targets (near term, 
long term and net zero) have been created by 
following SBTi criteria:

Near term:

27.5% 

reduction in absolute scope 1 and 2  
emissions by 2030

79% 

of suppliers by emissions will have  
science-based targets by 2027

Long term:

90% 

reduction in absolute scope 1,  
2 and 3 emissions by 20501

achieve net zero. Activities and projects relating 
to many of these levers are already underway and 
their respective impacts on emissions are shown 
in the table to the right.

Our immediate focus is to deliver our near term 
carbon reduction targets and continue to take 
action where we can now. In the short term, to 
remain aligned to our net zero transition plan, we 
will focus our efforts on two key decarbonisation 
levers; empowering change and efficient 
operations.

SUSTAINABILITY continued

We have a vast supply chain 
comprised of over 10,000 
suppliers with associated 
scope 3 emissions 
accounting for around 83% 
of our total emissions.”

A low carbon business and workforce
Our scope 1 and 2 carbon emissions in 2023, 
2022 and our baseline year (2019) are shown in 
the table to the right. We are well on track to meet 
our science-based reduction goals for 2030. 
Compared to 2019, our carbon efficiency has 
improved by 30% with absolute emissions 
reduced by 18%.

In 2023, our overall emissions reduced by 4% 
compared to 2022. This reduction was driven 
by a focus on operational efficiency which has 
decreased fuel consumption in our commercial 
vehicles and resulted in a 2% reduction of global 
emissions. Our natural gas consumption reduced 
by 10% which was primarily driven by a relatively 
mild winter. 

Our emissions associated with electricity 
consumption decreased by 4%. This was driven 
by energy efficiency improvements and increased 
procurement of renewable energy (from 17% to 
25%). This emission reduction was partially offset 
by a higher electricity consumption due to 
increased uptake of electric vehicles (particularly 
in UK & Ireland and Continental Europe) and an 
increase in the conversion factors that are 
applied to sites that are not yet procuring 
renewable energy. 

A summary of the progress we have made 
since our baseline year and the key initiatives 
carried out in 2023, are provided in the table 
on page 53. We also report on our climate 
change performance through our annual 
response to the Carbon Disclosure Project ‘CDP’. 
In 2023, we received a B rating for our response 
which represents an improvement on last year.

Our near term carbon roadmap activities
Our short term scope 1 and 2 roadmaps primarily 
focus on technology that is currently available, but 
we also actively trial new technologies across the 
Group to support our longer term carbon 
reduction targets. As suitable new technologies 
develop, we will revisit our roadmaps accordingly 
to ensure our activities remain ambitious. The

In late 2023, we communicated our requirement 
for key supply partners to set science-based 
targets. During 2024 we will onboard our key 
supply partners onto the Avetta One platform 
and issue our first climate change survey. This will 
be used to assess where our suppliers are on 
their decarbonisation journey and help prioritise 
our engagement with them. Once we understand 
the maturity levels in our supply chain, we will 
work to support suppliers who need more 
information, guidance, resources and tools as well 
as meeting our largest suppliers to discuss their 
plans, review their progress and identify 
opportunities to collaborate.

activities our business areas are working on to 
ensure we stay on track to achieve our scope 1 
and 2 science-based reduction goals in 2030.

Building a low carbon supplier network
The scope 3 emissions associated with the goods 
and services we supply account for around 83%  
of our total emissions. Reducing these emissions 
is imperative to achieving our net zero goal and 
we have launched a new engagement programme 
with our key supply partners2 supported by one 
of the largest Supply Chain Risk Management 
(‘SCRM’) platforms in the industry: Avetta One. 
This programme will allow us to assess where our 
key supply partners are on their carbon reduction 
journey, gather data and inform them of our 
policies, targets and other requirements. 

As we improve our ability to identify and measure 
emissions across our supply chain, the data 
disclosed by our suppliers will improve and we 
will be able to measure and report the reductions 
in carbon that their targets, activities and 
programmes achieve, enhancing the transparency 
of our future disclosures. Our supplier 
engagement programme will also support 
another decarbonisation lever, as better quality 
data on carbon can be used to advise customers 
on the climate impact of the products they source 
from Bunzl and incentivise the sale of lower 
carbon options. This will also help to mitigate 
a climate-related transitional risk that we have 
identified when assessing climate change 
scenarios and their impact on our business; 
‘shifting customer expectations’ (see page 213 
for more information).

Transition of small commercial vehicles to electric options is in progress with conversions completed at some companies 
in North America and UK & Ireland.

Conversion of our large commercial vehicles is still at an early stage. Range limitations and impacts on operational efficiency 
still represent challenges for the large-scale transition of vehicles. Trialling of zero emission vehicles (where applicable 
technology exists) is taking place across the Group.

Following a review of biofuel feasibility, we are planning additional transitions to Hydrotreated Vegetable Oil (‘HVO’) in 2024 
and 2025 in the UK & Ireland and Continental Europe.

SUSTAINABILITY continued

Reducing carbon emissions  
with efficient logistics
Commercial fleet accounts for 50% of Bunzl’s total 
operational emissions. Integrating carbon 
efficiency into our logistics operations is 
imperative for our business to remain competitive 
in a rapidly changing landscape. The 
decarbonisation of our fleet will help meet the 
expectations of our customers who are 
increasingly aware of and demanding more 
sustainable supply chains. Bunzl’s approach to 
consolidation has proven to be a vital tool when 
reducing our emissions. Initiatives to reduce our 
carbon emissions arising from our logistics 
operations include the use of intelligent transport 
management systems, route optimization 
programmes, and an increased proportion of 
modern, fuel-efficient vehicles.

In the UK & Ireland, Bunzl Catering Supplies (‘BCS’) 
have invested in a new integrated system of 
telematics software and dynamic routing 
planning. The telematics software provides an 
in-cab interactive experience for our drivers 
informing them about their performance on the 
road as well as useful information such as the 
emissions generated while idling or braking. 

The dynamic route planning system provides 
drivers with information on the most efficient 
drop-off schedules, leading to a reduction in road 
miles and carbon emissions.

Bunzl Australasia’s efforts to reduce electricity 
consumption at the Erskine Park distribution 
centre in Sydney represents a key milestone in 
their carbon reduction strategy. The project 
includes LED lighting upgrades, zoned heating, 
ventilation and cooling systems and rooftop 
solar panels. By collaborating with their landlord 
to promote an environmentally responsible 
partnership, the business not only successfully 
reduced electricity consumption and carbon 
emissions at the site but also solidified a strong 
commercial relationship. In the three years since 
the project commenced, electricity consumption 
and carbon emissions have reduced by over 65%. 
The project’s learnings are now being applied 
to other facilities in the region as part of 
Bunzl’s broader carbon reduction and 
sustainability efforts.

Assessing climate change scenarios 
and their impact on our business 
The Board, Executive Committee and every 
business area and business in Bunzl identify and 
document risks in a consistent way within the 
categories of strategic, operational, and financial 
risks. Our process for identifying and assessing 
risks on an ongoing basis is detailed on page 68. 
These include current and emerging climate-
related risks and opportunities and by doing so, 
we are ensuring that climate change is integrated 
into the Group’s overall risk management. 

Using climate scenarios to assess  
climate change risks 
We follow a four-step process and use climate 
change scenarios to assess the impacts that 
climate change may have on Bunzl.

1.  Evaluating risks and opportunities 

 Bunzl’s climate-related risks and opportunities 
were determined by an internal consultation 
process that involved a wide range of internal 
stakeholders across all regions and markets, 
previous assessments and desk-based 
research. Our Company operates 
internationally and the impact on our business 
varies significantly depending on the market 
sector and the geographic location of our 
businesses, supply chains and our customers. 
These impacts could be direct (e.g. 
expenditure, revenue, assets) and/or indirect 
(e.g. delay in delivery, drop in demand, 
disruption of supply chains). It was determined 
that climate change could impact Bunzl in the 
following four thematic areas: 

•  shifting customer expectations 

(transitional risk); 

•  environmental impacts of technology 

(transitional risk); 

•  adaptation to extreme weather (physical 

risk); and

•  changing market dynamics (transitional risk). 

We have considered the following time horizons: 

•  short term (to 2025); 

•  medium term (to 2030); and 

•  long term (to 2050). 

 More information on the identified risk and 
opportunities can be found in page 214 of the 
ESG appendix. 

2.  Selecting climate change scenarios

 The next step was to assess the impact of 
various climate change scenarios. We focused 
our assessment on three alternative climate 
scenarios up to 2050. The ‘orderly’ and 
‘disorderly’ scenarios align with global warming 
trajectories of 1.5ºC and 2ºC by 2100 
respectively but differ in the speed and extent 
of decarbonisation over the next 30 years. Our 
final scenario (‘hothouse world’) assessed the 
potential impacts of a world in which global 
warming exceeds 3ºC by 2100. Our scenarios 
broadly align with the environmental and 
economic conditions represented in the 
Network for Greening the Financial System 
(‘NGFS’) scenario framework (www.ngfs.net/ 
ngfs-scenarios-portal/explore) and more 
information can be found on page 213 of 
our ESG Appendix. 

3.  Evaluating the impact on our business

 We have applied the three climate change 
scenarios to our four key risk areas (shifting 
customer expectations, environmental 
impacts of technology, adaptation to extreme 
weather and changing market dynamics) to 
understand the impact each scenario could 
have on Bunzl’s business. We have then 
worked to calculate the financial impacts 
associated with the various scenarios. 

4.  Effectiveness of response measures 
 We will continue to evaluate (and when 
necessary accelerate) our existing response 
measures to ensure that our business 
continues to be resilient to the assessed risks 
and is able to capitalise on business 
opportunities that our response to climate 
change may offer.

SUSTAINABILITY continued

Climate-related potential  
business impacts
In order to assess the impact on our business 
we have considered a range of possible outcomes 
(best, mid, worst) across four key potential 
climate-related business impacts, under each of 
the three climate scenarios (Orderly, Disorderly 
and Hot House world). In line with last year and 
the views expressed by the NGFS we have used 
the following probabilities of the modelled 
scenarios; Orderly scenario: probable (greater 
than 50% probability), Disorderly scenario: 
possible (21 to 50% probability) and Hot House 
remains remote (less than 5% probability). 

We have considered climate risk across five key 
potential business impacts.

1.  Global GDP decline:

 As a GDP+ business, Bunzl’s revenue is to 
some extent correlated with the health and 
progress of the global economy. Economic 
damage from climate change could be 
caused by a number of outcomes, including 
shocks from extreme weather events, losses 
in agricultural productivity, temperature 
effects on labour productivity and human 
health, energy demands, and flows of tourism. 
All impacts are considered within our 
impact calculations.

2.  Fleet transition:

4.  Carbon pricing:

 Whilst the transition to low carbon vehicles 
has begun, the pace and breadth of change 
will depend upon the climate scenarios above. 
Consideration of the environment in which we 
may operate under each of the climate 
scenarios above and has been included in the 
financial impact assessment. It has led to the 
conclusion that we will be able to realise the 
opportunity to implement a fleet strategy that 
ensures a timely transition to alternative fuels 
at a cost that is comparable to the current 
cost, or that any increase in costs is market 
wide and therefore passed on to customers. 

3.   Not meeting emissions target expectations 

of large customers:
 The timing of required emissions reductions 
varies significantly between the Orderly, 
Disorderly and Hot House scenarios. Many 
businesses have committed to dramatically 
reduce carbon emissions by 2050 with some 
committing to net zero. Consideration has 
been given to the potential impact of Bunzl not 
being able to meet the required level of climate 
action expected by key customers, resulting in 
the loss of those customers. We have already 
established a science-based emissions target 
in line with an Orderly scenario and ongoingly 
assess whether Bunzl’s emissions trajectory 
meets customers’ ambitions. 

 Carbon pricing is a cost levied by governments 
to encourage polluters to reduce the amount 
of greenhouse gases they emit. Higher carbon 
prices may present challenges to Bunzl’s 
competitiveness and profit margins if costs 
cannot be passed on to customers. We have 
considered the carbon pricing developments 
under the various scenarios. 

5.  Extreme weather conditions:

 The business impact of extreme weather 
conditions is already included in our climate 
scenarios analysis model, as extreme weather 
is a driver of GDP decline and carbon pricing 
impacts within these scenarios. We monitor 
the impact of extreme weather on our direct 
operations separately to ensure we remain 
well prepared for worsening conditions in the 
future. We have considered the business 
impacts of extreme weather events, such as 
hurricanes, flooding and wildfires, in the 
business areas where these events occur most 
frequently (i.e. North America and Australasia). 

Given our assessment of the likelihood and 
magnitude of impacts under the various 
scenarios including the impact of carbon pricing 
and other macroeconomic impacts from climate 
change, we have concluded that climate change 
remains a principal risk for Bunzl (see page 76 for 
more information).

 Packaging refers to packaging and other products within the foodservice, grocery and retail sectors which are facing legislation or 
consumer pressure. We continue to exercise judgement to allocate the sales in 2023 to non-packaging products and the four 
packaging categories shown, which are taken at a point in time in the context of rapidly changing legislation and changes in product 
composition across a vast range of products. As a consequence, category adjustments are likely, and we have recognised one 
category adjustment this year that increases “products likely to transition” by £0.2bn, with a corresponding reduction in “packaging 
with an important purpose.” More information on our packaging categories, and limitations with respect to the product data and 
related disclosures, are set out in the ESG Appendix on page 212.

Our materiality assessment showed our 
customers in the foodservice, grocery and retail 
sectors are responding to these consumer-driven 
trends and are increasingly requesting products 
which are more recyclable, reusable and climate 
friendly. These customers trust Bunzl to provide 
them with expert advice relating to packaging 
trends and legislation, the data they need to 
report effectively and make informed decisions, 
and the solutions they need to meet their 
sustainability objectives.

Our assessment also demonstrated that there is 
an increasing demand from our customers to 
understand the carbon footprint of the products 
we supply and where appropriate use lifecycle 
assessments to assess alternative options and 
find lower carbon solutions. During 2024 we will 
be building on the success of our proprietary 
material footprint tools and developing new 
approaches to bring this information to 
customers in a simple way. 

Consumer demand for packaging and 
products made from alternative materials 
continues to drive our commitment to 
lead the transition to products and solutions 
that support a low carbon and more 
circular economy. 

85%

SUSTAINABILITY continued

Some of our businesses have already started 
working with customers to understand the wider 
environmental impact of the products we supply; 
we have performed lifecycle assessments for 
customers in the Netherlands and started to 
assess the carbon footprint of top selling SKUs 
with retail customers in the UK.

Supporting customers to transition to 
alternative products
Our businesses have continued to help transition 
customers to packaging products made from 
alternative materials and these solutions account 
for 55% of total packaging sales across the Group. 
The introduction of new single-use plastics 
legislation and customers’ efforts to meet their 
packaging targets are examples of drivers that 
have contributed to the proportion of alternative 
packaging sales.

The Group continues to have very limited 
exposure (2%) to single-use plastic consumables 
facing regulation where some volume reduction 
is expected and the proportion of total Group 
revenue attributable to non-packaging products 
or packaging made from alternative materials is 
high at 85%.

In the UK & Ireland our businesses have 
continued to develop a variety of innovative 
solutions to help customers reduce waste, 
minimise single-use plastic consumption and 
meet their sustainability goals. For example, Bunzl 
Retail Supplies have worked with the Co-op to 
introduce reusable cage shrouds in their stores 
which negate the need to wrap cages in single-use 
plastic stretch film. This initiative will save around 
180 tonnes single-use plastic each year and 
reduce the customer’s UK plastics tax liability.

Adding value with our own brand 
packaging
The unique feature of Bunzl’s value proposition is 
that we not only add value for customers through 
providing the data and expertise they need to 
make informed decisions, meet the requirements 
of legislation and achieve their targets, but can 
also provide the products and other solutions 
they need to make this a reality.

Our innovative own brand solutions are helping to 
deliver value for our customers while supporting 
them to meet their sustainability goals. With many 
of our customers facing a combination of 
inflationary pressures and stricter packaging 
restrictions and associated legislation, our 
extensive range of own brand solutions across 
the Group have helped them transition to 
alternative materials at competitive prices while 
not compromising on sustainability credentials or 
product quality.

Four features of our sustainable own brand products

Feature

In action

Responsibly sourced
All own brand suppliers must meet the 
same internationally recognised human 
rights standards that we expect of our 
own business and are supported by our 
industry-leading ethical auditing function.

In North America, our rPET EcoSystems items are 
manufactured in one of the world’s only vertically 
integrated facility produced from 100% post-consumer 
curbside collected PET. Made from Food and Drug 
Administration (‘FDA’) approved food grade material, 
the vertically integrated process significantly reduces 
the overall carbon footprint of the products when 
compared to virgin PET.

Future-proof
Our ranges are always designed with the 
latest legislation in mind and are fully 
compliant with both existing and 
forthcoming regulations. We also keep 
track of the latest trends and extend our 
ranges to account for these.

Our European own brand Verive have launched their 
first range of around 100 reusable packaging products 
to present Bunzl as a distributor of both disposable and 
reusable food packaging solutions. This range is listed 
in nine European countries. Verive’s reusables are 
being used across all Bunzl’s sectors: from production 
facilities such as Volvo in Belgium to leisure parks in 
the Netherlands.

Accessible information
Sustainability can often be an ambiguous, 
confusing, technical subject. Our own 
brands and expert sustainability teams 
are positioned to cut through any 
greenwashing and provide transparent, 
honest advice.

Exceptional quality
Our cost competitive options are 
rigorously quality checked before 
distribution and are designed to 
include the latest innovations in 
packaging sustainability.

Bunzl Safety & Lifting in Australia have been supporting 
a major mining customer’s mission to eliminate plastics 
from their supply chain with transparent information, a 
strategic approach and leading solutions. Our own 
brand Global Recycling Standard (‘GRS’) certified 
recycled-content polyester vests have clear recycling 
logos on the outer packaging and fully recyclable paper 
tags with cotton cord instead of plastic. On all other 
products the plastic garment bags have been 
completely removed or replaced with recyclable 
cardboard packing bands.

BEST Services, one of Canada’s leading janitorial and 
maintenance service providers, specialises in high-
traffic public facilities. BEST prides itself on its 
innovative approach and turned to Bunzl for a more 
cost-efficient, sustainable cleaning solution. We 
introduced our own brand REGARD chemistry line and 
converted c.600 cases of branded product. This line is 
opening many new opportunities by helping our 
customers achieve both sustainability and cost 
management objectives.

An estimated 28 million people are in forced 
labour conditions1 across the world and everyday 
more people are deceived, persuaded or pushed 
into highly exploitative situations that they  
are unable to refuse or leave. This is why Bunzl 
takes a proactive, direct and risk-based approach 
to ensure that our supply chain partners are 
complying with the high ethical standards 
demanded by our policies. We regularly review 
best practice to ensure that our controls are fit 
for purpose, refine our approach to address new 
issues and expand the coverage of our audit 
programme year on year.

In 2023, we increased the proportion of high risk 
spend covered by our assessment and auditing 
programme by 3% to 81%. We assessed 1,022 
suppliers and 956 of these had no critical issues. 
If our audits identify any zero tolerance issues (for 
example, instances of forced labour or overtime 
or wage violations) we work to resolve these 
quickly through in-depth engagement with the 
supplier. Of the suppliers undertaking remediation 
efforts to bring them up to the required standard, 
35 have completed their action plans to date with 
21 still in progress. If resolution is not possible 
within a reasonable time frame (usually six 
months) then we terminate the relationship. 

1.  www.unseenuk.org/about-modern-slavery/facts-and-figures/. 
2.  Includes freight, duties and FX related costs.

In 2023, we terminated relationships with 10 
suppliers who failed to make enough progress. 

Most of our suppliers are based in countries with 
lower levels of social risk, with a small proportion 
of procurement spend with suppliers in higher-
risk countries, such as China, India, Malaysia and 
Brazil. Over the last two years we have expanded 
our programme to assess suppliers in high risk 
countries outside of Asia and now also assess 
suppliers of high risk commodities who are based 
in lower risk sourcing countries. In addition to our 
Asia auditing programme in 2023, we performed 
77 audits across suppliers in these categories 
with one zero tolerance issue identified. Once our 
responsible sourcing programme has worked to 
reduce the highest risks to acceptable levels, we 
will move on to lower risk areas.

Our materiality assessment demonstrated that 
this issue is still important to our stakeholders 
and with more individuals migrating now than at 
any point in the last fifty years due to conflict, 
natural disasters or to simply seek employment, 
the risk of exploitation is increasing and the most 
vulnerable (women, children and migrants) will be 
disproportionally affected. To take account of our 
materiality findings and in recognition of this 
situation, we will work with an expert, 
independent body to re-assess our supply chain 
risks during 2024 before making any necessary 
improvements to our already strong programme. 

Bunzl has a zero tolerance policy to any 
unethical practices and is committed to 
respecting human rights across our own 
operations and in our supply chain.

Our responsible sourcing 
process in action
One of our recently acquired operating 
companies, Medcorp in Brazil followed our 
responsible sourcing process by identifying that a 
potential new supply partner was based in a high 
risk country and requesting our Global Supply 
Chain Solutions team to audit the supplier before 
commencing any trade with them. 

A simplified overview of the audit process is 
shown here. The supplier passed the audit and 
Medcorp commenced trading in 2023.

As part of our review process, after the audit, we 
contacted an agreed percentage of our audited 
suppliers to check the audit was conducted in a 
fair and professional manner. 

Additionally, several times a year, senior 
management will, unannounced, arrive to witness 
an audit, to ensure our professional standards are 
maintained.

1. Policy review
As soon as we arrive at a factory, we ensure both the supplier 
and our auditor sign our Anti Bribery & Corruption document 
prior to the audit taking place. We also review that the 
supplier has signed our Supplier Code of Conduct.

2. Factory tour
We then conduct a factory tour, gaining a good overview of 
the Quality Management and Employee Health, Safety & 
Environment Systems and to review some of our Social 
Accountability points, which are then covered further in both 
our employee interviews and document checks.

3. Employee interviews
We interview several employees, selected at random, as part 
of the Social Accountability section of our audit. We ask 
questions relating to their freedom of movement, salary, days 
and hours worked amongst other topics.

4. Document review
Lastly, we check a wide range of documents to ensure we fully 
understand a supplier’s policies & procedures and to check 
that they are being followed. This will include reviewing details 
like employees working hours, salaries paid, etc., and allows 
us to investigate any potential modern slavery issues.

CASE STUDY:
Forensic testing to enhance 
traceability
One of Bunzl’s Australian based businesses 
took part in a customer pilot, aiming to 
enhance traceability beyond traditional 
methods of labelling and certifications to 
provide material origin. In collaboration with 
a third party, the pilot used forensic testing 
technology to analyse organic trace elements 
in Bunzl-sourced products to determine the 
source origin. This innovative approach 
successfully identified the geographic origin 
of products, even when packaging or labelling 
was removed. The pilot focused on a product 
category typically sourced from known regions 
associated with a high risk of forced labour. 
The results of the testing were used to guide 
further investigation of the supply chain. 
Ongoing efforts involve Bunzl, their customer, 
and suppliers working collaboratively to 
co-design enhancements to existing risk 
management processes. Bunzl’s sustainability 
and sourcing teams in Australia continue 
to apply the lessons learned from the pilot, 
extending the benefits to various aspects 
of the business.

Investing in a diverse workforce

Established in the UK & Ireland in 2021, our 
Inspiring Women in Bunzl (‘IWIB’) programme 
focused on improving a common issue that 
faces many large organisations; the 
under-representation of women at a senior level. 
Over the last three years, other business areas in 
Bunzl have adopted their own IWIB programmes 
with Latin America holding their first annual 
conference in 2023 and our North American 
group doubling in size to include more than 100 
female leaders in the region. 

These programmes have started to deliver 
tangible results; in North America 36% of internal 
promotions in the leadership team were female in 
2023 (up from 33% in 2022 and 14% in 2021), and 
30% of our senior leadership team in the UK & 
Ireland are women. Results like these have 
combined to improve the proportion of women in 
Bunzl’s senior leadership1 population to 22% in 
2023, compared to 20%2 in 2022 and 16% in 2020. 

We have continued to build development 
initiatives, including mentoring, for all high 
potential women in leadership roles. In Latin 
America more than 70 individuals have now 
completed a new programme designed in 
partnership with the Catholic University of 
Chile to develop leadership skills in women 
we have identified as high potential and part 
of the succession plans for our senior 
management roles.

Further information on our employee diversity 
data can be found on page 219.

SUSTAINABILITY continued

Building a truly inclusive culture is the key 
ambition of our diversity, equity, inclusion and 
belonging work at Bunzl. This is essential; a 
diverse group of people from different 
backgrounds and cultures provides us with the 
healthy balance of voices and diversity of thought 
that we need. 

We believe that the creation of an inclusive culture 
is a leadership accountability and recognise that 
our leader’s actions will shape how that culture 
evolves over time. During 2023, we have 
continued to provide training to our most senior 
teams and completed inclusive leadership 
and unconscious bias training with these groups. 
We also expanded the coverage of our employee 
listening forums to provide a voice for under-
represented colleagues at all levels and get the 
feedback we need to ensure our programme 
continues to focus on the right areas.

Moving forwards, we will establish a consistent 
approach to the creation of similar listening 
groups in all regions and roll out a programme of 
reverse mentoring for all members of the Group 
leadership team. This will be supported by a 
drumbeat of internal communications on 
diversity-related themes, building on a higher 
frequency and quantity of internal 
communications seen across the Group in 2023.

activities and Great Place to Work survey results

CASE STUDY:
Our sustainability value 
proposition in action
Adding value for new customers
Our sustainability expertise and unique data 
and reporting capabilities are a real competitive 
advantage that we continue to build on. 

Our sustainability value proposition is helping 
Bunzl operating companies to win new business 
and in 2023, Bunzl Cleaning & Hygiene Supplies 
in the UK were awarded a new multi-year 
contract with a leading cleaning and security 
services business, Excellerate Services UK. They 
operate in over 500 locations in the UK and our 
national footprint means we are able to service 
them completely.

Our Sustainability offering was critical to 
winning the contract with four solutions in 
particular that were essential for our new 
customer:

1.  Carbon reporting.  

3.  Recycle Connect.  

Bunzl’s ability to deliver high quality data on 
the carbon impact of our services set us apart 
from the competition.

2.  Sustainable Product Award.  

This allows our customers to make informed 
decisions on the sustainability attributes of 
the products they buy and drives positive 
change through our supply chain.

A new initiative that provides customers with 
material recovery opportunities, ensuring 
that more of their cleaning & hygiene 
equipment is reused or recycled at the end 
of its useful life.

4.  Own and exclusive brand products.  

Bunzl own brand range Cleanline Eco enables 
compliance with current chemicals legislation 
in addition to providing a solution that 
contains environmentally friendly ingredients 
and is biodegradable.

Governance

Our sustainability governance structure

We have an established governance structure to oversee the delivery 
of our sustainability strategy and activities across the Bunzl Group. In 
2022 we established a new Board Sustainability Committee (‘BSC’) to 
allow for more detailed strategic consideration of the opportunities 
and risks presented by sustainability and to educate and supplement 
the work of the Board in this area. Further information on the BSC can 
be found in the BSC report on pages 110 to 111. 

The Supply Chain Committee is responsible for 
developing processes and procedures to assess 
opportunities and mitigate risks within our global 
supply chains, ensuring regulatory compliance as 
a minimum. In 2023 the Committee took 
responsibility for governing the work required to 
meet our scope 3 carbon reduction target and will 
regularly review the progress of our supplier 
engagement programme.

The Health & Safety Committee is responsible for 
assessing the key health and safety risks across 
Bunzl. They also develop, review and monitor 
appropriate policies, standards and regulations 
relating to health & safety management across 
the Group.

Our Group Sustainability Committee is a 
cross-functional leadership committee that 
engages the management teams and operating 
companies across our business areas and 
provides oversight and strategic guidance for our 
programme. Chaired by our CEO and attended by 
members of our Executive team, the Committee 
meets quarterly to ensure Bunzl has an ambitious 
sustainability strategy, which is subject to 
effective governance. It sets targets and monitors 
progress while providing support for our business 
area sustainability teams.

To recognise the importance of climate change as 
a principal risk to the Company and effectively 
govern the progress of our regional carbon 
roadmaps, a new Environment & Climate Change 
Committee was established in 2023. Like our 
other governance meetings (e.g. the Supply Chain 
Committee), the group met four times a year and 
was represented by all business areas. 

In 2023, the Environment & Climate Change 
Committee reviewed performance against our 
environmental objectives and tracked the 
progress of scope 1 and 2 emission reduction 
initiatives across the Group such as renewable 
energy procurement, alternative fuels and 
commercial vehicle transition.

SECTION 172 STATEMENT

Delivering long term sustainable 
value for all our stakeholders 

Proactively engaging with all our stakeholders is critical to our 
long term success. We encourage ongoing, open and honest 
dialogue all year to help us make better business decisions for 
the benefit of all our stakeholders.

Section 172
The Board of directors of Bunzl plc promotes the success  
of the Company for the benefit of its members as a whole,  
having sufficient regard to:

The likely consequences of any decision  
in the long term

The impact of the Company’s operations on the 
community and the environment

•  Our people: pages 34 to 39

Maintaining two-way relationships with our 
key stakeholder groups, which are identified 
on pages 65 to 67, enables us to understand their 
views and objectives. With this understanding, 
the Board is able to factor the potential impact 
of decisions on each stakeholder group into the 
Company’s strategic decision-making and 
consider their needs and interests in line with 
section 172 of the Companies Act 2006. 

Engagement with stakeholders takes place 
through a range of mechanisms, key examples 
of which are set out on the following pages. 
These mechanisms are kept under review and 
the Board is satisfied that they remained effective 
throughout 2023. 

Engagement is carried out primarily at operational 
level and is reported to the Board by senior 
management on a regular basis. Direct 
engagement by the Board takes place when 
appropriate and on pertinent matters. 

When considering stakeholders in its 
deliberations, there are occasions when the 
Board must weigh the competing interests 
of certain stakeholder groups against each other. 
In such cases, the Board always seeks to ensure 
that those impacted are treated fairly.

Customers

Relevance to strategy 
Customers are central to Bunzl’s purpose 
of providing essential business solutions 
around the world, and Bunzl’s strategy 
is formed to achieve this purpose while 
creating long term value for the benefit 
of stakeholders as a whole. A key tenet of 
our strategy is organic growth; expanding 
by developing our business with current 
customers and gaining new business with 
additional customers. 

Concerns and interests
•  Customised digital solutions

•  Sustainable product expertise, support 

and sourcing

•  Innovative product solutions

•  Competitive prices

•  On-time and in-full delivery 

•  Access to customer service and sales 

•  Enhanced operational efficiency 

How we engage
Our customer relationships are akin to 
partnerships. We maintain frequent two-way 
dialogue with customers to enhance our 
understanding of their business needs and 
ambitions, which enables us to provide them 
with a truly tailored service. By running 
dedicated innovation sessions with large 
customers, proactively seeking feedback and 
having discussions about customer insights 
at Board level, we are able to place the needs 
of customers at the heart of our business 
and adapt our strategy accordingly. 

Outcomes of engagement
Recent engagement has highlighted the 
importance of digital solutions to our 
customers. In response to this, we have 
continued to expand our digital capabilities 
throughout 2023 by investing in a number 
of fast growing, high margin specialist online 
distributors to provide expert advice and 
specialist support to our customers, see 
page 31. This digital focus has also informed 
the Board’s strategic agenda in relation to 
acquisitions and market expansion, which 
are outlined on page 13. 

Employees

Relevance to strategy 
Bunzl has 24,528 employees worldwide. 
Bunzl’s employees represent our biggest 
opportunity and are the focus of the 
business. Recruiting, retaining and 
developing the best talent is key to Bunzl’s 
strategy as it shapes our culture and ensures 
that every person pulls in the same direction 
to achieve Bunzl’s purpose.

How we engage
The Board carried out direct engagement 
with employees during 2023 through site 
visits, meetings with young talent groups and 
CEO and non-executive director listening 
sessions. In addition, indirect engagement 
took place through regular team briefings 
and Board consideration of our 2023 Great 
Place to Work Survey.

Concerns and interests
•  Fair remuneration 

•  Talent development and career 

progression 

•  A safe and inclusive working environment

•  Good communications

•  Sharing in the Company’s success

Shareholders

Relevance to strategy 
Maintaining shareholder support by building 
meaningful relationships is key to Bunzl’s 
strategy, as our shareholders influence 
the long term direction and governance 
framework of the Company. Frequent 
dialogue keeps the Company informed 
as to the concerns and interests of our 
investors and allows the Company to 
respond, grow and perform better.

Concerns and interests
•  Financial performance

•  Resilience

•  Environmental, social and 

governance matters 

•  Executive remuneration

•  Shareholder returns

•  Strategic priorities 

•  Leadership and succession planning

How we engage
Committee Chairs proactively seek 
engagement with major shareholders on 
pertinent matters within their responsibility 
and major shareholders are routinely invited 
to meet with the Chairman. To read more 
about direct engagement between the Board 
and shareholders see page 102. Bunzl 
engages in dialogue with major shareholders 
throughout the year at regular meetings and 
investor roadshows, the outcomes of which 
are reported to the Board. More broadly, 
Bunzl updates shareholders on trading 
performance six times a year, encourages 
attendance at the Annual General Meeting 
(‘AGM’) and, in June 2023, hosted an Insight 
Day in North America for investors and 
analysts, details of which can be found 
on page 102. 

Outcomes of engagement
The outcomes of all of our 2023 shareholder 
meetings were positive, with no specific 
matters of concern being raised. In addition, 
Bunzl gathered feedback from 22 investors 
who met with the Company following the 
announcement of its half-year results. The 
outcome of this was positive, with Bunzl 
obtaining a net confidence score of 89%. 

Suppliers

Relevance to strategy 
Building strong and trusted partnerships 
with suppliers is fundamental to our business 
model. Our suppliers are our partners, and 
collaboration enables Bunzl to maintain 
resilient supply chains, drive ambitious 
business solutions and provide customers 
access to products that meet their individual 
needs with the reassurance that they have 
been ethically sourced.

Concerns and interests
•  Ethical supply chains

•  Reliable partnerships

•  On-time payment

•  Mutual trust

•  Improving environmental impacts

How we engage
Engagement with suppliers takes place 
primarily at operational level, with 
management providing frequent updates 
on our supplier engagement programme 
to the Board Sustainability Committee, who 
subsequently reports to the Board. One area 
of focus in 2023 was engaging suppliers on 
the requirement to set science-based 
emissions targets by 2027. In addition, we 
operate a rigorous onboarding and audit 
operation in line with Bunzl’s Supplier 
Code of Conduct and compliance with this 
is monitored by our Global Supply Chain 
Solutions team. For more information on our 
responsible sourcing process, see page 218.

Outcomes of engagement
We are on track to achieve our scope 3 
emissions target and 79% of our suppliers 
will have science-based targets by 2027, 
aligned to the SBTi. To read about our work 
to build a low carbon supplier network, see 
page 52. Further outcomes of engagement 
with Bunzl’s suppliers and the results of 
supplier audits undertaken during the year 
can be found on page 209.

Environment and community

Relevance to strategy 
Sustainability is core to Bunzl’s strategy and 
long term success. Our culture of continuous 
improvement drives the determination to set 
and meet ambitious climate-related targets. 
Bunzl’s decentralised business relies on local 
suppliers, recruiting local talent and 
championing local businesses. Giving back to 
the community is core to Bunzl’s values and 
the Company participated in a range of 
community initiatives throughout the year.

Concerns and interests
•  Ambitious climate targets

•  Science-backed commitments

•  Clear roadmap to net zero

•  Ethical supply chains

•  Local support

•  Community investment

•  Cost of living crisis

•  Inclusive working practices

•  Employing local talent

•  Sourcing local products

How we engage
Supported by the Board Sustainability 
Committee, the Board defines the Company’s 
sustainability strategy and oversees its 
implementation by way of updates from 
management. The Company maintains 
dialogue with environmental agencies and 
educates customers, employees and 
suppliers on sustainable practices in line with 
best practice and local laws. To benefit the 
wider community, Bunzl supports the 
communities where our employees live and 
work and encourage fundraising activities 
which are championed by our businesses 
and their employees locally. More 
information detailing our charitable 
contributions during the year can be found 
on page 220. 

Outcomes of engagement
During 2023, we made good progress across 
our four core sustainability themes; taking 
action on climate change, providing tailored 
solutions, responsible supply chains and 
investing in a diverse workforce. To read 
more, see our non-financial Key Performance 
Indicators on page 41. Group wide, Bunzl

CASE STUDY:
EcoTools.nl

Decision
In 2023, the Board considered the acquisition 
of EcoTools.nl, a Netherlands based specialist 
online distributor of tool accessories and 
industrial consumables to customers across 
the Benelux region. 

Considerations
Potential acquisitions are scrutinised by the 
Board to ensure the Company is making 
disciplined investments within our key 
acquisition criteria, including businesses selling 
goods-not-for-resale to a fragmented customer 
base, with attractive financial returns and the 
opportunity to enhance our ‘own label’ 
offering. In deciding whether to approve the 
proposal, the Board also considered how the 
proposed acquisition would affect the 
Company’s key stakeholders, including:

•  Shareholders: the Board evaluated the 

impact of the acquisition on shareholder 
value including consideration of the 
Group’s capital allocation and the financial 
performance of Ecotools.nl. The Board 
also considered the portfolio optimisation 
of the Group recognising that Ecotools.nl 
complements other online-focused 
businesses within the Group’s portfolio 
and further strengthens the Group’s 
digital capabilities; 

•  Employees: the Board was mindful of 

cultural fit to maintain our high standards 
of responsible business conduct and to 
ensure alignment between the values 
of the management teams and people 
at EcoTools.nl and the Group;

•  Customers: the Board considered the 

consequences of the acquisition on our 
customers noting that the acquisition 
would increase the Group’s exposure to 
fast-growing, specialist online distributors 
which will enhance the experience of our 
customers and increase the efficiency 
of our business; and

•  Suppliers: the Board discussed the 

environmental, social and governance 
implications of the proposed acquisition 
and were cognisant of EcoTools.nl’s 
own-brand product range which is 
complementary to our 
sustainability agenda. 

Outcome 
After careful consideration of the above 
criteria, along with the results of our thorough 
due diligence, the Board concluded the 
acquisition of Ecotools.nl to be in the best long 
term commercial interest of the Company and 
for the benefit of stakeholders as a whole.

PRINCIPAL RISKS AND UNCERTAINTIES

A robust approach 
to risk management

Bunzl operates in six core market sectors in 
33 countries which exposes it to risks and 
uncertainties. The Group sees the management 
of risk, both positive and negative, as critical to 
achieving its strategic objectives.

Risk assessment

STEP 1:

Risk identification

•  Every business, business area, the Executive Committee and the 
Board consider, identify and document risks in a consistent way 
within the categories of strategic, operational and financial risks.

•  This includes current risks as well as emerging risks which also 

need to be assessed and carefully monitored.

STEP 2:

Inherent risk 
assessment

•  The inherent impact and probability of risks are evaluated before 

considering the effect of any mitigating activities:

•  impact is assessed based on a defined range of business 

continuity, health & safety, environmental, regulatory, reputational 
and financial criteria; and 

•  probability is assessed as remote, unlikely, possible or probable.

STEP 3:

•  The relevant mitigating activities and controls are evaluated for 

Risk response and 
residual risk 
assessment

each risk.

•  The residual risk is assessed assuming that the mitigating actions 

and internal controls operate as intended in an effective way.

•  If necessary, to bring the residual risk within Bunzl’s risk appetite, 

enhancements to risk mitigation activities and controls are 
considered until the residual risk is reduced to an acceptable level.

PRINCIPAL RISKS AND UNCERTAINTIES continued

Risk management process
To deliver the Group’s strategic objectives 
successfully, and provide value for 
shareholders and other stakeholders, it 
is critical that Bunzl maintains an effective 
process for the management of risk. The 
Company has a risk management policy 
which ensures that a consistent process is 
followed by every business and business area 
as well as the Executive Committee and 
ultimately the Board, firstly to assess and then 
subsequently to manage both current and 
emerging risks. These interrelated aspects 
of the Group’s risk management policy are 
explained below*. Additional details are also 
provided on the key risk management 
activities undertaken during 2023.

* 

 The ‘Risk management and internal control’ section of 
the Corporate governance report on pages 104 to 105 
includes further information on the specific procedures 
designed to identify, manage and mitigate risks which 
could have a material impact on the Group’s business, 
financial condition or results of operations and for 
monitoring the Company’s risk management and 
internal control systems.

Risk management

The Board

Establishes the nature and extent of risk the 
Group is willing to accept (its ‘risk appetite’) in 
pursuit of Bunzl’s strategic objectives.

Performs a robust assessment of the Group’s 
risks through a biannual review of the Group’s 
risk register, focusing on the evolving risk 
landscape, emerging risks and those risks 
considered to be significant by management 
and the Executive Committee.

Continuously monitors and oversees the 
Group’s risk management and internal 
controls processes and procedures.

The Audit Committee

Reviews the process for the management of risk, including the risk 
assessment and risk response, and its effectiveness.

Directs and oversees internal audit’s activities and reviews the results 
of assurance over controls and risk mitigation activities.

Executive Committee

Holds regular meetings with business area management to discuss 
strategic, operational and financial issues and ensures policies and 
procedures are in place to identify and manage the principal risks 
affecting each of the Group’s businesses. Business area management 
present risk assessments to the Executive Committee annually, 
focusing on the key risks in their region, processes they have in place 
to identify risk and any areas of heightened concern or any emerging 
risks for the future.

Considers the evolving risk landscape, including reviewing the results 
of the risk assessment process and assessing the sufficiency of risk 
mitigation activities for current risks as well as the threats and 
opportunities from emerging risks.

Business area management

Business management

The Group’s decentralised management structure allows for the 
establishment of clear ownership of risk identification and 
management at the business area level within the framework 
of Bunzl’s risk management policy.

Businesses, with the support of business area management, 
implement and monitor the effectiveness of controls, policies  
and procedures designed to manage risk.

PRINCIPAL RISKS AND UNCERTAINTIES continued

Principal risks and uncertainties
The Group operates in six core market sectors 
in 33 countries which exposes it to risks and 
uncertainties, many of which are not fully within 
the Group’s control. The risks summarised below 
represent the principal risks and uncertainties 
faced by the Group, being those which are 
material to the development, performance, 
position or future prospects of the Group, and 
the steps taken to mitigate such risks. However, 
these risks do not comprise all of the risks that 
the Group may face and accordingly this summary 
is not intended to be exhaustive.

In addition, the Group’s financial performance is 
partially dependent on general global economic 
conditions, the deterioration of which could have 
an adverse effect on the Group’s business and 
results of operations. Although this is not 
considered by the Board to be a specific principal 
risk in its own right, many of the risks referred to 
below could themselves be impacted by the 
economic environment prevailing in the Group’s 
markets from time to time. 

The risks are presented by category of risk 
(Strategic, Operational and Financial) and are not 
presented in order of probability or impact. The 
relevant component of the Group’s strategy that 
each risk impacts is also noted:

 Organic growth

 Acquisition growth

 Operating model improvements

 Sustainability

The nature and type of the principal risks 
and uncertainties affecting the Group are 
considered to be unchanged compared 
to the 2022 Annual Report.

Monitoring risks
The Board reviews each risk and assesses the 
gross impact, applying the hypothetical 
assumption that there are no mitigating controls 
in place, the net impact after mitigating controls 
and the probability to set the Group’s mitigation 
priorities. The register of principal risks and 
uncertainties was updated following review by the 
Executive Committee and approval by the Board. 

Emerging risks 
In addition to the principal risks faced by the 
Group, there are risks which are more uncertain 
in nature and difficult to assess or that have the 
potential to develop and increase in severity 
over time.

One such risk is that due to ongoing and new 
geopolitical conflicts arising in 2023, market 
shortages or other adverse events in the supply 
chain impacting the sourcing and delivery of our 
products emerged as a risk that may impact 
Bunzl’s operations. Failure to supply and deliver 
the required volumes could adversely impact 
revenue, profit, and customer relationships. 
Management will continue to monitor this risk 
and the impact on operations and any other 
uncertainties that may impact Bunzl’s operations. 

As part of the ongoing risk management 
processes, the Board closely monitors all 
emerging risks that have the potential to 
increase in significance and affect the 
performance of the Group and its ability to 
meet its strategic objectives.

Strategic risks

1. Competitive pressures 
Revenue and profits are 
reduced as the Group loses a 
customer or lowers prices due 
to competitive pressures

Risk owner:  
CEO and Business  
Area Heads

Change to risk level: 

Included in viability  
statement: Yes

•  The Group operates in highly competitive markets 
and faces price competition from international, 
national, regional and local companies in the 
countries and markets in which it operates.

•  Unforeseen changes in the competitive landscape 
could also occur, such as an existing competitor 
or new market entrant introducing disruptive 
technologies or changes in routes to market.

•  Customers, especially large or growing customers, 
could exert pressure on the Group’s selling prices, 
thereby reducing its margins, switch to a competitor 
or ultimately choose to deal directly with suppliers.

•  Any of these competitive pressures could lead to a 
loss of market share and a reduction in the Group’s 
revenue and profits.

2. Financial collapse of 
either a large customer 
and/or a significant 
number of small customers  
Revenue and profits are 
reduced as the Group loses 
customers

Risk owner:  
CEO and Business Area Heads

Change to risk level: 

Included in viability 
statement: Yes

•  An unexpected insolvency of either a large customer 

or a significant number of small customers, 
particularly within the retail and foodservice sectors, 
could lead to a sudden reduction in revenue and 
profits, including the cost of impairing any 
irrecoverable receivables balances, as well as 
operating margin erosion due to under-used 
capacity.

•  The Group’s revenue and profits may be affected as 

well as receivables and inventory (if customer specific 
inventory is held).

•  The Group’s geographic and market sector 

•  The Group’s large sales force connected with 

diversification allow it to withstand shifts in demand, 
while this global scale across many markets also 
enables the Group to provide the broadest possible 
range of customer specific solutions to suit their 
exacting needs.

•  The Group maintains high service levels and close 

contact with its customers to ensure that their needs 
are being met satisfactorily. This includes continuing 
to invest in e-commerce and digital platforms to 
enhance further its service offering to customers.

•  The Group maintains strong relationships with 

a variety of different suppliers, thereby enabling 
the Group to offer a broad range of products to 
its customers, including own brand products, in 
a consolidated one-stop-shop offering at 
competitive prices.

•  The Group monitors significant developments in 
relationships with key customers, including credit 
checks and limits set for each customer. 

•  Delegation of authority limits mean that there is 
oversight of all material customer contracts at 
business area and local level.

customers to help them understand the range 
of products available to meet their needs.

•  The Group continued to invest in technology 

to streamline customers’ experience.

•  The Group continued to develop its sustainable 

product assortment and tools to assist customers 
in meeting their sustainability goals.

•  In 2023, the Group did not encounter material 
insolvencies of either a large customer or a 
significant number of smaller customers. However, 
this remains a significant risk given the potential for 
global economic downturn.

•  In 2023, provisions relating to the Group’s 
credit exposure from customers remained 
broadly unchanged.

3. Product cost deflation 
Revenue and profits are 
reduced due to the Group’s 
need to pass on cost price 
reductions

Risk owner:  
CEO and Business  
Area Heads

Change to risk level: 

Included in viability 
statement: Yes

4. Cost inflation 
Profits are reduced due to the 
Group’s inability to pass on 
product or operating cost 
increases

Risk owner:  
CEO and Business Area Heads

Change to risk level: 

Included in viability 
statement: Yes

•  In the event of a reduction in the cost of products 
bought by the Group, due to suppliers passing on 
lower commodity prices (such as plastic or paper) 
or other price reductions, lower trade tariffs and/or 
foreign currency fluctuations, coupled with actions 
of competitors or customers, indexed or cost plus 
contracts may require the Group to pass on such 
cost reductions to customers, resulting in a 
reduction in the Group’s revenue and profits.

•  Operating profits may also be lower due to the 

above factors if operating costs are not reduced 
commensurate with the reduction in revenue.

•  The Group uses its considerable experience in 
sourcing and selling products to manage prices 
during periods of deflation in order to minimise 
the impact on profits.

•  Focus on the Group’s own brand products, together 
with the reinforcement of the Group’s service and 
product offering to customers, helps to minimise 
the impact of price deflation.

•  The Group continually looks at ways to improve 
productivity and implement other efficiency 
measures to manage and, where possible, reduce 
its operating costs.

•  In 2023, the Group experienced a higher level of 

price volatility compared to recent years. During the 
second half of 2023, the Group began experiencing 
product cost deflation, particularly in North America. 
The outlook for product costs, however, 
remains uncertain 

•  Significant or unexpected cost increases by 
suppliers, due to the pass through of higher 
commodity prices (such as plastic or paper) or other 
price increases, higher trade tariffs and/or foreign 
currency fluctuations, could adversely impact profits 
if the Group is unable to pass on such product cost 
increases to customers.

•  Operating profits may also be lower due to the above 

factors if selling prices are not increased 
commensurate with the increases in operating costs.

•  The Group sources its products from a number of 
different suppliers based in different countries so 
that it is not dependent on any one source of supply 
for any particular product, or overly exposed to a 
particular country changing trade tariffs, and can 
purchase products at the most competitive prices.

•  The majority of the Group’s transactions are 

carried out in the functional currencies of the 
Group’s operations, but for foreign currency 
transactions some forward purchasing of foreign 
currencies is used to reduce the impact of short 
term currency volatility.

•  The Group will, where possible, pass on price 
increases from its suppliers to its customers.

•  The Group continually looks at ways to improve 
productivity and implement other efficiency 
measures to manage and, where possible, reduce 
its operating costs.

•  The Group experienced significant product cost 

inflation in recent years. Selling prices to customers 
were continually evaluated and updated to ensure 
that profitability levels were at least maintained.

•  The Group’s ongoing focus on own brand product 

development was an important part of the 
discussion with customers about price increases.

•  Overall, the Group was very successful in passing 

on product cost inflation, which has eased 
considerably during 2023.

•  Inflation in operating costs remained elevated in 

2023, but has started to normalise during the year.

•  To mitigate the operating costs increases the 

Group drives efficiencies by consolidating facilities 
and implementing IT systems and solutions to 
improve productivity.

5. Inability to make further 
acquisitions 
Profit growth is reduced from 
the Group’s inability to acquire 
new companies

Risk owner:  
CEO and Business  
Area Heads

Change to risk level: 

Included in viability

Included in viability 
statement: Yes

•  Acquisitions are a key component of the Group’s 

growth strategy and one of the key sources of the 
Group’s competitive advantage, having announced 
214 acquisitions since 2004.

•  Insufficient acquisition opportunities, through a 

lack of availability of suitable companies to acquire 
or an unwillingness of business owners to sell 
their companies to Bunzl, could adversely impact 
future profit growth.

•  The Group maintains a large acquisition database 
which continues to grow with targets identified by 
managers of current Bunzl businesses, research 
undertaken by the Group’s dedicated and 
experienced in-house corporate development team 
and information received from banking and 
corporate finance contacts.

•  The Group has a strong track record of successfully 
making acquisitions. At the same time, the Group 
maintains a decentralised management structure 
which facilitates a strong entrepreneurial culture and 
encourages former owners to remain within the 
Group after acquisition, which in turn encourages 
other companies to consider selling to Bunzl.

•  The acquisition pipeline is closely monitored with 
continued research of any available opportunities 
for investment

•  During 2023, the Group’s committed acquisition 

spend was £468 million and the pipeline 
remains active

•  Inadequate pre-acquisition due diligence related to 
a target company and its market, or an economic 
decline shortly after an acquisition, could lead to the 
Group paying more for a company than its fair value.

•  The Group has established processes and 

procedures for detailed pre-acquisition due diligence 
related to acquisition targets and the post-
acquisition integration thereof.

•  Furthermore, the loss of key people or customers, 

exaggerated by inadequate post-acquisition 
integration of the business, could in turn result in 
underperformance of the acquired company 
compared to pre-acquisition expectations which 
could lead to lower profits as well as a need to 
record an impairment charge against any associated 
intangible assets.

•  The Group’s acquisition strategy is to focus on those 
businesses which operate in sectors where it has or 
can develop competitive advantage and which have 
good growth opportunities.

•  The Group endeavours to maximise the performance 

of its acquisitions through the recruitment and 
retention of high quality and appropriately 
incentivised management combined with effective 
strategic planning, investment in resources and 
infrastructure and regular reviews of performance 
by both business area and Group management.

•  The acquisition pipeline is reviewed by Exco, and for 
any new acquisitions that are proposed, the Board 
reviews the potential acquisition in detail

•  The CEO and CFO review the performance of all 

acquisitions with business area management teams 
on a quarterly basis.

•  Internal Audit reviews acquisitions within 12 to 18 

months of the sale.

•  The Board reviews performance of recent 

acquisitions annually. In 2023, the Board reviewed 
the principal acquisitions made in 2021 and noted 
that performance was in line with expectations.

•  New legislation introduced outside Europe and the 
UK in countries where Bunzl operates mirrors (and 
in some cases goes further than) the legislation 
previously introduced in Europe and the UK. The 
scope of new legislation tends to cover a wider range 
of products than that previously introduced. 
Legislation related to packaging still remains 
extremely fragmented across different regions.

•  Some legislation seeking to restrict the use of 

plastics has been challenged and overturned in 
court. However, it can be expected that the 
legislation will be reintroduced in some form and 
as such it is not anticipated that there will be a 
widespread removal of the legislative measures 
already in place across the Group.

•  Consumer sentiment and customer targets are likely 

to lead to a reduction in demand for single-use 
plastic-based products that the Group sells, whilst 
simultaneously increasing demand for renewable, 
recyclable, or reusable alternatives. 

•  The Group’s revenue and profits could be reduced 
if it is unable to offer packaging and products made 
from alternative materials that will replace products 
that cannot be sold due to legislation, or products 
where demand is lower due to changes in consumer 
preferences, for example a move to more 
reusable packaging. 

•  Bunzl is well positioned to support its customers 

•  The majority of the Group’s businesses in the retail, 

foodservice and grocery sectors now employ 
material footprint tools that explain how legislation 
will impact the products and packaging a customer 
uses, while promoting the alternatives we have in 
our ranges. 

•  In response to a larger number of customers setting 
increasingly ambitious targets for their packaging, 
the Group has continued to strengthen its expert 
sustainability teams who train customers on 
incoming legislation, hold customer forums where 
they showcase the latest products and support 
customers to report effectively against their goals 
and participation in industry-leading external 
schemes such as the New Plastics Economy and 
B-Corp certification. 

•  The Group continued to expand and introduced 
new ranges of own brand products made from 
alternative materials. 

with the legislative complexity thanks to its material 
agnostic position and network strength that allowing 
it to deliver the right products across large multi-site 
customer operations.

•  Bunzl’s scale and unique position at the centre of the 

supply chain, supported by expert sustainability 
managers, gives the Group an opportunity to provide 
customers with advice about alternative products 
which are recyclable, compostable, biodegradable 
or reusable.

•  The Group has access to an extensive supply chain 
of product and packaging manufacturers who are 
innovating the range of products they produce to 
satisfy the increased focus on sustainability. This 
means the Group can offer the broadest possible 
range of products whether in response to legislative 
changes, consumer preference driven changes or 
a desire to offer market-leading products to the 
Group’s customers.

•  The Group has access to the proprietary data on 
the packaging and products our customers need. 
That coupled with the Group’s detailed product 
knowledge and data on customer product usage, 
ensures that the Group is well-positioned to be able 
to support its customers in shaping and achieving 
their sustainability strategies.

•  The frequency, sophistication and impact of 

•  Concurrent with the Group’s IT investments, the 

cyber-attacks on businesses are rising at the same 
time as Bunzl is increasing its connectivity with third 
parties and its digital footprint through acquisition 
and investment in e-commerce platforms and 
efficiency enhancing IT systems.

•  Weak cyber defences, both now and in the future, 
through a failure to keep up with increasing cyber 
risks and insufficient IT disaster recovery planning 
and testing, could increase the likelihood and 
severity of a cyber-attack leading to business 
disruption, reputational damage and loss of 
customers and/or a fine under applicable data 
protection legislation.

Group is continuing to improve information security 
policies and controls to improve its ability to monitor, 
prevent, detect and respond to cyber threats.

•  The Group continued to improve cyber security and 
data privacy governance, architecture, and controls, 
along with increasing awareness of both cyber 
security and data privacy across the Group.

•  Cyber security awareness campaigns have been 

deployed across all regions to enhance the 
knowledge of Bunzl personnel and their resilience to 
phishing attacks.

•  Investments were made in modern cyber security 
technologies that address current and emerging 
threats while improving operational processes 
and procedures.

•  IT disaster recovery and incident management plans, 
which would be implemented in the event of any 
such failure, are in place and periodically tested. 
The Group Chief Information Officer and Chief 
Information Security Officer coordinate activity in 
this area.

•  The Group focused on improving cyber security 

and data privacy due diligence processes during the 
acquisition process, along with improving security 
posture for acquired companies.

•  Insufficient liquidity in financial markets could lead to 
banks and institutions being unwilling to lend to the 
Group, resulting in the Group being unable to obtain 
necessary funds when required to repay maturing 
borrowings, thereby reducing the cash available to 
meet its trading obligations, make acquisitions and 
pay dividends.

•  The Group arranges a mixture of borrowings from 

•  The availability of funding to the Group 

different sources and continually monitors net debt

that sufficient facilities are in place to meet the 
Group’s requirements in the short, medium and 
long term.

remains strong. 

•  During 2023, £365m of bank facilities were signed 
with maturities between 2026 to 2028. The Group 
expects to extend and finance additional bank 
facilities during 2024. There is £130m of debt 
maturing in the next 12 months which can be repaid 
from free cash flow. The Group maintains a BBB+ 
rating from S&P and therefore access to the 
Eurobond public market.

•  The majority of the Group’s revenue and profits are 

earned in currencies other than sterling, the Group’s 
presentation currency.

•  As a result, a significant strengthening of sterling 

against the US dollar and the euro in particular could 
have a material translation impact on the Group’s 
reported results and/or lead to a breach of net debt 
to EBITDA banking covenants.

•  In 2023, currency translation had a small positive 

impact on the Group’s reported profits, increasing 
the reported profit growth rates by between 0% 
and 3%. 

•  The Group’s results are reviewed at constant 

exchange rates to show the underlying 
performance of the Group excluding the currency 
translation impact. 

•  The Group does not hedge the impact of exchange 
rate movements arising on translation of earnings 
into sterling at average exchange rates. The Board 
believes that the benefits of its geographical spread 
outweigh the risks.

•  The Group’s borrowings are denominated in US 

dollars, sterling and euros in similar proportions to 
the relative profit contribution of each of these 
currencies to the Group’s EBITDA. This reduces the 
volatility of the ratio of net debt to EBITDA from 
foreign exchange movements. In addition, net debt 
for the purposes of covenant calculations in the 
Group’s financing documents is calculated using 
average rather than closing exchange rates. 
Consequently, any significant movement in exchange 
rates towards the end of an accounting period 
should not materially affect the ratio of net debt to 
EBITDA. Both these factors minimise the risk that 
banking covenants will be breached as a result of 
foreign currency fluctuations.

VIABILITY STATEMENT

Assessment of the prospects of the 
Company and its viability statement
In accordance with provision 31 of the Corporate 
Governance Code, the directors set out below 
how they have assessed the prospects of the 
Company, over what period the prospects have 
been assessed and the Company’s formal 
viability statement.

The context for and period over which 
the prospects of the Company have 
been assessed
To consider the prospects of the Company and 
determine an appropriate time frame for the 
purpose of making a statement on the Company’s 
longer term viability, the directors have taken into 
account various factors including the nature of 
the Company’s business, its business model and 
strategy and the existing planning periods.

In particular:

•  Bunzl has a geographically balanced and 

diversified business portfolio operating in more 
than 33 countries;

•  the Company operates across six core, 

fragmented market sectors, many of which are 
growing and resilient to challenging economic 
conditions; and

•  the business model and strategy minimise the 
volatility of the Company’s results, enabling 
Bunzl to deliver consistently good results with 
high returns on capital and cash conversion.

With regard to the time frame specifically, the 
directors considered the above factors as well 
as the Group’s strategic planning process. 
Comprehensive budgets are prepared annually 
by the business areas and approved by the Board. 
Strategic plans focusing on two years beyond the 
forecast for the current year are also prepared 
annually and reviewed by the Board. While the 
directors have no reason to believe the Company 
will not be viable over a longer period, given the 
inherent uncertainty involved, the period over 
which the directors consider it possible to form 
a reasonable expectation as to the Group’s 
longer-term viability is the three year period to 
31 December 2026.

How the prospects of the Company 
and its longer term viability have 
been assessed
In making a viability statement, the directors are 
required to consider the Company’s ability to 
meet its liabilities as they fall due, taking into 
account the Company’s current position and 
principal risks. The Company has significant 
financial resources including committed and 
uncommitted banking facilities, US private 
placement notes and senior bonds, further details 
of which are set out in Note 18 to the consolidated 
financial statements. As a result, the directors 
believe that the Company is well placed to 
manage its business risks successfully.

The resilience of the Group to a range of possible 
scenarios, in particular the impact on key financial 
ratios and its ongoing compliance with financial 
covenants, was factored into the directors’ 
considerations through stress testing current 
financial projections. These stress tests included 
the following:

•  the impact of the crystallisation of the principal 
strategic and operational risks to the Group’s 
organic growth resulting in a 25% reduction in 
adjusted operating profit and a 20% increase 
in working capital; and

•  the impact of the crystallisation of the principal 
strategic and operational risks to the Group’s 
organic growth as above, together with the 
impact of the crystallisation of the principal 
risks to the Group’s acquisition growth, without 
mitigating actions.

In addition, the Group has carried out reverse 
stress tests against the base case financial 
projections to determine the conditions that 
would result in a breach of financial covenants. 
In order for a breach of covenants to occur during 
the three year assessment period the Group 
would need to experience a reduction in EBITDA 
of over 60% compared to the base case or an 
increase in net debt of over 340% .

In all scenarios it has been assumed, based on 
past experience and all current indicators, that 
the Company will be able to refinance its banking 
facilities and US private placement notes as and 
when they mature. In the first two stress tests it 
was found that the Group was resilient and in 
particular it remained in compliance with the 
relevant financial covenants. The conditions 
required to create the reverse stress test scenario 
were so severe that they were considered to 
be implausible.

The directors consider that the stress testing 
based assessment of the Company’s prospects, 
building on the results of the robust assessment 
of the principal risks to the business and the 
financial implications of them materialising, 
confirms the resilience of the Group to severe 
but plausible scenarios and provides 
a reasonable basis on which to conclude on 
its longer term viability.

Confirmation of longer term viability
In accordance with the provisions of the 
Corporate Governance Code, the directors have 
taken account of the Group’s current position and 
principal risks and uncertainties referred to above 
in assessing the prospects of the Company and 
they have a reasonable expectation that the 
Company will be able to continue in operation and 
meet its liabilities as they fall due over the three 
year period to 31 December 2026.

Currency translation
Currency translation has had a positive impact on the Group’s reported profits, increasing the reported 
profit growth rates by between 0% and 3%. This positive exchange impact to profit is primarily due to 
the weakening of sterling against the euro and Brazilian real, partly offset by the strengthening of 
sterling against the Australian dollar and Canadian dollar. The US dollar average exchange rate 
remained in line with last year.

Revenue
Revenue decreased to £11,797.1 million (2022: £12,039.5 million), a decrease of 1.9% at constant 
exchange rates and 2.0% at actual exchange rates, due to underlying decline of 2.9% and impact from 
the disposal of the UK Healthcare business at the end of 2022 reducing revenue by 1.5% partly offset 
by acquisitions adding 2.5%. The underlying decline was impacted by a decline in Covid-19 related sales, 
which are now broadly in line with 2019 levels, volume loss in North America foodservice sector driven 
by increased price related competitive pressure and post-pandemic normalisation trends, as well as 
a reducing benefit from inflation. Furthermore, volumes were impacted by planned strategic actions 
in the North America retail business to focus on more profitable customers and the decision to 
transition ownership of customer specific packaging to certain customers, as well as some volume 
weakness in Continental Europe and UK & Ireland.

Operating profit
Adjusted operating profit was £944.2 million (2022: £885.9 million), an increase of 6.2% at constant 
exchange rates and 6.6% at actual exchange rates. At both constant and actual exchange rates 
operating margin increased to 8.0% from 7.4% in 2022. The operating margin of 8.0% was supported by 
good margin management, including increasing penetration of own brands, higher margin acquisitions 
made, operational efficiencies and inventory driven one-off benefits in the second half of 2023.

During 2023, the Group has seen a net utilisation of approximately £25 million in trade receivables and 
slow moving inventory provisions. Usage of these provisions, including some releases to profit, 
exceeded net charges to increase the provisions. In addition, the Group has seen some utilisation of 
the residual provisions set up in prior years as a result of market price movements on certain Covid-19 
products; the remaining market price risk on these products is no longer significant.

Customer relationships, brands and technology amortisation and acquisition related items are 
excluded from the calculation of adjusted operating profit as they do not relate to the trading 
performance of the business. Accordingly, these items are not taken into account by management when 
assessing the results of the business and are removed in calculating adjusted operating profit and other 
alternative performance measures by which management assess the performance of the Group.

Net finance expense
The net finance expense for the year was £90.5 million, an increase of £27.2 million at constant 
exchange rates (up £22.6 million at actual exchange rates), mainly due to increases in interest rates and 
fair value movements on interest rate derivatives, partly offset by lower average debt during the year.

Profit before income tax
Adjusted profit before income tax was £853.7 million (2022: £818.0 million), up 3.4% at constant 
exchange rates (up 4.4% at actual exchange rates), due to the growth in adjusted operating profit partly 
offset by the increase in net finance expense. Profit before income tax was £698.6 million (2022: 
£634.6 million), an increase of 7.8% at constant exchange rates (up 10.1% at actual exchange rates). 

Taxation 
The Group’s tax strategy is to comply with tax laws in all countries in which it operates and to balance its 
responsibilities for controlling the tax costs with its responsibilities to pay the appropriate level of tax 
where it does business. No companies are established in tax havens or other countries for tax purposes 
where the Group does not have an operational presence and the Group’s de-centralised operational 
structure means that the level of intragroup trading transactions is very low. The Group does not use 
intragroup transfer prices to shift profit into low tax jurisdictions. The Group’s tax strategy has been 
approved by the Board and tax risks are reviewed by the Audit Committee. In accordance with UK 
legislation, the strategy is published on the Bunzl plc website within the Corporate governance section.

The effective tax rate (being the tax rate on adjusted profit before income tax) for the year was 
25.0% (2022: 24.6%) and the reported tax rate on statutory profit was 24.7% (2022: 25.2%). The 
effective tax rate for 2023 is higher than for 2022 primarily due to the increase in the UK statutory 
tax rate from 19% to 25% from April 2023. The Group’s effective tax rate is expected to increase 
to be around 26% in 2024.

The Group is within the scope of the OECD Pillar Two model rules which take effect from 1 January 
2024. Most countries in which the Group operates are expected to report an effective tax rate in excess 
of 15% and therefore to qualify for a safe harbour exemption such that no top-up tax should apply. In 
countries where this is not the case there is the potential for Pillar Two taxes to apply, but these are not 
expected to be material. 

Earnings per share 
Profit after tax increased to £526.2 million (2022: £474.4 million), up 8.2% and an increase of £40.1 million 
at constant exchange rates (up 10.9% at actual exchange rates), due to a £50.3 million increase in profit 
before income tax, partly offset by a £10.2 million increase in the tax charge at constant exchange rates. 
Profit after tax for the year bears an £11.0 million adverse impact from hyperinflation accounting 
adjustments (2022: £21.2 million adverse impact and a £13.0 million hyperinflation accounting related 
impairment charge to the customer relationships assets in the Group’s businesses in Turkey partly offset 
by a tax credit of £2.5 million related to the impairment charge). 

Adjusted profit after tax was £640.3 million (2022: £616.8 million), up 2.8% and an increase of 
£17.6 million at constant exchange rates (up 3.8% at actual exchange rates), due to a £27.9 million 
increase in adjusted profit before income tax, partly offset by a £10.3 million increase in the tax 
on adjusted profit before income tax at constant exchange rates. Adjusted profit before income 
tax for the year bears an £11.0 million adverse impact from hyperinflation accounting adjustments 
(2022: £19.4 million adverse impact).

The weighted average number of shares in issue increased to 335.0 million from 334.7 million in 
2022 due to employee share option exercises partly offset by share purchases into the employee 
benefit trust.

The Company’s practice is to pay a progressive dividend, delivering year-on-year increases. The Board 
is proposing a 2023 final dividend of 50.1p, an increase of 10.4% on the amount paid in relation to the 
2022 final dividend. The 2023 total dividend of 68.3p is 8.9% higher than the 2022 total dividend.

Before approving any dividends, the Board considers the level of borrowings of the Group by reference 
to the ratio of net debt to EBITDA, the ability of the Group to continue to generate cash and the amount 
required to invest in the business, in particular into future acquisitions. The Group’s long term track 
record of strong cash generation, coupled with the Group’s substantial borrowing facilities, provides 
the Company with the financial flexibility to fund a growing dividend. After the further growth in 2023, 
Bunzl has sustained 31 years of consecutive annual dividend growth to shareholders.

The risks and constraints to maintaining a growing dividend are principally those linked to the 
Group’s trading performance and liquidity, as described in the Principal risks and uncertainties on 
pages 68 to 76. The Group has substantial distributable reserves within Bunzl plc and there is a robust 
process of distributing profits generated by subsidiary undertakings up through the Group to Bunzl plc. 
At 31 December 2023 Bunzl plc had sufficient distributable reserves to cover more than six years of 
dividends at the levels of those delivered in 2023, which is expected to be approximately £230 million.

Acquisitions
The Group completed 20 acquisitions during the year ended 31 December 2023 with a total committed 
spend of £470.3 million. Excluding the acquisition of GRC, which was agreed in 2022 but completed on 
1 January 2023, total committed spend on acquisitions agreed and completed during the year was 
£467.5 million. The estimated annualised revenue and adjusted operating profit of the acquisitions 
agreed during the year were £325 million and £51 million, respectively.

The Group’s free cash flow of £643.5 million was £62.2 million lower than in 2022, primarily due to the 
decrease in operating cash flow of £39.7million, a £15.0 million higher cash outflow relating to tax, and 
an increase in net interest paid excluding interest on lease liabilities of £7.5 million. The Group’s free 
cash flow was used to finance an acquisition cash outflow of £374.6 million (2022: £264.2 million), 
dividend payments of £209.7 million in respect of 2022 (2022: £190.5 million in respect of 2021) and net 
payments of £23.7 million (2022: net payments of £31.9 million) relating to employee share schemes. 
Cash conversion (being the ratio of operating cash flow as a percentage of lease adjusted operating

(2022: £1,160.1 million), due to a net cash inflow of £35.5 million, a £38.4 million decrease due to 
currency translation and a non-cash decrease in debt of £0.7 million. Net debt including lease liabilities 
was £1,750.0 million (2022: £1,730.0 million).

Net debt to EBITDA calculated at average exchange rates and based on historical accounting standards, 
in accordance with the Group’s external debt covenants, was 1.1 times (2022: 1.2 times). Net debt to 
EBITDA calculated at average exchange rates including lease liabilities was 1.5 times (2022: 1.5 times).

Return on average operating capital increased to 46.1% from 43.0% in 2022 mainly due to higher 
returns in the underlying business driven by an increase in operating margin. Return on invested capital 
was 15.5% compared to 15.0% in 2022, similarly due to higher returns in the underlying business driven 
by an increase in operating profit.

Intangible assets increased by £148.2 million to £3,242.1 million due to intangible assets arising on 
acquisitions in the year of £372.0 million, a net increase from hyperinflation adjustments of £8.8 million 
and software additions of £15.5 million, partly offset by an amortisation charge of £145.0 million and 
a decrease from currency translation of £103.1 million. 

Right-of-use assets increased by £86.7 million to £616.3 million due to additional right-of-use assets 
from new leases during the year of £136.7 million, an increase from remeasurement adjustments of 
£119.8 million and an increase from acquisitions of £16.2 million, partly offset by a depreciation charge 
of £166.1 million and a decrease from currency translation of £19.9 million.

Working capital increased from the prior year end by £61.5 million to £1,158.1 million driven by an 
increase of £61.2 million from acquisitions and an underlying increase of £28.4 million as shown in the 
cash flow statement, partly offset by a decrease from currency translation of £43.9 million. 

Deferred consideration increased by £35.7 million to £175.6 million due to £69.5 million of deferred 
consideration recognised on current year acquisitions, partly offset by deferred consideration and 
retention payments of £30.0 million, a credit from adjustments to previously estimated earn outs net 
of charges relating to the retention of former owners of £1.4 million and a decrease from currency 
translation of £2.4 million. Including expected future payments which are contingent on the continued 
retention of former owners of businesses acquired of £83.2 million, total deferred and contingent 
consideration at 31 December 2023 was £258.8 million (2022: £216.2 million).

The Group’s net pension surplus of £49.4 million at 31 December 2023 has increased by £9.5 million 
from the net pension surplus of £39.9 million at 31 December 2022, largely due to cash contributions 
of £6.9 million.

Shareholders’ equity increased by £245.4 million during the year to £2,966.3 million.

FINANCIAL REVIEW continued

Capital management
The Group’s policy is to maintain a strong capital base to maintain investor, creditor and market 
confidence and to sustain future development of the business. The Group funds its operations through 
a mixture of shareholders’ equity and bank and capital market borrowings. The Group’s funding 
strategy is to maintain an investment grade credit rating and the Company’s current credit rating with 
Standard & Poor’s is BBB+. All borrowings are managed by a central treasury function and funds raised 
are lent onward to operating subsidiaries as required. The overall objective is to manage the funding to 
ensure the borrowings have a range of maturities, are competitively priced and meet the demands of 
the business over time. There were no changes to the Group’s approach to capital management during 
the year and the Group is not subject to any externally imposed capital requirements.

Treasury policies and controls
The Group has a centralised treasury department to control external borrowings and manage liquidity, 
interest rate, foreign currency and credit risks. Treasury policies have been approved by the Board and 
cover the nature of the exposure to be hedged, the types of financial instruments that may be 
employed and the criteria for investing and borrowing cash. The Group uses derivatives to manage its 
foreign currency and interest rate risks arising from underlying business activities. No transactions of 
a speculative nature are undertaken. The treasury department is subject to periodic independent 
review by the internal audit department. Underlying policy assumptions and activities are periodically 
reviewed by the Board. Controls over exposure changes and transaction authenticity are in place.

During the year, the Group’s USD interest rate swaps and committed USD bank facility, which previously 
referenced the discontinued USD LIBOR, have been renegotiated to reference SOFR, the new USD 
benchmark. This has not had an impact on the financial results for the year ended 31 December 2023.

The Group continually monitors net debt and forecast cash flows to ensure that sufficient facilities are 
in place to meet the Group’s requirements in the short, medium and long term and, in order to do so, 
arranges borrowings from a variety of sources. Additionally, compliance with the Group’s biannual debt 
covenants is monitored on a monthly basis and formally tested at 30 June and 31 December. The 
principal financial covenant limits are net debt, calculated at average exchange rates, to EBITDA of no 
more than 3.5 times and interest cover of no less than 3.0 times. Sensitivity analyses using various 
scenarios are applied to forecasts to assess their impact on covenants and net debt. During the year 
ended 31 December 2023 all covenants were complied with and based on current forecasts it is 
expected that such covenants will continue to be complied with for the foreseeable future. Debt 
covenants are based on historical accounting standards. The US private placement notes (‘USPPs’) 
issued in March 2022 contain a clause whereby upon maturity of the previously issued USPPs, the 
latest maturity being in 2028, the principal financial covenants referred to above will no longer apply. 
In addition, the principle financial covenants were removed from the Group’s committed bank 
facilities in 2022.

The Group has substantial funding available comprising multi-currency credit facilities from the Group’s 
banks, US private placement notes and senior bonds. At 31 December 2023 the nominal value of US 
private placement notes outstanding was £917.5 million (2022: £1,126.4 million) with maturities ranging 
from 2024 to 2032. At 31 December 2023 the available committed bank facilities totalled £852.6 million 
(2022: £963.6 million) of which none (2022: none) was drawn down, providing headroom of  
£852.6 million (2022: £963.6 million). During 2023, £365 million of bank facilities were signed with 
maturities between 2026 to 2028. The Group expects to make repayments in the 18 month period from 
the date of these financial statements to the end of 30 June 2025 of approximately £302 million relating 
to maturing USPPs. In addition, the current intention is that the £300 million Senior Bond maturing in 
2025 will be refinanced in the capital markets before maturity.

Going concern
The directors, having reassessed the principal risks and uncertainties, consider it appropriate to adopt 
the going concern basis of accounting in the preparation of the financial statements. In reaching this 
conclusion, the directors noted the Group’s strong cash performance in the year, the substantial 
funding available to the Group as described above and the resilience of the Group to a range of severe 
but plausible downside scenarios. Further details are set out in Note 1 on page 154.

CHAIRMAN’S INTRODUCTION

Introduction from  
Peter Ventress,  
Chairman of the Board

Peter Ventress 
Chairman 

The Board welcomes 
developments in corporate 
governance practice, which 
aim to enhance trust and 
transparency in our 
disclosures.”

On behalf of the Board, I am pleased to present 
the Corporate governance report for the year 
ended 31 December 2023. This report, in 
conjunction with the Nomination, Board 
Sustainability, Audit and Remuneration 
Committee reports, outlines Bunzl’s approach 
to governance: prudent risk management, 
transparency, open engagement with 
stakeholders and compliance with the principles 
and provisions of the 2018 UK Corporate 
Governance Code (the ‘Code’).

I am delighted to welcome Jacky Simmonds, 
who joined the Board on 1 March 2023, as a 
non-executive director. Through her executive 
and non-executive roles, she brings a wealth of 
international and listed company experience, 
which, coupled with Jacky’s extensive HR 
expertise, will enhance and strengthen the 
capabilities of the Board further. Following Jacky’s 
appointment, the proportion of female directors 
on the Board is 44%, exceeding the Financial 
Conduct Authority’s new 40% board gender 
diversity target. More information on Jacky’s 
experience and induction process can be found 
on pages 91 and 99, respectively. 

As announced on 26 February 2024, Vanda 
Murray, Senior Independent Director and Chair 
of the Remuneration Committee, has informed 
the Board of her intention to step down as a 
director at the conclusion of the Company’s 
Annual General Meeting (‘AGM’) on 24 April 2024. 
Her independent advice and valued contribution 
to the Board’s deliberations over the years have 
been greatly appreciated and she leaves with the 
Company’s thanks and best wishes. A robust 
recruitment process for a new non-executive 
director is now underway and an announcement 
will be released in due course, once a suitable 
candidate has been identified. Full details of the 
recruitment process will also be included in next 
year’s Annual Report.

Vanda will be succeeded as Chair of the 
Remuneration Committee by Jacky and Pam Kirby 
will succeed her as the Board’s new Senior 
Independent Director. The timing of the changes 
allows for a meaningful handover period with 
Vanda as part of a planned succession. Further 
information concerning the Board and Committee 
changes, and succession planning more generally, 
can be found in our Nomination Committee 
report on pages 106 to 109.

In line with recognised best practice, Bunzl 
undertakes Board reviews on an annual basis 
to further increase Board effectiveness and to 
identify areas for improvement. Bunzl engaged 
Lintstock Ltd in 2023 to conduct an external 
review of the performance of the Board and its 
Committees. Additional evaluations of my 
performance as Chairman, as well as the 
performance of each individual director, were also 
undertaken. A wide variety of performance areas 
were assessed, with key strengths and potential 
priorities for 2024 identified to drive future 
discussions. The results of the evaluation were 
positive and identified that the Board 
demonstrates an appropriate mix of cohesion 
and challenge, has a transparent relationship 
with management, strong clarity of Bunzl’s 
operating model and of the Board’s role in driving 
the Group’s strategic outcomes. For additional 
information on the Board evaluation process 
and outcomes, see page 103.

Sustainability was highlighted as one of the 2023 
priority areas for the Board. Direct oversight of 
sustainability-related risks and opportunities is 
key to the continued strengthening of Bunzl’s 
sustainability strategy. In 2022, the Board 
established a new Board Sustainability Committee 
(‘BSC’), reflecting the importance Bunzl places on 
the consideration of Environmental, Social and 
Governance (‘ESG’) matters. The BSC comprises 
all of the non-executive directors and invitations 
to attend the meetings are regularly extended to 
the Chief Executive Officer (‘CEO’), Chief Financial 
Officer (‘CFO’), Director of Group HR and Head of 
Sustainability. More information about the work 
undertaken by the BSC during the year, as well as 
its priorities for 2024, can be found in the BSC 
report on pages 110 to 111.

CHAIRMAN’S INTRODUCTION continued

Acquisition growth is a key pillar of Bunzl’s 
compounding growth strategy and remained 
an area of focus for the Board in 2023. During the 
year, the Board maintained close oversight of the 
acquisition pipeline and received regular 
presentations from senior managers, covering 
financial, operational and ESG factors, including 
cultural fit. The Board is mindful of the need to 
consider the interests of the Company’s 
stakeholders when making decisions, and a case 
study demonstrating how the Board has had 
regard to stakeholder interests during the 
acquisition process can be found on page 67.

The Board welcomes developments in corporate 
governance practice, which aim to enhance trust 
and transparency in our disclosures. We are 
aware that revisions to the Code were published 
by the Financial Reporting Council (‘FRC’) in 
January 2024 and the Board will be giving further 
consideration to these during the year. We will 
report formally against the new Code in the 
Company’s future Annual Reports, as the 
requirements come into effect in 2025 and 2026. 

I am pleased to report that, for the year ended 31 
December 2023, the Company has complied in 
full with the provisions of the 2018 version of the 
Code that is currently in force.

As a Board, we are committed to ensuring that 
Bunzl’s robust governance structure enables 
sustainable and resilient growth, for the benefit 
of all of our stakeholders. We hope that you find 
the following report to be a useful overview of 
Bunzl’s approach to governance and look 
forward to welcoming you at the Company’s 
forthcoming AGM.

Peter Ventress 
Chairman 
26 February 2024

Continued Board oversight of strategic 
priorities and the execution of Bunzl’s 
strategic plans

During the year, the Board continued to focus 
on Bunzl’s strategic pillars of profitable organic 
growth, operating model improvements 
and acquisition growth. The Board received 
frequent updates on business area 
performance, acquisition reviews and 
supplier performance, which enhanced its 
ability to oversee Bunzl’s strategic priorities 
and have meaningful discussions with regard 
to future plans. 

Further information regarding Bunzl’s strategic 
priorities can be found in the Strategic report.

On the Board’s mind in 2023
Focusing on management succession 
planning and enhancing the Group’s 
organisational structure, talent 
management, and diversity and 
inclusion processes

The Board is committed to ensuring that  
it is balanced, diverse and representative  
of the markets in which it operates. During  
the year, Jacky Simmonds was appointed  
to the Board and brings with her valuable 
knowledge and experience, particularly 
in people-related matters. 

Succession planning for executives remained 
high on the agenda and formal Board sessions 
were held to focus on the topic of talent and 
leadership succession. These sessions involved 
the review of succession plans for the senior 
leadership team, leadership talent within the 
business areas and young talent initiatives, in 
the context of fostering diversity. Examples of 
the diversity and inclusion initiatives that are in 
place include reverse mentoring, annual 
leadership conferences and the Bunzl Women 
in Leadership engagement programmes, which 
are now present in all business areas. 

More information on succession planning, 
talent management and diversity and 
inclusion can be found in the Nomination 
committee report. 

More on page 109

Continuing Bunzl’s focus on sustainability 
and building this into customer relationships

The Board continued to develop the Company’s 
sustainability strategy and oversee its 
implementation throughout the year. The 
establishment of the Board Sustainability 
Committee in 2022 has allowed for more 
detailed consideration of sustainability-related 
risks and opportunities, with one of the focal 

points of Bunzl’s 2023 sustainability objectives 
being products and packaging. Approaching this 
objective with a focus on responsible sourcing 
has enabled the Group to develop deep and 
meaningful customer relationships whereby 
customers are supported with tailored 
solutions and innovative products better suited 
to a circular economy.

Further information on Bunzl’s tailored 
solutions can be found in the 
Sustainability report. 

More on page 56

Supporting management in acquisition and 
organic growth strategies

In line with the Company’s acquisition growth 
strategy, the Board approved the acquisition 
of 19 businesses in 2023. The Board drives and 
monitors the success of acquisitions through:

•  Bunzl’s decentralised model, which allows 
previous company owners to retain an 
entrepreneurial culture and drive further 
success;

•  providing management with training;

•   providing acquired companies with 
support, resources and operational 
excellence; and

•  frequently reviewing the performance of 
acquired companies against projections.

Further information regarding Bunzl’s 
acquisition strategy can be found in the 
Strategic report.

Governance structure

The Board has ultimate responsibility for the 
overall leadership of the Group. To ensure the 
directors maintain overall control over strategic, 
financial, operational and compliance issues, the 
Board meets regularly throughout the year and 
has formally adopted a schedule of matters which 
are required to be brought to it for consideration. 
Further details of the matters reserved for the 
Board can be found on page 93. 

The Board has established four Committees to 
which it delegates certain matters, all of which 
comply with the provisions of the Code and play 
an important governance role through the 
detailed work they carry out to fulfil the 
responsibilities delegated to them. The Board 
recognises the importance of evolving the 
governance structures of the Company in line 
with the development of the Company’s strategy, 
and the Board Sustainability Committee was 
formed with a mandate to provide strategic 
advice to the Board on the principal objectives, 
targets and priorities of Bunzl’s sustainability 
strategy. All Committees meet at least three times 
a year, with the exception of the Audit Committee 
which meets at least four times a year, and 
briefing papers are prepared and circulated to 
Committee members in advance of each meeting. 

The terms of reference for each Committee can 
be found on the Company’s website,

Board composition
As at 31 December 2023, the Board was made up 
of nine members comprising a Chairman, a CEO, 
a CFO and six non-executive directors, including 
a Senior Independent Director. 

Brief biographical details of the directors in office 
at the date of this report are given on pages 90 to 
91 and further information on the Nomination 
Committee’s approach to succession planning 
can be found in its report on page 108.

None of the Company’s non-executive directors 
had any previous connection with the Company 
or its executive directors on appointment to the 
Board, with the exception of Jacky Simmonds, who 
is presently Chief People Officer at Experian plc. 
Lloyd Pitchford, another non-executive director at 
Bunzl, is the CFO of Experian plc. Notwithstanding 
this connection, all of Bunzl’s non-executive 
directors, including Jacky, are considered by both 
the Board and the criteria set out in the Code to 
be independent. Further details concerning the 
determination of director independence can be 
found in the Nomination Committee report on 
pages 107 to 108.

Each of the non-executive directors is considered 
to have a breadth of strategic, management and 
financial experience gained in each of their own 
fields in a range of multinational businesses, 
further details of which can be found in the 
director skills matrix on page 92. 

The Board is satisfied that each non-executive 
director dedicates appropriate time to their role, 
continues to contribute effectively to Board 
decision making and executes their 
responsibilities to challenge, monitor, advise and 
guide the Company to a high standard for the 
benefit of Bunzl’s stakeholders as a whole. 
Further details relating to the time commitments 
of the directors can be found on page 99. 

In accordance with the terms of the Code and 
Bunzl’s Articles of Association, with the exception 
of Vanda Murray, each of the directors in office at 
the date of this Annual Report will be subject to 
re-election at the 2024 AGM and the reasons for 
each director’s re-election will be set out in the 
forthcoming Notice of Meeting.

CORPORATE GOVERNANCE REPORT continued

Board roles and responsibilities 
The following table summarises the role and responsibilities of the different members of the Board:

Role

Responsibilities

Chairman

The primary job of the Chairman is to be responsible for the leadership of the Board and to 
ensure its effectiveness in all aspects of its role. The Chairman:

•  takes overall responsibility for the composition and capability of the Board and its 

Committees;

•  organises the annual evaluation of the Board, its Committees and each individual director;

•  consults regularly with the Chief Executive Officer and is available on a flexible basis to 

provide advice, counsel and support to the Chief Executive Officer; and

•  ensures corporate governance is conducted in accordance with current best practice, as 

appropriate to the Group.

The Chairman is also viewed by investors as the ultimate steward of the Group and the 
guardian of the interests of all the shareholders.

Chief Executive 
Officer

The Chief Executive Officer is responsible for the leadership and the operational and 
performance management of the Company within the strategy agreed by the Board. The 
Chief Executive Officer:

•  manages the CFO and the Group’s management and day-to-day activities;

•  prepares and presents the strategy for growth in shareholder value to the Board;

•  sets the operating plans and budgets required to deliver the agreed strategy;

•  ensures that the Group has appropriate risk management and control mechanisms in 

place; and

•  communicates with the Company’s shareholders on a day-to-day basis as necessary.

There is a clear division of 
responsibilities between 
the Chairman and the 
Chief Executive Officer, 
which is set out in writing 
and has been agreed by 
the Board.

Chief Financial 
Officer

The Chief Financial Officer supports the Chief Executive Officer and is responsible for managing the Group’s funding strategy, 
financial reporting, non-financial reporting, risk management and internal controls, investor relations programme and the 
leadership of the Finance, Tax and Treasury functions. The Chief Financial Officer communicates with the Company’s analysts 
on a day-to-day basis as necessary.

Senior 
Independent 
Director

The Senior Independent Director is available to shareholders if they have concerns, which contact through the normal 
channels of Chairman, Chief Executive Officer or Chief Financial Officer has failed to resolve or for which such contact is 
inappropriate. The Senior Independent Director is also available to the other directors should they have any concerns, 
which are not appropriate to raise with the Chairman or that have not been satisfactorily resolved by the Chairman.

Independent 
non-executive 
directors

The non-executive directors play an important role in corporate governance and accountability, through both their 
attendance at Board meetings and their membership of the various Board Committees. The non-executive directors bring 
a broad range of business and financial expertise and experience to the Board, which complements and supplements the 
experience of the executive directors. This enables them to offer strategic guidance, evaluate information provided and 
constructively challenge management’s viewpoints, assumptions and performance.

Board activity
The Board meets formally at least seven times 
a year, with two Board meetings held at or near 
Group locations around the world. During 2023, 
the Board held meetings in Spain and in Canada, 
which gave the directors the opportunity to meet 
with local employees and assess the culture of 
the Company.

At each Board meeting, Bunzl’s operational and 
financial performance is discussed and 
presentations are made by the CEO and the CFO. 
The Business Area Heads attend certain meetings 
by invitation to present on key topics within their 
remit. The importance of bringing management 
into meetings to present on their respective area 
of expertise, share knowledge and provide 
updates on the performance of the business is 
well recognised by the Board. The Director of 
Corporate Development frequently presents to 
the Board on potential acquisitions and the Board 
receives regular updates from management on 
risk, health & safety, digital strategy, information 
security, environment, sustainability, governance 
and people matters. 

Board agendas are set by the Chairman in 
consultation with the CEO and with the assistance 
of the Company Secretary, who maintains a rolling 
programme of items for discussion by the Board. 
This ensures that all matters reserved for the 
Board and other key issues are considered at the 
appropriate time. 

Each Board meeting is structured to accommodate 
sufficient challenge and contribution by all 
participants. The Board is supplied with full and 
timely information to enable informed decision 
making. All directors have access to the advice and 
services of the Company Secretary who ensures 
that Board procedures are complied with, and the 
Board is fully briefed on relevant legislative, 
regulatory and corporate governance 
developments. Directors may also take 
independent professional advice at the Company’s 
expense where they judge this to be necessary in 
the furtherance of their duties to discharge their 
responsibilities as directors.

Conflicts of interest
The directors are required to avoid situations in 
which they have, or could have, a direct or indirect 
interest that conflicts, or possibly may conflict, 
with the Company’s interests. In accordance with 
the Companies Act 2006, the Company’s Articles 
of Association allow the Board to authorise 
potential conflicts of interest that may arise and 
to impose such limits or conditions as it thinks fit.

Directors are required to give notice of any 
potential situational and/or transactional 
conflicts, which are then considered by the 
Board and, if deemed appropriate, authorised 
accordingly. A director is not however permitted 
to participate in such considerations or to vote 
in relation to their own conflicts.

The Board has considered and authorised 
a number of potential situational conflicts, 
all of which relate to the holding of external 
directorships and have been entered on the 
Company’s conflicts register. No actual 
conflicts have been identified during the year 
and the Board considers that these 
procedures operate effectively. 

External appointments and time 
commitment of directors
The Board takes the time commitment of 
directors seriously and the time expected of 
directors is set out in their letters of appointment. 
Each director must notify the Chairman prior to 
accepting a new appointment, and the Chairman 
must notify the Board. During the year, the Board 
considered the external appointment of Vanda 
Murray as a non-executive director of Howden 
Joinery Group plc with effect from 1 February 
2024. Additional information on how the Board 
assessed this external appointment is available 
on pages 107 to 108 of the Nomination 
Committee report.

The Board recognises the benefits in terms of 
director knowledge and experience that external 
appointments can bring to Board deliberations. 
In 2023, when considering Vanda’s new 
appointment, the Board considered whether it 
would impact the time required for her to prepare 

for and attend meetings of the Company, engage 
with stakeholders, undertake any training or 
personal development and execute her duties to 
the Company effectively. In addition, the Board 
considered her current portfolio, whether there 
were any conflicts or potential conflicts, the time 
commitment required with the new appointment 
and whether the appointment would cause the 
number of directorships she held to exceed those 
set out in the Code or institutional investor and 
proxy adviser guidance.

The Board is satisfied that each director devotes 
sufficient time to their role at Bunzl and continues 
to discharge their duties effectively.

Induction
The Company Secretary assists the Chairman 
in designing and delivering a tailored induction 
programme for each new member of the Board. 
This takes into account each director’s individual 
needs, aims to outline their roles, responsibilities 
and duties as a director of the Company and 
facilitate their understanding of the Group’s 
business, people, processes, purpose, values 
and culture. 

A typical induction programme normally includes:

•  a detailed information pack that includes 

details of directors’ duties and responsibilities, 
procedures for dealing in Bunzl plc’s shares and 
other governance-related issues;

•  one-to-one meetings with the other members 

of the Board and the Company Secretary;

•  meetings with Committee Chairs, as 

appropriate;

•  meetings with senior management;

•  visits to some of the Group’s locations;

•  information on the main areas of the Group’s 

business activity and risks; and

•  information on the Company’s approach to 
sustainability and stakeholder engagement. 

INDUCTION:
Jacky Simmonds

Meeting with members of senior 
management and employees in Bunzl’s 
business areas has provided me with an 
understanding of the culture within the 
Company and an awareness of the views 
and priorities of employees throughout 
the Group. This knowledge allows me to 
consider the employee perspective in 
Board deliberations and is something  
that I look forward to developing further  
in 2024 and beyond.”

Training and development
The Board recognises the importance of 
continually developing existing directors and 
believes good decision making is enabled by 
a deep understanding of the Group’s operations 
and people. During the course of the year, 
directors receive training and presentations to 
keep their knowledge current and enhance their 
experience. They are updated continually on the 
Group’s businesses, their markets and changes 
to the competitive and regulatory environments 
in which they operate. In addition, the Board is 
kept informed of relevant legal, regulatory and 
financial developments or changes by the 
Company Secretary and the CFO. The Company’s 
legal advisers and auditors give presentations and 
training to the Board on specific topics of interest.

Training and development needs of the Board are 
kept under review and directors attend external 
courses where it is considered appropriate for 
them to do so.

2023 training and development 
activities
•  External adviser training on anti-bribery and 

corruption, including:

Employee engagement statement
In accordance with Provision 5 of the Code, the 
Board has decided to use alternative 
arrangements to engage with employees. Bunzl 
is a global, decentralised business with operations 
in multiple locations and our employees fulfil a 
broad range of roles with many different 
perspectives. It is therefore essential that our 
engagement methods suit the nature of our 
business, the culture of the Company and our 
workforce. This holistic approach to engagement 
is the most effective method and allows the 
Board to understand, monitor and assess 
employee sentiment. 

Some of the mechanisms used to engage with 
employees during the year are described in the 
following section. Employees are also encouraged 
to get involved with the Company’s performance 
through a variety of different means, including the 
operation of all employee share plans, bonus and 
commission schemes and other incentive 
arrangements. Our employee engagement 
mechanisms are discussed at Board meetings 
and kept under review to ensure that they remain 
appropriate and effective.

Site visits
In 2023, visits to operational sites gave the Board 
a chance to hear views from employees at all 
levels, providing a platform for meaningful 
engagement while enhancing their understanding 
of Bunzl’s operations and culture. Additional 
information on the Board’s site visits can be found 
on page 99.

Bunzl’s CEO, Frank van Zanten, carried out 
additional site visits during the year including 
a five day trip to Latin America, where he met 
employees within the teams of 17 Bunzl 
businesses. This has bolstered his ability as an 
executive director to bring the employee voice 
into Board deliberations.

CEO listening session
In 2023, the CEO, alongside the Director of Group HR, held a third annual listening session with female employees, and employees from ethnically 
diverse backgrounds, across the Group. Bunzl’s CEO listening sessions enable direct engagement between the CEO and employees, which is used 
to review progress against the Company’s diversity objectives, inform future Board decisions and gain further insight into the results of the employee 
pulse survey.

Key themes were identified from the employee feedback provided in the 2023 CEO listening session, which have been compiled and used to inform 
decision making around Bunzl’s diversity and inclusion initiatives in 2024.

Theme

Role models

Key point(s) raised

•  The creation of strong role models is critical, as employees can find it motivating to see people from 

similar backgrounds in senior positions throughout the organisation

•  Success stories covering role models should be more widely publicised through internal 

communications channels

Targets

•  Employees were pleased to see progress towards diversity targets in 2023 and appreciated the 

ambitious targets set for 2024

•  Targets were considered crucial in demonstrating clear measures of success, ensuring that progress 

is not left to chance

Communications

•  Different cultures, including faiths and nationalities, should continue to be celebrated through 

effective communications

Bunzl’s CEO listening sessions have been a valuable engagement mechanism, facilitating the provision of feedback from employees of diverse 
backgrounds direct to Board level. Further information on our diversity and inclusion initiatives can be found on page 36.

Non-executive director listening sessions
To gain insight into the 2023 employee experience, Lloyd Pitchford and Vanda Murray held several non-executive director listening sessions, speaking 
directly with employees from the Continental Europe, North America and Asia Pacific business areas. These sessions are held to facilitate direct 
engagement between the non-executive directors and Bunzl employees across all levels of the Group, on topics such as the effectiveness of 
communications, the quality of IT resources, and the alignment of executive remuneration with wider company pay policy. The matters raised by 
employees are fed back to the Board and the Board uses this feedback to inform its decisions.

Theme

Communications

Technology

Surveys

Reward

Key point(s) raised

•  Employees considered that internal communications had improved, resulting in a greater feeling of 

connectedness

•  Increased communication around Group strategy was identified as being something that employees 

would welcome

•  Employees were supportive of improvements to IT resources and systems in 2023 and encouraged 

continued investment

•  The Great Place to Work survey had been expanded to cover all regions in 2023 and this was 

positively received as an additional way for employees to have their voices heard across the Group
•  The basis of reward for frontline staff, when compared with that of management, was considered to 

be consistent

Engagement with customers,  
suppliers and other stakeholders
Understanding the views of the Company’s 
stakeholders is a key priority for the Board and 
Bunzl as a whole. It helps to focus the Company’s 
resources, engagement and reporting activities by 
addressing those issues that matter most to the 
Group’s businesses and to the Company’s wider 
stakeholders. Fostering strong business 
relationships is an intrinsic part of the Company’s 
long established and successful compounding 
strategy and a key consideration in all decision 
making. More information about Bunzl’s 
engagement with its suppliers, customers and 
wider stakeholder groups can be found on 
pages 64 to 67 and in the Sustainability report 
on pages 54 to 62.

Bunzl Insight series
In 2022, Bunzl began hosting Insight events, 
designed to enhance communication and 
engagement with key stakeholders by providing 
more detailed and comprehensive information 
regarding the Group’s international business 
operations. Given the intricate and expansive 
nature of Bunzl’s decentralised operations, 
providing additional detail beyond that outlined in 
Bunzl’s Annual Report, Capital Markets Days and 
other engagement activities allows stakeholders 
to gain a better insight into the Group’s culture 
and operational activities.

With a focus on Bunzl’s Continental Europe 
businesses in 2022, and North America in 2023, 
the Insight events were hosted by local senior 
leadership and focused on a wide variety of 
topics, including value-added solutions for 
customers, an overview of Bunzl’s expanding 
acquisition model and highlights of our 
established platform for future growth. The 
Group aims to enhance its engagement with 
stakeholders by actively fostering interaction 
through discussion and feedback.

The Group’s Insight events have been well 
received by stakeholders, with additional Insight 
events having been requested covering specific 
areas of the business. 

Shareholder meetings
The Board is committed to maintaining strong 
communications with our shareholders. 
Committee Chairs seek engagement with major 
shareholders on pertinent matters within their 
responsibility and, in 2023, the Chair of the 
Remuneration Committee sought engagement 
with major shareholders, regarding Bunzl’s 
proposed 2024 director’s remuneration 
policy, details of which can be found on 
pages 122 to 146.

Additionally, major shareholders are routinely 
invited to meet with the Chairman, Chair of the 
Audit Committee and Company Secretary to 
discuss governance at Bunzl. Some of the topics 
that were discussed during our 2023 shareholder 
meetings are outlined below. The outcomes of all 
of the meetings were positive, with no specific 
matters of concern being raised. The Board looks 
forward to continuing its engagement activity in 
the coming year.

Topics discussed in 2023 meetings

Outcome of meetings 

•  Outcomes of the 2023 Board evaluation and 

the Board’s mechanism for tracking 
progress against those outcomes

The outcomes of all of the meetings were 
positive, and the Board will continue its 
engagement activity in the coming year.

•  Succession planning, skills on the Board and 

priorities for the recruitment of new 
directors

•  Talent management priorities and the 

Board’s involvement in relation to talent 
management below Board level

•  The strategic oversight role of the Board 
with regard to capital allocation and the 
acquisition pipeline

Board performance review 
The Board believes that maintaining a trajectory of continual improvement of its performance is pivotal to its success. A formal and rigorous Board performance review, evaluating the Board, its 
Committees, the Chairman and each individual director is carried out annually and externally facilitated every three years, with a comprehensive external review having taken place during 2023. 
The process and outcomes of the 2023 performance review, along with actions taken to address the findings of the 2022 review, are outlined below. 

1. Selection

2. Planning

The review was undertaken by Lintstock, an independent advisory firm that does not provide any other services to, or have any connection with, the Company. The Board, following the 
recommendation of the Nomination Committee, felt that engaging Lintstock was appropriate given their in-depth understanding of the Company. Such appointment would also ensure 
consistency and continuity in the presentation of results from year to year, allowing progress to be tracked effectively. 

The objectives, scope and areas of focus of the review were agreed between the Chairman and the Company Secretary and discussed with Lintstock. It was agreed that the performance 
of the Board, its Committees, the Board Chairman, Committee Chairs and each individual director would be reviewed and that it would cover core aspects of governance such as 
information, composition and dynamics, as well as people, strategy and risk areas relevant to the performance of Bunzl. 

3. Surveys and 
Questionnaires

With the agreed scope and objectives in mind, Lintstock invited each director to complete a survey, following which Lintstock held in-depth one-to-one interviews with each of them. 
The Company Secretary coordinated the process and provided Lintstock with the necessary support throughout. 

4. Findings 

Reports on the results of the reviews were presented to the Chairman and Company Secretary and subsequently discussed by the Board and its Committees. Reports on individual 
director performance were presented to the Chairman and a report on the Chairman was provided to the Senior Independent Director, who discussed the findings with the other 
non-executive directors. The contributions, independence and time commitment of each director were found to be effective. 

5. Next steps

Having considered the findings of the review, the Board agreed on key priorities to further improve performance in 2024 and the follow up actions in relation thereto. These actions, 
further details of which are detailed below, have been built into the Board’s agenda and activities for 2024. 

Led by the Senior Independent Director, the non-executive directors meet without the Chairman present at least annually to appraise the Chairman’s performance, including a review of his other 
commitments, to ensure that he is able to allocate sufficient time to the Company to discharge his responsibilities effectively. The Chairman also periodically holds meetings with the non-executive 
directors without the executive directors present. All of these processes were carried out satisfactorily during the year.

Details of progress made in respect of the key priorities identified in 2022, are set out below.

Key priorities identified during 2022

Progress made

Key priorities identified during 2023

Outcome of evaluation

1.  Focusing on management succession planning and 
enhancing the Group’s organisational structure, 
talent management, and diversity and inclusion 
processes.

2.  Continuing Bunzl’s focus on sustainability and 

building this into customer relationships.

3.  Supporting management in acquisition and organic 

growth strategies.

4.  Continued Board oversight of strategic priorities and 

the execution of Bunzl’s strategic plans.

The Board is satisfied that the 
priorities identified following 
the evaluation carried out in 
2022 have been adequately 
addressed during 2023.

See page 89 for further 
information.

1. Supporting the continuing evolution of the Board’s 
composition.

2. Deepening the Board’s understanding of key 
stakeholder developments, including customers.

3. Monitoring management succession and 
development plans to build the long term talent 
pipeline.

4. Continuing to monitor the external context, 
particularly in areas such as sustainability and 
technology.

As a result of the external 
evaluation process carried out 
in 2023, the Board concluded 
that both it and its Committees 
are operating effectively.

Risk management and internal controls overview

The Board has delegated to an Executive Committee, consisting 
of the CEO, CFO and other functional managers, the initial 
responsibility for identifying, evaluating, managing and 
mitigating the risks facing the Group and for deciding how 
these are best managed, as well as responsibility for 
establishing a system of internal controls appropriate to the 
business environments in which the Group operates. The 
principal features of this system include:

Some of the procedures carried out in order to monitor the 
effectiveness of the internal controls system and to identify, 
manage and mitigate business risk are:

•  central management holds regular meetings with business 
area management to discuss strategic, operational and 
financial issues, including a review of the principal risks 
affecting each of the business areas and the policies and 
procedures by which these risks are managed; 

•  a procedure for monitoring the effectiveness of the internal 

controls system through a tiered management structure with 
clearly defined lines of responsibility and delegation of 
authority;

•  a second line of defence Internal Controls team to continually 
develop the Group’s framework and approach to internal 
controls over financial reporting;

•  formal standards of business conduct (including code of 

conduct, anti-bribery and corruption, fraud investigations and 
reporting, and whistleblowing policies) based on honesty, 
integrity, fair dealing and compliance with the local laws and 
regulations of the countries in which the Group operates;

•  strategic plans and comprehensive budgets which are 

prepared annually by the business areas and approved by 
the Board;

•  clearly defined authorisation procedures for capital 

investment and acquisitions;

•  a well-established consolidation and reporting system for the 

statutory accounts and monthly management accounts; 

•  detailed manuals covering Group accounting policies, and 

policies and procedures for the Group’s treasury operations 
supplemented by internal controls procedures at a business 
area level;

•  periodic IT risk assessment aligned with the Group’s IT security 
standard, as well as continual investment in IT systems and 
security to ensure the security of information systems and 
data, business continuity and the production of timely and 
accurate management information; and

•  considering ESG and non-financial reporting and assurance.

•  the Executive Committee reviews the outcome of the 

discussions held at business area meetings on internal 
controls and risk management issues;

•  the Board in turn reviews the outcome of the Executive 
Committee discussions on internal controls and risk 
management issues, which ensures a documented and 
auditable trail of accountability;

•  each business area, the Executive Committee and the Board 

carry out an annual fraud risk assessment. Reporting protocols 
are in place to identify, analyse and respond to actual or 
potential fraud incidents;

•  an annual self-assessment of the status of internal controls 
measured against a prescribed list of minimum standards is 
performed by every business and action plans are agreed 
where remedial action is required;

•  actual results are reviewed monthly against budget, forecasts 
and the previous year and explanations are obtained for all 
significant variances;

•  all treasury activities, including in relation to the management 
of foreign exchange exposures and Group borrowings, are 
reported and reviewed monthly. The Group’s bank balances 
around the world are monitored on a weekly basis and 
significant movements are reviewed centrally;

•  developments in tax, treasury and accounting are continually 

monitored by Group management in association with 
external advisers;

•  regular meetings are held with insurance and risk advisers to 

assess the risks throughout the Group;

•  systems are in place to monitor IT security incidents, analyse 
and remediate any identified weaknesses. Findings are used 
to continually improve defences across all Group companies; 

•  the Internal Audit function periodically performs business 
and risk-themed audit work, makes recommendations to 
improve processes and controls and follows up to ensure 
that management implements the recommendations made. 
The Internal Audit function’s work is determined on a risk 
assessment basis and its findings are reported to Group and 
business area management as well as to the Audit Committee 
and the external auditors;

•  the Audit Committee, which comprises all of the independent 
non-executive directors of the Company, meets regularly 
throughout the year. Further details of the work of the 
Committee, which includes a review of the effectiveness of 
the Company’s internal financial controls and the assurance 
procedures relating to the Company’s risk management 
system, are set out in the Audit Committee report on 
pages 112 to 121;

•  management committees (known as the Group Sustainability 
Committee, the Environment & Climate Change Committee, 
the Health & Safety Committee, and the Supply Chain 
Committee) which oversee issues relating principally to 
environment, health & safety and business continuity planning 
matters, set relevant policies and practices and monitor their 
implementation; and

•  health & safety risk assessments, safety audits and a regular 
review of progress against objectives established by each 
business area are periodically carried out.

Risk management and internal controls
In accordance with the Code, the Board acknowledges that it has overall responsibility for identifying, evaluating, managing and mitigating the principal and emerging risks faced by the Group, and for monitoring 
the Group’s risk management and internal controls systems. Such systems are designed to manage rather than eliminate the risk of failure to achieve business objectives and can only provide reasonable and not 
absolute assurance against material misstatement or loss.

In accordance with the Code and the related guidance, the Company has established the procedures necessary to ensure that there is an ongoing process for identifying, evaluating, managing and mitigating the 
principal risks faced by the Group and for determining the nature and extent of the principal risks it is willing to take to achieve its strategic objectives (its ‘risk appetite’). The directors confirm that such 
procedures have been in place for the year ended 31 December 2023 and, up to the date of approval of these financial statements, that the Group’s risk management and internal controls systems have been 
monitored during the year.

Further information about the Group’s approach to risk management and the principal risks and uncertainties facing the Group can be found on pages 68 to 76.

Financial and business reporting
The responsibilities of the directors in respect of the preparation of the Group and parent company financial statements are set out on page 195 and the auditors’ report on pages 196 to 201 includes a 
statement by the external auditors about their reporting responsibilities. In accordance with provision 30 of the Code and as set out on page 154, the directors are of the opinion that it is appropriate to continue 
to adopt the going concern basis in preparing the financial statements. 

The process of preparing the Annual Report has included the following:

•  comprehensive reviews undertaken at different levels of the Group in order to ensure the accuracy, consistency and overall balance of the Annual Report; and

•  procedures to verify the factual accuracy of the Annual Report.

Fair, balanced and understandable – Bunzl’s assurance framework
In accordance with provision 27 of the Code, the Board confirms that taken as a whole, the 2023 Annual Report is fair, balanced and understandable, and provides the information necessary for shareholders to 
assess the Company’s position, performance, business model and strategy. Considerations of the Board when reviewing whether the 2023 Annual Report, taken as a whole, is fair, balanced and understandable 
and provides sufficient information to enable the reader to assess the Group’s position and performance, business model and strategy, are shown below:

NOMINATION COMMITTEE REPORT

Introduction from Peter Ventress
On behalf of the Board, I am pleased to present 
the Nomination Committee’s report for the 
financial year ended 31 December 2023, which 
outlines the Committee’s role and responsibilities, 
as well as our activities and areas of focus 
during the year.

I am delighted to welcome Jacky Simmonds 
as a member of the Committee, following her 
appointment as a non-executive director on 
1 March 2023. Jacky was appointed after an 
extensive search and selection process, 
considered in the context of the existing 
balance of skills and diversity on the Board. She 
has significant knowledge and experience across 
all aspects of HR, with particular expertise in 
employee engagement, transformational change, 
board and leadership succession planning, 
employee relations, and talent management. 
Additional information concerning the search 
and selection process for Jacky is included in the 
report that follows, and information concerning 
her skills and experience is set out on page 91. 
An overview of Jacky’s induction process can 
be found on page 99.

As I mentioned in my introduction to the 
Corporate governance report, Vanda Murray, 
Senior Independent Director and Chair of the 
Remuneration Committee, has served as a 
director for over nine years and will therefore, 
in accordance with best practice and the Code, 
step down from the Board at the conclusion 
of the AGM on 24 April 2024. A recruitment 
process for a new non-executive director is 
now underway and an announcement will 
be released in due course, once a suitable 
candidate has been identified.

The Nomination Committee dedicated time 
during the year to succession planning for the 
roles of Senior Independent Director and 
Remuneration Committee Chair and an overview 
of the matters considered by the Committee 
as part of its deliberations can be found later 
in this report.

In 2023, the Committee has focused on the 
key priorities identified during the 2022 Board 
evaluation, which included management 
succession planning, enhancing the Group’s 
organisational structure, talent management, and 
the diversity and inclusion process. Information 
on the Committee’s progress in respect of these 
priorities can be found on pages 107 to 109.

The 2023 Board evaluation was externally 
facilitated and concluded that the Committee 
continues to operate effectively and benefits from 
strong internal and external support. 
Recommended areas of focus for 2024 included 
executive succession and talent development, 
as well as ongoing monitoring of the director 
skills matrix in the wider context of the Group’s 
business and strategic needs. For a 
comprehensive summary of the Board evaluation 
process and outcomes, see page 103. An 
overview of the Committee’s priorities for 2024 
can be found on the following page.

The Board’s composition is fully compliant with 
the requirements of the Parker Review on ethnic 
diversity and the gender diversity targets outlined 
in the Hampton-Alexander Review. I am also 
pleased to confirm that, following the 
appointment of Jacky, we exceed the Financial 
Conduct Authority’s new board diversity targets 
implemented under Listing Rule 9.8.6. Further 
information concerning our performance against 
these targets can be found on page 109.

The Committee will continue to champion 
an inclusive and diverse approach to talent 
management and closely monitor Board and 
Committee performance against best practice.

NOMINATION COMMITTEE REPORT continued

Composition
During 2023, the Nomination Committee 
comprised the Chairman of the Company, 
who chairs the Committee (unless the Committee 
is dealing with the matter of succession of the 
Chairman of the Company) and all of the 
independent non-executive directors. In 
accordance with the provisions of the UK 
Corporate Governance Code, all of the 
members are independent non-executive 
directors. The Secretary to the Committee is 
the Company Secretary. 

Nomination Committee meetings
The Committee meets as necessary throughout 
the year to discharge its responsibilities.

The table below sets out directors’ attendance at 
the four scheduled Committee meetings held 
during 2023.

 Jacky Simmonds was appointed as a director on 1 March 2023 
and attended all Committee meetings held between that date 
and the end of the year. 

Key areas of focus in 2024
•  Long term succession planning, with a 

particular focus on the skills matrix for the 
Board and senior executives

•  Executive succession and talent development

•  The balance of internal experience and external 

fresh perspectives on the Board

•  Consideration of the Company’s profile from 

a talent management perspective

Role and support
The Committee’s principal role is to lead the 
process for appointments to the Board, whether 
to fill any vacancies that may arise or to change 
the number of Board members, ensure plans are 
in place for orderly succession to both the Board 
and senior management positions and oversee 
the development of a diverse pipeline for 
succession. The senior management succession 
plans take into account the views of all Board 
members to ensure the plans encompass the 
benefit of all their skills and experience. In the 
performance of its duties, the Committee has 
been authorised to enlist the services of external 
executive search firms to assist with the 
recruitment process, including the identification 
of potential candidates, to fill Board positions 
and vacancies.

It is the Committee’s role to ensure that the 
Board and its Committees maintain the 
appropriate balance of skills, knowledge, 
experience and diversity to ensure their 
continued effectiveness. Information 
concerning the training and development 
activities undertaken by the directors during 
the year can be found on page 99. 

The Committee meets as necessary throughout 
the year to discharge its responsibilities. The 
Committee’s terms of reference are available on 
the Company’s website, www.bunzl.com.

Performance evaluation
The Committee’s performance and effectiveness 
are reviewed annually by both the Committee and 
as part of the Board performance evaluation. The 
Chair of the Committee also meets with each 
Committee member independently to ensure that 
their individual views about the operation of the 
Committee are taken into account. This year, the 
Board evaluation was externally facilitated by 
Lintstock. Additional information concerning the 
results of the 2023 performance evaluation is set 
out on page 103.

Principal responsibilities of the 
Committee

Board structure

•  Reviewing the structure, size and 

composition of the Board with regard to 
maintaining a balance of skills, experience, 
knowledge and diversity

Succession

•  Considering succession planning, taking into 
account the challenges and opportunities 
facing the Company and the skills and 
expertise required by the Board and senior 
management in the future

•  Reviewing annually a succession planning 
presentation in relation to the Company’s 
senior management

Appointments

•  Identifying and nominating appropriate 

individuals to fill Board vacancies as they 
arise

•  Approving the appointment of any senior 
executive who is to report directly to the 
Chief Executive Officer

•  Making recommendations to the Board  
as to the continuation in office and/or 
reappointment of directors

Evaluation

•  Considering the commitment required of 

non-executive directors and reviewing their 
performance

Activities

Evaluation and independence
When determining whether to recommend that 
the directors be reappointed at the 2024 AGM, 
the Committee considered a number of factors, 
including the output of the 2023 external Board 
evaluation. These factors were also considered, 
in 2023, when recommending that the Board 
approve additional three-year terms for Lloyd 
Pitchford, Stephan Nanninga and Vin Murria. 
Having served on the Board for more than six 
years, Lloyd Pitchford and Stephan Nanninga’s 
continued objectivity and independence were 
subject to particularly rigorous review. 

Further details concerning the Board evaluation 
process that was carried out during 2023, which 
identified that the Committee continues to 
operate effectively, can be found in the Corporate 
governance report on page 103. Examples of the 
priorities identified as part of the Committee’s 
2023 evaluation can be found under the Key areas 
of focus in 2024 section on this page.

The Committee also conducted a review of 
individual director conflict authorisations as 
recorded in the Conflicts of Interest register. The 
register is maintained by the Company Secretary 
and sets out any actual or potential conflict of 
interest situations which a director has disclosed 
to the Board in line with their statutory duties. 
To form a view of a director’s independence, 
consideration was also given to other external 
appointments held by each director. 

Jacky Simmonds is currently Chief People Officer 
at Experian plc and Lloyd Pitchford, another of 
Bunzl’s non-executive directors is the Chief 
Financial Officer of Experian plc. The Board is 
mindful that the Code states that where a 
non-executive director holds cross-directorships 
or has significant links with other directors 
through involvement in other companies or 
bodies, this is likely to impair, or could appear to 
impair, a non-executive director’s independence. 

Prior to Jacky Simmonds’ appointment to Bunzl, 
the Nomination Committee and the Board 
considered whether the appointment would 
impair the independence of either director.

NOMINATION COMMITTEE REPORT continued

The Committee and the Board were satisfied that 
there were no business conflicts between the two 
companies and both directors demonstrate 
independence of thought and will offer challenge, 
including of each other’s views. Further, the 
Committee and the Board were satisfied that 
Jacky Simmonds has sufficient time to discharge 
her duties to the Board and Committees of Bunzl 
and that there were no other factors, which would 
impair either director’s independence. 
Accordingly, the Board does not consider that 
Jacky Simmonds’ and Lloyd Pitchford’s positions 
as independent non-executive directors of the 
Company are adversely impacted by their roles 
at Experian plc and are satisfied that, 
notwithstanding these roles, they are to be 
regarded as independent.

Non-executive directors’ independence of 
thought and judgement is vital to facilitating 
constructive and challenging debate in the 
boardroom and is essential to the operational 
effectiveness of the Board and its Committees. 
The Committee determines a non-executive 
director’s independence in line with the relevant 
provisions of the Code and is satisfied that all 
of the non-executive directors meet the criteria 
for independence and that the Chairman of 
the Board met the criteria on appointment 
to that role.

Succession planning
As previously mentioned, Vanda Murray will 
retire from the Board and its Committees at the 
conclusion of the Company’s upcoming AGM in 
April 2024. Having served on the Board for over 
nine years, Vanda’s departure had been factored 
into the Committee’s director succession plans.

Pam Kirby and Jacky Simmonds will be appointed 
to succeed Vanda in the Senior Independent 
Director and Remuneration Committee Chair 
roles, respectively. Pam is a seasoned director 
with extensive executive and non-executive 
experience in large, listed companies, and was 
a clear candidate for the Senior Independent 
Director role. Jacky has a strong background 
across all aspects of HR, including remuneration, 

and has previously served as Chair of the 
Remuneration Committee of Ferguson plc. 
She has also served as a member of Bunzl’s 
Remuneration Committee since her appointment. 
She was therefore considered to be ideally suited 
to the role of Remuneration Committee Chair at 
Bunzl. The need to refresh the Board but at the 
same time maintain a knowledgeable and 
experienced team of non-executive directors 
is something that the Committee continued to 
address in succession planning discussions 
during 2023. 

The Committee recognises that having the right 
directors and senior management, with the right 
capabilities, experience and Company and 
industry knowledge, is fundamental to the 
Group’s long term, sustainable success. In 
furtherance of this, a key responsibility of the 
Committee is to satisfy itself that a robust and 
rigorous succession planning process is in place, 
over both the medium and long term, to ensure 
there is the right mix of skills and experience on 
the Board as the Company evolves. The 
Company’s succession plans, together with the 
Board skills matrix and tenure tracker, are 
considered regularly. This allows the Committee 
to identify potential gaps, including in relation to 
director rotation and in respect of the skills 
needed to deliver the Group’s strategic priorities. 
Effective and proactive succession planning and 
assessment also enable the Committee and the 
Board to ensure that changes to the Board are 
proactively planned and coordinated. 

Enhancing the Committee’s oversight of executive 
succession planning continued to be a key priority 
for the Committee in 2023 and one which will 
continue to be an area of focus in 2024. The 
Committee also plans to deepen its discussions 
concerning the Board skills matrix, and executive 
succession requirements in the context of longer 
term strategic business requirements.

Recruitment
Appointments to the Board are subject to 
rigorous and transparent procedures, and 
the Committee plays a key role in these. 
The Committee oversees and makes 
recommendations to the Board in respect 
of the identification, assessment and selection 
of candidates for appointment. 

The Committee seeks to follow best practice in 
all the appointments it recommends, agreeing the 
criteria for each role and the most appropriate 
interview panel, before considering a 
comprehensive and diverse list of candidates. 
Shortlisted candidates are interviewed and 

assessed against the chosen criteria and due 
diligence is then undertaken before the 
Committee makes its final recommendation. 
Executive search firms are appointed based on 
their expertise relative to each role, with Russell 
Reynolds Associates being engaged in 2023. 
Russell Reynolds Associates do not provide any 
other services to, or have any connection with, 
the Company or its individual directors. Russell 
Reynolds Associates are a signatory to the 
Voluntary Code of Conduct for Executive Search 
Firms on gender diversity and best practice. 
An overview of the search and selection process 
undertaken in respect of the appointment of 
Jacky Simmonds can be found below.

Recruitment of Jacky Simmonds 

Role specification

The Committee developed a role specification and list of preferred skills, 
experience and characteristics for the new non-executive director.

Election of external 
search firm

Following a final review of the role specification, Russell Reynolds 
Associates was engaged as the external search firm.

NOMINATION COMMITTEE REPORT continued

Talent
The Committee takes an active interest in the 
quality and development of the talent and 
capabilities within Bunzl, ensuring that 
appropriate opportunities are in place to develop 
high-performing individuals. As part of its remit, 
during 2023, the Committee continued to monitor 
the development of Bunzl’s Executive Committee, 
which sits below the Board, to ensure that there is 
a diverse supply of senior executives and 
potential future Board members with appropriate 
skills and experience.

The Committee embraces the importance of 
diversity and inclusion in all Board and senior 
management recruitment and challenges external 
search consultants where necessary to ensure 
that diversity of gender, social and ethnic 
backgrounds and cognitive and personal 
strengths is always considered in the selection 
of candidates. In addition, the Committee seeks 
to engage firms that are signatories to the 
Voluntary Code of Conduct of Executive Search 
Firms and encourages them to look further afield 
and access talent from wide and diverse pools.

While taking the important considerations of 
gender and diversity into account, the Committee 
will continue to recommend appointments to the 
Board based on merit and the individual skills and 
experience of each candidate. It is nevertheless 
clear that gender, ethnicity, race and other 
forms of diversity and inclusion must remain 
key parts of our succession planning discussions 
and are critical to the long term sustainable 
success of the business.

The Board and the Committee’s approach to 
inclusion and diversity in respect of the Board and 
senior management is set out in the Board and 
Committee Diversity Policy, which is reviewed 
regularly and can be found on the Company’s 
website at www.bunzl.com. The Board 
Sustainability Committee refreshed the Board 
and Committee Diversity Policy in 2023, 
increasing the explicitly mentioned diversity 
characteristics and adding tangible targets that 
the Board will seek to continue to meet in future. 
Additional information concerning diversity and 
inclusion in Bunzl can be found in the 
Sustainability report on pages 44 to 62 and 
in the Our People section on page 36.

During the year, the Company completed annual 
talent and succession planning reviews with the 
Business Area Heads and HR Directors, a 
summary of which was discussed by the 
Committee. Additionally, the CEO presented his 
annual management succession plan to the 
Committee for its consideration. This included 
information on people review processes, 
functional talent development, specific emerging 
talent pipelines, diversity, equity and inclusion, 
and learning and development initiatives. This 
process ensures that high performing individuals 
within senior management can be developed and 
nurtured in order to strengthen the succession 
pipeline further, while at the same time increasing 
diversity in senior roles across the Group. The 
Committee also maintained regular interaction 
with senior management across the Group and 
within each business area. Such interaction 
enables the Committee to familiarise itself with 
the teams, thereby facilitating the identification 
of high performing talent and informing 
succession planning.

Inclusion and diversity
Boards with an appropriate mix of experience, 
backgrounds and perspectives are widely 
acknowledged to foster robust dialogue of 
differing views and be less susceptible to 
groupthink. The Committee strives to embed 
inclusion in everything that it does, and 
succession planning and the appointment 
process are key in promoting diversity in a way 
that is consistent with Bunzl’s long term strategy.

Performance against targets under LR 9.8.6

The Company is pleased to announce that it already meets the following diversity targets, at the 
reference date of 31 December 2023: 

I. 

 at least 40% of the individuals on the Board of directors are women;

  B.  the Chief Executive;

  C.  the Senior Independent Director; or

III.   at least one individual on the Board of directors is from a minority ethnic background.

BOARD SUSTAINABILITY COMMITTEE REPORT

Introduction from Peter Ventress
I am pleased to present the first report of the 
Board Sustainability Committee (the ‘BSC’) for 
the financial year ended 31 December 2023. This 
report provides an overview of the Committee’s 
responsibilities and activities throughout the year, 
and demonstrates how our work contributes to 
sustainable value creation for the Company and 
its stakeholders. 

Bunzl is on a journey with respect to 
sustainability, an area of critical strategic 
importance in which the Company aims to be an 
industry leader. Established in 2022, the 
Committee acts as an oversight function for the 
Group Sustainability Committee and provides 
strategic advice to the Board on the objectives, 
targets and priorities of the Group’s sustainability 
strategy. While principal responsibility for 
determining the sustainability strategy and its 
implementation remain decisions for the Board, 
the Committee supplements its work in this area 
to allow for more detailed consideration of 
sustainability-related risks and opportunities. 
This reflects the centrality of sustainability to 
Bunzl’s strategy and the Company’s recognition 
of the increasing importance of sustainability 
matters globally. 

This year, the Committee met three times and 
discussed a range of matters, details of which are 
set out later in this report. Our meetings are 
regularly attended by Bunzl’s Head of 
Sustainability and Director of Group HR who, 
throughout the year have provided valuable 
insights into ESG-related matters, including deep 
dives on the Company’s net zero transition plan, 
responsible sourcing at Bunzl, and the Company’s 
double materiality assessment in 2023 and 
beyond. These sessions have bolstered the 
Committee’s understanding of key sustainability 
issues at play within the Company, enabling the 
Committee to leverage its experience and 
expertise to have meaningful discussions and 
provide informed recommendations to the Board. 

Bunzl’s commitment to sustainability is a source 
of competitive advantage, encouraging innovation 
and long term decision making, aligned with our 
purpose-led strategy. During the year, the 
Committee helped the Company to deliver on this 
commitment by reviewing workstreams such as 
the proposed approach for Bunzl’s supplier 
engagement programme, considering an update 
on the Science Based Target initiative’s (‘SBTi’s’) 
Net Zero Standard (which has formed the basis of 
the Company’s net zero transition plan) and 
assessing performance against the Group’s 
carbon reduction and other sustainability targets. 
The Committee recognises that accountability and 
transparency are key to building trust in the 
Company’s sustainability efforts and endeavours 
to report effectively against sustainability-related 
targets. These disclosures and further 
information regarding Bunzl’s approach to 
sustainability can be found in the Sustainability 
report on pages 44 to 62.

During the year, the Committee also reviewed 
and updated the Board and Committee Diversity 
Policy to widen the diversity characteristics 
explicitly outlined for consideration and to 
incorporate the Company’s diversity targets, 
in relation to both Board and Committee 
appointments. A link to the Board and Committee 
Diversity Policy can be found on the Company’s 
website, www.bunzl.com.

The 2023 Board evaluation concluded that the 
Committee has come together well since its 
formation and I look forward to sustainability 
becoming even further embedded in our 
governance framework going forward.

Q&A:
with James Pitcher, Group Head of 
Sustainability

Q. How has the formation of the BSC 
influenced Bunzl’s governance of 
sustainability related issues?

Sustainability has always been a regular agenda 
item at Bunzl’s Board meetings, but the creation 
of the BSC has allowed for more time to be 
dedicated to discussion of sustainability-related 
matters and more frequent updates to be 
provided to the Board on the progress of our 
key initiatives. This allows Board members to 
consider sustainability-related issues in more 
detail and ask more questions on particular 
topics, for example the development of our 
net zero transition plan. 

The formation of the BSC has also facilitated 
deeper Board-level consideration of emerging 
issues, such as new sustainability reporting 
standards. The Committee’s oversight of this 
area ensures that Bunzl delivers on its 
commitment to clear and transparent 
disclosures and enhances the Group’s 
contribution to a more sustainable future. 

Q. What level of engagement does your team 
have with the BSC? 

As Group Head of Sustainability, I attend and 
present to the Board at Committee meetings, 
supported by other members of the team 
as necessary. 

I then provide updates from meetings to our 
regional sustainability teams so they can 
understand and act on the Committee’s 
feedback as appropriate.

Q. How does the BSC include stakeholder 
considerations in its discussions?

At Bunzl one of our key strengths is being able to 
offer our customers a tailored approach based 
on their individual needs. The local expertise 
and supply flexibility that our decentralised 
structure offers means we are perfectly placed 

to solve the individual problems our customers 
face rather than taking a ‘one size fits all’ 
approach to their sustainability challenges. 
For example, we can provide solutions to suit 
different types of regional or local packaging 
legislation that a customer with a national 
presence needs, and can tailor our deliveries 
to a customer’s network of sites to reduce 
carbon emissions. 

Since the formation of the BSC, we have been 
able to share feedback and examples from our 
customer’s perspectives with the Board and, 
in doing so, give Board members a greater 
appreciation of the sustainability-related 
priorities of our customers and how any issues 
are addressed across Bunzl’s decentralised 
business. The Board is then able to take these 
priorities and issues into consideration and 
make well-informed decisions with the interests 
of Bunzl’s key stakeholders in mind.

AUDIT COMMITTEE REPORT

Introduction from Lloyd Pitchford
I am pleased to present our Audit Committee 
report for the year ended 31 December 2023 
and welcome Jacky Simmonds, who was appointed 
on 1 March 2023, as a Committee member. The 
report provides an overview of the Committee’s 
role and demonstrates how our work contributes 
to the achievement of the Group’s purpose-led 
strategy, further information of which can be 
found on page 26.

Assuring the reliability of our reporting is critical 
to the Group’s long term success and to building 
trust with our stakeholders. The Committee 
assists the Board in fulfilling its responsibilities 
in this regard by monitoring areas such as the 
integrity of financial and non-financial reporting 
and the effectiveness of the risk management 
framework and system of internal controls.

During 2023, the Committee made good progress 
on the key areas of focus that were identified as 
part of its 2022 evaluation, further details of which 
are set out in the report that follows. The 
Committee continues to keep its activities under 
review to ensure they remain appropriate, and 
insights into the Committee’s priorities for the 
forthcoming year can be found on page 113.

External audit tender
In accordance with The Statutory Audit Services 
for Large Companies Market Investigation 
(Mandatory Use of Competitive Tender Processes 
and Audit Committee Responsibilities) Order 2014 
(the ‘CMA Order’), the Company is required to put 
its external audit contract out to tender every 10 
years. As PricewaterhouseCoopers LLP (‘PwC’) 
were appointed as Bunzl’s external auditors in 
2014, it was decided that a formal and competitive 
tender process, overseen by the Committee, 
would be carried out in 2023. 

The tender concluded with the Board accepting 
the Committee’s recommendation that, subject 
to shareholder approval at the Company’s 2024 
AGM, PwC be reappointed as the Company’s 
statutory auditors for the 2024 financial year. 
An overview of the tender process can be found 
on page 120.

Audit and corporate governance 
reforms
During 2023, the Committee monitored the 
draft Companies (Strategic Report and Directors’ 
Report) (Amendment) Regulations 2023 and 
undertook preparatory work to ensure that the 
Company would be well positioned to implement 
the new requirements. While the statutory 
instrument has been withdrawn, the principle of 
increasing the effectiveness of the Company’s risk 
management and internal controls systems 
remains a priority for the Committee.

In addition, the Audit Committees and the 
External Audit: Minimum Standard (the ‘Minimum 
Standard’) was issued by the Financial Reporting 
Council (the ‘FRC’) in 2023. Prior to its 
implementation, a gap analysis was undertaken 
to ensure that the Company’s current practices 
are in line with the requirements set out therein. 
Although the Minimum Standard is not currently 
mandated, I am pleased to share that the 
Company complies with its provisions.

The Committee is also aware of the amendments 
to the UK Corporate Governance Code, which 
were published by the FRC in January 2024. As 
mentioned in the Corporate governance report, 
a full review of the new requirements will be 
undertaken in 2024 and the Committee will report 
formally against the relevant provisions as they are 
brought into effect in 2025 and 2026.

Risk management, internal controls,  
and fraud risk
Bunzl’s internal controls environment is designed 
to protect the business from any material risks it 
faces. Overseen by the Committee, Bunzl’s 
Internal Controls Essentials programme was 
implemented in 2022 to address the UK 
government’s proposed reforms to the audit and 
corporate governance regime. Although some of 
the proposed reforms were withdrawn in October 
2023, the programme was implemented with a 
‘no-regrets’ approach and designed to support 
Bunzl’s growing businesses with a clear global 
framework and guidance but localised design 
and implementation. As such, core programme 

objectives around financial controls remain and 
implementation work continues. Progress in 
respect of the work carried out under the 
programme was considered at each Committee 
meeting during 2023 and the Committee is 
pleased with the positive impact that the 
programme has had on the Group’s risk and 
control environment. The Committee will review 
the Internal Controls Essentials programme 
approach and alignment with the relevant 
provisions of the revised Code in 2024, with 
a particular focus on non-financial controls.

The Internal Controls Essentials programme has 
also brought about more extensive and frequent 
reporting of fraud risk and, in 2023, the 
Committee evaluated a new cross-functional 
Fraud Response and Investigation Standard, 
developed in conjunction with a third party 
security firm. The standard was designed to 
supplement the Group Fraud Policy, which itself 
was refreshed in 2022, with the aim of advancing 
minimum standards and providing best practice 
guidelines on investigation activity. The impact 
of the new standard will be kept under review 
and risk management and internal controls will 
remain an area of focus for the Committee 
throughout 2024. 

Additional information on our governance of risk 
management and internal controls can be found 
later in this report and in the Corporate 
governance report on pages 116 to 117.

Information and cyber security
Bunzl’s information and cyber security 
programmes are vital to the sustainable success 
of the Group’s operations. Ensuring that robust 
and adaptable governance processes are in place 
to detect and respond to ever-evolving cyber 
security risks remained a key focus of the 
Committee in 2023. During the year, the 
Committee received regular updates on the 
Group’s information security internal controls 
framework from both the Group Chief Information 
Officer (‘Group CIO’) and the Group Chief 
Information Security Officer (‘Group CISO’), 
including the output from an externally facilitated 
cyber incident simulation.

AUDIT COMMITTEE REPORT continued

Additional information on the Group’s approach 
to information and cyber security is outlined later 
in this report on page 116.

Financial and non-financial reporting
During the year, the Finance function’s remit was 
expanded to include responsibility for the Internal 
Controls team, as well as ESG and non-financial 
reporting. This is a welcome development, which 
I believe will streamline the Group’s reporting 
processes and further enhance the quality of 
Bunzl’s disclosures. 

Monitoring the integrity of the Group’s financial 
and narrative reporting and the significant 
judgements contained therein continued to be 
a key priority in 2023. The Committee received 
regular updates on legal and regulatory 
developments relating to ESG and non-financial 
reporting and considered existing processes in 
the context of these new requirements and 
emerging best practice. The Committee is aware 
of incoming legislation, such as the Corporate 
Sustainability Reporting Directive, and will monitor 
developments in this area closely to ensure that 
it is well positioned to oversee and, where 
necessary, challenge, the Company’s plans and 
actions to comply therewith.

During the year, a letter was received from the 
Conduct Committee of the FRC relating to its 
limited scope review of the Company’s Annual 
Report for the year ended 31 December 2022. 
Further information was requested in relation to 
two principal areas. However, following our letter 
of response, no substantive changes were 
required to the Company’s disclosures.1

Internal Audit function
In accordance with the internal audit charter, the 
Company’s Internal Audit function was subject to 
a rigorous external quality assessment (‘EQA’) 
process in 2023, facilitated by an independent 
third party. The Committee considered and 
discussed the results of the assessment and I am 
pleased to report that, since the previous EQA, all 
actions identified to mature the approach and role 
of the function have been taken. Further details 
concerning the 2023 EQA process can be found 
on page 119.

Performance evaluation
I am pleased to report that the 2023 Board 
evaluation demonstrated that we are performing 
our duties effectively and providing robust 
challenge and support to management. Further 
information concerning the evaluation can be 
found in the Corporate governance report on 
page 103.

Additional disclosures on the Committee’s 
activities in 2023, and planned areas of focus in 
2024, can be found later in this report. I hope that 
this report and the insights it provides on the 
Committee’s activities assures you that we 
continue to approach our duties with rigour, 
integrity and transparency. 

Lloyd Pitchford  
Chair of the Audit Committee
26 February 2024

Composition and experience
The Committee comprises all of the independent 
non-executive directors, who were appointed to 
the Committee by the Board following 
recommendations by the Nomination Committee. 
The Secretary to the Committee is the 
Company Secretary. 

All members contribute to the work of the 
Committee and bring an appropriate balance of 
financial, risk management, commercial acumen 
and experience in multinational organisations, 
combined with a good understanding of the 
Company’s business and are therefore considered 
by the Board to be collectively competent in the 
sector in which the Company operates.

As the serving Chief Financial Officer of Experian 
plc, the Chair of the Committee, Lloyd Pitchford, is 
considered by the Board to have recent and 
relevant financial experience. The Committee 
members are of an independent mindset and 
bring a diversity of perspectives, knowledge and 
experience to the Committee’s deliberations, 
which in turn ensures that the Committee is able 
to provide an appropriate amount of scrutiny, 
challenge and support to management. 
Independent thinking is an essential aspect of the 
Committee’s role and is crucial in assessing the 
work of management and the assurance provided 
by the internal and external audit functions. 
Further information concerning the directors’ skills 
and experience can be found in the Corporate 
governance report on pages 90 to 92.

1. 

 The FRC makes suggestions, where it believes the users of the accounts would benefit from improvements to the Company’s existing 
disclosures. Each year, the Company considers any suggestions made by the FRC in preparing the Company’s Annual Report. The 
Company recognises that the FRC’s review was based on a review of its Annual Report for the year ended 31 December 2022 and did 
not benefit from detailed knowledge of the Company’s business or an understanding of the underlying transactions entered into. 
The FRC’s review provides no assurance that the Company’s Annual Report is correct in all material respects; the FRC’s role is not to 
verify the information provided but to consider compliance with reporting requirements.

AUDIT COMMITTEE REPORT continued

Role and support
The role of the Audit Committee is to act 
independently of management to safeguard 
the interests of stakeholders in relation to the 
Company’s financial reporting and internal 
controls arrangements. A fundamental part 
of this role is ensuring that the Company has 
effective governance over the Group’s financial 
reporting, including the adequacy of related 
disclosures, the performance of both the internal 
and external audit functions and the management 
of the Group’s systems of internal controls and 
business risk management and related 
compliance activities.

The Committee provides appropriate oversight, 
review and challenge of the decisions and 
approach taken by management in respect of the 
content and disclosures within the Company’s 
financial reports, including considering whether 
such disclosures are set properly in context.

In the performance of its duties, the Committee 
has independent access to the services of the 
Company’s internal audit function and to the 
external auditors and may obtain outside 
professional advice as necessary. 

The Committee’s terms of reference, which were 
reviewed by both the Committee and the Board 
in 2023, are available on the Company’s website, 
www.bunzl.com.

Training and briefings
Throughout 2023, the Committee considered 
market updates and developments to ensure that 
it was fully cognisant of matters that may affect 
the Group and its operations. This included:

•  Internal Controls Essentials programme and 
fraud updates at every Committee meeting;

•  review of non-financial reporting and 

assurance;

•  updates on the proposed UK corporate 

governance and audit reforms;

•  information security updates;

•  PwC Audit Committee training, including:

Principal responsibilities of the 
Committee

 − accounting update;

 − corporate reporting & governance update; 

and

 − regulatory and public policy matters.

Stakeholder engagement
Our relationship with our stakeholders is a 
fundamental driver of value creation and we place 
considerable importance on ensuring that we are 
aware of and understand their views and 
sentiments. The Committee Chair avails himself 
of all opportunities to engage with Bunzl’s 
stakeholders when appropriate in order to obtain 
their feedback and discuss any concerns that they 
may have concerning the Committee’s operations 
and oversight. In 2023, members of the 
Committee, including the Chair, proactively 
reached out to various institutional shareholders 
to solicit meetings to discuss the work of the 
Committee and to answer any questions that the 
shareholders may have concerning matters within 
the Committee’s remit. Additional information on 
this engagement can be found of page 102.

While the results of the Company’s proactive 
engagement with stakeholders during the year 
did not identify any concerns relating to the 
Group’s risk profile and management thereof, or 
the Committee’s discharge of its responsibilities, 
this is not taken for granted and the Committee 
will continue to monitor stakeholder sentiment 
closely and ensure that engagement is sought 
whenever it is needed. The Chair of the 
Committee will also be attending the Company’s 
forthcoming AGM to answer any questions that 
shareholders may have. Further information 
concerning stakeholder engagement can be 
found on pages 64 to 67.

Financial and narrative reporting

•  Monitoring and reviewing the integrity of the 
Group’s financial and narrative reporting and 
the significant judgements contained therein

•  Reviewing non-financial reporting measures, 
including non-financial KPIs, for inclusion in 
the Annual Report

Risk management and internal controls

•  Reviewing:

 − the Group’s risk management processes, 

procedures and controls; 

 − the effectiveness of the Company’s internal 
controls systems including operational, 
compliance and financial controls; and

 − the assurance activities relating to financial 

and non-financial reporting matters.

Internal audit

•  Overseeing the Company’s internal audit 

activities

•  Monitoring and reviewing the effectiveness 

of the internal audit function

External audit

•  Making recommendations to the Board in 

relation to the appointment/reappointment/
removal of the external auditors

•  Reviewing the Company’s relationship with 
the external auditors and monitoring their 
independence and objectivity

•  Agreeing the scope, terms of engagement 

and fees for the statutory audit

•  Initiating and supervising a competitive 
tender process for the external audit as 
required from time to time

•  Developing and implementing a policy on the 

engagement of the external auditors to 
supply non-audit services

Financial statements and significant 
accounting matters
During the year and prior to the publication of the 
Group’s results for 2023, the Committee spent 
considerable time reviewing and scrutinising the 
2023 half year financial report and related news 
release, the 2023 Annual Report (including the 
financial statements), the 2023 annual results 
news release and the reports from the external 
auditors on the outcomes of their half year review 
and their audit relating to 2023. Management was 
challenged, where appropriate, on matters such 
as the appropriateness of accounting policies, 
critical accounting judgements and key accounting 
estimates. The appropriateness of the Group’s 
external reporting framework and use of 
alternative performance measures (‘APMs’) were 
also assessed, with the Committee concluding 
that it is satisfied that the APMs reviewed are 
consistent with market practice, and that 
disclosure and reconciliation to statutory 
measures is appropriate. In conjunction with the 
Board, the Committee reviewed the financial 
modelling and stress testing conducted for the 
going concern assessment, as well as the viability 
assessment process undertaken in support of the 
long term viability statement. The Committee also 
challenged the assumptions and scenarios, 
noting the effect they would have during the 
viability period, further details of which can be 
found on page 77. 

As part of its work, the Committee considered 
a number of significant accounting matters in 
relation to the Company’s financial statements, 
together with the adequacy of the associated 
disclosures. These significant accounting matters 
are summarised in the table below and further 
information can be found in the relevant notes 
to the consolidated financial statements. The 
Committee believes that the significant 
accounting matters have been properly recorded 
in the Company’s books and records and 
accounted for appropriately, including relevant 
disclosure in the Annual Report.

Matter

Review and conclusion

Accounting for business 
combinations

For business combinations, the Group has a long-standing process for the identification of the fair values of the assets acquired and liabilities assumed, including separate 
identification of intangible assets using external valuation specialists where required. The Committee reviewed this process and discussed with management and the external 
auditors the methodology and assumptions used to value the assets and liabilities of the acquisitions completed in 2023. The Committee concluded that it was satisfied with 
management’s valuations of these assets and liabilities, including the degree to which such valuations are supported by professional advice from external advisers. For 
business combinations where less than 100% of the issued share capital of a subsidiary is acquired and the acquisition includes put and call options over the remaining share 
capital of the subsidiary, the Group has an established process to assess whether a non-controlling interest should be recognised. There were six such business combinations 
during the year. The Committee reviewed the Group’s assessment of these si business combinations, noting that no non-controlling interest had been recognised. The 
Committee concurred with management’s conclusion that the risks and rewards associated with the options to purchase the remaining shares had transferred to the Group 
on each acquisition. Details of the Company’s approach to accounting for acquisitions are set out in Note 9 to the consolidated financial statements.

The carrying value of 
goodwill, customer 
relationships and brands 
intangible assets

Goodwill is allocated to cash generating units (‘CGUs’) and is tested annually for impairment. The Committee critically reviewed and discussed management’s report on the 
impairment testing of the carrying value of goodwill of each of the Group’s CGUs. The Committee also critically reviewed and discussed management’s consideration of the 
impairment risk relating to customer relationships, brands and technology intangible assets. In both regards, the Committee considered the sensitivity of the outcome of 
impairment testing to the use of different assumptions and considered the external auditors’ testing thereof.

After due challenge and debate, the Committee concluded that it was satisfied with the assumptions and judgements applied in relation to the impairment testing and agreed 
that there was no impairment of goodwill or customer relationships, brands and technology intangible assets. Details of the key assumptions and judgements used are set out 
in Note 13 to the consolidated financial statements.

Defined benefit pension 
schemes

The Committee considered reports from management and the external auditors in relation to the valuation of the defined benefit pension schemes and reviewed the key 
actuarial assumptions used in calculating the defined benefit pension liabilities, especially in relation to discount rates, inflation rates and mortality/life expectancy. The 
Committee discussed the reasons for the movement in the net pension surplus and was satisfied that the assumptions used were appropriate and were supported by 
independent actuarial experts.

Inventory and receivable 
provisions

The Committee considered the analysis from management detailing the provision percentages and reconciliation of the provision balance from 31 December 2022 to 
31 December 2023 and noted that, during the year, the Group had a net utilisation of approximately £25 million in trade receivables and slow-moving inventory provisions, 
with usage of these provisions exceeding net charges to increase the provisions.

The Committee also noted that the Group had some utilisation of the additional provisions set up in the prior year as a result of market price movements on certain 
Covid-19 products.

AUDIT COMMITTEE REPORT continued

Risk management
The Board approves the Group’s risk management 
framework and sets the risk appetite, which in 
turn guides management to proactively identify, 
monitor, and manage the material and emerging 
risks that could impact Bunzl. During 2023, the 
Committee continued its regular review of risk 
reporting to ensure the balance between risk and 
opportunity remained in line with the Group’s risk 
appetite and tolerance.

In 2023, the Committee reviewed the process by 
which significant current and emerging risks had 
been identified by management and the Board, 
the key controls and other processes designed to 
manage and mitigate such risks, including the 
assurance provided by the internal audit function, 
the external auditors and other oversight from 
management and the Board. The Committee uses 
a number of tools to review the Group’s risk 
management processes, including the Group’s 
Risk and Assurance Map. These tools are reviewed 
regularly to ensure that they remain fit for 
purpose and continue to meet the needs of the 
business. External assurance reviews, which are 
focused on the maturity of the Group’s risk 
management procedures, are held every five 
years, with the latest taking place in 2022. In 2023, 
the Committee reviewed the output of annual 
internal reviews of the maturity of the Group’s risk 
management procedures, which have been used 
to develop the Group’s ERM framework further 
and set goals for the future.

Cyber risk 
We have continued to strengthen our cyber 
security controls and governance in recent years 
in response to the increasing threat cyber risks 
pose to our businesses, including further 
developing our security policies, practices and 
training. We have remained focused on increasing 
the maturity of our cyber security capabilities and 
have invested heavily in the resources and 
initiatives necessary to maintain and improve our 
information security framework, including 
preventative technologies such as end point 
detection systems, user training and carrying out 
regular health checks and testing. 

We believe that having an overlapping strategy 
based on security tools, people, and processes 
yields the most effective defences. Our layered 
approach to cyber security provides multiple 
opportunities for threats to be identified and 
addressed before they can cause significant harm.

Fundamental to the success of our digital security 
and strategy is our digital security culture, which is 
fostered and embedded through several 
channels. We recognise that a culture of security 
has to start at the top and the Board and 
Committees lead by example by dedicating 
considerable time and attention to the risks 
associated with cyber and information security. 
The Group CIO, Group CISO and the Head of 
Internal Audit and Risk are regularly invited to 
Committee meetings to give an assessment of 
cyber risk and provide updates on the measures 
being taken by management to mitigate the cyber 
and information security risks and other evolving 
threats faced by the business. 

Making security a part of everyone’s 
responsibilities is a key part of instilling Bunzl’s 
security culture and seeing senior management 
embody the security culture through their words 
and actions has been an important part of this. 
Regular communications and presentations from 
the Group CIO and Group CISO also increase 
employees’ awareness and understanding of 
cyber risks and reinforce the significance security 
has for the entire Group. Similar to many large 
companies, Bunzl is the subject of regular cyber 
threats and attacks, none of which were 
considered material and all of which were 
managed effectively by our Group Information 
Security teams in 2023.

In 2023, the Committee received reports on a 
cyber incident simulation exercise facilitated by a 
third party. A cross-functional group undertook 
the exercise, considering how they would address 
the simulated incident at each stage of the 
process. At the end of the simulation, key 
learnings and future actions were summarised 
with additional feedback provided by the third 
party to further improve each function’s approach 
to addressing potential cyber security incidents.

The Committee also received updates on the 
Group’s information security risk assessment 
process and an internal controls overview, 
supported by a detailed internal audit of the 
current information security internal controls 
framework. External assurance reviews of our 
information security systems are undertaken 
regularly, with the last review being carried out in 
2022, and the next one scheduled for 2024.

We believe that having an overlapping strategy 
based on security tools, people, and processes 
yields the most effective defences. Our layered 
approach to cyber security provides multiple 
opportunities for threats to be identified and 
addressed before they can cause significant harm.

Internal controls
The Group has an internal controls environment 
designed to protect the business from the 
material risks which have been identified. 
Management is responsible for establishing and 
maintaining adequate internal controls and the 
Committee has responsibility for ensuring the 
effectiveness of those controls. These controls 
and procedures are designed to manage, but not 
eliminate, the risk of failure of the Company to 
meet its business objectives and, as such, provide 
reasonable, but not absolute, assurance against 
material misstatement or loss. 

The Committee monitored the effectiveness of 
the internal financial controls framework through 
reports from the Chief Financial Officer (‘CFO’), the 
Group Financial Controller, the Head of Internal 
Audit and Risk and the external auditors. In 
particular, the Committee considered the scope 
and results of the work of internal audit, the 
findings of the external auditors in relation to the 
year end audit, management’s assessment of 
fraud risk, the controls over the Company’s 
financial consolidation and reporting process, 
treasury controls, tax risks and the process for 
monitoring the ongoing performance of the 
Company. It is the responsibility of management 
to provide confirmation that the controls and 
processes are being adhered to throughout the 
business and this is continually tested by the work 
of the internal audit function as part of its annual 
plan of work, which the Committee approves. 
Compliance with the internal controls system is 
monitored via an annual internal controls 
self-assessment with sign-off and review of key 
financial and non-financial controls for all 
businesses. Self-assessed responses are 
challenged locally by business area internal 
controls teams, reviewed centrally and audited on 
a sample basis by the internal audit function, and 
reported to the Committee. 

Following each Committee meeting, any 
significant findings are reported to the Board 
and copies of the minutes of the Committee 
meetings are circulated to all directors and 
to the external auditors.

The Committee Chair attends the AGM to respond 
to any shareholder questions that might be raised 
concerning the Committee’s activities.

A summary of the Committee’s key activities in 
2023 and its priorities for 2024 can be found on 
page 118 and page 113 respectively. The 
Committee will continue to keep its activities under 
review and adapt them wherever necessary in 
anticipation of, and in response to, developments 
within the business and changes in the financial 
reporting, regulatory and governance landscape.

The Committee also oversaw the Group’s Internal 
Controls Essentials programme, which aims to 
further develop the Group’s internal controls 
framework for financial reporting. As part of this 
programme, a Group Steering Committee works 
to further the strategy and monitor progress 
against key programme deliverables. In 2024, the 
Committee will review the Internal Controls 
Essentials programme to ensure it is aligned to 
the FRC’s revised Code, including in respect of 
non-financial controls.

Having reviewed the process by which 
management assessed the control environment, 
in accordance with the requirements of the 
Guidance on Risk Management, Internal Controls 
and related Financial and Business Reporting 
published by the FRC, the Committee confirms 
that the system of internal controls operated 
effectively for the 2023 financial year. Where 
specific areas for improvement were identified, 
mitigating alternative controls and processes 
were in place. This allows us to provide positive 
assurance to the Board to help fulfil its obligations 
under the FRC’s UK Corporate Governance Code.

Further information on internal controls and risk 
management is included in the Corporate 
governance report on pages 104 to 105. 
Additional information concerning the Group’s 
approach to risk management and the principal 
risks and uncertainties that it faces can also be 
found on pages 68 to 76. 

Meetings and activities
Committee meetings are generally scheduled 
close to Board meetings in order to facilitate an 
effective and timely reporting process.

The Committee has a structured, rolling, forward-
looking planner which is developed with the 
Company Secretary and is designed to both 
ensure that the Committee’s responsibilities are 
discharged in full during the year, and to facilitate 
more in-depth reviews of those topics which are 
of particular importance or pertinence. Items on 
the agenda are set with consideration of 
regulatory requirements, the Company’s 
reporting timetable and after considering key 
issues identified by the CFO, management, the 
Head of Internal Audit and Risk and the external 
auditors. 

The forward agenda planner is reviewed regularly 
and adapted, where necessary, to ensure that it 
meets the changing needs of the business. 

The Chair of the Committee holds preparatory 
discussions with the Company’s senior 
management, the Head of Internal Audit and Risk 
and the external auditors prior to Committee 
meetings to discuss the items to be considered at 
the meetings. The Committee Chair also meets 
individually throughout the year with Committee 
members to obtain their feedback on the areas of 
Committee focus. Separate discussions are held 
periodically during Committee meetings between 
the Committee and the Head of Internal Audit and 
Risk and the external auditors without 
management present.

AUDIT COMMITTEE REPORT continued

Internal audit
The work of the internal audit function provides 
the Committee with a further means of 
monitoring the processes and actions to manage 
and mitigate those risks identified as posing the 
greatest threat to the Company.

The scope of work covers all systems and 
activities of the Group and work is prioritised 
according to the Company’s risk profile. The 
internal audit plan is approved by the Committee 
annually and is reviewed regularly thereafter to 
ensure that it continues to be fit for purpose and 
to enable the Committee to assess how internal 
audit is delivering against the plan. 

The quality and effectiveness of the internal audit 
function’s work is monitored continually using a 
variety of formal and informal inputs, including 
discussions with management, reviews and 
assessments of the quality of testing results and 
reporting, questionnaires, and feedback from the 
external auditors. This year, an externally 
facilitated evaluation of the effectiveness of the 
internal audit function was undertaken by a 
third party.

The external audit partner and the Head of 
Internal Audit and Risk attend and table reports at 
each scheduled Audit Committee meeting, which 
ensures that the Committee members have the 
opportunity to provide real-time feedback and, 
where appropriate, challenge in relation to all 
audit related matters. The internal audit reports 
include details of the audit findings, the relevant 
management actions required in order to address 
any issues arising, as well as updates on 
management’s progress in addressing any 
outstanding recommendations from previously 
reported findings. The reports also highlight any 
significant issues relating to the processes for 
controlling the activities of the Group and the 
adequacy and effectiveness of such processes. 

A detailed questionnaire is circulated annually to 
gather feedback from a broad range of internal 
stakeholders, including directors and senior 
management at Group and business area levels 
who have regular contact with the internal audit 
function. In 2023, the questionnaire covered a 

total of 35 different aspects of the internal audit 
function, including: purpose, authority and 
responsibility; independence, objectivity and 
proficiency; quality assurance processes; 
adequacy of resources; auditors’ skills and 
capabilities; and the quality of reporting. Taking 
all of these elements into account, the Committee 
concluded that the Internal Audit function 
continued to be effective, efficient and 
appropriately resourced.

The Head of Internal Audit and Risk has direct 
access to the Committee Chair, with whom a 
number of meetings were held during the year 
outside formal Committee meetings. The Chair 
of the Committee also liaises with the CFO as 
necessary to ensure robust oversight and 
challenge in relation to financial control and risk 
management and to ensure that the Committee 
is kept informed of any changes in response to 
new issues or changing circumstances.

In 2023, the Committee considered an external 
quality assessment report on the Internal Audit 
function. The findings of the report were positive, 
revealing that the function benefitted from 
support from the Board, had embedded quality 
assurance processes, and engaged effectively 
with the business while maintaining 
independence and objectivity. The report outlined 
actions to further strengthen and mature the 
Internal Audit function, all of which will be 
addressed as part of the function’s future work 
programme. The Committee will carry out an 
internal effectiveness review of the Internal Audit 
function in 2024.

External auditors
An important part of the Committee’s work 
consists of overseeing the Group’s relationship 
with the external auditors. The Committee is 
responsible for ensuring that the three-way 
relationship between the Committee, the external 
auditors and the Company’s management is 
appropriate and that the independence, quality, 
rigour, and challenge of the external audit process 
is maintained. 

As part of its decision making process concerning 
whether to tender, offer, or continue an audit 
engagement, there are a number of key 
considerations that the Committee takes into 
account, the principal elements of which are set 
out below and on pages 120 to 121.

Details of the fees paid to the external auditors 
in 2023 in respect of the audit and for non-audit 
services are set out in Note 5 to the consolidated 
financial statements. The fees relating to 
non-audit services work in 2023 equated to 7.2% 
of the fees relating to audit services.

Conflicts of interest
In assessing the independence of the auditors 
from the Company, the Committee takes into 
account the information and assurances provided 
by the auditors confirming that all its partners and 
staff involved with the audit are independent of 
any links to the Company.

PwC confirmed during the year that all its 
partners and staff complied with its ethics and 
independence policies and procedures which are 
consistent with the FRC’s Revised Ethical Standard 
(2019) and other relevant regulatory and 
professional requirements, including that none of 
its employees working on Bunzl’s audit hold any 
shares in Bunzl plc. PwC is required to provide an 
independence confirmation letter at the 
completion stage of the audit, including any 
relationships that may reasonably be thought to 
have an impact on its independence and the 
integrity and objectivity of the audit engagement 
partner and the audit staff.

Non-audit services
Bunzl has a detailed policy relating to the 
provision of non-audit services by the external 
auditors which is overseen by the Committee.  
It is the Company’s policy to assess the non-audit 
services to be performed by the Company’s 
auditors on a case-by-case basis to ensure 
adherence to the prevailing ethical standards 
and regulations.

Principally, Bunzl uses other firms to provide 
non-audit services. However, if the provision of 
a service by the Company’s auditors is permitted 
and adequate safeguards are in place, it is 
sometimes appropriate for this additional work 
to be carried out by the Company’s auditors. 

Tenure and effectiveness
The Committee takes into account the tenure of 
the auditors in addition to the results of its review 
of the effectiveness of the external auditors and 
considers whether there should be a full tender 
process, either as a result of that review or as may 
be required by the relevant regulations. As 
previously mentioned, a tender process for the 
external audit was undertaken in 2023 and an 
overview of this process can be found on the 
following page. There are no contractual 
obligations restricting the Committee’s choice of 
external auditors. The Company confirms that it 
has complied with the provisions of the CMA 
Order for the 2023 financial year.

Given the continuing effectiveness of PwC in its 
role as external auditors, the Committee believes 
it is in the best interests of shareholders for PwC 
to remain in the role for the next year. Neil Grimes 
took over the position as audit partner with effect 
from 1 January 2019 and remained the audit 
partner throughout 2023. Having acted as audit 
partner to the Company for five years, Neil Grimes 
will rotate off as audit partner in 2024, being 
replaced by Simon Morley, in line with the Auditing 
Practices Board’s Ethical Standards.

The Committee was satisfied with the results of its 
review of the external auditors’ activities, and 
performance throughout the tender process, 
during the year. The Committee has therefore 
recommended to the Board, that a resolution 
proposing the reappointment of PwC as external 
auditors for the year ending 31 December 2024 
be put to shareholders at the forthcoming AGM. 
Additional information on the 2023 external 
auditor effectiveness review can be found on 
page 121.

AUDIT COMMITTEE REPORT continued

External audit tender process

Scope
Bunzl is required to undertake an external audit tender every 
10 years and rotate audit firms every 20 years. Given PwC 
was appointed in 2014, the Audit Committee initiated and 
supervised a competitive tender process for the Company’s 
external audit. The Committee approved a project plan for the 
tender and the selection criteria that would be used.

A Selection Panel comprising the individuals listed below was 
established to facilitate the tender process:

Members

Lloyd Pitchford

Peter Ventress

Vin Murria OBE

Pam Kirby

Richard Howes

Ian Burrows

Chair of the Audit Committee

Chairman of the Board

Non-executive director

Non-executive director

Chief Financial Officer

Group Financial Controller

The Selection Panel was responsible for identifying audit firms to 
potentially participate in the tender and subsequently evaluating 
participating firms’ performance using transparent and 
non-discriminatory criteria. Committee members were involved 
throughout the tender process, with regular updates being 
provided by the Selection Panel. Participating firms were 
provided with an information pack covering key information 
about the Group and were provided access to discussions with 
senior managers at Group and local business level.

Evaluation
All members of the Selection Panel attended oral presentations 
by candidate firms held at the Bunzl plc registered office on 
9 June 2023.

The resources that were available to the Selection Panel in the 
evaluation process included the proposal documents received 
from the three candidate firms, the feedback received from 
Bunzl management following the meetings with each firms’ 
representatives, an extract from the FRC’s published quality 
reviews of each firm and an analysis of the fees proposed by 
each firm in relation to proposed audit scopes.

The Selection Panel evaluated the proposals according to five 
non-financial criteria:

•  audit firm capability and service delivery;
•  audit team capability;
•  understanding our business;
•  audit approach and materiality; and
•  audit quality.

The candidate firm fee proposals were also considered in the 
context of whether they were competitive and offered strong 
value to Bunzl, although the principal focus of the evaluation 
was on maximising future audit quality. 

Decision
A report setting out the results of the evaluation was presented 
to the Committee by the Selection Panel. 

Having considered the report, the Committee submitted two 
possible audit firm options to the Board, with PwC being the 
preferred candidate.

Key factors in the decision to recommend the reappointment of PwC 
included:

•  strong performance against the evaluation criteria;
•  continuity in the audit approach and experience of working 

with Bunzl;

•  understanding of Bunzl’s culture and decentralised business;
•  a demonstrable desire to evolve and improve the existing audit 

approach; and

•  detailed improvement proposals and recommendations to the 

non-financial audit approach.

The recommendation made by the Committee to the Board was 
free from third party influence and there were no contractual 
restrictions on the choice of auditor. 

After due consideration, the Board approved the reappointment 
of PwC as the Company’ statutory auditors for the 2024 financial 
year. The reappointment is subject to shareholder approval at 
the Company’s 2024 AGM.

The Committee will continue to undertake annual effectiveness 
reviews of the external auditors’ performance and consider the 
FRC’s annual Audit Quality Inspection and Supervision reports.

Tender response requirements
The Audit Committee Chair reviewed and 
approved the invitation to tender letter and 
tender response requirements. Large and 
challenger firms were invited to participate in the 
tender process; however, due to the size and 
geographical spread of the Group, none of the 
challenger firms accepted the invitation. 
Participating firms were required to submit a draft 
audit plan and audit proposal.

Draft audit plan
•  Demonstrates an understanding of Bunzl’s 

business and risks

•  Outlines a proposed audit approach, 

Audit proposal
•  Demonstrates capability to serve clients of 
large and international scope of similar 
complexity to Bunzl

specifically considering the 2024 half year 
review and year end audit

•  Details the experience and technical 

capabilities of the service teams

•  Includes an audit plan of the Company’s 

•  Demonstrates independence and quality, 

non-financial data

including the FRC audit quality record

•  Outlines an approach to auditing specific 
business geographies including North 
America, Continental Europe and the UK

•  Outlines the firm’s approach to resolving 
accounting and financial reporting issues

•  Outlines the firm’s available expertise relating 
to the reporting of sustainability and other 
non-financial information

The draft audit plans and the audit proposals 
were a key source of information outlining the 
capability of shortlisted firms and were used by 
the Committee and Selection Panel in the 
evaluation process.

AUDIT COMMITTEE REPORT continued

Effectiveness of the statutory external audit process

PwC presented the Committee with its detailed audit plan for 
the forthcoming financial year, which outlined its audit scope, 
planning materiality and its assessment of key audit risks. The 
identification of key audit risks is critical in the overall 
effectiveness of the external audit process. 

The Committee was provided with updates on PwC’s progress 
against the audit scope at subsequent Committee meetings, 
providing Committee members with the opportunity to 
challenge management and PwC and raise questions where 
necessary. 

As part of the ongoing monitoring process, the Committee 
considers the results of any periodic reviews by the FRC’s Audit 
Quality Review Team of PwC’s audit of the Company, as well as 
the results of the FRC’s reviews of PwC’s audits more broadly, 
and challenges PwC to ensure continuous improvement.

In assessing the adequacy of the audit plan, the Committee 
considers and, where necessary, challenges the auditors on 
how far the scope of the audit addresses the Board’s 
assessment of risks.

Regular dialogue between the Committee and the auditors 
ensures that any significant issues are identified, and the 
appropriate audit responses are discussed, at the earliest 
opportunity. The external auditors also have direct access to the 
Chair of the Committee who held a number of meetings with 
PwC during the year outside formal Committee meetings.

Prior to the Board’s approval of the annual financial statements, 
the Committee provided the Board with its views on the 
outcome of the statutory audit. Such feedback generally covers: 
the outcome of the auditors’ assessment of key audit matters; 
management’s key accounting issues and judgements; other 
areas of audit focus; and how the statutory audit has 
contributed to the integrity of the financial reporting process. 

The Committee also discusses the outcome of any quality 
monitoring processes that may have been undertaken by the 
auditors’ own firm, including any lessons learnt and the actions 
taken to address those areas identified for improvement.

Following the completion of the audit, those involved in the 
process were invited to provide feedback on PwC’s 
performance. This involved the completion of a questionnaire 
by the Committee members, key members of senior 
management and those who regularly provide input into the 
Committee or have regular contact with the auditors. 

The questionnaire covered a total of 24 different aspects of the 
external audit process, grouped under four separate headings: 
the robustness of the audit process; the quality of delivery; the 
quality of people and service; and the quality of reporting. The 
responses were collated and a summary was presented to the 
Committee for consideration.

During the year, private meetings were held between the 
Committee and PwC without management present to 
encourage open and honest feedback by both parties on any 
matters they wished to raise. This afforded the Committee the 
opportunity to obtain greater insight concerning the extent to 
which management’s analysis and presentation of information 
had been challenged by the auditors.

Based on the feedback received and the results of the Committee’s ongoing audit monitoring throughout the year, the Committee 
concluded that PwC had demonstrated appropriate focus and challenge on the primary areas of the audit and had applied robust 
challenge and scepticism throughout the process, with additional measures for further enhancement encouraged.

DIRECTORS’ REMUNERATION REPORT

Introduction from Vanda Murray
I am pleased to present the Directors’ 
remuneration report for the year ended 
31 December 2023. As we are seeking 
shareholder approval of our directors’ 
remuneration policy (‘Policy’) at the forthcoming 
AGM, it has been a particularly busy year for the 
Committee; we have undertaken an extensive and 
very helpful shareholder consultation exercise in 
addition to the usual business of setting pay and 
assessing performance. It has also been my last 
full year as chair of the Committee and I will be 
handing over Chair responsibilities to Jacky 
Simmonds following the 2024 AGM.

Context of remuneration
2023 continued to provide a challenging 
performance context for Bunzl. The Group has 
faced the dual headwinds of ongoing post-
pandemic product deflation in some parts of the 
world and continuing high cost inflation in others. 
We have also been managing the impact of a 
continuing tight labour market and the pressures 
of a cost of living crisis which has impacted 
consumer demand for some products and 
therefore customer behaviour. 

Amidst all these challenges Bunzl’s business 
performance was strong. Although the pressure 
of deflation and the continuation of post-Covid 
normalisation meant that revenues were slightly 
down, disciplined cost management coupled with 
a strong focus on margin and working capital 
meant that we improved our adjusted operating 
profit by 6.2% at constant exchange.

We were also able to make significant progress 
with our strategic objectives. 19 acquisitions 
were completed during the year, and with the 
acquisition of Pamark in January 2024 we have 
added two more countries to our global presence. 
We continued our progress against our 
sustainability goals, including the expansion 
of our audit programme in high risk countries, 
the engagement of our key suppliers on the 
measurement of scope 3 carbon emissions, 
and the increase in leadership roles occupied 
by females.

In summary, the Group has delivered another 
strong set of all-round business results, and this 
has been reflected in the outturns for both the 
annual bonus, the final performance shares 
granted in 2020, and the first cycle of the 
Restricted Share Awards granted in April 2021.

Performance and reward for 2023
Annual bonus
Annual bonus payments were based on a 
combination of key financial measures (70%) 
comprising adjusted earnings per share (‘eps’), 
return on average operating capital (‘RAOC’) and 
operating cash flow, with 20% based on personal 
objectives and 10% on ESG objectives. In setting 
our incentive targets, we have regard to the 
performance potential of the different parts of 
the business and of the whole Group. The 
on-target performance level for the financial 
elements of the bonus for 2023 was set at, or 
close to, the budgeted level of performance. The 
personal and ESG objectives selected are closely 
aligned to the strategic priorities for the business 
and are clearly measurable. 

The Committee’s evaluation of the annual bonus 
targets resulted in a payment of 89.8% of 
maximum for Frank van Zanten and 89.8% of 
maximum for Richard Howes. As outlined above, 
this was a strong all-round performance from the 
business and the leadership team and the 
Committee is confident that the variable pay 
awarded has been aligned with this performance. 
On the financial elements, no discretion was 
applied by the Committee to adjust the bonus 
outcomes, as overall payments reflected business 
performance. The Committee conducted a 
detailed review of the evidence to support the 
evaluation of the personal and ESG objectives. 
In line with the Policy, 50% of the annual bonuses 
will be delivered in shares, subject to a three year 
deferral period. 

Long Term Incentive Plans (‘LTIPs’)
Under the previous 2020 Policy, our practice was 
to grant both market value share options (LTIP A) 
and performance shares (LTIP B). Performance 
shares were granted biannually with half the 
award subject to eps growth and half to relative 
Total Shareholder Return. The eps element of the 
awards granted in April and October 2020 
concluded on 31 December 2022 and was 
reported in last year’s report. The TSR element 
concluded in the 2023 financial year based on 
performance to 31 March and 30 September 
2023. Bunzl’s TSR of 68.7% and 30.2% respectively 
resulted in vestings of 100% (April 2020 award 
and 75.19% (October 2020 award). As noted last 
year, the Committee was also satisfied that there 
had been no ‘windfall’ gain in these awards as the 
original grants were made in both the spring and 
the autumn and the average grant prices during 
2020 were less than 10% below 2019 prices. 

The first Restricted Share Awards (‘RSAs’) were 
granted in 2021 and will vest in April 2024 based 
on satisfaction of the performance underpin (as 
worded in the 2021 policy) relating to the period 1 
January 2021 to 31 December 2023. Having 
reviewed the wide range of financial and non-
financial metrics in the underpin and having 
identified no material underperformance, risk 
issues or regulatory failures, I can confirm that the 
Committee has determined that these shares 
should vest in full. Specific factors considered in 
assessing the underpin for this award included:

•  Financial health of the business (revenue, 

profitability, cashflow, returns)

•  Delivery of strategic priorities

•  Stakeholder experience

•  Progress towards ESG goals

More detail can be found on page 140

Shareholders should note that reporting 
requirements mean that both the 2020 LTIP B 
awards and the 2021 restricted share awards are 
included in the Single Figure table for 2023 in this 
report. This means that the total remuneration 
shown for both directors is artificially high this 
year. This will be normalised in 2024’s report.

Vanda Murray OBE 
Chair of the Remuneration  
Committee

Bunzl delivered a strong 
performance against a 
backdrop of ongoing post-
Covid adjustments in the 
market. The 2023 outturns 
reflect this, and the 
proposed adjustments to 
our Policy support our 
continuing strategy of 
growth.”

Review of the directors’ 
remuneration policy
Background
Frank van Zanten was appointed as CEO in 2016 
and, under his tenure, he has built a very capable 
leadership team containing broad experience and 
significant market and sector expertise. The 
consistent and proven compounding strategy 
based on growing organically (by expanding and 
developing business with existing customers and 
gaining new revenue with additional ones), 
continuously making operating model 
improvements and applying strong discipline in 
selecting the right acquisitions has driven 
geographic and market expansion and 
significantly increased the size and scale of the 
Group. Specifically:

•  Bunzl now has a presence in 33 countries, in six 
core market sectors with approximately 150 
operating companies and thousands of 
suppliers globally. Almost 60% of revenue is 
generated in North America.

•  The Group has made over 200 acquisitions 
since 2004 with the annual spend reaching 
£468m in 2023. There have been 114 high 
quality acquisitions and a total committed 
acquisition spend of over £3.1bn since 2015. 
The pipeline remains active and the consistent 
quality of our cash generation and our strong 
balance sheet provide us with headroom for 
further acquisitions and wider capital 
allocation options. 

•  Since 2015, revenue and adjusted operating 

profit increased by more than 80% and annual 
dividend growth has been maintained for 31 
years. Market value has increased by over 70% 
and shareholder return by almost 80% 

•  The Group has also made significant progress 

towards its objectives on sustainability, 
centred around some clear public 
commitments. This includes diversity and 
inclusion, with a significant improvement in the 
proportion of leadership roles occupied by 
females, which is now over 22%.

Changes to Policy proposed for 2024
The Committee has reviewed directors’ 
remuneration ahead of the binding shareholder 
vote at the 2024 AGM. We sought views from 
our largest shareholders and the major proxy 
agencies and are grateful for the feedback 
received which has helped revise and shape 
our proposals.

In overall terms, the Committee has concluded 
that the policy framework introduced in 2021 
remains appropriate, and specifically that 
Restricted Share Awards, which were first 
introduced then, continue to be instrumental in 
ensuring that the leaders of the business focus 
on actions that deliver long-term growth in an 
unpredictable market context. They have created 
greater simplicity, clarity and predictability of 
outcome and, importantly, they help to 
discourage any actions which unduly focus on 
short-term impacts but instead encourage a 
mindset which is aligned to the longer-term 
shareholder experience through value creation. 

The Committee also concluded that the triennial 
Policy review should provide the opportunity to 
assess whether the quantum remains sufficiently 
competitive against the market, particularly given 
the requirement to attract and retain first class 
talent in a global context. We have proposed 
changes in quantum for the annual bonus and 
Restricted Share Award levels for both the Chief 
Executive Officer and Chief Financial Officer in 
order to reflect the increasing scale, complexity 
and performance of the business, and to align 
them with the market. Alongside this, a more 
robust underpin for the RSAs will apply from 
2024 so that it is clearer how the awards have 
been assessed. 

The policy review was concluded at a time when 
there has been much discussion regarding 
whether the current state of executive 
remuneration for UK-listed companies, and in 
particular, those with significant US influence and 
exposure such as ours, needs a reset. This 
includes various calls from stakeholders for UK 
pay to become more flexible in terms of both 
quantum and structure. In this regard, a number 

of our investors raised with us whether a hybrid 
structure (granting both performance shares and 
restricted shares) had been considered. While a 
hybrid structure provides the benefits of both 
performance assessment and stewardship, it 
adds complexity and, at the current time, remains 
rare in the UK. After some consideration, the 
Committee decided that such an approach was 
not preferred for Bunzl at this time but we will 
continue to monitor progress and market practice 
in this area with interest.

companies remains appropriate. In this context, 
the Committee considered other FTSE 11-100 
companies (excluding financial services) with 
significant international and US presence (i.e. 
based on those companies with more than 20% 
of revenue generated from North America). At the 
time of the review Bunzl was ranked at c.40 in the 
FTSE 100 and has circa 60% of revenue coming 
from North America. The proposed incentive 
levels are in line with the median of our chosen 
benchmarking peer group.

I set out below more detail on the proposed 
changes alongside views received from 
shareholders during the consultation exercise.

1.  Incentive quantum increases
The Committee considered the strong 
performance of the business as set out above, 
the individual performance of members of the 
leadership team, the pipeline of succession talent 
and Bunzl’s ability to recruit in a highly 
competitive international labour market when 
undertaking the current review. 

Our review showed that a significant gap had 
developed between the Company and the wider 
market with regards to total remuneration. In 
particular, the value of the key elements of 
variable pay are seen as trailing the market. As 
such, the Committee proposes the following 
policy adjustments:

Current 
Annual 
Bonus 
maximum 

Proposed 
Annual 
Bonus 
maximum 

Current 
RSA 
maximum 

Proposed 
RSA 
maximum 

CEO 
CFO 

180% 
160% 

200% 
175% 

125% 
100% 

175% 
125% 

External benchmarking data was used to help 
provide various reference points to assist the 
Committee with determining the competitiveness 
of the current packages of the executive directors. 
Despite being a truly global business with the 
majority of our revenue and profit coming from 
the US and the need to compete for US talent at 
all levels (where incentive quantum is significantly 
higher than in the UK), the Board recognises that 
Bunzl is headquartered and listed in the UK and 
therefore comparison with other global FTSE 

The gap in incentive quantum currently partly 
reflects the increased size and scale of Bunzl since 
the last Policy was approved but also the approach 
to setting quantum when RSAs were first 
introduced in 2021. At the time, Restricted Shares 
replaced dual grants of performance shares and 
share options and a conservative approach was 
taken which resulted in a relatively modest 
restricted share award exchange. For the CEO, this 
involved replacing share options (175% of salary) 
and performance shares (225% of salary) with a 
single 125% of salary restricted share grant. Since 
2017, the performance shares have on average 
vested at 62% and share options at 99%. The 
Committee is satisfied that the proposed Policy 
incentive levels reflect a more appropriate 
exchange and are in line with market norms.

While Restricted Shares provide greater certainty, 
we consider them to be variable rather than fixed 
in nature as quantum can be scaled back either 
at grant or at vesting (including to zero) through 
testing of the underpin. Furthermore, Restricted 
Shares are long term in nature (value delivered 
after five years) and their value mirrors the rise 
and fall in share price, thereby providing long-
term shareholder alignment.

Reflecting the comments received from a small 
minority of shareholders, the Committee has 
decided, for 2024, not to operate at the proposed 
Policy levels in respect of the Annual Bonus, but to 
instead retain the bonus maxima at 180% of salary 
for the Chief Executive Officer and 160% of salary 
for the Chief Financial Officer, with an increase to 
the maxima expected to apply from 2025.

2.  A more robust performance underpin 
For the first awards to be granted under the 2024 Policy, the performance underpin will be reorganised 
so that a formal framework is established upfront which will set out clearly for each award the key 
elements which will need to be assessed for the award to vest. As is current policy, the Committee will 
review specific indicators to help form a view of ‘in the round’ performance. In addition, the Committee 
has the discretion to scale back awards (including to zero) if it concludes there is material 
underperformance over the course of the vesting period.

Factors to be considered (not limited to)

Financial health of 
the business, 
considering key 
financial indicators

•  Revenue growth

•  Operating margin

•  Adjusted earnings per share

•  Return on capital (RAOC/ROIC)

•  Cash conversion

•  Balance sheet strength

Strategic priorities

Delivery of key strategic objectives over the vesting period including 
operational and individual performance

Stakeholder 
experience

ESG progress

Consideration of our key stakeholders including employees, customers, 
suppliers and shareholders

Progress towards key achievement of ESG objectives including climate change 
ambitions, ethical supply, investing in our people and diversity

The new framework provides the Committee with a better defined and more rigorous process when 
assessing vesting levels, and more clarity to participants and investors. The framework provides the 
same broad focus on overarching performance but now focuses more explicitly on the key indicators 
reflecting financial health (including return on capital), strategic priorities, stakeholder experience and 
ESG progress.

In assessing the stakeholder experience, the Committee will also consider the return to shareholders in 
the form of the dividend policy for a particular year.

3. Higher shareholding guidelines
Reflecting on the proposed increase to the RSA grant level, the Committee has agreed to increase the 
in-employment shareholding guideline from 300% to 350% of salary for the Chief Executive Officer and 
from 200% to 250% of salary for the Chief Financial Officer The new guidelines are double the proposed 
restricted share award grant levels. This will provide further alignment between executives and 
shareholders. The post-cessation guideline of 300% and 200% of salary shall remain unchanged.

Employee Pay
The Committee always considers the broader 
context of employee pay across the Group when 
reviewing and implementing the policy for 
directors. It closely monitors base pay increases, 
bonus awards and other pay elements, including 
“one off” awards such as the cost of living 
payments made in 2022. In the broader context, 
it is worth noting that almost 8,500 employees 
across the Group will receive a bonus for 2023. 
In addition, some of the increases in quantum 
proposed for the Executive Directors in the new 
policy will also apply to other members of the 
senior leadership team. As required by the 
Regulations we have again disclosed in this year’s 
Directors’ remuneration report the ratio between 
the Chief Executive Officer’s remuneration and 
the median, lower quartile and upper quartile of 
UK employees. 

Implementing the policy for the 2024 
financial year
Base salary 
The base salaries for the executive directors, 
Frank van Zanten and Richard Howes, have been 
increased by 4%, effective from 1 January 2024. 
Both these increases are lower than those 
budgeted for the Bunzl plc head office and UK 
leadership team which were 5%. The average pay 
awards for the Group leadership team ranged 
from 3.5% to 5.7% excluding market adjustments. 

Annual bonus
For the 2024 financial year, as stated above, the 
Committee has elected not to implement the 
policy maximum awards, and the maximum 
annual bonus opportunity will remain unchanged 
at 180% of base salary for the Chief Executive 
Officer and 160% for the Chief Financial Officer, 
with on-target bonus at 50% of the maximum. 

The annual bonus performance measures 
continue to be a balanced scorecard of key 
financial metrics – adjusted eps, RAOC and 
operating cash flow. For 2024, following 
shareholder feedback, the Committee has slightly 
increased the weighting given to RAOC. 20% of 
the bonus opportunity will be dependent on 

personal performance linked to certain specified 
strategic non-financial goals and again, 10% of the 
opportunity for both directors will be dependent 
on the achievement of specific ESG objectives, 
based on the four key pillars of the transition to 
Alternative Products, Climate Change, Ethical 
Sourcing, and Diversity. The objectives agreed 
for 2024 are a clear build on those used for the 
2023 targets and reflect the long-term nature 
of the roadmap.

50% of any bonus awarded will be deferred into 
shares for a period of three years.

LTIP
Subject to the approval of the Policy, the 
Committee expects to make further grants of 
Restricted Shares to the executive directors and 
other participants. These will vest in 2027, subject 
to continued employment and the assessment of 
the underpin. Vested awards will be subject to a 
two-year holding period. The Committee may 
scale back the awards (including to zero) if it is not 
satisfied that the underpin has been met. 

Priorities for 2024
I am confident that if the proposed revisions to 
our Policy are approved, then the right reward 
framework will be in place to support the next 
phase of growth for Bunzl, delivered by a 
motivated and incentivised leadership team which 
is focused on taking the right longer-term 
decisions. Whilst the geo-political and economic 
outlook is still uncertain, Bunzl is well positioned 
to take advantage of growth opportunities as they 
arise, across the full range of our geographies and 
market sectors. The Committee will also continue 
to monitor external market trends and 
developments in executive pay with interest.

Conclusions
Despite the market headwinds, this has been 
another strong year of performance and we see 
significant opportunities for further growth 
moving forward. The Committee’s focus has been 
to incentivise leadership appropriately to 
recognise significant performance and growth of 
the business but also focus them on long term

Chair of the Remuneration Committee 
26 February 2024

The responsibilities and operation 
of the Committee
Committee membership role and remit
The Committee comprises all of the independent 
non-executive directors of the Company. While 
neither the Chairman nor the Chief Executive 
Officer are members of the Committee, they 
attend meetings by invitation. The Director of 
Group Human Resources also attends meetings. 
The Committee’s terms of reference, which were 
reviewed by both the Committee and the Board in 
2023, but remain unchanged, are available on the 
Company’s website, www.bunzl.com.

No director plays any part in determining his or 
her remuneration. During the year ended 31 
December 2023, both the Chief Executive Officer 
and the Chairman were consulted and invited to 
attend meetings of the Committee but were not 
present during any part of the meeting when their 
own remuneration was under consideration.

The independent non-executive directors who 
were members of the Committee during 2023 
are listed opposite.

The primary role of the Committee is to 
determine the framework and broad policy for 
the remuneration of the Chairman, the executive 
directors of the Board and the senior 
management group directly below Board level. 
The Committee proposes the directors’ 
remuneration policy for shareholder approval at 
least every three years. It also governs the 
implementation of the policy, ensuring that the 
remuneration of the executive directors and 
senior management supports the sustainable 
performance of the business and that it is aligned 
with the Company’s shareholders’ interests. 
The Committee considers market practice, 
shareholders’ views and the Group’s broader 
remuneration arrangements when setting the 
Group’s performance-related incentives and 
ensures compliance with UK corporate 
governance good practice.

The key responsibilities of the  
Committee include:
•  ensuring that executive directors and senior 

executives are properly incentivised to attract, 
retain and fairly reward them for their individual 
contribution to the Company, having due 
regard to the policies and practices applied to 
the rest of the employees within the Group;

•  determining the framework and broad policy 

for the remuneration of the Chairman and the 
executive directors of the Board; 

•  ensuring that remuneration is aligned with 
and supports the Company’s strategy and 
performance, having due regard to the 
interests of the shareholders and to the 
financial and commercial health of the 
Company, while at the same time not 
encouraging undue risk taking; 

•  communicating and discussing any 

remuneration issues with the Company’s 
stakeholders as and when appropriate;

•  setting and reviewing the executive directors’ 
remuneration and benefits including, but not 
limited to, base salary, bonus, long term 
incentive plans and retirement benefits;

•  ensuring that all remuneration paid to the 
executive directors is in accordance with 
the Company’s previously approved 
remuneration policy; 

•  ensuring all contractual terms on termination, 

and any payments made, are fair to the 
individual and the Company;

•  monitoring the policies and practices applied 

in respect of the remuneration of senior 
executives directly below Board level and 
making recommendations as appropriate; 

•  overseeing the Company’s long term incentive 

plans for all employees; and

•  ensuring that provisions relating to disclosure 
of remuneration as set out in the relevant 
legislation, the Financial Conduct Authority’s 
Listing Rules and the Code are fulfilled.

Compliance statement
This report has been prepared on behalf of, and 
has been approved by the Board. It complies with 
Schedule 8 of the Large and Medium-sized 
Companies and Groups (Accounts and Reports) 
Regulations 2008 (as amended) (the ‘Regulations’), 
the Code and the Financial Conduct Authority’s 
Listing Rules and takes into account the 
accompanying Directors’ Remuneration Reporting 
Guidance and the relevant policies of shareholder 
representative bodies. 

In accordance with the Regulations, at the 2024 
AGM the Company will be asking shareholders 
to put forward an advisory vote on the Directors’ 
remuneration report and a binding vote on the 
directors’ remuneration policy, as set out 
on pages 126 to 134.

DIRECTORS’ REMUNERATION REPORT continued

Directors’ remuneration policy 

The 2021 shareholder-approved policy requires renewal at the 2024 AGM. A new Policy will be put to a 

binding vote at the 2024 meeting and will be effective from the date of approval. It is expected to remain 

in place until its normal renewal which will be the 2027 AGM at the latest.

Objectives of the Policy
The objectives of the new proposed Policy remain unchanged from the current one and are as follows:

•  Clarity: maintain transparency, clear alignment with shareholder value and promotion of longer term, 
sustained performance. For example, the restricted share plan encourages a focus on the longer 
term success of the business;

•  Predictability: continue to ensure that targets are stretching (but realistic), the quantum of reward 
reflects both Company and individual performance and there are appropriate award caps and 
Committee discretions in place. For example, the underpin is broad and encourages the Committee 
to focus on ‘in the round’ performance;

•  Support for the Company’s business strategy: for example, aligning the executive directors’ and 

management’s incentives with the Company’s growth objectives;

•  Simplicity: ensure that the remuneration structures avoid unnecessary complexity. For example, the 

restricted share plan has only a single annual grant of shares;

•  Risk is appropriately managed: variable pay should drive performance within the Company’s risk 

appetite and encourage a prudent and balanced approach to the business;

•  Alignment to culture: the remuneration principles encourage the behaviour from the executive 

directors that the Committee expects to see throughout the business; and

•  Proportionality: the link between individual awards, the delivery of strategy and long term 

performance of the Group is clear.

In setting the remuneration policy for the executive directors, the Committee also takes into 
consideration a number of different factors:

•  The Committee applies the principles set out in the Code and also takes into account best practice 
guidance issued by the major UK institutional investor bodies, the Financial Conduct Authority 
(including the provisions of any applicable remuneration codes) and other relevant organisations;

•  The Committee has overall responsibility for the remuneration policies and structures for employees 

of the Group as a whole and it reviews remuneration policy on a Group wide basis. When the 
Committee determines and reviews the remuneration policy for the executive directors it considers 
and compares it against the pay, policy and employment conditions of the rest of the Group to 
ensure that there is alignment between the two; and

•  The Committee considers the external market in which the Group operates and uses comparator 
remuneration data from time to time to inform its decisions. However, the Committee recognises 
that such data should be used as a guide only (data can be volatile and may not be directly relevant) 
and that there is often a need to phase-in changes over a period of time. The Committee has 
reviewed a range of relevant benchmarking data to guide the 2024 review. 

•  Specifically, it has looked at FTSE 11-100 companies with greater than 20% of revenue generated from 
the United States. The peer group comprises RS Group, Convatec, Melrose Industries, Smiths Group, 
Pearson, Intertek, Smurfit Kappa, Halma, Spirax-Sarco, Burberry, Rolls-Royce, Informa, 
Intercontinental Hotels, Croda, WPP, Smith & Nephew, Rentokil, Imperial Brands, Flutter, Ashtead, 
Experian, BAE Systems, CRH, Haleon, Compass, National Grid, Reckitt Benckiser and RELX.

The Committee’s overall policy, having had due regard to the factors above, continues to be for a 
proportion of total remuneration to be based on variable pay. This is achieved by setting base pay and 
benefits by reference to mid-market levels, with annual bonus linked to the achievement of demanding 
performance targets and long term incentives which vest over the medium term and are designed 
to align the interests of the directors with those of shareholders and the long term sustainable success 
of the business. 

Changes to Policy proposed for 2024
The Committee is proposing to make some revisions to the policy, within the current overall framework, 
which can be summarised as follows:

1.   An increase to the quantum of Annual Bonus and Restricted Share Award levels for both the Chief 

Executive Officer and Chief Financial Officer in order to align them with the market and to reflect the 
increasing scale, complexity and performance of the business. For the Chief Executive Officer the 
Annual Bonus potential increases to 200% of salary (although remains at 180% of salary for 2024) 
and the Restricted Share Award increases to 175% of salary. For the Chief Financial Officer the 
Annual Bonus potential increases to 175% of salary (although remains at 160% of salary for 2024) 
and the Restricted Share Award increases to 125% of salary.

2.   A revision to the “underpin” attached to Restricted Share Awards so that it is clearer how that 

element of the award will be assessed. See page 146 for more detail. 

3.   An increase to the in-employment shareholding requirement for both the Chief Executive Officer 

and the Chief Financial Officer to 350% and 250% of salary respectively.

4.   A minor revision to the process for reviewing the Chairman’s fee whereby the Committee proposes 
to create alignment with the process for other non-executive Directors and review the fee annually 
rather than biennially. More detail on these proposals is contained in the table below. 

The Committee conducted a thorough consultation on the proposals with the Group’s key 
shareholders. It is very grateful for the positive support received, and for the constructive feedback 
which was carefully considered and input into the final proposals outlined below.

Remuneration policy for executive directors
The following table summarises each element of the remuneration policy for the executive directors, 
explaining how each element operates and links to the corporate strategy. 

Base salary

Purpose

•  Recognise knowledge, skills and experience as well as reflect the scope and size of 

the role

•  Reward individual performance without encouraging undue risk

Operation

•  Paid in 12 equal monthly instalments during the year

•  Normally reviewed annually in December (with any changes usually effective from 
January). An out-of-cycle review may be conducted if the Committee determines 
that it is appropriate

•  Takes into consideration a number of factors including (but not limited to) 
individual and Group performance, the size and scope of the individual’s 
responsibilities, salary increases across the Group, typical salary levels for 
comparable roles using appropriate comparator groups, for example similarly 
sized companies with a large international presence

•  Pensionable

Maximum 
potential  
value

•  While there is no maximum salary level, salary increases are normally considered 

in relation to the salary increases of other employees in the Group and 
performance of the individual. Higher salary increases may be made under 
certain circumstances, such as when there has been a change in role or 
responsibility, a major market movement or when a director has been appointed 
to the Board at a lower than typical salary initially

Maximum 
potential  
value

Performance 
metrics

•  While there are no performance conditions attached to the payment of base 
salary, individual performance in the role, as well as the performance of the 
Group and achievements related to environmental, social and governance issues, 
are all taken into consideration

Annual bonus

Purpose

•  Incentivise the attainment of annual corporate targets

•  Retain and reward high performing employees

•  Align with shareholders’ and wider stakeholders’ interests

Operation

•  Bonus awards are based on performance targets and objectives set by the 

Committee for the financial year

•  At the end of the performance period, the Committee assesses the extent to 
which the performance measures have been achieved. The level of bonus for 
each measure is determined by reference to the actual performance against the 
relevant performance targets

•  Up to half the bonus is paid in cash and the remainder in shares (with the shares 

normally deferred for three years under the Deferred Annual Share Bonus 
Scheme (‘DASBS’)) in respect of which dividend equivalents may apply to the 
extent that such deferred awards vest. If a director resigns during the period of 
deferral any outstanding DASBS awards would normally lapse

•  Malus and clawback provisions apply and are set out in more detail below,

•  Bonus awards are non-pensionable and are payable at the Committee’s 

discretion

•  The annual bonus policy maximum is 200% of base salary (175% for the Chief 

Financial Officer)

•  For 2024, the maximum bonus opportunity will be 180% for the Chief Executive 

Officer and 160% for the Chief Financial Officer

•  The annual target bonus opportunity is normally set at 50% of the maximum

•  The level of annual bonus for threshold performance is up to 25% of the 

maximum

•  The Chief Executive Officer may receive restricted shares per financial year with 

a face value of up to 175% of salary

•  The Chief Financial Officer may receive restricted shares per financial year with 

a face value of up to 125% of salary

Performance 
metrics

•  Restricted share awards are not subject to performance measures but vesting 
is subject to the achievement of an underpin normally reviewed over the three 
financial years commencing with the financial year in which awards are granted

•  In assessing the underpin, in normal circumstances the Committee may consider 

the Group’s overall performance, including financial and non-financial 
performance over the course of the vesting period and any material risk/
regulatory failures identified. Specifically, it will seek evidence of positive progress 
against the Group’s financial and strategic objectives as follows: 

•  Financial health of the business, considering financial indicators

•  Strategic priorities

•  Stakeholder experience

•  ESG progress

•   In considering these factors, the Committee will assess performance in the round, 

with the expectation of full vesting unless there has been a lack of material 
progress towards a stated objective, or it has identified material 
underperformance over the period. The Committee may scale back the awards 
(including to zero) if it is not satisfied the underpin has been met, and there is 
no threshold level of vesting.

Performance 
metrics

Metrics will be set each year by the Committee taking into account the Company’s 
key strategic objectives for the year.

For example, bonus metrics may include:

•  Financial measures chosen to align bonus outcomes with the underlying financial 
performance of the business, such as profit, return on average operating capital 
(‘RAOC’) and cash flow;

•  Non-financial measures are linked to the achievement of personal goals or certain 
specified strategic goals, including environmental, social and governance matters;

•  The performance metrics and targets are reviewed each year to ensure that they 

remain appropriate. The Committee retains the discretion to set alternative 
metrics as appropriate; and

•  The specific targets will be disclosed on a retrospective basis following the end of 

the financial year unless they are deemed to be commercially sensitive. 

The Committee sets targets that are appropriately stretching in the context of the 
business outlook and taking into account internal and external factors. The 
achievement of quantifiable financial targets will always drive the majority of the 
bonus outturn. Targets are set to ensure that there is appropriate alignment 
between stakeholder outcomes and to ensure that they do not drive unacceptable 
levels of risk taking.

Long term incentives

Purpose

•  Incentivise long term decision making as the basis for sustainable growth

•  Align with shareholders’ interests

•  Recruit and retain senior employees across the Group

Operation

Executive directors receive restricted share awards as the long term variable 
element of remuneration: 

•  Restricted share awards are discretionary and will normally vest subject to 

continued employment and the satisfaction of the underpin after no less than 
three years; 

•  A holding period will apply which means that restricted shares may not ordinarily 
be sold until at least five years after the grant date (other than to pay relevant 
taxes due on vested awards);

•  Malus and clawback provisions apply and are set out in more detail below.

•  Dividend equivalents shall accrue in respect of restricted share awards to the 

extent that they vest, including in relation to any holding periods; and

•  All awards are subject to the discretions contained in the relevant plan rules.

Long term incentives – previous policy applied for awards up to and including December 2020

Long term incentives – previous policy applied for awards up to and including December 2020

Purpose

•  Awards issued under the previous policy with respect to long term incentives 

continued to vest until October 2023, and therefore the policy described below 
applied for the final time to outturns reported in this report.

Performance 
metrics

•  Performance and service conditions must be met over a three year performance 

period. Metrics and targets are set each year by the Committee. The current 
metrics are as follows:

Operation

•  Discretionary biannual grants of executive share option awards and performance 
share awards which vest subject to performance conditions measured over three 
years and subject to continuous service. 

•  A malus and clawback facility is in operation under which part or the full amount 
of a vested award may be recovered, by a reduction in the amount of any future 
bonus, subsisting award, the vesting of any subsisting award or future share 
awards and/or a requirement to make a cash payment, for a period of three years 
from the relevant performance year, to the extent that the value of a vested 
award is subsequently found to have been overstated as a result of a material 
misstatement of performance or there has been a significant failure of risk control 
or serious misconduct

•  Two year post-vesting holding requirement for shares that vest, net of sales to 

settle tax or other withholding due on vesting or exercise of awards

•  If any executive resigns during the period before vesting, awards would 

normally lapse

•  All awards are subject to the discretions contained in the relevant plan rules

Maximum 
potential  
value

Executive share options
•  Maximum annual award of 225% of base salary

•  Annual grant levels for executive directors will not normally exceed 200% of 

base salary

•  For 2020, grants did not exceed 200% of base salary for the incumbent executive 

directors

Performance shares
•  Maximum annual award of 175% of base salary

•  For 2020, awards did not exceed 150% of base salary for the Chief Executive 

Officer and 120% for the Chief Financial Officer

Executive share options
•  The eps performance measure relates to the absolute growth in the Company’s 

eps against the targets set for the performance period

•  The vesting is scaled as follows:

 − no vesting for performance below the threshold target;

 − 25% of an award will vest for achieving the threshold target;

 − 100% of an award will vest for achieving or exceeding the maximum target; and

 − for performance between these targets, the level of vesting will vary on a 

straight line sliding scale.

•  The Committee annually reviews the performance conditions outlined above 
and, in line with the rules of the LTIP, reserves the right to set different targets 
for forthcoming annual grants provided it is deemed that the relevant 
performance conditions remain appropriately challenging in the prevailing 
economic environment

Performance shares
•  The TSR performance measure (50% of the total award) compares a combination 

of both the Company’s share price and dividend performance during the 
performance period against a comparator group of the constituents of the FTSE 
11–100. It aligns the rewards received by executives with the returns received 
by shareholders

•  The other 50% of the award is subject to an eps performance measure which 

relates to the absolute growth in the Company’s eps against the targets set for 
the performance period

•  The vesting for both performance measures is scaled as follows:

 − no vesting for performance below median performance (TSR) or below the 

threshold target (eps);

 − 25% of an award will vest for achieving median performance (TSR) or the 

threshold target (eps);

 − 100% of an award will vest for achieving or exceeding upper quartile 

performance (TSR) or the maximum target (eps); and

 − for performance between these targets, the level of vesting will vary on a 

straight line sliding scale.

•  The Committee annually reviews the performance conditions outlined above and, 

in line with the rules of the LTIP, reserves the right to set different targets for 
forthcoming annual grants provided it is deemed that the relevant performance 
conditions remain appropriately challenging in the prevailing economic 
environment

All employee share plans

Other benefits

Purpose

•  Encourage employees, including the executive directors, to build a shareholding 
through the operation of all employee share plans such as the HM Revenue & 
Customs (‘HMRC’) tax advantaged Sharesave Scheme and the Internal Revenue 
Service (‘IRS’) approved Employee Stock Purchase Plan (US) (‘ESPP’) in the US

Operation

•  Executive directors may participate in all employee schemes on the same basis as 

other eligible employees

•  The Sharesave Scheme has standard terms under which participants can 

normally enter into a savings contract, over a period of either three or five years, 
in return for which they are granted options to acquire shares at a discount of up 
to 20% of the market price prevailing on the day immediately preceding the date 
of invitation to apply for the option. Options are normally exercisable either three 
or five years after they have been granted

•  In the UK, the Sharesave Scheme is linked to a contract for monthly savings 

within the HMRC limits over a period of either three or five years (currently £500 
per month)

•  Service conditions apply

Retirement benefits

Purpose

•  Provision of retirement benefits

•  Retain executive directors

Operation

•  All defined benefit pension plans in the Group have been closed to new entrants 
since 2003 with any new recruits being offered defined contribution retirement 
arrangements and/or a pension allowance.

•  Pension contributions and allowances are normally paid monthly

Maximum 
potential  
value

•  Company pension contributions to defined contribution retirement arrangements 
or cash allowances are capped at 5% of base salary for current and new executive 
directors 

Performance 
metrics

•  Not applicable

Purpose

•  Provision of competitive benefits which helps to recruit and retain 

executive directors

Operation

•  Benefits may include a car allowance or a car which may be fully expensed, 

various insurances such as life, disability and medical and, in some jurisdictions, 
club expenses and other benefits provided from time to time.

•  Some benefits may only be provided to reflect hybrid working and/or overseas 

relocation, such as removal expenses, and in the case of an international 
relocation might also include fees for accommodation, children’s schooling, home 
leave, tax equalisation and professional advice etc.

Maximum 
potential  
value

•  The value of benefits is based on the cost to the Company and varies according to 

individual circumstances. For example, the cost of medical insurance varies 
according to family circumstances and the jurisdiction in which the family is based

Performance 
metrics

•  Not applicable

Shareholding requirement

Purpose

•  Strengthen the alignment between the interests of the executive directors and 

those of shareholders

Operation

•  In employment guideline: executive directors will normally be expected to retain 

shares, net of sales to settle tax, through the exercise of awards under the DASBS 
and the LTIP until they attain the required holding. Three years is the typical 
expectation for executives who are promoted from within the Company to 
achieve the required shareholding. It is recognised that a longer time period may 
be required for externally recruited executives to achieve the expected 
shareholding. Unvested deferred shares held under the DASBS will count towards 
the guideline (net of the expected sales for tax that would apply on vesting)

•  Post-cessation guideline: Upon cessation of employment, executive directors 
should maintain a shareholding for two years thereafter at a level equal to the 
lower of the in-employment guideline and the number of shares vested as at 
cessation (net of tax) under restricted share awards granted. 

•  Shares held by or to the benefit of an executive director’s spouse, civil partner or 
children (or with them as relevant) may count for the purposes of the guidelines.

Maximum 
potential  
value 

•  The Chief Executive Officer’s in-employment shareholding requirement is 350% of 

base salary. The in-employment requirement for other executive directors is 
250% of base salary

•  The Chief Executive Officer’s post-employment shareholding requirement is 300% 
of salary. The post-employment shareholding requirement for other executive 
directors is 200%.

Fees policy for Chairman and non-executive directors (the ‘NEDS’)
The following table summarises the fees policy for the Chairman and the NEDs.

Fees

Purpose

•  Provision of a competitive fee to attract NEDs who have a broad range of 

experience and skills to oversee the implementation of the Company’s strategy

Operation

•  Determined in light of market practice and with reference to time commitment 

and responsibilities associated with the roles

•  Annual fees are paid in 12 equal monthly instalments during the year

•  The Senior Independent Director and Chairs of the Audit and Remuneration 
Committees are paid an extra fee to reflect their additional responsibilities

•  The NEDs and the Chairs are not eligible to receive benefits and do not participate 

in pension or incentive plans. Expenses incurred in respect of their duties as 
directors of the Company are reimbursed

•  The NEDs’ and Chairman’s fees are reviewed annually in January each year, 
the latest review being with effect from January 2024 for NED fees and the 
Chairman’s fees

•  The Board as a whole considers the policy and structure for the NEDs’ fees on the 
recommendation of the Chairman and the Chief Executive Officer. The NEDs do 
not participate in discussions on their specific levels of remuneration; the 
Chairman’s fees are set by the Committee

Maximum 
potential  
value

•  Determined within the overall aggregate annual limit of £1,500,000 authorised by 
shareholders with reference to the Company’s Articles of Association approved at 
the 2021 AGM

Performance 
metrics

Taxable 
benefits and 
expenses

•  Not eligible to participate in any performance related elements of remuneration

•  Taxable expenses incurred in the course of carrying out NED duties are 

reimbursed and grossed up to include tax payable

Notes to the Policy Table
Malus and Clawback Provisions
Malus and clawback provisions apply to the cash and deferred elements of the bonus and the RSA 
awards. The malus and clawback provisions may be enforced in the event of material misstatement, 
errors in assessment of conditions, significant failure of risk control, serious misconduct, corporate 
failure (entailing the appointment of an administrator or liquidator) and serious reputational damage or 
where there has been a material failure in the management of the company to which the relevant 
individual has made a direct contribution. Malus or clawback as relevant may be affected by a reduction 
in the amount of any future bonus or subsisting award, the vesting of any subsisting award or future 
share award and/or a requirement to make a cash payment. In respect of bonus or deferred bonus the 
relevant discovery period expires three years after the end of the relevant performance period. In 
respect of RSA awards (and legacy performance shares and options) the relevant discovery period 
expires on the third anniversary of the vesting of the awards.

Selection of performance measures and targets
The Committee determines the performance measures, and the weighting of each, applying to the 
annual bonus based on the strategic priorities of the Group at the time. The bonus measures in place 
normally include the use of profit, RAOC and cash flow measures, but the precise metrics and their 
weightings may change from year to year. Each of these measures is aligned with the Group’s key 
performance indicators (‘KPIs’) and has been chosen as, alongside growing profitability, a focus on cash 
and effective investment of capital are particularly important. The management of capital employed 
together with profitability and cash flow ensures the focus on cash generation, enabling the Group to 
pay dividends and to support the growth strategy by making acquisitions and reinvesting in the 
underlying business. Strategic non-financial goals reward individual contribution to the success of the 
Group and allow a focus each year on important operational goals and strategic milestones, with a 
focus on the Environmental, Social and Governance agenda. This combination of performance 
measures provides a balance relevant to the Group’s business and market conditions as well as 
providing a common goal for the executive directors, senior managers and shareholders. 

Statement of consideration of shareholder views
The Committee considers shareholder feedback received in relation to the AGM each year and 
guidance from shareholder representatives more generally. In addition, the Committee consults 
proactively with its major shareholders prior to making significant changes to its policy, as it did this 
year when a comprehensive shareholder consultation was undertaken. This was conducted through 
meetings, calls and correspondence and the views received helped to shape the policy proposals.

Discretions retained by the Committee in operating the incentive plans 
The Committee operates the Group’s various incentive plans according to their respective rules and in 
accordance with HMRC and IRS rules where relevant. To ensure the efficient administration of these 
plans, the Committee may apply certain operational discretions. These include the following:

•  selecting the participants in the plans;

•  determining the timing of grants and/or payments;

•  determining the quantum of grants, reference pricing basis and/or payments (within the limits set out 

in the policy table above);

•  determining the extent of vesting based on the assessment of performance, including the vesting 

of restricted share awards;

•  determining the appropriate treatment of leavers and the extent of vesting in the case of the share 

based plans;

•  determining the extent of vesting of awards under share based plans in the event of a change 

of control;

•  making the appropriate adjustments required in certain circumstances (e.g. rights issues, corporate 

restructuring events, variation of capital and special dividends); 

•  determining the appropriate choice of measures, weightings and targets for the annual bonus plan 

from year to year, including discretion to amend the bonus outcome, as appropriate; and

•  varying the performance conditions applying to share based awards if an event occurs which causes 

the Committee to consider that it would be appropriate to amend the performance conditions, 
provided the Committee considers the varied conditions are fair and reasonable and not materially 
less challenging than the original conditions would have been but for the event in question.

Legacy arrangements
The proposed and previous directors’ remuneration policies give authority to the Company to honour 
any commitments entered into with current or former directors (that have been disclosed to 
shareholders in previous remuneration reports) or internally promoted future directors (in each case, 
such as the payment of a pension or the unwind of legacy share plans). Details of any payments to 
former directors will be set out in the relevant remuneration report as they arise.

Executive directors’ external appointments
With the specific approval of the Board in each case, executive directors may accept external 
appointments as non-executive directors of other companies and retain any related fees paid to them.

Recruitment of executive directors – approach to remuneration
Executive directors
For the ongoing stability and growth of the Group, it is important to secure, as necessary, the 
appointment of high calibre executives to the Board by either external recruitment or internal 
promotion. The overarching principles applied by the Committee in developing the remuneration 
package will be to set an appropriate base salary together with retirement and other benefits and short 
and long term incentives taking into consideration the skills and experience of the individual, the 
complexity and breadth of the role, the particular needs and situation of the Group, internal relativities, 
the marketplace in which the executive will operate and an individual’s current remuneration package 
and location. In addition, the Committee recognises that it may need to meet certain relocation 
expenses or expatriate benefits as appropriate. 

Any fixed or variable pay awards for new executive directors will not exceed the maximum limits set out 
in the policy table above. However, in addition, for external appointments the Committee may consider 
offering additional cash and/or share based elements to replace deferred remuneration forfeited by 
the individual on leaving their existing employment when it considers these to be in the best interests 
of the Company and its shareholders. Such elements, as appropriate, may be made under section 9.4.2 
of the Listing Rules and would normally take account of the nature, time horizons and performance 
requirements attached to the awards forfeited. 

Depending on the timing of the appointment, the Committee may deem it appropriate to set different 
annual bonus performance conditions for the first performance year of appointment. A long term 
incentive award can be made shortly following an appointment (or as soon as is practical if the 
Company is in a close period).

Non-executive directors
On appointment of a new Chairman of the Board or non-executive director, the fees will be set taking 
into account the experience and calibre of the individual and the prevailing rates of the other non-
executive directors at the time. 

Executive directors’ service contracts
The service contracts for Frank van Zanten and Richard Howes provide for an equal notice period from 
the Company and the executive of a maximum 12 months’ notice and any contracts for newly 
appointed executive directors will provide for equal notice in the future. The date of each service 
contract is noted in the table below:

Policy on payment for departure from office
On termination of an executive director’s service contract, the Committee will take into account the 
departing director’s duty to mitigate his loss when determining the amount of compensation. The 
Committee’s policy in respect of the treatment of executive directors leaving the Group is described 
below and is designed to support a smooth transition from the Company taking into account the 
interests of shareholders:

Component 
of pay

Voluntary resignation or 
termination for cause

Departure as a ‘good leaver’ or in other specific 
circumstances including on agreed terms

Base salary, 
pension and 
benefits

Paid for the proportion of 
the notice period worked 
and any untaken holidays 
pro-rated to the leaving 
date

Annual 
bonus cash

Cessation of employment 
during a bonus year will 
normally result in no cash 
bonus being paid

Unvested deferred shares 
will lapse

Annual 
bonus 
deferred 
shares

Paid up to the date of departure or death, including 
any untaken holidays pro-rated to such date. In the 
case of ill health, a payment in lieu of notice may be 
made and, according to the circumstances, may be 
subject to mitigation. In such circumstances some 
benefits, such as company car or medical insurance 
may be retained until the end of the notice period.

Cessation of employment during a bonus year or after 
the year end but prior to the normal bonus payment 
date will result in cash and deferred bonus being paid 
and pro-rated for the relevant portion of the financial 
year worked and performance achieved.

In the case of the death of an executive, all deferred 
shares will be transferred to the estate as soon as 
possible after death. In all other cases, subject to the 
discretion of the Committee, unvested deferred shares 
will be transferred to the individual on a date 
determined by the Committee.

Component 
of pay

Voluntary resignation or 
termination for cause

Departure as a ‘good leaver’ or in other specific 
circumstances including on agreed terms

Restricted 
shares

Unvested restricted share 
awards will lapse

Subject to the discretion of the Committee, unvested 
restricted share awards will normally be retained by 
the individual for the remainder of the vesting period, 
remain subject to the underpin conditions and will 
ordinarily be subject to time pro-ration. Holding period 
terms will ordinarily continue to run until (or be set to 
expire on or no later than) the second anniversary of 
departure from employment, commensurate with the 
post-cessation shareholding requirement. However, in 
the case of the death of an executive, the Committee 
will determine the extent to which the unvested shares 
may be exercised within 12 months of the date of 
death.

As per HMRC regulations

DIRECTORS’ REMUNERATION REPORT continued

Differences in remuneration policy for executive directors and  
employees in general
The main difference in remuneration policy between the executive directors and employees in general 
is the split of fixed and performance related pay, such as bonus and long term incentives. Overall the 
percentage of performance related pay, in particular longer term incentive pay, is greater for the 
executive directors. This reflects that executive directors have more freedom to act and the 
consequences of their decisions are likely to have a broader and more far reaching time span of effect 
than those decisions made by employees with more limited responsibility. As a consequence only 
executive directors, Executive Committee members and other key employees (currently 27 people) 
are granted restricted share awards. Approximately 480 senior managers are granted executive share 
option awards on an annual basis, which helps to provide a common focus for management in the 
Company’s decentralised organisation structure. In most cases, the annual bonuses are related to 
the performance of individual operating units.

Bonus arrangements vary throughout the Group and are related to the specific role and the country 
in which the employee operates. The majority of bonus plans have quantitative targets, but the 
performance measures and targets vary according to each specific role. Sales representatives often 
have annual bonus payments which may be commission based.

When there is a critical mass of employees within a country to make it cost-effective to do so, to 
encourage wider employee share ownership, an all employee share plan may be offered. Currently 
plans are offered to all employees based in Australia, New Zealand, Canada, Germany, Ireland, the 
Netherlands, the US and the UK. In France, employees take part in profit sharing arrangements in 
accordance with local regulations. 

Retirement and other benefits offered to employees across the Group differ according to the country 
in which the job is based and the function and seniority of the relevant role. 

Statement of consideration of employment conditions elsewhere in the Group
The Committee is provided annually with information on the salaries and proposed increases for the 
Executive Committee members and other senior direct reports of the Chief Executive Officer, as well as 
data on the average salary increases for leadership teams in each region within the Group. In addition, 
the Committee reviews and agrees all grants of executive share options, performance share awards 
and restricted share awards.

The Committee considers the general basic salary increase within the geographical regions for the 
broader employee population when determining the annual salary increases for the executive directors 
and is cognisant of the Group’s overall employment arrangements when reviewing and implementing 
the executive directors’ remuneration policy. Members of the Committee held feedback sessions with 
employees in all regions and part of the discussion sought the employee’s view on the executive 
remuneration approach and application. In addition, the Company monitors employees’ views through 
regular employee surveys.

Remuneration scenarios
The remuneration package comprises both core fixed elements (base salary, pension and other 
benefits) and performance based variable elements (cash bonus, the DASBS and the LTIP). The 
structure of the remuneration packages for on-target and stretch performance for each of the two 
executive directors for 2024, in line with the remuneration policy, is illustrated in the bar charts below.

DIRECTORS’ REMUNERATION REPORT continued

Annual report on directors’ remuneration for 2023
This report sets out the elements of remuneration paid to, or earned by, the directors in respect of the financial year 2023. Shareholders should note that reporting requirements mean that both the 2020 LTIP B 
awards and the 2021 Restricted Share Awards are both included in the Single total figure of remuneration. This means that the total remuneration shown for both directors is artificially high this year. This will 
normalise in 2024. For this reason, a subtotal has been included which removes the LTIP B awards made under the previous policy. This provides a more representative view of total remuneration.

Notes
a)   The figures above represent remuneration earned as directors during the relevant financial year including the bonus of which the cash element, 50% of the bonus, is paid in the year following that in which it is earned. The other 50% of the bonus shown above is deferred and 

conditionally awarded as shares under the rules of the Deferred Annual Share Bonus Scheme (‘DASBS’). Shares relating to the 2022 deferred bonus were awarded in 2023 as shown in the table on page 141 and the shares relating to the 2023 deferred bonus will be awarded in 2024.

b)   The annual bonus for 2023 was determined according to a formulaic calculation in respect of adjusted eps, RAOC and operating cash flow measures, while the Committee used its judgement to assess performance of individual objectives (20% of the bonus) and ESG 

objectives (10% of the bonus). No discretionary adjustment was applied.

c)   Benefits provided for all executive directors include a car or car allowance and medical insurance coverage for them and their families. Frank van Zanten’s benefits include a hybrid working allowance and expenses which have been impacted in 2023 by increases in overall 

costs, such as travel.

d)   The 2023 long term incentives figure comprises two types of award. The value of the LTIP B awards granted under the 2020 Policy in April and October 2020 which included performance periods ending in 2023 and the first grant of RSA awards granted under the 2021 Policy 
in April 2021. The performance metrics for LTIP B were eps growth and TSR and for RSAs, an underpin condition has to have been achieved, further details of which are on page 140. The share price used to calculate the value for the LTIP B is the closing mid-market share 
price on dates of vesting, 3,071p and 2,933p on 6 April 2023 and 5 October 2023 respectively. The share price used to calculate the estimated value of the vesting RSA awards is 2,990p being the three-month average share price to 31 December 2023. 

e)   The portion of total long term incentive figures that are attributable to share price growth are £875,158 for Frank van Zanten and £717,218 for Richard Howes in 2022 and £1,053,764 (£734,369 for LTIP B award and £319,395 for RSA) for Frank van Zanten and £552,842 

(£385,281 for LTIP B award and £167,561 for RSA) for Richard Howes in 2023.

f)   The figures shown in relation to 2022 for the LTIP have been restated. The 2022 Annual Report figure of £1,141,517 was based on the estimated value of the LTIP Part A share option awards using a three-month average share price to December 2022 of 2,888p. These awards 
vested on 10 March 2023 and 9 September 2023 and therefore figures have been updated to £1,125,301 to reflect the actual share price on the date of vesting of 2,930p (being the mid-market share price on 10 March 2023) and 2,807p (being the mid-market share price on 
8 September 2023, the closest working day to vesting date) respectively. 

g)   The pension contribution was delivered as monthly cash payments in lieu of pension.

Non-financial strategic goals (30%) 
Following a review of performance against specific personal objectives for 2023, the Committee 
determined the bonus percentages payable to the executive directors in relation to the non-financial 
strategic goals. The specific objectives, and the related evaluation of performance, are shown in the 
table below:

Frank van Zanten – Chief Executive Officer 
Non-financial objectives (20% of bonus) 

Evaluation

•  Continue to deliver digital progress 

across the Group. Ensure that digital 
best practice continues to be shared 
across the Group so that development 
can be accelerated and ensure that 
investment is targeted at the areas 
of greatest opportunity.

•  Significant progress on digital sales orders (December 2023) 
which grew to 72% of transactions compared to 69% in 2022. 
Excluding acquisitions, the growth was from 60% in 2019 to 74% 
in the month of December 2023. Supplier invoices electronically 
loaded (December 2023) were at 60% compared to 52% in 2022. 

•  Several large Digital Forums are in place across the business for 
the sharing of best practice (Global forum has 500+ members) 
and the combination of the adoption of new technology tools 
(including artificial intelligence) and the recruitment of new 
digital talent is supporting ongoing progress.

•  Develop a vision for how the Bunzl 

•  Over the course of the first half of 2023, a thorough process 

business could look in 2030, including 
more understanding of what new 
capabilities will be required from a 
technology and talent perspective. 

involving all members of the leadership team and some 
external input was launched to create a vision for Bunzl in 2030. 
This was shared with the Board at a Strategy session in June, 
and focused on the use of Artificial Intelligence in both the 
content and the delivery. This helped to re-focus the objectives 
around talent and technology and provides a framework for the 
team on the key strategic priorities. 

•  Continue to build an effective Board 
and Leadership Team, to include 
effective onboarding and induction 
for newly appointed non-executive 
directors and the Managing Director 
of Bunzl Asia Pacific and ensuring 
continuous development of the 
Leadership team. 

•  The new non-executive director underwent an extensive 

induction programme meeting functional leaders and Exco 
members. Commercial, operational and strategic information 
was shared before the annual Board planning meetings which 
has accelerated their active participation at the Board.

•  The annual Board evaluation process has been converted into 
tangible action points which have been integrated into the 
Board forward agenda

•  The Managing Director of Bunzl APAC has made a positive start 
and has been actively coached and supported in stepping up as 
a full member of the Leadership team. Other tailored 
development activities have been implemented for the regional 
Managing Directors according to individual need.

•  Internal Controls & Reporting/

Information Security – deliver the key 
milestones of the regional 
implementation plans and agree the 
roadmap for roll-out of non-financial 
information reporting over  
2023–2025. 

•  The tender process invited three firms to submit proposals 
for the 2024 year end audit. After an extensive engagement 
process the Audit Committee, supported by a Selection Panel, 
recommended to the Board that the services of the current 
auditor, PwC, be retained. The process and outcome 
successfully balanced the importance of financial and non 
financial aspects of the audit process. 

•  The Global Internal Controls programme remains on track with 
100% of key controls (tier 1 and 2, by revenue) documented 
including Group Finance, Tax and Treasury. All the Information 
Security audits completed by the Internal Audit team have 
achieved Reasonable Assurance. Significant enhancements 
implemented have included modified acquisition assessments, 
dark web scanning, health checks and external threat 
intelligence. In addition, the team completed the first cross 
group InfoSec breach response simulation.

•  A comprehensive roadmap for non-financial information 

reporting was presented to the Audit Committee following 
extensive engagement with regional teams and the creation 
of dedicated resources.

practices and ensuring that the local 
teams deliver the planned progress. 

developed and extensive communication has taken place to 
ensure the ownership of regional finance directors. Average 
inventory days has improved year on year.

•  A new approach to reporting digital progress has been 

implemented with a particular focus on the inclusion of specific 
business performance metrics. As above, significant progress 
on the digitisation of sales orders and supplier invoices has 
been made.

ESG objectives – shared objectives (10% of bonus)

Evaluation

•  A thorough RFP process was carried out to source a suitable, 
Bunzl-aligned supplier engagement tool and shortlisted four 
options before selecting the most appropriate provider. After 
ensuring ownership of the programme from the regional leads 
and procurement teams, a Bunzl-specific structure was built 
into the tool and 750 suppliers (representing 79% of spend by 
emissions) were contacted as a first step of the engagement 
process to take place in 2024. This will involve a pilot with the 
top 100 suppliers in the first half of the year followed by the 
remaining 650 suppliers.

•  Climate change – Ensure that those 
suppliers that jointly account for at 
least 79% of the Group supplier 
emissions are fully engaged on the 
requirement to set science-based 
targets by 2027. This ensures that the 
SBTi requirement to have science-
based targets for 2/3 of Bunzl’s scope 
3 emissions is met. Identify a suitable 
platform for data collection and 
monitoring, agree a timetable for 
implementation and deliver the key 
milestones for 2023. Ensure that the 
communications approach with 
suppliers is fit for purpose, and that 
roles and responsibilities are clear.

•  Products – Increase the sales of

LTIP grants/awards with performance periods ending in 2023  
(audited information)
Performance shares – LTIP Part B
Awards of performance shares were made to Frank van Zanten and Richard Howes on 6 April 2020 
and 5 October 2020 under the 2014 LTIP and vested during 2023. These will be the last LTIP Part B 
performance shares to vest. The Committee assessed the performance of the Company against the 
relevant performance conditions and no discretion was exercised to override the formulaic outcomes 
including as a result of the share price movement over the vesting period.

LTIP – 2021 Restricted Share Awards

The first grant of restricted share awards was made under the 2021 Policy on 21 April 2021. These 
awards vest after three years subject to the achievement of an underpin (assessed for the year ending 
31 December 2023) and continued service.

After each completed financial year during the three-year underpin assessment period, the Committee 
considered carefully and documented progress towards achieving the underpin. Reflecting the strong 
financial and non-financial performance of the Group over the three-year period, the Committee 
determined that the underpin has been achieved and therefore no scale back is required. The following 
points were considered by the Committee in arriving at this assessment:

Note
The face value of the awards is calculated using the average of the closing mid-market share price on the 60 calendar days prior to the 
grant of the award. The RSA options were awarded under the LTIP Part B on 1 March 2023 at a value of 2,984p per share.

The extent to which the Restricted Share Award, granted as nil-cost options, may vest is subject to a 
performance underpin which will be closely reviewed by the Committee before these awards vest in 
2026. In assessing the underpin, in normal circumstances the Committee may consider the Group’s 
overall performance, including financial and non-financial performance over the course of the vesting 
period and any material risk/regulatory failures identified. Financial performance may include elements 
such as revenue, profitability, cash generation, and return on capital. Non-financial performance relates 
to strategic priority areas focused on delivering long term success of the Company and implementing 
the Group’s long term strategy. These include, for instance, making operating model improvements, 
own brand development, acquisition growth, building on our competitive advantage, digital and 
technology improvements, focus on ESG, including sustainability, employee satisfaction and managing 
risk in the business. Vested awards are subject to a two-year holding period. 

Shareholder dilution
In accordance with The Investment Association’s Principles of Remuneration, the Company can satisfy 
awards to employees under all of its share plans with new issue shares or shares issued from treasury 
up to a maximum of 10% of its issued share capital (adjusted for share issuance and cancellation) in a 
rolling 10 year period. Within this 10% limit, the Company can only issue (as newly issued shares or from 
treasury), 5% of its issued share capital (adjusted for share issuance and cancellation) to satisfy awards 
under executive (discretionary) plans.

As well as the LTIP, the Company operates various all employee share schemes as described on page 
130. Newly issued shares are currently used to satisfy the exercise of options under the Sharesave 
Scheme and the International and Irish Sharesave Plans. Awards of executive options, performance 
share awards and restricted share awards made under the LTIP are principally satisfied by shares 
delivered from the Employee Benefit Trust which buys shares on the market, unless security laws in 
relevant jurisdictions prevent this.

Statement of directors’ shareholding and share interests (audited 
information)
As at 31 December 2023, each of the executive directors and their connected persons have a 
shareholding as follows:

Frank van Zanten
Richard Howes

Chief Executive Officer’s single figure history 
The table below summarises the Chief Executive Officer’s single total figure of remuneration, annual bonus and long term incentive payout as a percentage of maximum opportunity for 2023 and the previous 
nine years. The total remuneration figure for 2023 includes both the 2020 LTIP B awards and the 2021 Restricted Share Award due to reporting requirements. This means the total remuneration is artificially high 
and will normalise in 2024.

Notes
a)    The data for 2016 includes the amounts relating to Michael Roney (‘MR’) from 1 January 2016 to 19 April 2016 and also includes the LTIP awards made to him that vested in the period from 20 April to 31 December 2016. There was no bonus award for Michael Roney in relation 

to 2016.

b)   The data for 2016 also includes the amounts relating to Frank van Zanten (‘FvZ’) from 20 April to 31 December 2016 including the bonus award for that period and the international relocation package with accommodation benefit support, but excludes the LTIP awards made 

to him in his previous role that vested during the period from 20 April to 31 December 2016.

c)   All years prior to 2016 relate to the former CEO Michael Roney.
d)   The single total figure of remuneration in relation to 2022 has been restated from the figure shown in the 2022 Annual Report to reflect the difference between the grant price and the estimated value of vesting using the three month average share price to 31 December 

2022 and the value of the relevant LTIP awards on the actual date of vesting as detailed in Note (f) to the table of the single total figure of remuneration 2023 on page 136.

Percentage change in each director’s remuneration
The table below sets out the annual changes from the prior year, for the years 2020 through to 2023, in the salary, benefits, and bonus values of all directors and employees of the legal entity which employs the 
Chief Executive Officer, Bunzl plc. Where it is not possible to compare employees from Bunzl plc between years due to employees joining or leaving the Company or moving role, these employees have been 
removed from the data to prevent distortion.

DIRECTORS’ REMUNERATION REPORT continued

Chief Executive Officer pay ratio
The table below sets out the comparisons between the 25th, median, and 75th percentile employees 
in the UK, with reference to 31 December 2023, and the Chief Executive Officer’s salary and total 
remuneration as detailed in the single figure table. To calculate these ratios, the Company has used 
Option A and determined full time equivalent total remuneration as this is the most statistically robust 
method. This includes scaling up salary for part time employees. Each employee’s pay and benefits are 
calculated using each element of employee remuneration consistent with the Chief Executive Officer 
and no element of pay has been omitted.

2024 bonus measures
The structure for Frank van Zanten’s and Richard Howes’ annual bonus for 2024 is a balanced 
scorecard of performance measures, based on adjusted eps, RAOC, operating cash flow and specified 
strategic goals. The weighting of these measures remains 70% financial measures and 30% non-
financial measures (20% strategic goals and 10% ESG goals).

Following feedback from shareholders, the weighting of RAOC will increase by 5% to 15% and the 
weighting of eps will decrease by 5% to 30%. The relevant performance points are: threshold, target, 
and maximum (the level at which the bonus for that measure is capped). These performance points are 
determined at the start of the year and no elements of the bonus are guaranteed. As in previous years, 
the performance measures, including the financial targets, are commercially sensitive and therefore are 
not disclosed until the following year.

The total remuneration ratios for 2023 are higher due to the inclusion of both the LTIP B vests and RSA 
vest in the single figure table for the Chief Executive Officer’s remuneration. The median salary ratio 
remains broadly consistent as the Chief Executive Officer’s salary increase was in line with the wider UK 
workforce. 
Note
The single total figure of remuneration in relation to 2022 has been recalculated to reflect the difference between the grant price and 
the estimated value of vesting of the relevant LTIP awards on the actual date of vesting as detailed in Note (f) to the table of the single 
figure of remuneration 2023 on page 136. The 2022 salary ratio has not been restated because there was no difference to report. 

Relative importance of spend on pay
The table below shows a comparison between the overall expenditure on pay and dividends paid to 
shareholders as well as adjusted earnings per share for 2022 and 2023 (as stated in Note 26, Note 22 
and Note 3 to the consolidated financial statements on pages 185, 182 and 161 respectively).

DIRECTORS’ REMUNERATION REPORT continued

Underpin and pricing basis for long term incentives to be awarded in 2024
For the first awards to be granted under the 2024 Policy, the performance underpin will be reorganised 
so that a formal framework is established upfront which will set out clearly for each award the key 
elements which will need to be assessed for the award to vest. As is current policy, the Committee will 
review specific indicators to help form a view of ‘in the round’ performance. In addition, the Committee 
has the discretion to scale back awards (including to zero) if it concludes there is material 
underperformance over the course of the vesting period.

Performance underpin 
framework

Financial health of the 
business, considering key 
financial indicators

Factors to be considered (not limited to)

•  Revenue growth 

•  Operating margin 

•  Adjusted earnings per share 

•  Return on average operating capital (RAOC/ROIC)

•  Cash conversion 

•  Balance sheet strength

Strategic priorities

Delivery of key strategic objectives over the vesting period including 
operational and individual performance 

Stakeholder experience

Consideration of our key stakeholders including employees, customers, 
suppliers and shareholders 

ESG progress

Progress towards key achievement of ESG objectives including climate 
change ambitions, ethical supply, investing in our people and diversity

The Committee conducts an annual review of the underpin and overall performance to determine if the 
shares should vest in full at the end of three years. Under the proposed new policy there will be an 
increase to quantum of restricted shares granted. In 2024 Frank van Zanten, subject to shareholder 
approval, will be granted a restricted share award to the value of 175% of his salary and Richard Howes 
will be granted a restricted share award to the value of 125% of his salary. In respect of determining the 
number of awards to be granted in 2024, the 60-day average share price preceding the first grant date 
will be used.

Chairman’s and non-executive directors’ fees for 2024
The Chairman’s fee is reviewed every two years and the non-executive directors’ fees are reviewed 
annually with the most recent reviews for both taking effect from 1 January 2024. The current fee 
structure for the Chairman and the non-executive directors is shown below:

The 8.5% increase to the Chairman’s fee reflects the time commitment related to the role and the 
biannual approach to increases. 

Advisers to the Remuneration Committee
In carrying out their responsibilities, the Committee seeks external remuneration advice as necessary. 
During the year the Committee received advice from Willis Towers Watson (‘WTW’) and FIT 
Remuneration Consultants LLP (‘FIT’). WTW provided external survey data on directors’ remuneration 
and benefit levels and FIT advised the Remuneration Committee on senior executive pay. 

The fees payable to each adviser, based on hourly rates, were: £18,090 (WTW), and £72,421 (FIT) 
respectively for such work undertaken in 2023. Advisers are appointed by the Committee and 
reviewed periodically. A tender exercise was conducted in 2020 and FIT were selected to provide 
independent advice to the Remuneration Committee on senior executive pay matters. The Committee 
conducts regular reviews of the effectiveness of the advisers and is satisfied that they remain objective 
and independent.

Statement of voting at the 2023 AGM for the remuneration report 
The remuneration report and remuneration policy respectively received the following shareholder 
votes at the 2023 AGM held on 26 April 2023 and the 2021 AGM held on 20 April 2021 these being the 
years they were last voted on by shareholders:

OTHER STATUTORY INFORMATION

Annual General Meeting
The Notice convening the Company’s Annual 
General Meeting (‘AGM’), to be held at 60 Victoria 
Embankment, London, EC4Y 0JP on Wednesday 
24 April 2024 at 11.00 am, is set out in a separate 
letter from the Chairman to shareholders. 

Dividends
An interim dividend of 18.2p was paid on 
3 January 2024 in respect of 2023 and the 
directors are recommending a final dividend of 
50.1p, making a total for the year of 68.3p per 
share (2022: 62.7p). Dividend details are given in 
Note 22 to the consolidated financial statements. 
Subject to shareholder approval at the 2024 AGM, 
the final dividend will be paid on 2 July 2024 to 
those shareholders on the register at the close 
of business on 17 May 2024.

Share capital
The Company has a single class of share capital 
which is divided into ordinary shares of 32¹⁄ ⁷p 
each which rank pari passu in respect of 
participation and voting rights. The shares are in 
registered form, are fully paid up and are quoted 
on the London Stock Exchange. In addition, the 
Company operates a Level 1 American Depositary 
Receipt programme with Citibank N.A. under 
which the Company’s shares are traded on the 
over-the-counter market in the form of American 
Depositary Receipts.

Details of changes to the issued share capital 
during the year are set out in Note 21 to the 
consolidated financial statements.

Bunzl Group General Employee 
Benefit Trust
The trustee of the Bunzl Group General Employee 
Benefit Trust (the ‘EBT’) holds shares in respect of 
employee share options and awards that have not 
been exercised or vested. The EBT abstains from 
voting in respect of these shares. The trustee has 
agreed to waive the right to dividend payments 
on shares held within the EBT. Details of the 
shares so held are set out in Note 21 to the 
consolidated financial statements.

Rights and obligations attaching 
to shares
Subject to the provisions of the Companies Act 
2006 and without prejudice to any rights attached 
to any existing shares, the Company may resolve 
by ordinary resolution to issue shares with such 
rights and restrictions as set out in such 
resolution or (if there is no such resolution or so 
far as it does not make specific provision) as the 
Board may decide. Subject to the provisions of 
the Companies Act 2006 and of any resolution of 
the Company passed pursuant thereto and 
without prejudice to any rights attached to 
existing shares, the Board is duly authorised to 
issue and allot, grant options over or otherwise 
dispose of the Company’s shares on such terms 
and conditions and at such times as it thinks fit. If 
at any time the share capital of the Company is 
divided into different classes of shares, the rights 
attached to any class may be varied or abrogated 
by special resolution passed at a separate general 
meeting of such holders. Subject to the rights 
attached to any existing shares, rights attached to 
shares will be deemed to be varied by the 
reduction of capital paid up on the shares and by 
the allotment of further shares ranking in priority 
in respect of dividend or capital or which confer 
on the holders more favourable voting rights than 
the first-mentioned shares, but will not otherwise 
be deemed to be varied by the creation or issue 
of further shares.

Power to issue and allot shares
The directors are generally and unconditionally 
authorised under the authorities granted at the 
2023 AGM to allot shares in the Company up to 
approximately one third of the Company’s issued 
share capital or two thirds in respect of a rights 
issue. The directors were also given the power to 
allot ordinary shares for cash up to a limit 
representing approximately 10% of the 
Company’s issued share capital as at 9 March 
2023, without regard to the pre-emption 
provisions of the Companies Act 2006 (however, 
more than 5% can only be used in connection 
with an acquisition or specified capital 
investment). No such shares were issued or 

allotted under these authorities in 2023, nor is 
there any current intention to do so, other than 
to satisfy share options under the Company’s 
share option schemes and, if necessary, to 
satisfy the consideration payable for businesses 
to be acquired. 

These authorities are valid until the conclusion 
of the forthcoming AGM and the directors again 
propose to seek equivalent authorities at 
such AGM.

Restrictions on transfer of shares
Dealings in the Company’s ordinary shares by its 
directors, persons discharging managerial 
responsibilities, certain employees of the 
Company and, in each case, any persons closely 
associated with them, are subject to the 
Company’s Share Dealing Code.

Certain restrictions, which are customary for a 
listed company, apply to transfers of shares in the 
Company. The Board may refuse to register an 
instrument of transfer of any share which is not 
a fully paid share and of a certificated share at its 
discretion unless it is:

•  lodged, duly stamped or duly certified, at the 

offices of the Company’s registrar or such other 
place as the Board may specify and is 
accompanied by the certificate for the shares to 
which it relates and such other evidence as the 
Board may reasonably require to show the right 
of the transferor to make the transfer;

•  in respect of only one class of share; and

•  in favour of not more than four transferees.

Registration of a transfer of an uncertificated 
share may be refused in the circumstances set 
out in the uncertificated securities rules, and 
where, in the case of a transfer to joint holders, 
the number of joint holders to whom the 
uncertificated share is to be transferred 
exceeds four.

In addition, no instrument of transfer for 
certificated shares shall be registered if the 
transferor has been served with a restriction 
notice as defined in the Company’s Articles of 
Association (the ‘Articles’) after failure to provide 

the Company with information concerning 
certain interests in the Company’s shares 
required to be provided under the Companies Act 
2006, unless the transfer is shown to the Board 
to be pursuant to an arm’s length sale. The Board 
has the power to procure that uncertificated 
shares are converted into certificated shares 
and kept in certificated form for as long as the 
Board requires.

The Company is not aware of any 
agreements between shareholders that may 
result in any restriction of the transfer of shares 
or voting rights.

Restrictions on voting rights
A member shall not be entitled to vote, unless the 
Board otherwise decides, at any general meeting 
or class meeting in respect of any shares held by 
them if any call or other sums payable remain 
unpaid. Currently, all issued shares are fully paid. 
In addition, no member shall be entitled to vote if 
they have been served with a restriction notice 
after failing to provide the Company with 
information concerning certain interests in the 
Company’s shares required to be provided under 
the Companies Act 2006. Votes may be exercised 
in person or by proxy. The Articles currently 
provide a deadline for submission of proxy forms 
of 48 hours before the relevant meeting, 24 hours 
before a poll is taken if such poll is taken more 
than 48 hours after it was demanded or during 
the meeting at which the poll was demanded if 
the poll is not taken straight away but is taken not 
more than 48 hours after it was demanded.

Purchase of own shares
At the 2023 AGM, shareholders gave the Company 
authority to purchase up to a maximum amount 
equivalent to approximately 10% of its issued 
share capital. During the year ended 31 
December 2023, the Company did not purchase 
any of its own shares pursuant to this authority 
or the authority granted at the 2022 AGM and 
no shares have been purchased between 
31 December 2023 and 26 February 2024.  
As a result, directors again propose to seek the 
equivalent authority at the 2024 AGM.

pursuant to the Articles if the director:

•  resigns by giving notice in writing sent to or

and career development on the basis of their 
aptitudes and abilities. Employees who develop a 
disability during their working life will be retained 
in employment wherever possible and given help 
with rehabilitation and training.

Further information relating to the Group’s 
employees can be found in the Our people 
section on pages 34 to 39.

Bunzl Finance plc, has a number of bilateral loan 
facilities with a range of different counterparties, 
all of which are guaranteed by the Company, are 
in substantially the same form and are repayable 
at the option of the lender in the event of a 
change of control of the Company. Similar change 
of control provisions in relation to the Company 
are included in the US dollar, sterling and euro 
US private placement notes and the senior 
unsecured bonds (which are listed on the Main 
Market and International Securities Market of 
the London Stock Exchange), all of which have 
been entered into by Bunzl Finance plc and the

External auditors
Each of the directors in office at the date of

ought to have taken as a director in order to 
make the director aware of any relevant audit 
information and to establish that the Group 
and the Company’s auditors are aware of that 
information.

This confirmation is given and should be 
interpreted in accordance with the provisions of 
section 418 of the Companies Act 2006.

An indication of likely future developments in the

Strategic report and Directors’ report
Pages 2 to 87 inclusive consist of the Strategic 
report and pages 88 to 149 inclusive consist of the 
Directors’ report. These reports have been drawn 
up and presented in accordance with, and in 
reliance upon, applicable English company law 
and any liability of the directors in connection 
with these reports shall be subject to the 
limitations and restrictions provided by such law.

The Company has chosen, in accordance with 
section 414C(11) of the Companies Act 2006, to 
include certain matters in its Strategic report that 
would otherwise be required to be disclosed in 
this Directors’ report. These matters are referred 
to above and are explained in more detail in the

Under the Companies Act 2006, a safe harbour 
limits the liability of directors in respect of 
statements in and omissions from a strategic 
report and a directors’ report. Under English law, 
the directors would be liable to the Company, but 
not to any third party, if the Strategic report or the 
Directors’ report contain errors as a result of 
recklessness or knowing misstatement or 
dishonest concealment of a material fact, but 
would not otherwise be liable.

The Strategic report and the Directors’ 
report were approved by the Board on 
26 February 2024.

1 Basis of preparation
Bunzl plc (the ‘Company’) is a public company, which is limited by shares and is listed on the London Stock 
Exchange. The Company is incorporated and domiciled in the United Kingdom and is registered in England 
and Wales. 

a. Basis of accounting
The consolidated financial statements for the year ended 31 December 2023 have been approved by the 
Board of directors of Bunzl plc. They are prepared in accordance with UK-adopted International Accounting 
Standards (‘IASs’) in conformity with the requirements of the Companies Act 2006 and the applicable legal 
requirements of the Companies Act 2006. The consolidated financial statements also comply fully with 
International Financial Reporting Standards (‘IFRSs’) as issued by the International Accounting Standards 
Board (‘IASB’). They are prepared under the historical cost convention with the exception of certain items 
which are measured at fair value as described in the accounting policies below. 

(i) Going concern
The directors, having reassessed the principal risks and uncertainties, consider it appropriate to adopt the 
going concern basis of accounting in the preparation of the financial statements.

In reaching this conclusion, the directors noted the Group’s strong operating cash flow performance in the 
year and the substantial funding available to the Group as described in the Financial review. The directors 
also considered a range of different forecast scenarios for the 18 month period from the date of these 
financial statements to the end of June 2025 starting with a base case projection derived from the Group’s 
2024 Budget excluding any non-committed acquisition spend or changes in funding. The resilience of the 
Group to a range of severe but plausible downside scenarios was factored into the directors’ considerations 
through two levels of stress testing against the base case projection. 

These severe but plausible downside scenarios included the following assumptions: 
•  A 15% reduction in adjusted operating profit from the potential for adverse impacts from the 

crystallisation of the principal strategic and operational risks to the Group’s organic growth and a 10% 
increase in working capital

•  A 25% reduction in adjusted operating profit from a more severe impact from the crystallisation of the 
principal strategic and operational risks to the Group’s organic growth and a 20% increase in working 
capital

In addition, the Group has carried out reverse stress tests against the base case to determine the level of 
performance that would result in a breach of financial covenants. In order for a breach of covenants to occur 
during the 18 month period to the end of June 2025 the Group would need to experience a reduction in 
EBITDA of over 65% compared to the base case.

In the first two stress tests it was found that the Group was resilient and in particular it remained in 
compliance with the relevant financial covenants. The conditions required to create the reverse stress test 
scenario were so severe that they were considered to be implausible. The directors are therefore satisfied 
that the Group’s forecasts, which take into account reasonably possible changes in trading performance, 
show that there are no material uncertainties over going concern, including no anticipated breach of 
covenants, and therefore the going concern basis of preparation continues to be appropriate. 

(ii) Impact of Hyperinflation on the financial statements at 31 December 2023
The Group’s financial statements include the results and financial position of its Turkish and Argentinian 
operations restated to the measuring unit current at the end of the year, with hyperinflationary gains and 
losses in respect of monetary items being reported in finance expense. Comparative amounts presented 
in the financial statements have not been restated. The inflation rates used by the Group are the official 
rates published by the Turkish Statistical Institute and the Argentine Federation of Professional Councils of 
Economic Sciences. The movement in the publicly available official price index for the year ended 31 
December 2023 was an increase of 65% (2022: increase of 64%) in Turkey and an increase of 210% (2022: 
increase of 95%) in Argentina.

IAS 29 requires that the income statement is adjusted for inflation in the year and translated at the year end 
foreign exchange rates and that non-monetary assets and liabilities on the balance sheet are inflated to 
reflect the change in purchasing power caused by inflation from the date of initial recognition. For the year 
ended 31 December 2023, this resulted in an increase in goodwill of £8.4m (2022: £16.4m) and a net 
increase in other intangibles of £0.4m (2022: £12.3m before impairment charges). The impacts on other 
non-monetary assets and liabilities were immaterial. The impact to retained earnings during the year was 
a gain of £21.6m (2022: gain of £47.5m). The total impact to the Consolidated income statement during the 
year was a charge of £11.0m (2022: £21.2m) to profit after tax from hyperinflation accounting adjustments, 
comprising a £9.5m adverse impact (2022: £18.7m adverse impact) on adjusted profit before tax, 
increased customer relationships amortisation of £0.2m (2022: £1.8m) and an increased tax charge of £1.3m 
(2022: £0.7m).

When applying IAS 29 on an ongoing basis, comparatives in a stable currency are not restated with the 
translation effect presented within other comprehensive income during the year, and the effect of inflating 
opening balances to the measuring unit current at the end of the reporting period presented as a change 
in equity.

b. Newly adopted accounting policies
There are no new standards or amendments to existing standards that are effective that have had 
a material impact on the Group, nor does the Group anticipate any new or revised standards and 
interpretations that are effective from 1 January 2024 and beyond to have a material impact on its 
consolidated results or financial position.

2 Accounting policies
The accounting policies set out below have, unless otherwise stated, been applied consistently to all years 
presented in the consolidated financial statements.

a. Basis of consolidation 
(i) Subsidiaries
Subsidiaries are entities controlled by the Group. Control exists when the Group is either exposed or has 
rights to variable returns from its involvement with the entity and has the ability to affect those returns 
through its power over the entity. Subsidiaries are included in the consolidated financial statements from 
the date that control commences until the date that control ceases. A list of all of the Company’s subsidiary 
undertakings is included in the Related undertakings note in the Shareholder information section on 
pages 202 to 207 and is subject to audit. The results of all of the subsidiary undertakings are included 
in full in these consolidated financial statements. 

The following UK subsidiaries are exempt from the requirements under the Companies Act 2006 relating to 
the audit of individual financial statements by virtue of section 479A of the Act.

03829908

(ii) Business combinations
The acquisition method of accounting is used to account for the acquisition of subsidiaries. Identifiable 
assets acquired and liabilities and contingent liabilities assumed in a business combination are measured 
initially at fair value at the acquisition date. The consideration paid or payable in respect of acquisitions 
comprises amounts paid on completion and deferred consideration, excluding payments which are 
contingent on the continued employment of former owners of businesses acquired. The excess of the 
consideration over the fair value of the identifiable net assets acquired is recorded as goodwill. Payments 
that are contingent on future employment and transaction costs and expenses such as professional fees 
are charged to the income statement.

When less than 100% of the issued share capital of a subsidiary is acquired and the acquisition includes 
an option to purchase the remaining share capital of the subsidiary, the anticipated acquisition method is 
applied, where judged appropriate to do so based on the risks and rewards associated with the option to 
purchase, meaning that no non-controlling interest is recognised. A liability is carried on the balance sheet 
equal to the fair value of the option and this is revised to fair value at each reporting date with differences 
being recorded in acquisition related items in the income statement.

(iii) Disposal of businesses
Where a subsidiary undertaking is sold, the profit or loss on disposal is calculated as the difference between 
the aggregate of the fair value of the consideration received and the carrying amount of the assets and 
liabilities of the subsidiary on the date of disposal less any transaction costs relating to the disposal. On the 
disposal of a subsidiary with assets and liabilities denominated in foreign currency, the cumulative 
translation difference associated with that subsidiary in the translation reserve is credited or debited to the 
profit or loss on disposal recognised in the income statement. Cash received on disposal of businesses is 
shown within investing activities in the Consolidated cash flow statement, net of cash, cash equivalents and 
overdrafts disposed of and transaction costs paid.

(iv) Transactions eliminated on consolidation
Intragroup balances and any unrealised gains and losses or income and expenses arising from intragroup 
transactions are eliminated in preparing the consolidated financial statements.

b. Foreign currency
Transactions in foreign currencies are recorded at the rate of exchange at the date of the transaction. 
Monetary assets and liabilities denominated in foreign currencies at the balance sheet date are translated at 
the exchange rate prevailing at that date. Foreign exchange differences arising on translation are recognised 
in the income statement, unless they qualify for cash flow or net investment hedge accounting treatment, in 
which case the effective portion is recognised directly in other comprehensive income.

Assets and liabilities of foreign operations are translated at the exchange rate prevailing at the balance sheet 
date. Income and expenses of foreign operations are translated at average exchange rates with the 
exception of subsidiaries in hyperinflationary economies that are translated at the closing rate at the end of 
the year. All resulting exchange differences, including exchange differences arising from the translation of 
borrowings and other financial instruments designated as hedges of such balances, are recognised directly 
in other comprehensive income and accumulated in the translation reserve. Differences that have arisen 
since 1 January 2004, the date of transition to IFRS, are presented in this separate component of equity.

c. Revenue
The Group is principally engaged in the delivery of goods to customers representing a single performance 
obligation which is satisfied upon delivery of the relevant goods. Revenue related to the provision of services 
is recognised when the service is provided, which for the majority of the Group’s service revenue represents 
a single performance obligation. Revenue is not recognised if there is significant uncertainty regarding 
recovery of the consideration due.

Revenue is valued at invoiced amounts, excluding sales taxes and including estimates for variable 
consideration where relevant, such as returns and discounts, for which a liability is recognised as required. 
Returns and early settlement discount liabilities are based on experience over an appropriate period 
whereas volume discount liabilities are based on agreements with customers and expected volumes. 

d. Cost of goods sold 
Cost of goods sold consists of the cost of the inventories sold or disposed of in the period where the cost 
of inventories is net of supplier rebate income related to those inventories. 

e. Supplier rebates
The Group has various rebate arrangements with a number of suppliers. Some of these arrangements are 
based on the volume of products purchased and others are based on the volume of products sold. Supplier 
rebate income is recognised in cost of goods sold concurrent with the sale of the inventories to which it 
relates and is calculated by reference to the expected consideration receivable from each rebate 
arrangement. Substantially all supplier rebate income is unconditional and non-judgemental. Supplier

2 Accounting policies continued
rebate income is not recognised if there is significant uncertainty regarding recovery of the amount due. 
Supplier rebate income accrued but not yet received is included in other receivables. 

f. Share based payments
The Group operates a number of equity settled share based payment compensation plans. Details of these 
plans are outlined in Note 21 and the Directors’ remuneration report. The total expected expense is based 
on the fair value of options and other share based incentives on the grant date, calculated using a valuation 
model, and is spread over the expected vesting period with a corresponding credit to equity. 

g. Leases
The Group recognises a right-of-use asset and a lease liability at the lease commencement date. The 
right-of-use asset is initially measured at cost, comprising the initial amount of the lease liability plus any 
initial direct costs incurred and any lease payments made at or before the lease commencement date, less 
any lease incentives received. The right-of-use asset is subsequently depreciated using the straight line 
method from the commencement date to the earlier of the end of the useful life of the asset or the end of 
the lease term. The lease liability is initially measured at the present value of the lease payments that are not 
paid at the commencement date, discounted using the interest rate implicit in the lease. If that rate cannot 
readily be determined, as is the case in the vast majority of the leasing activities of the Group, the lessee’s 
incremental borrowing rate is used, being the rate that the lessee would have to pay to borrow the funds 
necessary to obtain an asset in a similar economic environment with similar terms and conditions. The lease 
liability is subsequently measured at amortised cost using the effective interest method. It is remeasured 
when there is a change in future lease payments arising from a change in an index/rate or a change in the 
Group’s assessment of whether it will exercise an extension or termination option. When the lease liability 
is remeasured, a corresponding adjustment is made to the right-of-use asset. 

Judgements are involved in determining the lease term, particularly because termination options are 
included in a number of property leases across the Group to facilitate operational flexibility. The majority 
of termination options held are exercisable only by the Group and not by the respective lessor. In 
determining the lease term, management considers all facts and circumstances that create an economic 
incentive to exercise a termination option. Periods after the date of a termination option are only included 
in the lease term if it is reasonably certain that the lease will not be terminated. The assessment of the lease 
term is reviewed if a significant event or a significant change in circumstances occurs that is within the 
control of the Group. 

Payments associated with short term leases and leases of low value assets are recognised on a straight line 
basis as an expense in profit or loss. Short term leases are leases with a lease term of 12 months or less. 
Low value assets are assets with a value of less than £5,000 when new, typically small items of IT equipment, 
office equipment and office furniture. 

h. Income tax
Income tax in the income statement comprises current and deferred tax. Income tax is recognised in the 
income statement except to the extent that it relates to items recognised directly in equity or other 
comprehensive income.

Current tax is the expected tax payable or recoverable on the taxable income or loss for the year using tax 
rates enacted or substantively enacted at the balance sheet date and any adjustments in respect of prior 
years. Current tax payable is recognised when it is probable that the Group will be required to settle the 
obligation. The Group’s policy for accounting for current tax payable or receivable where it is uncertain is 
described in more detail in Note 2y – Sources of estimation uncertainty – Taxation.

Deferred tax is provided using the balance sheet liability method providing for temporary differences arising 
between tax bases and carrying amounts in the consolidated financial statements. Deferred tax is 
measured at the tax rates that are expected to be applied to temporary differences when they reverse, 
based on the laws that have been enacted or substantively enacted at the balance sheet date.

Deferred tax is not recognised for the following temporary differences: goodwill not deductible for tax 
purposes, the initial recognition of assets and liabilities that affect neither accounting nor taxable profits and 
differences relating to investments in subsidiaries to the extent that they will probably not reverse in the 
foreseeable future and where the Company controls the timing of the reversal. A deferred tax asset is 
recognised only to the extent that it is probable that future taxable profit will be available against which the 
temporary difference can be utilised. 

i. Property, plant and equipment
Property, plant and equipment is stated at historical cost less accumulated depreciation and any 
impairment losses. The carrying values of property, plant and equipment are periodically reviewed for 
impairment when events or changes in circumstances indicate that the carrying values may not be 
recoverable. Where parts of an item of property, plant and equipment have different useful lives, they 
are accounted for as separate items.

j. Depreciation
Depreciation is charged to the income statement on a straight line basis to write off cost less estimated 
residual value over the assets’ estimated remaining useful lives. The estimated useful lives are as follows: 

Buildings 
Plant and machinery 
Fixtures, fittings and equipment 
Freehold land 

50 years (or depreciated over life of lease if shorter than 50 years)
3 to 12 years
3 to 12 years
Not depreciated

Assets’ residual values, useful lives and depreciation methods are reviewed, and adjusted if appropriate, at 
each balance sheet date.

k. Intangible assets
(i) Goodwill
Acquisitions are accounted for using the acquisition method. As permitted by IFRS 1 ‘First-time Adoption 
of International Financial Reporting Standards’, the Group chose to apply IFRS 3 ‘Business Combinations’ 
from 1 January 2004 and elected not to restate previous business combinations. For acquisitions made 
before 1 January 2004, goodwill represents the amount previously recorded under UK Generally Accepted 
Accounting Practice (‘UK GAAP’). For acquisitions that occurred between 1 January 2004 and 31 December 
2009, goodwill represents the cost of the business combination in excess of the fair value of the identifiable 
assets, liabilities and contingent liabilities acquired. For acquisitions that have occurred on or after 1 January 
2010, goodwill represents the cost of the business combination (excluding payments contingent on future 
employment and transaction costs and expenses) in excess of the fair value of the identifiable assets, 
liabilities and contingent liabilities acquired. Goodwill is allocated to cash generating units (‘CGUs’) and is 
tested annually for impairment. Negative goodwill arising on acquisition is recognised immediately in the 
income statement.

(ii) Customer relationships, brands and technology
Customer relationships, brands and technology intangible assets acquired in a business combination are 
recognised on acquisition and recorded at fair value. Subsequent to initial recognition, customer 
relationships, brands and technology intangible assets are stated at cost less accumulated amortisation and 
any impairment losses. Amortisation is charged to the income statement on a straight line basis over the 
estimated useful economic lives which range from 3 to 19 years.

(iii) Software
Software is stated at historical cost less accumulated amortisation and any impairment losses. The carrying 
values of software are periodically reviewed for impairment when events or changes in circumstances 
indicate that the carrying values may not be recoverable. Amortisation is charged to the income statement 
on a straight line basis over the estimated useful economic lives which range from 3 to 10 years.

l. Impairment
The carrying amounts of the Group’s assets are reviewed annually to determine if there is any indication of 
impairment. If any such indication exists, the assets’ recoverable amounts are estimated. The recoverable 
amounts of assets carried at amortised cost are calculated as the present value of estimated future cash 
flows, discounted at appropriate pre-tax discount rates. The recoverable amounts of other assets are the 
greater of their fair value less the costs of disposal and the value in use. In assessing the value in use, the 
estimated future cash flows are discounted to their present values using appropriate pre-tax discount rates. 
Impairment losses are recognised when the carrying amount of an asset or CGU exceeds its recoverable 
amount, with impairment losses being recognised in the income statement. 

m. Inventories
Inventories are valued at the lower of cost and net realisable value. The cost of inventories is based on the 
first-in first-out principle and comprises the purchase price, net of any related supplier volume rebates, plus 
import duties and other taxes, inbound freight and haulage costs and other related costs incurred to bring 
the product to its present location and condition. Net realisable value is the estimated selling price in the 
ordinary course of business, less the estimated cost of completion and estimated cost necessary to make 
the sale. Provision is made for obsolete, slow moving or defective items and market price movements where 
appropriate.

n. Trade and other receivables
Trade and other receivables are initially measured at fair value, which for trade receivables is equal to the 
consideration expected to be received from the satisfaction of performance obligations, plus any directly 
attributable transaction costs. Subsequent to initial recognition these assets are measured at amortised 
cost less any provision for impairment losses including expected credit losses. In accordance with IFRS 9 
‘Financial Instruments’ the Group applies the simplified approach to measuring expected credit losses which 
uses a lifetime expected loss allowance for all trade receivables. To measure the expected credit losses, 
trade receivables have been grouped based on shared credit risk characteristics such as the ageing of the 
debt and the credit risk of the customers. An historical credit loss rate is then calculated for each group and 
adjusted to reflect expectations about future credit losses. Inputs and assumptions used for expected 
credit loss provisions are based on local operating company historical experience and expectations about 
future credit losses. The Group does not have any significant contract assets.

o. Trade and other payables
Trade and other payables are initially measured at fair value including any directly attributable transaction 
costs. Subsequent to initial recognition these liabilities are measured at amortised cost. The Group has 
contract liabilities in the form of deferred income which arises from consideration received in advance of the 
satisfaction of performance obligations. 

p. Financial instruments 
Classification and measurement
Under IFRS 9, financial instruments are initially measured at fair value with subsequent measurement 
depending upon the classification of the instrument. IFRS 13 ‘Fair Value Measurement’ defines fair value 
as the price that would be received to sell an asset or paid to transfer a liability in an orderly transaction 
between market participants at the measurement date. 

All non-derivative financial assets and liabilities are subsequently held at amortised cost unless they are 
in a fair value hedge relationship, with the exception of money market funds which are held at fair value. 
Financial assets and liabilities held in a fair value hedge relationship are held at amortised cost with a fair 
value adjustment with subsequent changes in this fair value adjustment recorded in the income statement. 

Derivatives and hedging activities
Derivatives are initially recognised at fair value on the date a derivative contract is entered into and are 
subsequently remeasured to their fair value at the end of each reporting period. The accounting for 
subsequent changes in fair value depends on whether the derivative is designated as a hedging instrument 
and, if so, the nature of the item being hedged. The Group designates certain derivatives as either:

•  a hedge of the fair value of recognised assets or liabilities or a firm commitment (‘fair value hedge’);
•  a hedge of a particular risk associated with the cash flows of recognised assets and liabilities and highly 

probable forecast transactions (‘cash flow hedge’); or

•  a hedge of a net investment in a foreign operation (‘net investment hedge’).

The Group documents its risk management objectives and strategy for undertaking its hedge transactions. 
At inception of hedge relationships, the Group documents the economic relationship between the hedging 
instruments and the hedged items. 

The fair value of a hedging derivative is classified as a non-current asset or liability when the remaining 
maturity of the hedged item is more than 12 months and as a current asset or liability when the remaining 
maturity of the hedged item is 12 months or less. 

(i) Fair value hedge
Where a derivative instrument is designated and qualifies as a hedge of a recognised asset or liability, all 
changes in the fair value of the derivative are recognised immediately in the income statement within 
finance expense. The carrying value of the hedged item is adjusted by the change in fair value that is 
attributable to the risk being hedged with changes recognised in the income statement, also within finance 
expense. The gain or loss relating to any ineffective portion of the hedging arrangement is recognised 
immediately in the income statement.

If the hedge relationship is de-designated, then from the point of de-designation there is no further fair 
valuing of the hedged item. Any previous adjustment to the carrying amount of the hedged item is 
amortised over the remaining maturity of the hedged item.

(ii) Cash flow hedge
The effective portion of changes in the fair value of derivatives that are designated and qualify as cash flow 
hedges is recognised in the cash flow hedge reserve within equity. The gain or loss relating to any ineffective 
portion is recognised immediately in the income statement.

Where a derivative instrument is designated and qualifies as a hedge of a forecast transaction, only the 
change in fair value of the forward contract related to the spot component is designated as the hedging 
instrument. Gains or losses relating to the effective portion of the change in the spot component of the 
forward contract are initially recognised in the cash flow hedge reserve within equity. The change in the 
forward element of the contract that relates to the hedged item is recognised in the income statement. 

Gains or losses accumulated in equity are reclassified to the income statement when the hedged item 
affects profit or loss. When the hedged item results in the recognition of a non-financial asset, the gains 
or losses accumulated in equity are transferred from equity and included in the carrying amount of the 
non-financial asset, with the deferred gains or losses ultimately being recognised in the income statement 
as the non-financial asset affects profit or loss. This transfer is not a reclassification adjustment.

p. Financial instruments continued 

When a hedging instrument expires, any cumulative deferred gain/loss in equity relating to that instrument 
remains in equity until the forecast transaction occurs at which point it is reclassified to the income 
statement. When the forecast transaction is no longer expected to occur, the cumulative deferred gain/loss 
recorded in equity is immediately reclassified to the income statement.

(iii) Net investment hedge
Foreign currency differences arising on the retranslation of a financial liability designated as a hedge of a net 
investment in foreign operations are recognised directly in equity to the extent the hedge is effective and 
are accumulated in a separate reserve within equity. To the extent that the hedge is ineffective such 
differences are recognised in the income statement. 

(iv) Other derivative instruments
Certain derivative instruments do not qualify for hedge accounting. Changes in the fair value of any 
derivative instrument that does not qualify for hedge accounting are recognised immediately in the income 
statement.

q. Cash, cash equivalents and overdrafts
Cash and cash equivalents, as reported in the balance sheet, comprises cash at bank and in hand and 
money market funds. Cash at bank and in hand includes cash balances and short term deposits with 
maturities of three months or less from the date the deposit is made. 

Cash, cash equivalents and overdrafts, as reported in the cash flow statement, comprises cash at bank and 
in hand, money market funds and bank overdrafts. 

r. Net debt
Net debt is defined as interest bearing loans and borrowings adjusted for the fair value of interest rate 
swaps on fixed interest rate borrowings and other derivatives managing the interest rate risk and currency 
profile less cash, cash equivalents and overdrafts.

s. Provisions
A provision is recognised in the balance sheet when the Group has a present legal or constructive obligation 
as a result of a past event that can be reliably measured and it is probable that an outflow of economic 
benefits will be required to settle the obligation. If the effect is material, provisions are determined by 
discounting the expected future cash flows at a pre-tax rate that reflects risks specific to the liability.

t. Investment in own shares
The cost of shares held either directly (treasury shares) or indirectly (employee benefit trust shares) is 
deducted from equity. Repurchased shares are classified as treasury shares and are presented as a 
deduction from total equity. When treasury shares are subsequently sold or reissued, the amount received 
is recognised as an increase in equity and the resulting surplus or deficit on the transaction is recognised in 
retained earnings. 

At each reporting date the Group remeasures the value of the shares held in the employee benefit trust to 
present them in the own shares reserve at the market value of those shares at the reporting date. This is 
done through a reclassification from retained earnings to the own shares reserve. This movement has no 
effect on the actual numbers of shares held by the employee benefit trust.

u. Retirement benefits
(i) Defined contribution pension schemes
A defined contribution pension scheme is a post-employment benefit scheme under which the Company 
pays fixed contributions into a separate fund and will have no legal or constructive obligation to pay further 
contributions if the fund does not hold sufficient assets to pay all employee benefits relating to employee 
service in the current and prior periods. Obligations for contributions to defined contribution pension 
schemes are recognised as an expense in the income statement in the periods during which services are 
rendered by employees.

(ii) Defined benefit pension schemes
A defined benefit pension scheme is a post-employment benefit plan other than a defined contribution 
pension scheme. Defined benefit pension schemes are recognised on the balance sheet as a defined 
benefit pension asset or a defined benefit pension liability based on the difference between the fair value 
of pension scheme assets and the present value of pension scheme liabilities.

The present value of pension scheme liabilities is calculated by a qualified actuary using the projected unit 
method by estimating the amount of future benefit that employees have earned in return for their service 
in the current and prior periods, discounted using the rate applicable to AA rated corporate bonds that have 
a similar maturity and currency to the pension scheme liabilities. The fair value of any pension scheme 
assets (at bid price) is deducted from the present value of pension scheme liabilities to determine the net 
deficit or surplus of each scheme. Remeasurements arising from defined benefit pension schemes 
comprise actuarial gains and losses on pension scheme liabilities and the actual return on pension scheme 
assets excluding amounts already included in net interest. The net actuarial gain or loss for the year is 
recorded in full in the statement of comprehensive income.

Current service cost, past service cost or gain and gains and losses on any settlements and curtailments 
are credited or charged to the income statement. Past service cost is recognised immediately to the extent 
benefits are already vested. Net interest on the net defined benefit pension liability or asset is calculated by 
applying the discount rate used to measure the defined benefit pension scheme deficit or surplus at the 
beginning of the year to the net defined benefit pension liability or asset at the beginning of the year. Net 
interest is recorded within finance expense or finance income in the income statement.

When the valuation of a defined benefit pension scheme results in a surplus, the recognised defined benefit 
pension asset is limited to the present value of benefits available in the form of any future refunds from the 
pension scheme or reductions in future contributions and takes into account the adverse effect of any 
minimum funding requirements.

v. Dividends
The interim dividend is recognised in the statement of changes in equity in the period in which it is paid and 
the final dividend in the period in which it is approved by shareholders at the Annual General Meeting.

w. Hyperinflationary economies
Where the Group has operations in countries to which hyperinflation accounting applies, the financial 
statements of the business concerned are accounted for under IAS 29 ‘Financial Reporting in 
Hyperinflationary Economies’. See Note 1a(ii) for details on the impact of hyperinflation accounting in 
the current year.

2 Accounting policies continued

x. Judgements made in applying the Group’s accounting policies 
In the course of preparing the financial statements, other than judgements involved in determining lease 
terms under the application of IFRS 16 ‘Leases’ and in determining estimates and assumptions (see Note 2y 
below), no other judgements have been made in the process of applying the Group’s accounting policies 
that have had a significant effect on the amounts recognised in the financial statements. 

In measuring its right-of-use assets and lease liabilities, management is required to make judgements, 
particularly in relation to lease termination options. Periods after the date of a termination option are only 
included in the lease term if it is reasonably certain that the lease will not be terminated. While management 
determine lease terms across the Group on a case-by-case basis, if different judgements were applied 
relating to a number of leases, it could have a significant effect on the overall amounts recognised in the 
financial statements. 

y. Sources of estimation uncertainty
In applying the Group’s accounting policies various transactions and balances are valued using estimates 
or assumptions. Should these estimates or assumptions prove incorrect, there may be an impact on the 
following year’s financial statements. As at 31 December 2023, sources of estimation uncertainty where 
there was a significant risk of material adjustment to the carrying amounts of assets and liabilities within 
the next financial year was limited to the following item:

Defined benefit pension schemes
The measurement of the present value of defined benefit pension scheme liabilities involves the use of 
various actuarial assumptions. The Group uses independent actuarial experts to assist with the estimation 
of the discount rates, inflation rates and longevity assumptions used for the measurement of defined 
benefit pension scheme liabilities but the actual liabilities could be materially different. The main risks 
to which the Group is exposed in relation to the valuation of the defined benefit pension schemes are 
described in Note 25. The Group’s net pension asset balance as at 31 December 2023 was £46.6m 
(2022: £39.9m).

While not expected to result in a material change in the carrying value of assets or liabilities in the next 12 
months the following estimates or assumptions were also used in applying the Group’s accounting policies:

Accounting for business combinations
Part of the Company’s strategy is to grow through acquisitions. Acquisitions are accounted for using the 
acquisition method as described in the business combinations accounting policy, Note 2a(ii), and the 
goodwill accounting policy, Note 2k(i). This includes the determination of fair values for assets and liabilities 
acquired, including the separate identification of intangible assets, which use assumptions and estimates 
and are therefore subjective. The Group has developed a process to meet the requirements of IFRS 3 
including the separate identification of customer relationships, brands and technology intangible assets 
based on estimated future performance and customer attrition rates. This formal process is applied to 
each acquisition and involves an assessment of the assets acquired and liabilities assumed with 
assistance provided by external valuation specialists where appropriate. Until this assessment is 
complete, the allocation period remains open up to a maximum of 12 months from the relevant 
acquisition date. The process applied is described in Note 9.

y. Sources of estimation uncertainty continued
Recoverability of goodwill, customer relationships, brands and technology intangible assets
As noted above, part of the Company’s strategy is to grow through acquisitions which has led to material 
goodwill, customer relationships, brands and technology intangible assets being recognised on the balance 
sheet. Goodwill, which is allocated across CGUs, is tested annually to determine if there is any indication of 
impairment by comparing the carrying amount of the goodwill to the recoverable amount of the CGU to 
which it has been allocated. Assumptions and estimates are used to determine the recoverable amount of 
each CGU, principally based on the present value of estimated future cash flows. Actual performance may 
differ from management’s expectations. The estimates and assumptions used in performing impairment 
testing are described in Note 13. Customer relationships, brands and technology intangible assets are also 
reviewed annually for indicators of impairment and if an indicator of impairment exists then similar 
recoverability testing, involving the use of estimates and assumptions, is performed for the business to 
which the customer relationships, brands and technology intangible assets relate. The useful economic lives 
of customer relationships, brands and technology intangible assets are also reviewed at least annually, with 
any revisions to the original estimated useful economic lives accounted for prospectively. As at 31 December 
2023 the goodwill balance was £2,008.9m (2022: £1,931.6m), the amount of customer relationships 
intangible assets was £1,150.8m (2022: £1,090.9m), the amount of brands intangible assets was £41.1m 
(2022: £34.9m) and the amount of technology intangible assets was £7.5m (2022: £9.1m).

Trade receivables and inventory provisions
Due to the uncertainty created by the Covid-19 pandemic and the continuing challenging economic 
conditions, trade receivables and inventory provisions are considered to be a source of estimation 
uncertainty. In 2020 and 2021, the Group saw increases in provisions for expected credit losses on trade 
receivables and slow moving inventory provisions, and additional provisions were made as a result of market 
price deflation on certain Covid-19 products. During 2023, the Group has seen a net utilisation of 
approximately £25m in trade receivables and slow moving inventory provisions (2022: net utilisation of 
approximately £5m), and also some utilisation of the residual provisions set up in the prior year for market 
price movements on certain Covid-19 products; the remaining market price risk on these products is no 
longer significant. As at 31 December 2023, the Group carried trade receivables provisions of £34.5m (2022: 
£29.1m) and provisions for slow moving, obsolete or defective inventories and market price movements of 
£154.2m (2022: £179.9m).

Taxation
The Group operates in many countries and is therefore subject to tax laws in a number of different tax 
jurisdictions. The amount of tax payable or receivable on profits or losses for any period is subject to the 
agreement of the tax authority in each respective jurisdiction and the tax liability or asset position is open to 
review for several years after the relevant accounting period ends. In determining the provisions for income 
taxes, management is required to make assumptions based on interpretations of tax statute and case law, 
which it does after taking account of professional advice and prior experience.

The majority of the Group’s tax payable balance of £47.5m (2022: £41.7m) relates to provisions for uncertain 
tax matters. Uncertainties in respect of enquiries and additional tax assessments raised by tax authorities 
are measured by management according to the guidance provided by IFRIC 23 ‘Uncertainty over Income Tax 
Treatments’ but the amounts ultimately payable or receivable may differ from the amounts of any provisions 
recognised in the consolidated financial statements as a result of the estimates and assumptions used.

Management does not consider there to be any significant risks of material adjustment within the next 
financial year because tax provisions cover a range of matters across multiple tax jurisdictions with a variety 
of timescales before such matters are expected to be concluded.

3 Alternative performance measures

In addition to the various performance measures defined under IFRS, the Group reports a number of other 
measures that are designed to assist with the understanding of the underlying performance of the Group 
and its businesses. These measures are not defined under IFRS and, as a result, do not comply with 
Generally Accepted Accounting Practice (‘GAAP’) and are therefore known as ‘alternative performance 
measures’. Accordingly, these measures, which are not designed to be a substitute for any of the IFRS 
measures of performance, may not be directly comparable with other companies’ alternative performance 
measures. The principal alternative performance measures used within the consolidated financial 
statements and the location of the reconciliation to equivalent IFRS measures are shown and defined in the 
table below:

Underlying 
revenue growth

Revenue excluding the incremental impact of acquisitions and disposals compared to revenue 
in prior years at constant exchange, adjusted for differences in trading days between years 
and adjusted to exclude growth in excess of 26% per annum in hyperinflationary economies 
(reconciled in the Financial Review)

Adjusted 
operating profit

Operating profit before customer relationships, brands and technology amortisation, 
acquisition related items, non-recurring pension scheme charges and profit or loss on disposal 
of businesses (reconciled in the following tables and in the Consolidated income statement)

Operating margin

Adjusted operating profit as a percentage of revenue

Adjusted profit 
before income tax

Profit before income tax, customer relationships, brands and technology amortisation, 
acquisition related items, non-recurring pension scheme charges and profit or loss on disposal 
of businesses (reconciled in the following tables)

Adjusted profit 
for the year

Profit for the year before customer relationships, brands and technology amortisation, 
acquisition related items, non-recurring pension scheme charges, profit or loss on disposal 
of businesses and the associated tax (reconciled in the following tables)

Effective tax rate

Tax on adjusted profit before income tax as a percentage of adjusted profit before income 
tax (reconciled in Note 7)

Adjusted earnings 
per share

Adjusted profit for the year divided by the weighted average number of ordinary shares in issue 
(reconciled in the following tables and in Note 8)

Adjusted diluted 
earnings per share

Adjusted profit for the year divided by the diluted weighted average number of ordinary shares 
(reconciled in Note 8)

Operating 
cash flow

Cash generated from operations before acquisition related items after deducting purchases 
of property, plant and equipment and software and adding back the proceeds from the sale 
of property, plant and equipment and software and deducting the payment of lease liabilities 
(as shown in the Consolidated cash flow statement)

Free cash flow

Operating cash flow after deducting payments for income tax and net interest excluding 
interest on lease liabilities (as shown in the Consolidated cash flow statement)

Lease adjusted 
operating profit

Adjusted operating profit after adding back the depreciation of right-of-use assets and 
deducting the payment of lease liabilities (as shown in the Consolidated cash flow statement)

Cash conversion

Operating cash flow as a percentage of lease adjusted operating profit (as shown in the 
Consolidated cash flow statement)

Return on average 
operating capital

The ratio of adjusted operating profit to the average of the month end operating capital 
employed (being property, plant and equipment, right-of-use assets, software, inventories and 
trade and other receivables less trade and other payables)

Return on 
invested capital

The ratio of adjusted operating profit to the average of the month end invested capital (being 
equity after adding back net debt, lease liabilities, net defined benefit pension scheme liabilities, 
cumulative customer relationships, brands and technology amortisation, acquisition related 
items and amounts written off goodwill, net of the associated tax)

Dividend cover

The ratio of adjusted earnings per share to the total dividend per share

EBITDA

Adjusted operating profit on a historical GAAP basis, before depreciation of property, plant 
and equipment and software amortisation and after adjustments as permitted by the Group’s 
debt covenants, principally to exclude share option charges and to annualise for the effect of 
acquisitions and disposal of businesses

Net debt excluding 
lease liabilities

Constant 
exchange rates

Net debt excluding the carrying value of lease liabilities (reconciled in Note 28)

Growth rates at constant exchange rates are calculated by retranslating the results for prior 
years at the average rates for the year ended 31 December 2023 so that they can be compared 
without the distorting impact of changes caused by foreign exchange translation. The principal 
exchange rates used for 2023 and 2022 can be found in the Financial review on page 80

The definition of 'Dividend cover' has been added to the list of alternative performance measures in the 
year. All other alternative performance measures have been calculated consistently with the methods 
applied in the consolidated financial statements for the year ended 31 December 2022. The amendments 
to the list of alternative performance measures and an assessment of the relevance of the existing 
alternative performance measures, were agreed with the Audit Committee. 

A number of the alternative performance measures listed above exclude the charge for customer 
relationships, brands and technology amortisation, acquisition related items, non-recurring pension scheme 
charges, profit or loss on disposal of businesses and any associated tax, where relevant. 

Acquisition related items comprise deferred consideration payments relating to the retention of former 
owners of businesses acquired, transaction costs and expenses, adjustments to previously estimated earn 
outs, customer relationships asset impairment charges, goodwill impairment charges and interest on 
acquisition related income tax. Customer relationships, brands and technology amortisation, acquisition 
related items and any associated tax are considered by management to form part of the total spend on 
acquisitions or are non-cash items resulting from acquisitions. The non-recurring pension scheme charges 
relate to non-recurring charges arising from the Group’s participation in a number of defined benefit 
pension schemes. In the year ended 31 December 2023 and the year ended 31 December 2022 there were 
no non-recurring pension scheme charges. Disposal of business relates to the profit on disposal of the 
Group’s UK Healthcare division in the year ended 31 December 2022. None of these items relate to the 
trading performance of the business. Accordingly, these items are not taken into account by management 
when assessing the results of the business and are removed in calculating the profitability measures by 
which management assesses the performance of the Group. However, it should be noted that they do 
exclude charges that nevertheless do impact the Group’s cash flow and GAAP financial performance. 

Working capital

Inventories and trade and other receivables less trade and other payables, excluding 
non-operating related receivables, non-operating related payables (including those relating 
to acquisition payments) and dividends payable (reconciled in Note 14)

Other alternative performance measures, including the Group’s key performance indicators which are set 
out and defined on pages 40 and 41, are used to monitor the performance of the Group and a number of 
these are based on, or derived from, the alternative performance measures noted above.

Reportable segments are determined based on quantitative thresholds in accordance with IFRS 8 
‘Operating Segments’. The three business areas of North America, Continental Europe and UK & Ireland 
are operating segments that meet the quantitative thresholds for reportable segments and are therefore 
disclosed separately above. The Rest of the World business area contains businesses in Latin America and 
Asia Pacific which individually do not meet the quantitative thresholds for separate disclosure as reportable 
segments. Rest of the World is therefore an ‘other’ segment that is disclosed above as a reportable segment 
as this information is considered to be useful to users of the financial statements and it also helps to 
reconcile the results of the reportable segments to the Group’s consolidated results.

The revenue presented relates to external customers. Sales between the business areas are not material. 
Each of the business areas supplies a range of products to customers operating primarily in the grocery, 
foodservice, safety, cleaning & hygiene, retail and healthcare market sectors but results are not monitored 
on this basis. The performance of the four business areas is assessed by reference to adjusted operating 
profit and this measure also represents the segment results for the purposes of reporting in accordance 
with IFRS 8. Debt and associated interest is managed at a Group level and therefore has not been allocated 
across the business areas. 

In the year ended 31 December 2023 the Group had no customer that represented 10% or more of total 
Group revenue (2022: no customers).

As noted above, the businesses within each operating segment operate in a number of different countries 
and sell products across a range of market sectors, with the vast majority of revenue generated from the 
delivery of goods to customers. The following table provides a breakdown of revenue by market sector. 
The other category covers a wide range of market sectors, none of which is sufficiently material to warrant 
separate disclosure.

2023 was £1,270.3m, representing 11% of the Group’s total (2022: £1,354.5m, representing 11% of the 
Group’s total). Revenue attributable to foreign countries in total was £10,526.8m, representing 89% of the 
Group’s total (2022: £10,685.0m, representing 89% of the Group’s total). Six foreign countries account for the 
majority of the revenue attributable to foreign countries, these being USA, Canada, France, the Netherlands, 
Australia and Brazil. These six foreign countries account for 73% of the Group’s revenue (2022: 74%).

Non-current assets attributable to the UK, the parent company’s country of domicile, for the year ended 
31 December 2023 were £508.7m, representing 13% of the Group’s total (2022 restated: £486.6m, 
representing 13% of the Group’s total). Non-current assets attributable to foreign countries in total were 
£3,509.2m, representing 87% of the Group’s total (2022 restated: £3,274.1m, representing 87% of the 
Group’s total). Six foreign countries account for the majority of the non-current assets attributable to foreign 
countries, these being USA, Canada, France, the Netherlands, Australia and Brazil. These six foreign 
countries account for 66% of the Group’s total non-current assets (2022 restated: 65%). The 2022

The foreign exchange loss on intercompany funding arises as a result of the retranslation of foreign currency 
intercompany loans. This loss on intercompany funding is substantially matched by the foreign exchange 
gain on external debt and foreign exchange forward contracts not in a hedge relationship which minimises 
the foreign currency exposure in the income statement.

Audit related assurance services comprise the review of the half yearly financial report for the six months 
ended 30 June. All other services comprise other non-audit work which was permissible in accordance with 
the Company’s policy and the prevailing regulations concerning the provision of non-audit services by the 
Company’s external auditors. It is the Company’s policy to assess the non-audit services to be performed by 
the Company’s auditors on a case-by-case basis to ensure adherence to the prevailing ethical standards and 
regulations. Other firms are normally used by the Company to provide non-audit services. However, if the 
provision of a service by the Company’s auditors is permitted and adequate safeguards are in place, it is 
sometimes appropriate for this additional work to be carried out by the Company’s auditors. 

The Audit Committee, which consists entirely of independent non-executive directors, reviews and approves 
the level and type of non-audit work which the external auditors perform, including the fees paid for such 
work, to ensure that the auditors’ objectivity and independence are not compromised. Further information 
is set out in the Audit Committee’s report on pages 112 to 121.

Factors affecting the tax charge for the year
The Group operates in many countries and is subject to different rates of income tax in those countries. 
The expected tax rate is calculated as a weighted average of the tax rates in the tax jurisdictions in which 
the Group operates, most of which are higher than the UK statutory rate for the year of 23.5% (2022: 19.0%). 
The adjustments to the tax charge at the weighted average rate to determine the income tax on profit are 
as follows: 

Profit before income tax

Tax charge at weighted average rate (2023: 25.2%; 2022: 24.6%)
Effects of:

non-deductible expenditure
impact of intercompany finance
change in tax rates
hyperinflation accounting adjustments
prior year adjustments

The Group is within the scope of the OECD Pillar Two model rules which impose a minimum tax expense 
in each country. Pillar Two legislation has been enacted in the UK, the country of tax residence of the 
ultimate parent of the Group, as well as in several other countries in which the Group operates. The earliest 
legislation is effective from 1 January 2024. Since the Pillar Two legislation was not effective during the year 
ended 31 December 2023, the Group has no related current tax exposure at the balance sheet date. The 
Group applies the exception to recognising and disclosing information about deferred tax assets and 
liabilities related to Pillar Two income taxes, as provided in the amendments to IAS 12 issued in May 2023.

The legislation imposes a top-up tax to the extent that in any country the effective tax rate according to the 
Pillar Two methodology is below the 15% minimum rate. Most countries in which the Group operates are 
expected to report an effective tax rate in excess of 15% and therefore to qualify for a safe harbour 
exemption such that no top-up tax should apply. In countries where this is not the case there is the potential 
for Pillar Two taxes to apply, but these are not expected to be material. The Group continues to refine this 
assessment and analyse the future consequences of these rules.

9 Acquisitions 
Acquisitions involving the purchase of the acquiree’s share capital or, as the case may be, the relevant assets 
of the businesses acquired, have been accounted for under the acquisition method of accounting. A key part 
of the Group’s strategy is to grow through acquisition. The Group has developed a process to assist with the 
identification of the fair values of the assets acquired and liabilities assumed, including the separate 
identification of intangible assets in accordance with IFRS 3 ‘Business Combinations’ as revised. This formal 
process is applied to each acquisition and involves an assessment of the assets acquired and liabilities 
assumed with assistance provided by external valuation specialists where appropriate. Until this 
assessment is complete, the allocation period remains open up to a maximum of 12 months from the 
relevant acquisition date. At 31 December 2023 the allocation period for all acquisitions completed since 
1 January 2023 remained open and accordingly the fair values presented are provisional.

Adjustments are made to the assets acquired and liabilities assumed during the allocation period to the 
extent that further information and knowledge come to light that more accurately reflect conditions at the 
acquisition date. Adjustments are made to the value of assets acquired to reflect more accurately the 
estimated realisable or settlement value. Similarly, adjustments are made to acquired liabilities to record 
onerous commitments or other commitments existing at the acquisition date but not recognised by the 
acquiree. Adjustments are also made to reflect the associated tax effects. During the year ended 31 
December 2023 adjustments have been recognised to the fair value of assets and liabilities acquired related 
to acquisitions made in the prior year, resulting in a net increase to goodwill of £0.8m (2022: net decrease to 
goodwill of £3.4m). Given the immaterial amounts involved the fair value of assets and liabilities acquired as 
reported in the prior year have not been restated.

The consideration paid or payable in respect of acquisitions comprises amounts paid on completion, 
deferred consideration and payments which are contingent on the retention of former owners of 
businesses acquired. Any payments that are contingent on future employment, including payments which 
are contingent on the retention of former owners of businesses acquired, are charged to the income 
statement. All other consideration has been allocated against the identified net assets, with the balance 
recorded as goodwill. Transaction costs and expenses such as professional fees are charged to the income 
statement. The acquisitions provide opportunities for further development of the Group’s activities and to 
create enhanced returns. Such opportunities and the workforces inherent in each of the acquired 
businesses do not translate to separately identifiable intangible assets but do represent much of the 
assessed value that supports the recognised goodwill.

For each of the businesses acquired and announced during the year, the name of the business, the market 
sector served, its location and date of acquisition, as well as the estimated annualised revenue it would have 
contributed to the Group for the year if such acquisitions had been made at the beginning of the year, are 
separately disclosed. The remaining disclosures required by IFRS 3 are provided separately for those 
individual acquisitions that are considered to be material and in aggregate for individually immaterial 
acquisitions. An acquisition would generally be considered individually material if the impact on the Group’s 
revenue or profit measures (on an annualised basis) or the relevant amounts on the balance sheet is greater 
than 5%. Management also applies judgement in considering whether there are any material qualitative 
differences from other acquisitions made.

10 Disposal of business
The Group did not dispose of any businesses during the year ended 31 December 2023. Disposal of 
business in the year ended 31 December 2022 related to the UK Healthcare division, a business that was 
no longer considered to be a strategic fit within the portfolio of the Group’s businesses. The disposal 
was completed on 19 December 2022. 

During the year ended 31 December 2022, the net assets of the Group increased by £0.9m representing the 
profit on disposal of £0.9m. The profit on disposal reflects the cash consideration received of £63.7m, offset 
by the net book value of the assets disposed of £53.0m, including the associated customer relationships 
intangible assets of £2.2m and the carrying value of allocated goodwill of £17.0m, less the associated 
transaction costs.

The net cash inflow in the year in respect of disposal of business comprised:

13 Intangible assets continued
Goodwill, customer relationships, brands and technology intangible assets have been acquired as part of 
business combinations. Further details of acquisitions made in the year are set out in Note 9. 

Customer relationships include three businesses with individually significant customer relationships assets, 
McCue Corporation acquired in October 2021 and based in North America, MCR Safety acquired in 
September 2020 and based in North America and Hedis acquired in 2017 and based in France. The net 
book value of customer relationships in McCue Corporation as at 31 December 2023 was £98.9m (2022: 
£113.1m) with a remaining useful economic life of 12.7 years (2022: 13.7 years). The net book value of 
customer relationships in MCR Safety as at 31 December 2023 was £82.7m (2022: £94.2m) with a remaining 
useful economic life of 11.7 years (2022: 12.7 years). The net book value of customer relationships in Hedis 
as at 31 December 2023 was £76.8m (2022: £86.9m) with a remaining useful economic life of 9.9 years 
(2022: 10.9 years).

Impairment testing
The carrying amount of goodwill is allocated across CGUs and is tested annually for impairment by 
comparing the recoverable amount of each CGU with its carrying value.

A description of the Group’s principal activities is set out in the Chief Executive Officer’s review. There is 
no significant difference in the nature of activities across different geographies. The identification of CGUs 
reflects the way the business is managed and monitored on a geographical basis, taking into account the 
generation of cash flows and the sharing of synergies. Given the similar nature of the activities of each CGU, 
a consistent methodology is applied across the Group in assessing CGU recoverable amounts. The 
recoverable amount is the higher of the value in use and the fair value less the costs of disposal. The value 
in use is the present value of the cash flows expected to be generated by the CGU over a projection period 
together with a terminal value. The projection period is the time period over which future cash flows are 
predicted. The Group’s methodology is to use a projection period of five years consisting of detailed cash 
flow forecasts for the first two years and CGU specific growth assumptions for years three, four and five. 
For periods after this five year period, the methodology applies a long term growth rate specific to the CGU 
to derive a terminal value. Cash flow expectations exclude any future cash flows that may arise from 
restructuring or other enhancements to the cash generating activities of the CGU and reflect management’s 
expectations of the range of economic conditions that may exist over the projection period. 

The value in use calculations are principally sensitive to revenue growth, including any significant changes 
to the customer base, achievability of future profit margins and the discount rates used in the present value 
calculation. The information used for valuation purposes takes into consideration past experience and the 
current economic environment with regard to customer attrition rates and additions to the customer base, 
the ability to introduce price increases and new products and experience in controlling the underlying cost 
base. This information is used to determine a long term growth rate which is consistent with the geographic 
segments in which the Group operates and management’s assessment of future operating performance 
and market share movements. The discount rates used are determined with assistance provided by 
external valuation specialists.

The Group allocates goodwill across seven CGUs (2022: seven). Based on our impairment testing, no 
impairments were identified to the carrying value of goodwill within the Group.

As at 31 December 2023, North America, UK & Ireland, France and Rest of Continental Europe carried a 
significant amount of goodwill in comparison with the total value of the Group’s goodwill. At 31 December 
2023 the carrying value of goodwill in respect of North America was £700.0m (2022: £722.7m), UK & Ireland 
was £317.3m (2022: £314.7m), France was £253.5m (2022: £258.0m) and Rest of Continental Europe was 
£307.1m (2022: £276.8m). As at 31 December 2023 the aggregate amount of goodwill attributable to the 
Group’s CGUs, excluding North America, UK & Ireland, France and Rest of Continental Europe, was 
£431.0m (2022: £359.4m), none of which is individually significant.

For North America, UK & Ireland, France and Rest of Continental Europe, the weighted average long term 
growth rate used in 2023 was in the range of 2.5%–3.3% (2022: 2.5%–4.0%) reflecting anticipated revenue 
and profit growth. A pre-tax discount rate in the range of 9%–11% (2022: 8%–11%) has been applied to the 
value in use calculations reflecting market assessments of the time value of money at the balance sheet 
date. Similar assumptions have been applied to the other CGUs but where appropriate the directors have 
considered alternative market risk assumptions to reflect the specific conditions arising in individual CGUs 
with long term growth rates ranging from 2.5%–5.5% (2022: 2.5%–5.4%) and discount rates ranging from 
9%–15% (2022: 7%–15%).

As part of the annual impairment testing for goodwill, the Group also considered whether there were any 
indicators that individual customer relationships and brands intangible assets were impaired. As for the 
impairment testing for the Group’s CGUs noted above, value in use calculations were prepared based on 
management’s latest expectations of the performance of the relevant business over a five year projection 
period and appropriate long term growth and discount rates. Based on our impairment testing, no 
impairments were identified to the carrying value of customer relationships, brands and technology 
intangible assets within the Group.

Sensitivity to changes in key assumptions
Impairment testing is dependent on management’s estimates and judgements, particularly as they relate 
to the forecasting of future cash flows, expected long term growth rates and the discount rates selected. 
Key assumptions on which value in use calculations are dependent relate to the discount rates used and 
revenue growth including the impact of changes to the underlying customer base from customer attrition 
and the rate at which new customer relationships are introduced and established.

As part of the annual impairment testing, management performed sensitivity analysis by modelling the 
impact of higher discount rates, and reviewing the combination of discount rates and long term growth rates 
which would bring the value in use to the net book value or below. From this sensitivity testing management 
has concluded that no reasonably possible change in key assumptions would result in a material change 
to the carrying amounts of any of the Group’s intangible assets in the next 12 months. 

The Group has also considered whether climate change would have a significant impact on the approach 
taken to the annual impairment testing. As part of this the Group has assessed three alternative climate 
change scenarios up to 2050. Two of our scenarios align with the global warming trajectory of between 
1⁰C to 2⁰C by 2100 but differ in the speed and extent of global decarbonisation over the next 30 years 
(orderly and disorderly). Our final scenario assessed the potential impacts of a world in which global 
warming exceeds 3⁰C by 2100 (hothouse world scenario). Having assessed these scenarios the Group has 
concluded that, although climate change is a principal risk, it does not warrant any amendment to the 
assumptions used in the Group’s impairment testing, and would not have a material impact on the results 
of the impairment testing.

During the year £11.9m (2022: £10.8m) was written off directly from inventories due to obsolescence or 
damage. Inventory provisions, including provisions for slow moving, obsolete or defective inventories and 
market price movements, as at 31 December 2023 were £154.2m (2022: £179.9m). During the year, the 
Group saw a net utilisation of approximately £25m on provisions for slow moving inventory (2022: net 
utilisation of approximately £4m), as well as some utilisation of the residual provisions related to market 
price movements on Covid-19 related products; the remaining market price risk on these products is no 
longer significant.

18 Risk management and financial instruments
Capital management
The Group’s policy is to maintain a strong capital base so as to maintain investor, creditor and market 
confidence and to sustain future development of the business. The Group monitors the return on average 
operating capital employed and the return on invested capital (as defined in Note 3) as well as the level of 
total shareholders’ equity and sets the amount of dividends paid to ordinary shareholders. 

The principal financial covenant limits are net debt to EBITDA, calculated at average exchange rates and in 
accordance with the Group’s external debt covenants, of no more than 3.5 times and interest cover of no 
less than 3.0 times. Sensitivity analyses using various scenarios are applied to forecasts to assess their 
impact on covenants and net debt. Additionally, compliance with the Group’s biannual debt covenants is 
monitored on a monthly basis and formally tested at 30 June and 31 December. During 2023 all covenants 
have been complied with and based on current forecasts it is expected that such covenants will continue to 
be complied with for the foreseeable future. Debt covenants are based on historical accounting standards. 
The US private placement notes (‘USPPs’) issued in March 2022 contain a clause whereby upon maturity of 
the previously issued USPPs, the latest maturity being in 2028, the principal financial covenants referred to 
above will no longer apply. In addition, the principle financial covenants were removed from the Group’s 
committed bank facilities in 2022.

The Group funds its operations through a mixture of shareholders’ equity and bank and capital market 
borrowings. All of the borrowings are managed by a central treasury function and funds raised are lent 
onward to operating subsidiaries as required. The overall objective is to manage the funding to ensure the 
borrowings have a range of maturities, are competitively priced and meet the demands of the business over 
time and, in order to do so, the Group arranges a mixture of borrowings from different sources with a variety 
of maturity dates.

The Group’s businesses provide a high and consistent level of cash generation which helps fund future 
development and growth. The Group seeks to maintain an appropriate balance between the higher returns 
that might be possible with higher levels of borrowings and the advantages and security afforded by a 
sound capital position.

There were no changes to the Group’s approach to capital management during the year and the Group is 
not subject to any externally imposed capital requirements.

Treasury policies and controls
The Group has a centralised treasury department to control external borrowings and manage liquidity, 
interest rate, foreign currency and credit risks. Treasury policies have been approved by the Board and cover 
the nature of the exposure to be hedged, the types of financial instruments that may be employed and the 
criteria for investing and borrowing cash. The Group uses derivatives to manage its foreign currency and 
interest rate risks arising from underlying business activities. No transactions of a speculative nature are 
undertaken. The treasury department is subject to periodic independent review by the internal audit 
department. Underlying policy assumptions and activities are periodically reviewed by the Board. Controls 
over exposure changes and transaction authenticity are in place.

Derivatives and hedge accounting
The Group designates derivatives which qualify as hedges for accounting purposes as either (a) a hedge 
of the fair value of a recognised asset or liability; (b) a hedge of the cash flow risk resulting from changes 
in interest rates or foreign exchange rates; or (c) a hedge of a net investment in a foreign operation. The 
accounting treatment for hedges and derivatives is set out in the financial instruments accounting policy 
in Note 2p. The Group tests the effectiveness of hedges on a prospective basis to ensure compliance with 
IFRS 9. Information about the methods and assumptions used in determining the fair value of derivatives 
is provided under the Financial instruments section on page 179.

Hedge effectiveness
For hedges of foreign currency purchases and sales, the Group enters into cash flow hedge relationships 
where the critical terms of the hedging instrument are similar to those of the hedged item, such as notional 
amount, expected maturity date and currency. Hedge ineffectiveness may arise if the timing of the forecast 
transaction changes from what was originally estimated. The Group therefore performs a quantitative 
hedge effectiveness assessment to calculate any ineffectiveness during the period. 

Part of the Group’s fixed rate debt portfolio is swapped to floating rates using interest rate swaps where the 
hedged items are individual tranches of fixed rate debt. These interest rate swaps are held in fair value 
hedges with critical terms exactly matching those of the underlying hedged items, such as notional amounts, 
payment dates, reset dates, maturity dates and currencies. As all critical terms matched during the year, the 
economic relationship was 100% effective. The Group therefore performs a qualitative assessment of 
effectiveness. If changes in circumstances affect the terms of the hedged item such that the critical terms no 
longer match exactly with the critical terms of the hedging instrument, the Group will perform a quantitative 
assessment of effectiveness. Hedge ineffectiveness may arise due to a change in credit risk of the 
counterparty or if there is a change in timings or amounts of the hedged cash flows.

There was no material ineffectiveness during 2023 in relation to the interest rate swaps or the forward 
currency contracts.

Risk management
(a) Liquidity risk
Liquidity risk is the risk that the Group will not be able to meet its financial obligations as they fall due. 
The Group continually monitors net debt and forecast cash flows to ensure that sufficient facilities are 
in place to meet the Group’s requirements in the short, medium and long term and, in order to do so, 
arranges borrowings from a variety of sources. 

The Group has substantial funding available comprising multi-currency credit facilities from the Group’s 
banks, US private placement notes and senior bonds. During 2023, £365m of bank facilities were signed 
with maturities between 2026 to 2028. The Group expects to sign and extend bank facilities during 2024.

During the year, the Group’s USD interest rate swaps and committed USD bank facility, which previously 
referenced the discontinued USD LIBOR, have been renegotiated to reference SOFR, the new USD 
benchmark. This has not had an impact on the financial results for the year ended 31 December 2023.

In addition, the Group maintains overdraft and uncommitted facilities to provide short term flexibility.  
As at 31 December 2023 there were no loans secured by fixed charges on property (2022: none).

Contractual maturity profile
The contractual maturity profile of the Group’s financial liabilities at 31 December is set out in the tables 
below. The amounts disclosed are the contractual undiscounted cash flows and therefore include interest 
cash flows (forecast using SONIA and SOFR interest rates at 31 December in the case of floating rate 
financial assets and liabilities). Derivative assets and liabilities have been included within the tables since 
they predominantly relate to derivatives which are used to manage the interest cash flows on the Group’s 
debt. Bank loans have been drawn under committed facilities and can be refinanced on maturity from these 
same facilities. Accordingly, they have been aged based on the maturity dates of the underlying facilities. 
Foreign currency cash flows have been translated using spot rates as at 31 December.

(b) Interest rate risk
The Group is funded by a mixture of fixed and floating rate debt with the Group’s main interest rate risk 
arising on its floating rate debt. Interest rate swaps and interest rate caps are used to manage the interest 
rate risk profile. 

The table below shows the fixed/floating rate debt mix after interest rate swaps. Of the US private 
placement notes of £925.1m (2022: £1,136.7m), there are US dollar denominated amounts totalling £90.6m 
(2022: £94.6m), with maturities ranging from 2026 to 2028, which have been swapped to floating rates using 
interest rate swaps which reprice daily. Of the senior bonds of £621.9m (2022: £598.3m), an amount totalling 
£322.4m (2022: £299.2m), with a maturity of 2030, has been swapped to floating rates using interest rate 
swaps which reprice daily.

The US private placement notes of £925.1m include a fair value adjustment of £12.4m (2022: £16.6m) related 
to interest rate swaps terminated in previous years. The terminations resulted in discontinuation of a 
number of fair value hedge relationships. At the date of de-designation, there was a fair value adjustment on 
the US private placement notes which will be amortised to the income statement across the remaining life of 
the debt. The amortisation of the fair value adjustment in 2023 was a credit to the income statement of 
£4.2m (2022: £4.2m). 

The interest rate risk on the floating rate liability is managed using interest rate options. The strike rates of 
these options are based on EURIBOR and are repriced every three months. 

Bank loans are drawn for periods up to one month at interest rates linked to SONIA.

Effects of hedge accounting on the financial position and performance
The effects of the interest rate swaps on the Group’s financial position and performance are as follows:

For the year ended 31 December 2023, all foreign exchange cash flow hedges were effective with a 
cumulative pre-tax loss of £2.5m (2022: cumulative pre-tax loss of £1.2m) recognised in equity at the end 
of the year and this will affect the income statement during 2024.

The majority of the Group’s borrowings are effectively denominated in US dollars, sterling and euros, 
aligning them to the respective functional currencies of the component parts of the Group’s EBITDA. This 
currency profile is achieved using short term foreign exchange contracts and foreign currency debt which 
are designated as hedging instruments to achieve net investment hedge accounting at a Group level. This 
currency composition minimises the impact of movements in foreign exchange rates on the ratio of net debt 
to EBITDA. No ineffectiveness was recorded from net investments in foreign entity hedges.

The currency profile of the Group’s net debt excluding lease liabilities at 31 December is set out in the 
table below:

(c) Foreign currency risk
The majority of the Group’s sales are made and income is earned in US dollars, euros and other foreign 
currencies. The Group does not hedge the impact of exchange rate movements arising on translation of 
earnings into sterling at average exchange rates.

The majority of the Group’s transactions are carried out in the respective functional currencies of the 
Group’s operations and so transaction exposures are usually relatively limited. Where they do occur the 
Group’s policy is to hedge exposures of highly probable forecast transactions using forward foreign 
exchange contracts and these are designated as cash flow hedges. During the year the Group hedged highly 
probable forecast transactions for periods of up to 21 months. However, the economic impact of foreign 
exchange on the value of uncommitted future purchases and sales is not hedged. As a result, sudden and 
significant movements in foreign exchange rates can impact profit margins where there is a delay in passing 
the resulting price increases on to customers.

The Group also enters into foreign currency derivatives to hedge intercompany loans economically although 
these do not qualify for hedge accounting and therefore gains and losses are recorded in the income 
statement. These currency derivatives are subject to the same risk management policies as all other 
derivative contracts.

Sensitivity to movements in foreign exchange rates
For the year ended 31 December 2023, a movement of one cent in the US dollar and euro average exchange 
rates would have changed profit before income tax by £3.0m and £1.0m respectively (2022: £2.7m and 
£0.9m) and adjusted profit before income tax by £3.4m and £1.5m respectively (2022: £3.2m and £1.2m). 

If a 10% strengthening or weakening of sterling had taken place on 31 December it would have increased/
(decreased) profit before income tax and (decreased)/increased equity for the year by the amounts shown 
below. The impact of this translation is much greater on equity than it is on profit before income tax since 
equity is translated using the closing exchange rates at the year end and profit before income tax is 
translated using the average exchange rates for the year. As a result, the value of equity is more sensitive 
than the value of profit before income tax to a movement in exchange rates on 31 December and the 
resulting movement in profit before income tax is due solely to the translation effect on monetary items. 
This analysis assumes that all other variables, in particular interest rates, remain constant.

(d) Credit risk
Credit risk is the risk of loss in relation to a financial asset due to non-payment by the relevant 
counterparty. The Group’s objective is to reduce its exposure to counterparty default by restricting the 
type of counterparty it deals with and by employing an appropriate policy in relation to the collection of 
financial assets.

The Group’s financial assets are cash at bank and in hand, derivative financial instruments and trade and 
other receivables which represent the Group’s maximum exposure to credit risk in relation to financial 
assets. The maximum exposure to credit risk for cash at bank and in hand, derivative financial assets (see 
page 179) and trade and other receivables (see Note 16) is their respective carrying amounts. 

Dealings are restricted to those banks with the relevant combination of geographic presence and suitable 
credit rating. The Group continually monitors the credit ratings of its counterparties and the credit exposure 
to each counterparty.

For trade and other receivables, the amounts represented in the balance sheet are net of any impairment 
losses measured using the expected credit loss model. Note 16 sets out an analysis of trade and other 
receivables and the provision for doubtful debts in respect of trade receivables.

At the balance sheet date there were no significant concentrations of credit risk (2022: none).

Financial assets and liabilities stated as being measured at fair value in the tables above (including all 
derivative financial instruments), with the exception of money market funds and other payables, have 
carrying amounts where the fair value is, and has been throughout the year, a level two fair value 
measurement. Level two fair value measurements use inputs other than quoted prices that are observable 
for the relevant asset or liability, either directly or indirectly. The fair values of financial assets and liabilities 
stated at level two fair value have been determined by discounting expected future cash flows, translated 
at the appropriate balance sheet date exchange rates and adjusted for counterparty or own credit risk as 
applicable. Money market funds have a fair value which is a level one fair value measurement, as this is 
determined by utilising unadjusted quoted prices in active markets as at the balance sheet date. Other 
payables measured at fair value relate to earn outs and options on businesses acquired. This is a level three 
fair value which is initially measured based on the expected future profitability of the businesses acquired at 
the acquisition date and subsequently reassessed at each reporting date based on the most recent data 
available on the expected profitability of the businesses acquired. These balances are sensitive to a change 
in the expected profitability of the businesses acquired. A 1% increase in the expected profitability of the 
relevant businesses acquired would result in an increase to other payables of £3.4m (2022: £2.5m) and 1% 
decrease in the expected profitability would result in a decrease of £3.4m (2022: 3.0m).

There were no transfers between levels for recurring fair value measurements during the year.

As at 31 December 2023 the fair values, based on unadjusted market data, of the US private placement 
notes was £875.9m (2022: £1,063.4m) and of the senior bonds was £615.8m (2022: £572.7m).

For other financial assets and financial liabilities not measured at fair value, including cash at bank and in 
hand, bank loans and overdrafts, trade and other receivables and trade and other payables, their carrying 
amount is a reasonable approximation of fair value due to their short term nature. Bank loans are priced 
based on floating interest rates and the credit spread has not changed since the inception of the loan.

The Properties provision includes provisions for repairs and dilapidations. These provisions cover the 
relevant periods of the lease agreements, which typically extend from one to 10 years, up to the expected 
termination date. 

The MEPP withdrawal provision relates to the withdrawal liability on multi-employer pension plans in 
North America. See Note 25 for further details. 

Group companies are, from time to time, subject to certain claims and litigation incidental to their operations 
and arising in the ordinary course of business including, but not limited to, those relating to the products 
and services that they supply, contractual and commercial disputes, environmental claims, employment 
related disputes and indirect and payroll taxes. Other provisions include management’s best estimate of the 
liabilities for such claims and litigation at the balance sheet date, determined by reference to known factors 
and past experience of similar items. Provision is made if, on the basis of current information and 
professional advice, liabilities are considered likely to arise. Management expects these matters to be settled 
within the next one to five years. While any dispute has an element of uncertainty, management does not 
expect that the actual outcome of any such claims and litigation, either individually or in the aggregate, will 
be materially different to the amounts provided. In the case of unfavourable outcomes, the Group may 
benefit from applicable insurance protection. There are no individually significant provisions included within 
the other category.

Except as noted below, deferred tax is calculated in full on temporary differences under the liability method 
using the tax rate of the country of operation.

The Company is able to control the dividend policy of its subsidiaries and, therefore, the timing of the 
remittance of the undistributed earnings of overseas subsidiaries. In general, the Company has determined 
either that such earnings will not be distributed in the foreseeable future or, where there are plans to remit 
those earnings, no tax liability is expected to arise except for a liability of £1.4m (2022: £1.4m) which has 
been provided for. 

Deferred tax assets in respect of temporary differences have only been recognised in respect of tax losses 
and other temporary differences where it is probable that these assets will be realised. No deferred tax 
asset has been recognised in respect of unutilised tax losses of £11.9m (2022: £8.6m).

No deferred tax has been recognised in respect of unutilised capital losses of £86.9m (2022: £87.2m) as it is 
not considered probable that there will be suitable future taxable profits against which they can be utilised.

The Company operates a number of share plans for the benefit of employees of the Company and its 
subsidiaries. Further details of the share plans as they relate to the directors of the Company are set out 
in the Directors’ remuneration report.

Sharesave Scheme, International Sharesave Plan and Irish Sharesave Plan 
For many years, the Company has operated all employee savings related share option schemes. 
The existing scheme in the UK, the Bunzl plc Sharesave Scheme, was approved by shareholders at the 2011 
Annual General Meeting (‘AGM’) and renewal amendments were approved by shareholders at the 2021 
AGM. It is an HMRC tax advantaged scheme and is open to all eligible UK employees, including UK based 
executive directors.

The Bunzl Irish Sharesave Plan, which is approved by the Irish Revenue Commissioners, and the Bunzl plc 
International Sharesave Plan, were first introduced in 2006 and have since been extended, most recently 
following the renewal of the Bunzl plc Sharesave Scheme in 2021.

The Bunzl plc Sharesave Scheme, Bunzl plc International Sharesave Plan and the Bunzl Irish Sharesave 
Plan operate on a similar basis with options granted to participating employees who have completed at 
least three months of continuous service at a discount of up to 20% of the market price prevailing shortly 
before the invitation to apply for the options. Depending on the scheme, options are normally exercisable 
either three or five years after they have been granted, with employees saving up to £500 (2022: £500) per 
month (or the equivalent value in other currencies under the Bunzl plc International Sharesave Plan) or 
€500 per month under the Bunzl Irish Sharesave Plan (the last grant under the Bunzl Irish Sharesave 
Plan was in 2021).

Long Term Incentive Plan 2004 (‘2004 LTIP’) and 2014 (‘2014 LTIP’) 
The 2004 LTIP was approved by shareholders at the 2004 AGM and expired in May 2014. No further share 
options or performance share awards have been granted under the 2004 LTIP since that date and there are 
no 2004 LTIP options outstanding. The 2014 LTIP was approved by shareholders at the 2014 AGM and 
replaced the 2004 LTIP. The operation of the LTIP is overseen by the Remuneration Committee of the Board 
and is divided into two parts, being Part A and Part B.

Part A of the 2014 LTIP relates to the grant of market priced executive share options. In normal 
circumstances, options granted under Part A are only exercisable if the relevant performance condition has 
been satisfied. The performance condition is based on the Company’s adjusted earnings per share growth 
meeting certain specified targets.

21 Share capital and share based payments continued
Part B of the 2014 LTIP relates to the grant of performance share awards and restricted share awards, both 
of which are conditional rights to receive shares in the Company for nil consideration. Performance share 
awards and restricted share awards will usually vest (i.e. become exercisable) on the third anniversary of 
their grant. The extent to which a performance share award will vest is usually subject to the extent to which 
the applicable performance conditions have been satisfied, based partly on the Company’s total 
shareholder return performance, relative to a comparator group of companies over a three year period, and 
partly subject to the Company’s adjusted earnings per share growth meeting certain specified targets. The 
extent to which a restricted share award will vest is usually subject to the extent to which the applicable 
underpin condition has been satisfied. There are no set measures or targets in relation to the underpin 
condition. The basis of assessment is at the absolute discretion of the Remuneration Committee.

Investment in own shares
The Company holds a number of its ordinary shares in an employee benefit trust. The principal purpose 
of this trust is to hold shares in the Company for subsequent transfer to certain senior employees and 
executive directors in relation to options granted and awards made under the LTIP and the Deferred Annual 
Share Bonus Scheme (‘DASBS’) over market purchase shares. Details of these plans are set out above and in 
the Directors’ remuneration report. The assets, liabilities and expenditure of the trust have been 
incorporated in the consolidated financial statements. Finance expenses and administration charges are 
included in the income statement on an accruals basis. As at 31 December 2023 the trust held 2,223,988 
(2022: 2,298,301) shares, upon which dividends have been waived, with an aggregate nominal value of 
£0.7m (2022: £0.7m) and market value of £70.9m (2022: £63.4m). 

IFRS 2 disclosures
Options granted during the year have been valued using a Black Scholes model. The fair value per option 
granted during the year and the assumptions used in the calculations are as follows:

The expected volatility is based on historical volatility over the last three to seven years. The expected life is 
the average expected period to exercise. The risk free rate of return is the yield on zero coupon UK 
government bonds of a term consistent with the assumed option life. 

The weighted average share price for options exercised by employees of the Company and its subsidiaries 
during the year was £30.45 (2022: £29.53). The total charge for the year relating to share based payments 
was £15.4m (2022: £14.1m). After tax the total charge was £11.7m (2022: £12.4m).

Scheme, International Sharesave plan and DASBS are set out in the Directors’ remuneration report. 
No changes to the directors’ ordinary share interests shown in this Note and the Directors’ remuneration 
report have taken place between 31 December 2023 and 26 February 2024.

25 Retirement benefits
The Group operates a number of defined benefit and defined contribution retirement benefit schemes 
in the US, the UK and elsewhere in Europe (including France, the Netherlands and the Republic of Ireland). 
The funds of the principal defined benefit schemes are administered by trustees and are held 
independently from the Group. Pension costs of defined benefit schemes are assessed in accordance with 
the advice of independent professionally qualified actuaries. Contributions to all schemes are determined 
in line with actuarial advice and local conditions and practices. Scheme assets for the purpose of IAS 19 
‘Employee Benefits’ are stated at their bid value.

Characteristics of defined benefit pension schemes
UK
The UK defined benefit scheme is a contributory defined benefit pension scheme providing benefits based 
on final pensionable pay. The scheme has been closed to new members since 2003. The valuation of the UK 
defined benefit pension scheme has been updated to 31 December 2023 by the Group’s actuaries. 

The UK scheme is an HMRC registered pension scheme and is subject to standard UK pensions and tax law. 
This means that the payment of contributions and benefits are subject to the appropriate tax treatments 
and restrictions and the scheme is subject to the scheme funding requirements outlined in section 224 of 
the Pensions Act 2004.

In accordance with UK trust and pensions law, the pension scheme has a corporate trustee. Although the 
Company bears the financial cost of the scheme, the responsibility for the management and governance 
of the scheme lies with the trustee, which has a duty to act in the best interest of members at all times. 
The assets of the scheme are held in trust by the trustee who consults with the Company on investment 
strategy decisions.

25 Retirement benefits continued
The trustee, in agreement with the Company, has hedging in place to reduce the impact of inflation and 
interest rate movements on the funding of the plan. 

The last full triennial valuation on the UK defined benefit pension scheme was carried out by a qualified 
actuary as at 5 April 2021 and showed that there was a surplus on the agreed funding basis. During the 
year, a further contribution of £5.0m was made in respect of the 2022 calendar year. A revised schedule 
of contributions was agreed with the Trustee such that no further annual contributions will be paid in 
2024 or 2025.

US
The principal US defined benefit pension scheme is a non-contributory defined benefit pension scheme 
providing benefits based on final pensionable pay. The scheme has been closed to new members since 
2003. The valuation of the US defined benefit pension scheme has been updated to 31 December 2023 by 
the Group’s actuaries. 

The US scheme is a qualified pension scheme and is subject to standard regulations under the Employee 
Retirement Income Security Act of 1974, the Pension Protection Act of 2006 and the Department of Labor 
and Internal Revenue reporting requirements. The scheme pays annual premiums to the Pension Benefit 
Guaranty Corporation to insure the benefits of the scheme.

The assets of the scheme are held in trust by an independent custodian. The Company has established 
a Retirement Scheme Investment Committee. The members of the Committee are the scheme fiduciaries 
and, as such, are ultimately responsible for the management of the scheme assets. The Committee 
performs the oversight function and delegates the day-to-day management process to appropriate staff. 
A registered investment adviser advises the Committee regarding the investment of scheme assets. 

A de-risking strategy has been agreed for the scheme to reduce the mismatch between the assets and 
liabilities, whereby investments are switched from return seeking assets to liability matching assets as the 
funding improves, based on pre-agreed triggers.

Annual actuarial valuations are performed on the US defined benefit pension scheme. The last annual 
review was carried out by a qualified actuary as at 1 January 2023 and showed that there was a required 
annual contribution of $4.5m. Bunzl plans to cover this required contribution using prefunding balance. 
In 2023, Bunzl also used prefunding balance to cover the required contribution for the 2022 plan year. 
The annual review as at 1 January 2024 is ongoing.

Risks
The main risks to which the Group is exposed in relation to the defined benefit pension schemes are 
described below:

•  Inflation risk – the majority of the UK scheme’s liabilities increase in line with inflation and, as a result, if 
inflation is greater than expected the liabilities will increase. The impact of high inflation is capped each 
year for the UK scheme’s benefits. The US scheme’s liabilities are not directly tied to inflationary increases.

•  Interest rate risk – a fall in bond yields will increase the value of the schemes’ liabilities. A proportion of 

both the UK and US schemes’ assets are invested in liability matching assets to mitigate the interest rate 
and also the inflation risk.

•  Mortality risk – the assumptions adopted by the Group make allowance for future improvements in life 
expectancy. However, if life expectancy improves at a faster rate than assumed, this would result in 
greater payments from the schemes and consequently increases in the schemes’ liabilities. The mortality 
assumptions are reviewed on a regular basis to minimise the risk of using an inappropriate assumption.

•  Investment risk – the schemes invest in a diversified range of asset classes to mitigate the risk of falls 

in any one area of the investments. In the UK, the trustee implements partial currency hedging on the 
overseas assets to mitigate currency risk.

The risks mentioned above could lead to a material change to the deficit or surplus of the pension schemes. 
Given the long term time horizon of the schemes’ cash flows, the assumptions used can lead to volatility in 
the scheme valuations from year to year. The Company and the trustee of the UK scheme seek to mitigate 
actively the risks associated with the schemes.

A higher defined benefit obligation could lead to additional funding requirements in future years. Any deficit 
measured on a funding valuation basis, which may differ from the actuarial valuation under IAS 19, will 
generally be financed over a period that ensures the contributions are appropriate to the Group and in line

There is a net surplus of £49.0m (£65.3m before deferred tax) (2022: £44.5m (£59.3m before deferred tax)) 
on the UK scheme, which is recorded as a defined benefit pension asset on the balance sheet. In accordance 
with IFRIC 14, the surplus on the scheme is recognised as a defined benefit asset because the Group 
considers that it has an unconditional right to a refund of any surplus from the UK scheme.

Of the pension scheme assets, £400.1m (2022: £397.4m) are valued based on quoted market prices.

The actual return on pension scheme assets was a gain of £25.3m (2022: loss of £168.3m). 

The Group expects to pay approximately £1.3m in contributions to the defined benefit pension schemes in 
the year ending 31 December 2024 (expected as at 31 December 2022 for the year ending 31 December 
2023: £6.1m) including none for the UK (expected as at 31 December 2022 for the year ending 31 December 
2023: £4.7m). 

The weighted average duration of the defined benefit pension scheme liabilities at 31 December 2023 was 
approximately 14.0 years (2022: 14.5 years) for the UK and 8.2 years (2022: 9.0 years) for the US.

The total defined benefit pension scheme liabilities are divided between active members (£96.5m (2022: 
£102.6m)), deferred members (£142.7m (2022: £137.3m)) and pensioners (£136.3m (2022: £141.6m)).

Multi-employer pension plans 
The Group participates in a number of multi-employer pensions plans (‘MEPPs’) in North America. 
Although these plans are defined benefit plans the Group does not have sufficient information to 
account for them as defined benefit plans and, therefore, in accordance with IAS 19, accounts for them 
as defined contribution plans. 

For MEPPs, US law requires payment of a withdrawal liability when employers cease contributing to 
underfunded MEPPs. The liability for withdrawal payments is shared by all members of the group of 
companies in any particular plan and solvent entities must cover the unfunded liabilities of employers 
who are unable to pay due to insolvency or bankruptcy. On withdrawal from a plan, an employer’s 
withdrawal liability amount is calculated by reference to the employer’s proportionate share of the MEPP’s 
unfunded vested benefits based on the employer’s share of all contributions made to the plan over the 
previous 10 years. 

In 2023, the Group paid a lump sum of £9.1m towards the settlement of the liabilities for two of these plans. 

The Group continues to participate in three MEPPs and continues to account for these as defined 
contribution plans with the combined ongoing annual contributions for the three plans in 2024 expected 
to be no more than £2.0m per annum.

More detailed information concerning directors’ emoluments and long term incentives is set out in the 
Directors’ remuneration report. The aggregate amount of gains made by directors on the exercise of share 
options during the year was £0.8m (2022: £nil). The aggregate market value of performance share awards 
exercised by directors under long term incentive schemes during the year was £2.9m (2022: £1.7m). The 
aggregate market value of share awards exercised by directors under the DASBS was £1.1m (2022: £0.7m).

As at 31 December 2023, the Group had £11.9m (2022: £44.5m) of leases which had been committed to but 
which had not yet started. Such leases are not included in the Group’s lease liabilities as at 31 December 
2023. In relation to leases which are included in lease liabilities, there are potential further future cash flows 
of £67.8m (2022: £46.3m) if termination options are not exercised and extension options are exercised. 

The cash outflow for low value and short term leases was £4.6m for the year ended 31 December 2023 
(2022: £5.2m).

32 Post balance sheet event
On 26 February 2024, Bunzl signed an agreement to acquire an 80% stake in Nisbets and associated entities 
for an initial consideration of £339m. The purchase price will be settled in cash. Founded in 1983 by Andrew 
Nisbet, Nisbets is a highly respected omnichannel distributor of catering equipment and consumables in the 
UK & Ireland, Northern Europe and Australasia, offering an extensive product range including a wide range 
of own-brand products to foodservice customers. It has over 1,800 employees and an experienced 
management team that will remain with the Group post-acquisition, with Andrew Nisbet acting as a 
non-executive director and the family continuing to hold a minority interest in Nisbets. For the year ended 
31 December 2023, Nisbet generated revenue of £498m with a profit before interest, tax, amortisation and 
exceptional items of £35.5m and total gross assets of £242m, based on unaudited management accounts. 
An additional earn-out amount may be payable based on Nisbets’ financial performance in 2024. The 
transaction includes put / call options that enable Bunzl to acquire the remaining 20% stake in the future, 
subject to certain conditions.

NOTES TO THE COMPANY FINANCIAL STATEMENTS 

1 Basis of preparation
Bunzl plc (the ‘Company’) is a company incorporated and domiciled in the United Kingdom and is registered 
in England and Wales. These financial statements present information about the Company as an individual 
undertaking and not about its Group. 

The financial statements of the Company have been prepared on a going concern basis and under the 
historical cost convention with the exception of certain items which are measured at fair value as described 
in the accounting policies below.

These financial statements have been prepared in accordance with Financial Reporting Standard 101 
‘Reduced Disclosure Framework’ (‘FRS 101’) and the Companies Act 2006 as applicable to companies using 
FRS 101. There are no new standards, amendments or interpretations that are applicable to the Company 
for the year ended 31 December 2023. In preparing these financial statements the Company has applied 
the exemptions available under FRS 101 in respect of:

•  a cash flow statement and related notes;
•  comparative period reconciliations for share capital and tangible fixed assets;
•  disclosures relating to transactions with wholly owned subsidiaries and capital management;
•  the effects of new but not yet effective IFRSs; and
•  disclosures relating to the compensation of key management personnel.

b. Share based payments
The Company operates a number of equity settled share based payment compensation plans. Details 
of these plans are outlined in Note 21 to the consolidated financial statements and the Directors’ 
remuneration report. The total expected expense is based on the fair value of options and other share 
based incentives on the grant date, calculated using a valuation model, and is spread over the expected 
vesting period with a corresponding credit to equity.

Where the Company grants options over its own shares to the employees of its subsidiaries and it has not 
recharged the cost to the relevant subsidiaries, it recognises, in its individual financial statements, an 
increase in the cost of investment in its subsidiaries equivalent to the equity settled share based payment 
charge recognised in its consolidated financial statements, with the corresponding credit being recognised 
directly in equity. 

c. Financial guarantee contracts
The Company has issued financial guarantee contracts to guarantee the indebtedness of other companies 
within its Group. The likelihood of these financial guarantee contracts being called is considered to be 
remote and therefore the estimated financial effect of issuing is nil (2022: nil). The fair value of the issued 
financial guarantee contracts is deemed to be immaterial. 

d. Intercompany and other receivables

As the consolidated financial statements of the Company include the equivalent disclosures, the Company 
has also applied the exemptions available under FRS 101 in respect of:

•  certain disclosures required by IFRS 2 ‘Share Based Payments’ in respect of Group settled share based 

Intercompany and other receivables are initially measured at fair value. Subsequent to initial recognition 
these assets are measured at amortised cost less any provision for expected credit losses. The Group 
measures expected credit losses using the expected credit loss model in accordance with IFRS 9. There 
were no impairment losses on intercompany or other receivables during the year (2022: none).

payments; and

•  certain disclosures required by IFRS 13 ‘Fair Value Measurement’ and disclosures required by IFRS 7 

‘Financial Instruments: Disclosures’.

2 Accounting policies
The accounting policies of the Company have, unless otherwise stated, been applied consistently to all 
periods presented in these financial statements. In most cases the accounting policies for the Company are 
fully aligned with the equivalent accounting policies for the Group as stated in Note 2 to the consolidated 
financial statements. The accounting policies of the Company which are aligned with those of the Group 
are the policies for property, plant and equipment, leases, intangible assets, income tax, trade and other 
payables, provisions, retirement benefits, investment in own shares and dividends. The accounting policies 
that are specific to the Company are set out below.

a. Investment in subsidiary undertakings
Investments in subsidiary undertakings are held at cost less any provision for impairment. The subsidiary 
undertakings which the Company held at 31 December 2023 are disclosed in the Related undertakings 
Note in the Shareholder information section on pages 202 to 207. 

e. Defined benefit pension schemes
The Company is the sponsoring company of the UK defined benefit pension scheme. As there is no 
contractual agreement or stated Group policy for charging the net defined benefit cost of the scheme to 
participating subsidiaries, the net defined benefit pension cost or benefit is recognised fully by the Company. 
The contributions paid by the participating subsidiaries other than the Company are credited to profit or 
loss of the Company where the amounts relate to service and are independent of the number of years of 
service or to other comprehensive income if not linked to service. 

f. Judgements made in applying the Company’s accounting policies 
In the course of preparing the financial statements, other than judgements involved in determining 
estimates and assumptions (see Note 2g below), no judgements have been made in the process of applying 
the Company’s accounting policies that have had a significant effect on the amounts recognised in the 
financial statements.

g. Sources of estimation uncertainty
In applying the Company’s accounting policies various transactions and balances are valued using estimates 
or assumptions. Should these estimates or assumptions prove incorrect, there may be an impact on the 
following year’s financial statements. As at 31 December 2023, the only source of estimation uncertainty 
that has a significant risk of resulting in a material adjustment to the carrying amounts of assets and 
liabilities within the next financial year is the measurement of the defined benefit pension scheme liability 
which is explained in Note 2u to the consolidated financial statements.

STATEMENT OF DIRECTORS’ RESPONSIBILITIES

Statement of directors’ 
responsibilities
The directors are responsible for preparing the 
Annual Report, which includes the Directors’ 
remuneration report and the financial 
statements, in accordance with applicable law 
and regulation.

Company law requires the directors to prepare 
financial statements for each financial year. Under 
that law the directors have prepared the Group 
financial statements in accordance with UK-
adopted International Accounting Standards 
(‘IASs’) and the Company financial statements in 
accordance with United Kingdom Generally 
Accepted Accounting Practice (United Kingdom 
Accounting Standards, comprising FRS 101 
‘Reduced Disclosure Framework’, and applicable 
law). In preparing the Group financial statements, 
the directors have also elected to comply with 
International Financial Reporting Standards 
(‘IFRSs’), issued by the International Accounting 
Standards Board (‘IASB’) (‘IFRSs as issued by 
the IASB’).

Under company law, directors must not approve 
the financial statements unless they are satisfied 
that they give a true and fair view of the state of 
affairs of the Group and the Company and of the 
profit or loss of the Group for that period. In 
preparing the financial statements, the directors 
are required to:

•  select suitable accounting policies and then 

apply them consistently;

•  state whether applicable UK-adopted IASs and 
IFRSs as issued by the IASB have been followed 
for the Group financial statements and United 
Kingdom Accounting Standards, comprising FRS 
101, have been followed for the Company 
financial statements, subject to any material 
departures disclosed and explained in the 
financial statements;

•  make judgements and accounting estimates 

that are reasonable and prudent; and

•  prepare the financial statements on the going 
concern basis unless it is inappropriate to 
presume that the Group and the Company will 
continue in business.

The directors are responsible for safeguarding the 
assets of the Group and the Company and hence 
for taking reasonable steps for the prevention and 
detection of fraud and other irregularities.

The directors are also responsible for keeping 
adequate accounting records that are sufficient to 
show and explain the Group’s and the Company’s 
transactions and disclose with reasonable 
accuracy at any time the financial position of the 
Group and the Company and enable them to 
ensure that the financial statements and the 
Directors’ remuneration report comply with the 
Companies Act 2006.

The directors are responsible for the maintenance 
and integrity of the Company’s website. 
Legislation in the United Kingdom governing the 
preparation and dissemination of financial 
statements may differ from legislation in other 
jurisdictions.

The directors consider that the Annual Report, 
taken as a whole, is fair, balanced and 
understandable and provides the information 
necessary for shareholders to assess the Group’s 
and the Company’s position and performance, 
business model and strategy.

Each of the directors, whose names and functions 
are set out on pages 90 to 91 of the Annual 
Report, confirm that, to the best of 
their knowledge:

•  the Group financial statements, which have 

been prepared in accordance with UK-adopted 
IASs and IFRSs as issued by the IASB, give a true 
and fair view of the assets, liabilities, financial 
position and profit of the Group;

•  the Company financial statements, which have 

been prepared in accordance with United 
Kingdom Accounting Standards, comprising FRS 
101, give a true and fair view of the assets, 
liabilities and financial position of the Company; 
and

•  the Annual Report includes a fair review of the 
development and performance of the business 
and the position of the Group and the 
Company, together with a description of the 
principal risks and uncertainties that they face.

statement, the Consolidated statement of changes in equity and the Company statement of changes in 
equity for the year then ended; and the notes to the financial statements, comprising material 
accounting policy information and other explanatory information.

Our opinion is consistent with our reporting to the Audit Committee.

Separate opinion in relation to IFRSs as issued by the IASB
As explained in note 1 to the financial statements, the Group, in addition to applying UK-adopted 
international accounting standards, has also applied international financial reporting standards (IFRSs) 
as issued by the International Accounting Standards Board (IASB).

In our opinion, the Group financial statements have been properly prepared in accordance with IFRSs 
as issued by the IASB.

Basis for opinion
We conducted our audit in accordance with International Standards on Auditing (UK) (“ISAs (UK)”) and 
applicable law. Our responsibilities under ISAs (UK) are further described in the Auditors’ 
responsibilities for the audit of the financial statements section of our report. We believe that the audit 
evidence we have obtained is sufficient and appropriate to provide a basis for our opinion.

Independence
We remained independent of the Group in accordance with the ethical requirements that are relevant 
to our audit of the financial statements in the UK, which includes the FRC’s Ethical Standard, as 
applicable to listed public interest entities, and we have fulfilled our other ethical responsibilities in 
accordance with these requirements.

To the best of our knowledge and belief, we declare that non-audit services prohibited by the FRC’s 
Ethical Standard were not provided.

Other than those disclosed in note 5 to the Group financial statements, we have provided no non-audit 
services to the Company or its controlled undertakings in the period under audit.

Our audit approach

Overview
Audit scope

•  We performed full scope audits and other procedures of the financial 

information of 87 components spread across 26 different countries across 
North America, Continental Europe, UK & Ireland and Rest of the World.

•  Specific audit procedures in relation to various Group activities, including 

consolidation, taxation, pensions, business combinations and the carrying 
value of goodwill and intangible assets, were performed by the Group audit 
team centrally

•  The components where we conducted audit procedures, together with work 
performed by the Group audit team centrally, accounted for approximately 
94% of the Group’s revenue and 94% of the Group’s adjusted profit before 
tax. The full scope components in the North America, the Netherlands and 
Australia comprise sub consolidations; in calculating these coverage levels we 
have taken 100% coverage from the full scope audits performed in these 
locations

Key audit matters

•  Valuation of intangible assets acquired in a business combination (Group).

Materiality

•  Valuation of defined benefit schemes’ obligations (Group and Company).
•  Overall Group materiality: £42.0 million (2022: £40.0 million) based on 5% of 

adjusted profit before tax.

•  Overall Company materiality: £20.0 million (2022: £21.0 million) based on  

1% of net assets.

•  Performance materiality: £31.5 million (2022: £30.0 million) (Group) and  

£15.0 million (2022: £15.7 million) (Company).

The scope of our audit
As part of designing our audit, we determined materiality and assessed the risks of material 
misstatement in the financial statements.

Key audit matters
Key audit matters are those matters that, in the auditors’ professional judgement, were of most 
significance in the audit of the financial statements of the current period and include the most 
significant assessed risks of material misstatement (whether or not due to fraud) identified by the 
auditors, including those which had the greatest effect on: the overall audit strategy; the allocation of 
resources in the audit; and directing the efforts of the engagement team. These matters, and any 
comments we make on the results of our procedures thereon, were addressed in the context of our 
audit of the financial statements as a whole, and in forming our opinion thereon, and we do not provide 
a separate opinion on these matters.

This is not a complete list of all risks identified by our audit.

INDEPENDENT AUDITORS’ REPORT TO THE MEMBERS OF BUNZL PLC continued

Valuation of inventory provisions (Group), which was a key audit matter last year, is no longer 
included because of the reduction of risk in 2023. Otherwise, the key audit matters below are 
consistent with last year.

Key audit matter

How our audit addressed the key audit matter

Valuation of intangible assets acquired in a business combination (Group)
Refer to the Audit Committee report, 
Note 2 and Note 9 of the Group financial 
statements.

Given that the Group continues to make 
significant investment in acquisitions, 
accounting for intangible assets acquired 
in a business combinations is an area of 
focus due to the level of judgement 
involved in the valuation. Business 
combinations can involve judgements 
in relation to the value of assets and 
liabilities that are recognised on 
acquisition, particularly the allocation of 
purchase consideration to goodwill and 
separately identified intangible assets.

Management relies on external valuation specialists for 
larger acquisitions to value significant intangibles acquired 
in business combinations. Where management has relied 
on such specialists, with the support of our own valuation 
specialists, we assessed their objectivity and competence 
and tested the results of their work. For smaller acquisitions, 
management prepares their own valuation models.

We focused in particular on the following areas:

•  We assessed the methodology and key assumptions used 

in determining the value of the customer relationship 
assets for the more significant acquisitions;

•  We determined whether the cash flows applied within the 
valuation models and the key assumptions such as the 
discount rates, growth rates, customer attrition and 
period for amortisation, were appropriate;

•  We evaluated the consideration paid or payable in respect 

of certain acquisitions made; and

•  We considered the disclosures in Note 2 and Note 9 of the 

Group financial statements and we are satisfied that 
these disclosures are appropriate.

Based on the procedures performed, we noted no material 
issues arising from our work.

The Group has defined benefit pension 
schemes (with material schemes in the 
United States and the United Kingdom) 
with a net surplus of £49.4m at the 
current year end (2022: net surplus 
of £39.9m). The gross assets and 
liabilities in each scheme are 
significant in the context of the 
Consolidated balance sheet.

Management estimation is required in 
relation to the measurement of pension 
scheme obligations, and management 
employs independent actuarial experts 
to assist it in determining appropriate 
assumptions such as inflation levels, 
discount rates, salary increases and 
mortality rates. Movements in these 
assumptions can have a material impact 
on the determination of the liability and, 
therefore, the extent of any net surplus 
or deficit.

Key audit matter

How our audit addressed the key audit matter

Valuation of defined benefit schemes’ obligations (Group and Company)
Refer to the Audit Committee report, 
Note 2 and Note 25 of the Group 
financial statements.

We used our own actuarial experts to satisfy ourselves that 
the assumptions used in calculating the US and UK pension 
scheme liabilities are appropriate, including confirming that 
salary increases were appropriate and that mortality rate 
assumptions were consistent with relevant benchmarks.

We determined that the discount and inflation rates used 
in the valuation of the pension scheme liabilities were 
consistent with our internally developed benchmarks.

In each case we considered the assumptions made by 
management to be reasonable in light of the available 
evidence. We also performed procedures to satisfy 
ourselves over the completeness and accuracy of the 
employee data used in the calculation.

Based on the procedures performed, we noted no material 
issues arising from our work.

How we tailored the audit scope
We tailored the scope of our audit to ensure that we performed enough work to be able to give an 
opinion on the financial statements as a whole, taking into account the structure of the Group and the 
Company, the accounting processes and controls, and the industry in which they operate.

We identified one financially significant component, being North America, where a full scope audit has 
been performed. In addition, we have identified two material components being the Netherlands and 
Australia. To achieve the coverage desired, we identified five components across the UK and France for 
which a full scope audit of their financial information has been performed. In order to satisfy the 
request of the Audit Committee and management, we performed full scope audits and other 
procedures on a further 79 components. The components where we performed audit procedures 
covered over 94% of Group revenue and adjusted profit before taxation.

Where work was performed by component auditors, detailed instructions were issued by us and the 
Group audit team conducted conference calls with component teams. For our financially significant and 
material components, oversight procedures included regular communication with the component 
team, reviewing their working papers, and attending the clearance meeting either virtually or in person. 
Specific audit procedures over central functions and areas of significant judgement, including 
consolidation, taxation, pensions, business combinations and the carrying value of goodwill and other 
intangible assets, were performed by the Group audit team centrally.

The impact of climate risk on our audit
As part of the audit, we inquired of management to understand and evaluate the Group’s risk 
assessment process in relation to climate change. Management has sought advice from external 
sustainability experts to help them understand the environmental challenges they face, and to source 
science-based inputs for their assessment of climate risk. We reviewed management’s paper which sets 
out their assessment of climate change risk to the Group and the impact, if any, on the financial 
statements and impairment testing. In evaluating the completeness of the risks identified, we assessed 
the objectivity and competence of management’s experts, we engaged our internal climate change 
experts to review management’s assessment, we considered the return submitted to the Carbon 
Disclosure Project by the Group and challenged management on how they considered the Group’s net 
zero commitment in their assessment. In responding to the risk identified, we specifically considered 
how climate change risk would impact the assumptions made in the forecasts prepared by 
management used in their assessment of the carrying value of goodwill. We read the disclosures in 
relation to climate change made in the other information within the Annual Report to ascertain whether 
the disclosures are materially consistent with the financial statements and our knowledge from our 
audit. Our responsibility over other information is further described in the Reporting on other 
information section of our report.

Materiality
The scope of our audit was influenced by our application of materiality. We set certain quantitative 
thresholds for materiality. These, together with qualitative considerations, helped us to determine the 
scope of our audit and the nature, timing and extent of our audit procedures on the individual financial 
statement line items and disclosures and in evaluating the effect of misstatements, both individually 
and in aggregate on the financial statements as a whole.

Based on our professional judgement, we determined materiality for the financial statements as a 
whole as follows:

Overall materiality
How we determined it
Rationale for benchmark 
applied

Financial statements – Group

Financial statements – Company

£42.0 million (2022: £40.0 million).
5% of adjusted profit before tax
Given that the Group’s businesses are 
profit oriented and the directors use 
adjusted profit measures to assess 
the performance of the business, we 
believe that adjusted profit before tax 
is the best benchmark to use.

£20.0 million (2022: £21.0 million).
1% of net assets
Considering the nature of the 
business and activities in Bunzl 
plc (holding activities) we use the 
Company's net asset value as a 
basis for the calculation of the 
overall materiality level.

For each component in the scope of our Group audit, we allocated a materiality that is less than our 
overall Group materiality. The range of materiality allocated across components was up to £35.0 million. 
Certain components were audited to a local statutory audit materiality that was also less than our 
overall Group materiality.

We use performance materiality to reduce to an appropriately low level the probability that the 
aggregate of uncorrected and undetected misstatements exceeds overall materiality. Specifically, we 
use performance materiality in determining the scope of our audit and the nature and extent of our 
testing of account balances, classes of transactions and disclosures, for example in determining sample 
sizes. Our performance materiality was 75% (2022: 75%) of overall materiality, amounting to 
£31.5 million (2022: £30.0 million) for the Group financial statements and £15.0 million (2022: 
£15.7 million) for the Company financial statements.

In determining the performance materiality, we considered a number of factors – the history of 
misstatements, risk assessment and aggregation risk and the effectiveness of controls – and concluded 
that an amount at the upper end of our normal range was appropriate.

We agreed with the Audit Committee that we would report to them misstatements identified during our 
audit above £2.0 million (Group audit) (2022: £1.9 million) and £2.0 million (Company audit) (2022: 
£1.9 million) as well as misstatements below those amounts that, in our view, warranted reporting for 
qualitative reasons.

INDEPENDENT AUDITORS’ REPORT TO THE MEMBERS OF BUNZL PLC continued

Conclusions relating to going concern
Our evaluation of the directors’ assessment of the Group’s and the Company’s ability to continue 
to adopt the going concern basis of accounting included:

•  We assessed the appropriateness of the cash flow forecasts in the context of the Group’s 2023 
financial position and evaluated the directors’ downside sensitivities against these forecasts.

•  We evaluated the key assumptions in the forecasts and considered whether these were supported 

by the evidence we obtained.

•  We examined the headroom under the base case cash flow forecasts, as well as the directors’ 

sensitised cases, and evaluated whether the directors’ conclusion that headroom remained in all 
events was supported by the evidence we obtained.

•  We obtained the Group’s covenant calculations and reperformed the calculation including applying 

sensitivities to assess the potential impact of downside sensitivities on covenant compliance.

•  We also reviewed the disclosures provided relating to the going concern basis of preparation and 

found that these provided an explanation of the directors’ assessment that was consistent with the 
evidence we obtained.

Based on the work we have performed, we have not identified any material uncertainties relating to 
events or conditions that, individually or collectively, may cast significant doubt on the Group’s and the 
Company’s ability to continue as a going concern for a period of at least twelve months from when the 
financial statements are authorised for issue.

In auditing the financial statements, we have concluded that the directors’ use of the going concern 
basis of accounting in the preparation of the financial statements is appropriate.

However, because not all future events or conditions can be predicted, this conclusion is not a 
guarantee as to the Group’s and the Company’s ability to continue as a going concern.

In relation to the directors’ reporting on how they have applied the UK Corporate Governance Code, 
we have nothing material to add or draw attention to in relation to the directors’ statement in the 
financial statements about whether the directors considered it appropriate to adopt the going concern 
basis of accounting.

Our responsibilities and the responsibilities of the directors with respect to going concern are 
described in the relevant sections of this report.

Reporting on other information
The other information comprises all of the information in the Annual Report other than the financial 
statements and our auditors’ report thereon. The directors are responsible for the other information. 
Our opinion on the financial statements does not cover the other information and, accordingly, we do 
not express an audit opinion or, except to the extent otherwise explicitly stated in this report, any form 
of assurance thereon.

In connection with our audit of the financial statements, our responsibility is to read the other 
information and, in doing so, consider whether the other information is materially inconsistent with the 
financial statements or our knowledge obtained in the audit, or otherwise appears to be materially 
misstated. If we identify an apparent material inconsistency or material misstatement, we are required 
to perform procedures to conclude whether there is a material misstatement of the financial 
statements or a material misstatement of the other information. If, based on the work we have 
performed, we conclude that there is a material misstatement of this other information, we are 
required to report that fact. We have nothing to report based on these responsibilities.

With respect to the Strategic report and Directors’ report, we also considered whether the disclosures 
required by the UK Companies Act 2006 have been included.

Based on our work undertaken in the course of the audit, the Companies Act 2006 requires us also to 
report certain opinions and matters as described below.

Strategic report and Directors’ report
In our opinion, based on the work undertaken in the course of the audit, the information given in the 
Strategic report and Directors’ report for the year ended 31 December 2023 is consistent with the 
financial statements and has been prepared in accordance with applicable legal requirements.

In light of the knowledge and understanding of the Group and Company and their environment 
obtained in the course of the audit, we did not identify any material misstatements in the Strategic 
report and Directors’ report.

Directors’ Remuneration
In our opinion, the part of the Directors’ remuneration report to be audited has been properly 
prepared in accordance with the Companies Act 2006.

INDEPENDENT AUDITORS’ REPORT TO THE MEMBERS OF BUNZL PLC continued

Corporate governance statement
The Listing Rules require us to review the directors’ statements in relation to going concern, longer-term 
viability and that part of the corporate governance statement relating to the Company’s compliance 
with the provisions of the UK Corporate Governance Code specified for our review. Our additional 
responsibilities with respect to the corporate governance statement as other information are described 
in the Reporting on other information section of this report.

Based on the work undertaken as part of our audit, we have concluded that each of the following 
elements of the corporate governance statement is materially consistent with the financial statements 
and our knowledge obtained during the audit, and we have nothing material to add or draw attention 
to in relation to:

•  The directors’ confirmation that they have carried out a robust assessment of the emerging and 

principal risks;

•  The disclosures in the Annual Report that describe those principal risks, what procedures are in place 

to identify emerging risks and an explanation of how these are being managed or mitigated;

•  The directors’ statement in the financial statements about whether they considered it appropriate 
to adopt the going concern basis of accounting in preparing them, and their identification of any 
material uncertainties to the Group’s and Company’s ability to continue to do so over a period of at 
least twelve months from the date of approval of the financial statements;

•  The directors’ explanation as to their assessment of the Group’s and Company’s prospects, the 

period this assessment covers and why the period is appropriate; and

•  The directors’ statement as to whether they have a reasonable expectation that the Company will be 
able to continue in operation and meet its liabilities as they fall due over the period of its assessment, 
including any related disclosures drawing attention to any necessary qualifications or assumptions.

Our review of the directors’ statement regarding the longer-term viability of the Group and Company 
was substantially less in scope than an audit and only consisted of making inquiries and considering 
the directors’ process supporting their statement; checking that the statement is in alignment with 
the relevant provisions of the UK Corporate Governance Code; and considering whether the statement 
is consistent with the financial statements and our knowledge and understanding of the Group and 
Company and their environment obtained in the course of the audit.

In addition, based on the work undertaken as part of our audit, we have concluded that each of the 
following elements of the corporate governance statement is materially consistent with the financial 
statements and our knowledge obtained during the audit:

•  The directors’ statement that they consider the Annual Report, taken as a whole, is fair, balanced and 
understandable, and provides the information necessary for the members to assess the Group’s and 
Company’s position, performance, business model and strategy;

Responsibilities for the financial statements and the audit
Responsibilities of the directors for the financial statements
As explained more fully in the Statement of directors’ responsibilities, the directors are responsible for 
the preparation of the financial statements in accordance with the applicable framework and for being 
satisfied that they give a true and fair view. The directors are also responsible for such internal control 
as they determine is necessary to enable the preparation of financial statements that are free from 
material misstatement, whether due to fraud or error.

In preparing the financial statements, the directors are responsible for assessing the Group’s and the 
Company’s ability to continue as a going concern, disclosing, as applicable, matters related to going 
concern and using the going concern basis of accounting unless the directors either intend to liquidate 
the Group or the Company or to cease operations, or have no realistic alternative but to do so.

Auditors’ responsibilities for the audit of the financial statements
Our objectives are to obtain reasonable assurance about whether the financial statements as a whole 
are free from material misstatement, whether due to fraud or error, and to issue an auditors’ report 
that includes our opinion. Reasonable assurance is a high level of assurance, but is not a guarantee that 
an audit conducted in accordance with ISAs (UK) will always detect a material misstatement when it 
exists. Misstatements can arise from fraud or error and are considered material if, individually or in the 
aggregate, they could reasonably be expected to influence the economic decisions of users taken on 
the basis of these financial statements.

Irregularities, including fraud, are instances of non-compliance with laws and regulations. We design 
procedures in line with our responsibilities, outlined above, to detect material misstatements in respect 
of irregularities, including fraud. The extent to which our procedures are capable of detecting 
irregularities, including fraud, is detailed below.

Based on our understanding of the Group and industry, we identified that the principal risks of 
non-compliance with laws and regulations related to listing Rules, health and safety regulations, 
environmental regulations, data protection, and we considered the extent to which non-compliance 
might have a material effect on the financial statements. We also considered those laws and regulations 
that have a direct impact on the financial statements such as the Companies Act 2006 and tax 
legislation. We evaluated management’s incentives and opportunities for fraudulent manipulation of 
the financial statements (including the risk of override of controls), and determined that the principal 
risks were related to the posting of inappropriate journal entries to increase revenue or reduce 
expenditure, and management bias in accounting estimates. The Group engagement team shared this 
risk assessment with the component auditors so that they could include appropriate audit procedures 
in response to such risks in their work. Audit procedures performed by the Group engagement team 
and/or component auditors included:

•  Enquiry of management, those charged with governance and the entity’s in-house legal team around 

•  The section of the Annual Report that describes the review of effectiveness of risk management and 

actual and potential litigation and claims.

internal control systems; and

•  Reviewing minutes of meetings of those charged with governance including the Board, Audit 

•  The section of the Annual Report describing the work of the Audit Committee.

We have nothing to report in respect of our responsibility to report when the directors’ statement 
relating to the Company’s compliance with the Code does not properly disclose a departure from 
a relevant provision of the Code specified under the Listing Rules for review by the auditors.

committee and Executive committee

•  Reviewing internal audit reports

•  Assessment of matters reported on the Group’s whistleblowing helpline

•  Auditing the risk of management override of controls, including through testing journal entries and

INDEPENDENT AUDITORS’ REPORT TO THE MEMBERS OF BUNZL PLC continued

There are inherent limitations in the audit procedures described above. We are less likely to become 
aware of instances of non-compliance with laws and regulations that are not closely related to events 
and transactions reflected in the financial statements. Also, the risk of not detecting a material 
misstatement due to fraud is higher than the risk of not detecting one resulting from error, as fraud 
may involve deliberate concealment by, for example, forgery or intentional misrepresentations, or 
through collusion.

Our audit testing might include testing complete populations of certain transactions and balances, 
possibly using data auditing techniques. However, it typically involves selecting a limited number of 
items for testing, rather than testing complete populations. We will often seek to target particular items 
for testing based on their size or risk characteristics. In other cases, we will use audit sampling to enable 
us to draw a conclusion about the population from which the sample is selected.

A further description of our responsibilities for the audit of the financial statements is located on 
the FRC’s website at: www.frc.org.uk/auditorsresponsibilities. This description forms part of our 
auditors’ report.

Use of this report
This report, including the opinions, has been prepared for and only for the Company’s members as 
a body in accordance with Chapter 3 of Part 16 of the Companies Act 2006 and for no other purpose. 
We do not, in giving these opinions, accept or assume responsibility for any other purpose or to any 
other person to whom this report is shown or into whose hands it may come save where expressly 
agreed by our prior consent in writing.

Other required reporting
Companies Act 2006 exception reporting
Under the Companies Act 2006 we are required to report to you if, in our opinion:

•  we have not obtained all the information and explanations we require for our audit; or

•  adequate accounting records have not been kept by the Company, or returns adequate for our audit 

have not been received from branches not visited by us; or

•  certain disclosures of directors’ remuneration specified by law are not made; or

•  the Company financial statements and the part of the Directors’ remuneration report to be audited 

are not in agreement with the accounting records and returns.

We have no exceptions to report arising from this responsibility.

Appointment
Following the recommendation of the Audit Committee, we were appointed by the directors on 
19 May 2014 to audit the financial statements for the year ended 31 December 2014 and subsequent 
financial periods. The period of total uninterrupted engagement is 10 years, covering the years ended 
31 December 2014 to 31 December 2023.

SASB REPORTING FOR BUNZL’S SUSTAINABILITY METRICS

The Sustainability Accounting Standards Board (‘SASB’) has industry-specific sustainability standards 
which identify material topics and associated metrics. The table below summarises where relevant 
SASB disclosures can be found throughout Bunzl’s annual reporting. This is based on several standards 
from the materiality map as Bunzl does not fall within one clear sector. We have based our disclosure 
on the most relevant standards for the business that align to and cover the key sustainability themes 
arising from our recent materiality assessment. All of the data provided below is from 2023 unless 
otherwise stated.

Product lifecycle management

Revenue from products 
that are reusable,

Discussion of 
strategies to reduce 
the environmental 
impact of packaging 
throughout its lifecycle

In 2023, £2.2bn revenue was generated from packaging and products 
made from materials that are recyclable, compostable, reusable or 
made from renewable sources.

We have discussed how we work with our suppliers and customers to 
reduce the environmental impact of packaging and products in both 
our Annual Report and Insight Series presentations.

Pages 56 to 57.

or plan to manage 
Scope 1 emissions, 
emissions reduction 
targets, and an analysis 
of performance against 
those targets

89,806 tonnes of CO2e

Our climate change/carbon strategy has been detailed in the 
sustainability section of our Annual Report on pages 48 to 55.

A comprehensive view into how we understand, assess and manage the 
risks and opportunities associated with climate change can be found in 
our TCFD index and associated reporting. Pages 48 to 55.

Our integrated process for identifying and assessing risks is detailed in 
the strategic report section of our Annual Report on pages 68 to 76.

Our carbon reduction targets can be found on pages 48 to 49 of our 
Annual Report with our performance shown on pages 52 to 53.

The targets are (baseline year: 2019):
•  Scope 1 & 2 – 50% more carbon efficient (equivalent to a 27.5% 

absolute reduction by 2030)*

•  Scope 3 – 79% of suppliers by emissions will have science-based 

targets by 2027*

•  Scope 1, 2 & 3 – 90% absolute reduction in emissions by 2050
•  Net zero emissions by 2050 at the latest

We have committed to the Business Ambition for 1.5⁰C initiative & Race 
to Zero campaign. We have submitted our Net Zero plan to the SBTi for 
approval in 2023.
* These targets have been approved by the Science-Based Targets Initiative (SBTi).

(3) percentage of total 
audits conducted by a 
third-party auditor

Our auditing process is our first line of defence to prevent defective 
products being shipped and to ensure products comply with our ethical 
standards. 

(1)   Tier 1 suppliers: All products supplied directly from Asia are through 
suppliers that are verified by our Global Supply Chain Solutions team 
and our audits typically cover c.98% of Bunzl spend across 13 Asian 
countries every two years. We will take a proactive, risk-based 
approach to responsible sourcing, identifying common issues in our 
supply chain and working closely with suppliers to reduce the future 
incidences of these. The spend coverage above (representing c.15% 
of our global supply chain) relates to our suppliers based in regions 
identified as very high risk in international rankings of human rights 
issues (e.g. Global Slavery Index). 

(2)  Tier 2 suppliers: None audited as we are taking a risk based 

approach to working through our supply chain with our programme 
(and focusing on Tier 1 as a priority). Our audits and Supplier Code of 
Conduct demand that our Tier 1 suppliers ensure that the Code is 
maintained and enforced within their own supply chains, including 
by any sub-contractors used in executing any orders received from 
our Company.

(3)  Percentage of total audits conducted by a third-party auditor: 16%.

During 2023, our Global Supply Chain Solutions team audited 1,022 
suppliers:
•  956 had no critical issues (c.94% suppliers audited).
•  66 underwent remediation efforts to bring them up to the required 

standard (c.6% suppliers audited).

•  Following these remediation efforts, we terminated relationships with 
10 suppliers who failed to make enough progress (c.1% of suppliers 
audited, c.15% of suppliers requiring remediation).

•  Corrective action rate for suppliers requiring remediation: c.85%.

Our Global Supply Chain Solutions team have identified the following 
risks:

(1)  Labour: 

•   Child Labour.
•  Forced Labour (Modern Slavery) – including the use of recruitment 

fees.

•  Unfair discrimination.
•  Wages not meeting local legal minimum requirements.
•  Continuous work for more than 30 consecutive days without at 

least one day’s rest.

(2) Environmental, health and safety risks:

•  Whether the supplier has an Environmental Policy and an 

appointed business owner.

•  Are evacuation routes and safety exits kept clear and unblocked, 

and is firefighting equipment easy to access.

•  Whether the dormitory is located in a building separate from the 

workshops and warehouses.

•  Are the production/warehouse buildings structurally safe.

We monitor the percentage of our workforce by gender and have total 
workforce of c.24,500 employees, 62% of them are male and 38% are 
female. In our senior management population (c. 500 leaders) there are 
22% females and 78% males.

We cannot monitor ethnicity of our total workforce or senior 
management population due to restrictions on capturing data in certain 
countries in which we operate. 

No compensation costs were paid in 2023. 

Voluntary turnover was 15.3%.

Double materiality methodology
1.   Defining the boundaries and business context
Bunzl’s operations connect our distributed, flexible supply chain with customers across multiple 
industries including retail, foodservice, grocery, construction and healthcare. As a result our double 
materiality assessment has considered the ESG impacts present across the entire value chain with 
appropriate consideration given to impacted stakeholders at each stage.

It is not only our value chain that is complex and dynamic, but so are the solutions we source and 
supply. The goods we provide to our customers cover a wide range of target sectors, product types and 
materials. Our assessment has recognised that these different products and materials have different 
associated sustainability impacts, risks and opportunities as shown in the table below.

ESG issues relating to 
PPE, medical equipment 
and workwear

•  Connected with ESG topics such as biodiversity and ecosystems 

and workers in the value chain. 

•  Positive ESG impacts and opportunities such as increasing access 

to healthcare and user health & safety.

2.  Identification of potentially material topics, impacts, risks and opportunities
We used the ESRS list of sustainability topics, sub-topics and sub-sub-topics as a starting point for our 
double materiality assessment. This list was supplemented with information from other resources 
including: our previous materiality assessment, SASB reporting standards, legal requirements in our 
markets, widely accepted sector-specific best practice and peer benchmarking. 

The desktop research was then reviewed by a cross-functional senior team and resulted in a list of:

•  potentially material impacts where Bunzl’s business activities and relationships could potentially 

affect people and the environment, and;

•  risks and opportunities that could have a negative or positive financial impact on Bunzl.

3.  Engagement with relevant stakeholders
During the assessment we sought insights on the potentially material impacts, risks and opportunities 
from different stakeholders across our value chain, including our largest suppliers of key commodities 
(e.g. paper & pulp, plastics and chemicals), customers from across all of our business areas, key 
investors and other stakeholders such as members of the Bunzl team and relevant charities.

STAKEHOLDER ENGAGEMENT PROCESS

We assigned relevant sustainability topics to each stakeholder group and to ensure we received the 
best quality responses, tailored the questions to each stakeholder to match those who were 
expected to be impacted by a sustainability issue or were in a position to provide unique insight on a 
particular topic. 

Furthermore, our assessment has been designed to consider the impacts, risks and opportunities that 
might relate to the individual geographies and/or market sectors in which we operate. These impacts 
are not always material when aggregated at a central level but we have given some examples of 
regional and market specific issues that were of interest to our stakeholders on page 46.

This ‘tailoring’ was based on the business relationship with Bunzl (different stakeholders would 
contribute different insights depending on their position in the supply chain) and the stakeholders 
business activities (for example a plastic packaging supplier may not be able to comment authentically 
on the sustainability issues relating to paper and pulp raw material sourcing).

4.  Determining materiality using a defined scoring methodology and thresholds
We have used a quantitative approach to determine whether an impact, risk or opportunity is material 
for Bunzl. We developed a scoring criteria, aligned to Bunzl’s risk assessment process, that was used by 
our stakeholders to analyse the lists of impacts, risks and opportunities to establish whether they were 
material or not.

Impact materiality

Impact materiality has been assessed based on two factors: severity and likelihood. Severity can be 
considered as a combination of the factors of scale (how grave or beneficial an impact is), scope (how 
widespread an impact is), and its irremediable character (how difficult it is to undo negative changes). 
Financial materiality has been assessed by using two factors; potential magnitude of financial effects 
and likelihood. The scoring and thresholds relating to financial materiality have been aligned with the 
Bunzl risk assessment process and methodology.

Packaging categories
•  Packaging refers to packaging and other products within the foodservice, grocery and retail sectors 

which are facing legislation or consumer pressure.

•  We have exercised our judgement to allocate sales to the packaging and non-packaging categories 

as explained in the table to the right.

•  In future years packaging and products may move between categories and/or may be added or 
removed (for example, as legislation changes, recyclability improves or if a new line of products 
is launched).

•  We review the categorisation of our products and packaging on a quarterly basis as part of our 

internal controls process and have made one change this year. Food containers made from other 
types of plastic (e.g. PS) that are not covered by other reporting categories have been moved from 
category 3 to category 2. These products serve a functional purpose and we are seeing customers 
transition away from these products to alternatives on a like-for-like basis. As such we have 
positioned these sales in ‘Consumable plastics likely to transition’.

1 The single-use plastic products most 
commonly facing restriction – i.e. 
outright bans or complete restriction on 
placing into the market within the 
majority of the countries in which we 
operate – this is the category where we 
expect to see some volume reduction 
and transition may not happen on a 
like-for-like basis.

We have expanded these specific 
regulations to all Business Areas where 
such products are sold. This is to 
provide consistency, as it can be 
reasonably expected that legislation will 
follow to those areas where it does not 
currently apply.

2 Single-use plastic products that have 
existing measures in place (either 
legislative in countries we operate or 
voluntarily by some brands/businesses 
we sell to) to control their usage.

As the use of these products across our 
Group is not completely restricted (i.e. 
there are no consistent bans as with 
category 1) and the products 
themselves serve a functional purpose, 
customers typically transition away from 
these products to alternatives on a 
like-for-like basis (including reusable 
options).

We have expanded these specific 
regulations to all Business Areas where 
such products are sold to provide 
consistency.

4 These represent the alternative 

solutions our customers typically 
transition their single-use packaging and 
products to.

These are products that are typically 
recyclable or compostable, made from a 
renewable resource, for example palm 
leaf or sugar cane, plastic products 
containing a proportion of recycled 
content (where these products are also 
recyclable) and reusable products such 
as ‘bags for life’ or refillable coffee cups 
that are products specifically designed 
to be used more than once. National 
guidance (where it exists) has been used 
to determine the recyclability of a 
product.

Due to the huge variation in recycling 
provisions globally we have expanded 
these criteria to all Business Areas 
where such products are sold to provide 
consistency.

Climate change scenarios
Our climate change scenarios align with the environmental and economic conditions represented in the 
Network for Greening the Financial System (‘NGFS’) scenario framework. This framework was used as 
the basis for the Bank of England’s 2021 Biennial Exploratory Scenario on climate risks and is based on 
the following assumptions:

Scenario 1 – ‘Orderly’
This reflects Net Zero 2050 commitments from COP26 which limit global warming to 1.5°C through 
stringent climate policies and innovation and assumes those jurisdictions which have committed to Net 
Zero (including US, EU, UK, Canada, Australia and Japan) will achieve those goals. This scenario assumes 
climate policies are introduced early and become gradually more stringent and that physical and 
transition risks increase gradually. Carbon prices increase steadily in key Bunzl countries and the use 
of internal combustion engine ‘ICE’ vehicles will be limited by regulations and market pressures. Physical 
and transition risks are both relatively low, however carbon prices are initially higher than the Disorderly 
scenario in order to encourage an earlier curbing of emissions. Customers may also increasingly 
express their preferences relating to the type of transportation used by Bunzl to deliver their products.

Scenario 2 – ‘Disorderly’ 
This scenario assumes a lack of coordinated response to climate change and therefore emissions 
reductions are limited until 2030. Climate policies are delayed or divergent across countries and since 
actions are taken relatively late and are limited by available technologies, emissions reductions need 
to be greater than in the Orderly scenario to limit warming to below 2°C. The result is higher transition 
risks and higher carbon prices. 

Scenario 3 – ‘Hothouse world’ 
The final scenario assumes that Governments fail to introduce the policies needed to address climate 
change beyond those that are already in place. Climate policies are implemented in some jurisdictions, 
but global efforts are insufficient to halt significant global warming. Global average carbon prices 
remain low and emissions grow until 2080 leading to +3°C of warming with severe physical risks and 
irreversible global impacts.

Evaluating potential impacts of climate change on our business
The Group has considered three possible outcomes (best, medium, worst) across our key potential 
climate-related business impacts, under the three climate scenarios. We have assessed the impacts 
on a short term (to 2025) mid term (to 2030) and long term (to 2050) basis. 

Shifting customer expectations
The timing of the emissions reductions required varies significantly between the Orderly, Disorderly 
and Hothouse scenarios. Many customers have committed to dramatically reduce carbon emissions 
by 2050 (with some committing to net zero) and they expect suppliers such as Bunzl to contribute to 
achieving these targets. Bunzl has already established a science-based reduction target in line with 
an Orderly scenario and will assess on an ongoing basis whether this emissions trajectory continues 
to meet customers’ ambitions.

Environmental impacts of technology
Whilst the transition to electric and plug-in hybrid vehicles has begun, the pace and breadth of change 
will depend upon the climate scenarios above. Bunzl is aware of relevant current trends including the 
deployment of electric (‘EV’) and plug-in hybrid electric vehicles (‘PHEV’), the energy density and range 
limitations of batteries for long haul trucks and the likely future cost of biofuels, which represent an 
important transition fuel. We considered whether a rapid increase in carbon pricing after 2030 in the 
Disorderly scenario could leave Bunzl with stranded assets, if trucks were to become uneconomical 
to run. Consideration of the environment in which we may operate under each of the climate scenarios 
above has led us to conclude that Bunzl will implement a fleet strategy that ensures a timely transition 
to alternative fuels at a cost that is comparable to the current cost, or that any increase in costs is 
marketwide and can be incorporated into sales prices. We also conclude that the risk of stranded 
assets is minimal, as the average life remaining on our truck and car leases is limited (estimated  
to 3 to 4 years). 

Adaptation to extreme weather
The business impact of extreme weather is already included in our climate model, as it could be a driver 
of lower GDP growth. Bunzl monitors the current impact of extreme weather on our operations to 
ensure we remain well prepared for worsening conditions in the future. In recent years we have seen 
disruptions due to extreme weather in North America (hurricanes and wildfires) and Australasia 
(wildfires and flooding). These events were predominantly regional and in most cases we were able to 
serve customers from a different location. If this was not possible, then it is expected revenue would 
recover in a short time after conditions normalise. We have concluded that extreme weather conditions 
currently do not represent a material financial risk to Bunzl in excess of the impacts already modelled 
by considering the impact climate change will have on GDP. 

Changing market dynamics
We have modelled the business impact of changing market conditions, by considering the potential 
for climate change to lead to lower GDP growth and higher carbon taxes: 

Global GDP: Bunzl’s revenue is to some extent correlated with the health and progress of the global 
economy. Economic damage from climate change could be caused by a number of outcomes, including 
shocks from extreme weather events, losses in agricultural productivity, temperature effects on labour 
productivity and human health, energy demands, and flows of tourism. All impacts are considered 
within our scenarios.

Carbon pricing is a cost levied by governments to encourage polluters to reduce the amount of 
greenhouse gases they emit. The Orderly scenario assumes increased carbon pricing in key Bunzl 
countries as a result of Government intervention and sustained consumer pressure. The Disorderly 
scenario reflects moderate pressure from consumers for climate action, resulting in a much lower 
carbon price than the Orderly scenario until 2030, when the substantial financial impacts of extreme 
weather events leads to a rapid policy response from Governments. A high carbon price is required 
from this point to drive large emissions reductions to limit global warming. Within the Hot House 
scenario, increases in carbon pricing remain negligible up to and beyond 2050.

Thematic area 

Risk & opportunities 

Response measures 

Shifting customer 
expectations 
Bunzl’s customers are setting 
more stringent environmental 
targets. 

Bunzl is increasingly expected to 
help customers achieve their 
ambitions and goals.

Risks 
Failing to align with our customers’ 
ambitions could lead to reputational 
damage and loss of sales. 

Opportunities 
Aligning with customers’ ambitions could 
strengthen customer relationships, build 
resilience to new environmental 
legislation and policy, and create brand 
differentiation. 

The risks and opportunities are 
applicable for all time horizons and are 
most significant in the short and 
medium term.

Environmental impacts of 
technology 
Technological advances will drive 
decarbonisation of Bunzl’s 
commercial fleet and shipping 
suppliers. The extent to which 
technological change presents a 
risk or opportunity for Bunzl will 
be determined by factors such as 
the development of low carbon 
technology for large commercial 
goods vehicles and deployment 
of charging infrastructure. 
Increased regulatory pressure on 
the use of fossil fuels for mobility 
is expected.

Risks 
Bunzl may need to upgrade to less 
carbon intensive technologies such 
as electric vehicle technology in our 
commercial goods vehicles. Regulations 
could limit Bunzl’s access to major urban 
areas for last mile deliveries. 

Opportunities 
New technologies such as energy 
efficient measures in warehouses. 
Proactive implementation of electric 
vehicle technology presents 
opportunities for strengthened 
customer relationships and brand 
differentiation, in addition to emissions 
reductions. The risks and opportunities 
are applicable for all time horizons and 
are most significant in the medium term.

Proactive scanning of 
customer trends and 
expectations. Our customers 
demand a wide range of 
solutions from Bunzl. We will 
build on our role as a 
material-agnostic distributor 
to provide customers with: 

•  information on less carbon 

intensive products;
•  expert advice on the 

sustainability impact of 
products sourced;

•  a broad range of product 
solutions suited to the 
application they need;
•  options to reduce the 

impact of our deliveries (see 
page 43); and 

•  setting emissions reduction 
targets to decarbonise our 
operations and supply chain 
in line with climate science 
(see page 49).

Continuing and accelerating 
the introduction of 
technology in our warehouse 
operations with a focus on 
implementation of energy 
efficient lighting and solar 
photovoltaic panels  
(see page 53). 

Piloting new low carbon 
transport technologies (such 
as electric vehicle technology 
and biofuels) for use in our 
commercial fleet, ahead of full 
adoption once large vehicle 
technologies become 
technically and economically 
viable.

Adaptation to extreme 
weather 
Bunzl’s suppliers and operations 
have already experienced the 
impacts of extreme weather. For 
example, hurricanes in North 
America have disrupted Bunzl’s 
distribution activities and 
wildfires have threatened Bunzl’s 
Australian operations. In both 
cases, we have been able to 
mitigate the risks to ensure 
supply.

Changing market dynamics 
The direct (physical) and indirect 
(transitional) risk may change 
the dynamics of the markets in 
which Bunzl operates. A key 
potential impact could come 
from carbon pricing, leading to 
some increase in costs of 
carbon intensive products.

Climate change may create a 
demand for low carbon products 
or the supply of products which 
help mitigate the physical 
impacts of climate change. 
Certain markets may also be 
increasingly affected by extreme 
weather.

Risks 
The severity and frequency of extreme 
weather events could increase in the 
future. While the flexibility of Bunzl’s 
supply chain has provided good 
operational resilience to the physical 
impacts of climate change, there could 
be an impact if several key customers 
in a high risk region were impacted 
simultaneously. More chronic impacts 
of climate change, such as drought or 
increased rainfall may, in certain 
circumstances, also lead to resource 
shortages and price volatility of raw 
materials and packaging. 

Opportunities 
Our supply chain flexibility and lack of 
fixed manufacturing assets provide an 
opportunity to quickly respond to 
changing operating conditions such as 
flooding and erosion caused by changed 
weather patterns. 

The risks and opportunities are 
applicable for all time horizons and 
are most significant in the medium 
and long term.

Risks 
Bunzl may face the risk of some 
increases in indirect costs from carbon 
intensive products. Certain markets may 
be increasingly affected by extreme 
weather (i.e. disruption to the hospitality 
industry in areas impacted by wildfires 
and flooding) which could impact our 
commercial strategy. 

Opportunities 
Our material agnostic business model 
and flexible supply chain allows us to 
benefit from opportunities to source and 
supply specialist low carbon products, or 
to acquire business and/or supply 
products which help mitigate the 
physical impacts of climate change.

The risks and opportunities are 
applicable for all time horizons and 
are most significant in the medium 
and long term.

Proven business continuity 
plans have ensured 
continued service to 
customers. 

Resilience through supply 
chain flexibility and lack of 
fixed manufacturing assets.

Bunzl is agnostic to the type 
of products it sources and 
supplies. This allows us to 
follow broader 
environmental, social and 
economic trends, entering 
new markets and seeking 
new customers where 
there is a business case 
for doing so. 

The ability to effectively pass 
through any increased costs 
of products in our supply 
chain (for example due to 
carbon pricing mechanisms) 
to our customers.

Reports. 

Scope 1 and 2 emissions data requires significant time to collect and categorise and as a result there is 
a three-month time lag between our financial data and scope 1 and 2 emissions data. 

Our absolute carbon emissions decreased by 4% during the year. The divestment of the Healthcare 
business reduced our emissions by 1%, which was offset by an increase by 1% due to acquisitions. The 
remaining decrease was driven by an increased uptake of electric vehicles (particularly in UK & Ireland 
and Continental Europe), energy efficiency improvements and increased procurement of renewable 
energy (from 17 to 25%).

 Energy usage and carbon emissions disclosed separately to adopt to the requirements of the UK Streamlined Energy and Carbon 
Reporting (‘SECR’) policy.

Our reported environmental data includes all businesses that are subsidiaries of the Group for financial 
reporting purposes, except for recent acquisitions where there has been insufficient opportunity for 
the businesses to adopt our reporting guidelines. The revenue from these businesses is not included 
when calculating the indexed emissions. The reported data covers 99.4% of the Group by revenue. 

Bunzl has a Group wide approach to recording, measuring and reporting energy and climate change 
data. Business Areas are responsible for data input and monitoring progress against targets and 
providing commentary on significant variances and on the implementation of projects aimed at 
improving EHS performance. All data is reported in the Group’s central EHS reporting and consolidation 
system. More details can be found in the Group reporting guidelines on our website www.bunzl.com/
sustainability/sustainability-reporting. 

Scope 3:
In 2023, we assessed the scope 3 Forest, Land, and Agriculture (‘FLAG’) emissions relevant to Bunzl. 
FLAG emissions are the emissions associated with land use change and other land-related activities. 
In Bunzl’s supply chain these emissions are relevant within the scope 3 category Purchased Goods & 
Services (particularly paper and textile products). We have screened the relevant materials and 
engaged a third party to identify the emission factors required to calculate our FLAG emissions. 

In 2023, we have also introduced minor changes to the calculation of scope 3 transport emissions. 
These changes have also been applied to our 2019 and 2021 emissions calculations. We have also 
rebased our 2019 emissions to take account of acquisitions made after 2019 (our baseline year). Scope 
3 emissions are summarised in the table below. The calculation of the emissions associated with 
purchased goods and services, which is our largest scope 3 emission source, is based on supplier 
spend. The economic emission intensity factors that we use for this calculation do not account for the 
inflation increase in 2021 and 2022, which is why the reported emissions associated with purchased 
goods and services have increased significantly.

We are reporting on all material scope 3 categories of emissions. Our scope 3 carbon emissions 
are reported based on the previous financial year ended 31 December 2022 . The scope 3 emissions 
calculation is complex and requires data from a large number of supply chain partners and service 
providers, such as third-party carriers and other logistics services providers. As a result, there is a 
one-year time-lag between our financial data and the scope 3 emissions data in our Annual Report. 
We are working to develop our access to high quality scope 3 data and to reduce the time required 
to calculate our scope 3 emissions. Once complete, this will allow us to report our scope 3 emissions 
in better alignment with our financial reporting year. 

More information on the scope 3 data methodology can be found in our EHS Reporting Guidelines 
which are available in the Sustainability section of our website.

Waste
The amount of waste generated in our facilities in 2023 was estimated to be 22,200 tonnes which 
is unchanged compared to last year. We have continued to increase completeness and accuracy 
of reporting, particularly by moving to centralized waste management services in certain areas. 

The recycling rates strongly depend on the locally available waste recycling options. In 2023, the 
recycling rate remained stable at approximately 50% of the generated waste. This excludes any 
post-disposal waste treatment and recycling carried out by waste handlers. The reported waste data 
covers more than 99% of the Group by revenue although accurate waste measurement remains 
challenging in geographies with less advanced waste management infrastructures. 

Water
Direct water usage is not a significant environmental impact for our business as it is principally confined 
to staff hygiene and workplace cleaning, with the exception of a very small number of sites where we 
process gel or ice packs which contain water. Water discharges, apart from internal sanitation, are 
limited to rainwater run-off from the yards of our locations. Our estimated water usage is 224,000 m3 
of water per year. Despite the increase in employees in the Group, the usage is slightly lower than last 
year due to increased accuracy of reporting. 

Environmental management system certification 
We have developed an internal EHS management system standard that is based on ISO 14001 and ISO 
45001. Some parts of the business, mainly in UK & Ireland, Asia Pacific and Continental Europe, have 
elected to become formally certified. These businesses cover approximately 25% of the Group’s 
operations (measured by revenue). 

to complete this process in 2024. The new system will provide one platform globally to report data, 
carry out audits and inspections and to record and monitor actions. It is a key element of our 
programme going forward.

Targets for 2023: 
Reduce the Group accident incidence rate by 3% from 2022. Reduce the Group accident severity rate 
by 3% from 2022.

The 2023 Group accident incidence rate of 88 represents a 10% increase versus 2022. The 2023 Group 
accident severity rate of 2,338 represents a 4% improvement versus 2022. 

Injuries relating to the operation of our warehouses and vehicles, such as manual handling, falling, 
slipping and tripping and impact with equipment remain the highest causes of accidents. In addition 
to the number of accidents, we use a variety of leading indicators, such as near misses, the number of 
safety meetings and the number of inspections to measure our performance and to identify areas for 
ongoing improvement. Despite this, we have not been able to achieve our incidence reduction target 
for reporting year 2023. We have carried out an in-depth review of this increase to identify root causes 
and to ensure that our accident reduction programmes remain adequate. In 2024, we aim to update 
our global Health & Safety standards and focus on enhancing a proactive safety culture across the 
Group. We are currently introducing a new global integrated EHS data management system. We plan 

External assurance 
We engaged PricewaterhouseCoopers LLP ‘PwC’ to undertake a limited assurance engagement, 
reporting to Bunzl plc only, using International Standard on Assurance Engagements ‘ISAE’ 3000 
(Revised): ‘Assurance Engagements Other Than Audits or Reviews of Historical Financial Information’ 
and ISAE 3410: ‘Assurance Engagements on Greenhouse Gas Statements’ over the two non-financial 
KPIs highlighted on page 41 and the selected data on page 52 of the Sustainability Report and in the 
ESG Appendix. In each case that has been highlighted with the symbol ‘◊’. 

PwC has provided an unqualified opinion in relation to the relevant KPIs and data and their full 
assurance opinion is available in the Sustainability section of our Group website, www.bunzl.com. 
Non-financial performance information, including greenhouse gas quantification in particular, is 
subject to more inherent limitations than financial information. It is important to read the selected

Supply chain risk assessment
To guide our responsible sourcing work effectively, we partnered with the Non-Governmental 
Organisation (‘NGO’) Stop the Traffik which has applied its methodology to rank the inherent modern 
slavery and human rights risks in our supply chain. This work was based on a combination of the 
sourcing country and market sector applicable to the products and services being procured.

In our supplier risk assessment work we place primary focus on the inherent modern slavery risks in 
the countries that we source our products from (see Category A below for examples). However, we are 
aware that lower risk countries can contain industry sectors with an increased risk of modern slavery 
issues (see Category B below for examples and our approach to mitigation). 

The table below provides an overview of how we categorise the modern slavery risks associated with 
our suppliers and the risk mitigations we apply.

Category

Description

Category 
A (low 
overall 
spend)

Suppliers operating in very 
high or high risk countries 
regardless of product risk 
sector.

Our responsible sourcing 
target to 2025 covers this 
category.

Category 
B (low 
overall 
spend)

Suppliers operating in lower 
risk countries but operating in 
a very high or high product risk 
sector. Very high and high risk 
product sectors: 

•  Manufacturing of wearing 

apparel 

•  Manufacturing of textiles

•  Manufacture of leather 

products

Countries and 
product 
sectors

Most Asian 
countries. Key 
countries 
outside of Asia 
are Brazil, 
Turkey, Mexico, 
Poland and 
Israel.

In various 
countries such 
as USA, UK and 
France.

Risk mitigation

•  Standard or enhanced 

Bunzl audit process in Asia. 
•  Risk-based assessment and 
audit process outside Asia 
(self-assessment will be 
used to determine the most 
appropriate approach).
•  Type of audit (standard or 

enhanced) to be 
determined by product risk 
sector and other leverage 
factors such as spend and 
number of employees at 
supplier location. 

Similar assessment and 
auditing techniques to 
Category A but targeting 
specific sectors in these 
countries. These will be 
conducted at a lower 
frequency or by using 
proactive spot checks.

Countries and 
product 
sectors

In various 
countries such 
as USA, UK, 
France and the 
Netherlands.

Risk mitigation

These suppliers are provided 
with Bunzl’s Supplier Code of 
Conduct.

Category

Description

Category 
C (high 
overall 
spend)

Suppliers operating in lower 
risk countries and operating in 
lower risk product sectors.

Lower risk product sectors:

•  Manufacture of rubber and 

plastic products

•  Manufacture of paper and 

paper products

•  Manufacture of chemicals 
and chemical products

Code of conduct
The Group’s business code of conduct is a guide for every employee explaining how they are expected 
to conduct themselves both from a corporate and individual perspective.

141 In 2023 we received 141 reports through our 

confidential whistle blowing process, ‘Speak 
Up’, 17 of which related to the 4 material 
breaches of our code of conduct. The increase 
in cases is likely due to several factors; an 
increase in the number of clustered reports 
relating to the same issue; new acquisitions 
and greater awareness of the policy following 
the global Fraud Investigation Toolkit training 
sessions.

FIVE YEAR REVIEW

Charitable contributions
Bunzl’s operations are international but our strength lies in the local nature of our businesses. We 
support the communities where our employees live and work and encourage fundraising activities 
championed by our businesses and their employees locally. In 2019, we realigned our corporate charity 
programme to focus on environmental projects related to recycling, litter prevention, clean-up and 
waste management infrastructure. 

During 2023 we continued to support activities in these three areas:

•  charitable projects that encourage packaging reuse and recycling, and work to educate consumers;

•  litter clean-up and prevention initiatives operating in our markets, giving our employees the 

opportunity to get involved; and

•  projects that build new waste management infrastructure and develop recycling skills in some of the 
world’s poorest places, often in areas where plastic leakage to the natural environment is highest.

Example initiatives

WasteAid

Hubbub

Working with local associations, WasteAid and Bunzl have provided tailored 
training in business skills for up to 50 waste pickers in Johannesburg, South 
Africa to enable them to increase their earning potential. The training was 
followed by the opportunity to pitch for microgrants to support their activities, 
for example for the purchase of handcarts or compactors, or rental of a 
premises for aggregating material.

An engagement campaign aimed at encouraging commuters in major UK cities 
to reduce waste and save money by remembering their reusable cups, water 
bottles, and lunchboxes. The campaign employed a digital approach, featuring 
advertisements and collaborations with social media influencers.

Group wide, Bunzl donated a total of c.£1.8m to charitable causes during 2023. This does not include 
amounts donated by Bunzl in matching funds raised by employees for local charities.
