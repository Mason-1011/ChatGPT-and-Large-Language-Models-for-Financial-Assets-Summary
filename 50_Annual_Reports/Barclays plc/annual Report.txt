Chairman’s introduction

Barclays PLC

Annual Report 2023 04

Working together 
for a better 
financial future

Our strong and stable franchise has enabled us to remain 
resilient and continue to support our customers, clients 
and communities through an unpredictable external 
environment. We will continue to work together for a 
better financial future for all our stakeholders. 

“The UK has been Barclays' 
home for over 300 years 
and as such we play 
an active part in its 
economic success.”

Nigel Higgins

Chairman

Banks and the banking system should at all times 
strive for a high degree of stability and reliability, 
reflecting their resilience, continuity of service to 
customers and clients, and the essential 
mechanics they perform for national and global 
economies. The premium for stability and 
reliability, and the challenge of achieving both, 
rise in difficult times. The essence of our 
message to you this year is that Barclays is well 
on the journey to a more sustainable, and 
satisfactory performance, but has more to do 
and a plan to do it.

That the global background is unpredictable is 
obvious and volatility is now the backdrop to our 
world, where we seek so many things with only 
partial success – continuing economic growth, 
predictable courses for inflation and interest 
rates, settled patterns of global trade, stability 
within and between nations. 

2023 started with fairly uniform and downbeat 
economic and equity market expectations. On 
both counts, however, the intervening twelve 
months surprised on the positive side, but not 
without considerable stress being experienced 
by households and businesses, triggered by 
inflation and rising interest rates. It is testimony 
to the resilience of the economic system that 
this occurred but is sobering to note how wrong 
so much of the predictive commentary could be. 

As a global bank we must pay close heed to shifts 
in the external environment and reverberations 
for our stakeholders. Banks vary enormously, by 
geography and by individual firm, in terms of how 
they respond to changes in interest rates and the 
interest rate curve. After years of negligible 
interest rates, banks have to find the right 
balance between higher rates for borrowers, 
which improve profitability, and sometimes 
conflicting consumer and political expectations; 
this is not an easy balance to strike.

Sustainable and transition 
financing facilitated towards the target 
of $1trn by 2030

In this environment, Barclays has maintained 
strong liquidity and operated towards the top of 
its target range for capital throughout 2023. With 
a profitable business model we delivered a 
1
, 
Return on Tangible Equity for 2023 of 10.6%
enabling capital distributions of c. £3.0bn. These 
capital returns mean that since 2019 we have 
returned c.£9bn in dividends and buybacks to our 
shareholders, representing a share count 
reduction of 13%. Our management team has 
brought stability to earnings, delivering 
consistent underlying returns above 10% since 
2021, whilst continuing to oversee significant 
improvements in the operations of the bank as 
part of our ambition to achieve a standard of 
being consistently excellent in all that Barclays 
does. This has been a very material endeavour 
and Venkat gives more detail about our renewed 
operational rigour in his letter.

However, both the Board and management team 
are acutely aware that our returns should be 
higher, and our valuation is far from where it 
should be. Our focus since the global financial 
crisis has been to rebuild and stabilise the bank. In 
a world of constrained capital and human 
resource, the bank has prioritised its operational 
and financial resilience, including significant 
investments in the technology stack. This has 
included a considerable shrinkage of geographic 
footprint and a focus on those businesses where 
we believe we can be successful. 

We have also reinforced the talent and 
infrastructure of the Investment Bank, in Markets 
and Banking in particular, given that these are 
scale-dependent businesses and are central to 
the diversified returns strategy we pursue. The 
consumer businesses of Barclays have received 
less consistent and focused investment.

The challenges of performance and valuation are 
linked but distinct. In addressing the challenges 
and regulatory requirements of the post-
financial crisis world Barclays has become overly 
complex and cost-heavy. It is not always the case 
that more resources and extra processes make a 
financial institution safer or more resilient. 
Complexity can lead to accountability or 
responsibility being unclear at times, and to 
unnecessary cost; being simpler is often safer, 
and more cost efficient. In other words, how we 
operate is as important as the shape of the 
business model. There are a small number of 
business lines which we plan to exit in 2024, but 
these are not particularly material to the 
performance challenge. The big task is to 
execute Venkat's ambition to be consistently 
excellent. The simplification of processes and 
the streamlining of management layers in the 
bank are fundamental to this. This process is well 
underway and it lay behind the decision to take a 
significant fourth quarter restructuring charge 
last year.

The valuation challenge is obviously less directly 
under our control. The Board’s view remains that 
the diversified returns strategy which we pursue 
is the right one. However, it brings business 
complexities, and there is a scarcity of 
comparable banks in Europe. 

Barclays PLC

Annual Report 2023 05

Our commitment to the Investment Bank 
remains strong, and its priority over the next few 
years, having reached overall scale, is to become 
more capital efficient and thus profitable, in part 
through improved prioritisation around activities 
and clients. The cost structure also requires 
some work. Given this, we do not envisage 
needing to add materially to the capital deployed 
in the Investment Bank. At the same time we will 
step up investment in the consumer businesses 
of Barclays on both sides of the Atlantic. 

As a result, we expect the allocation of capital 
within the bank to shift, with Markets and Banking 
coming to represent a rather lower proportion of 
RWAs over coming years. We think that this 
balance, as long as it is reinforced by continuing 
returns at the appropriate level, should improve 
investor sentiment towards this business. 
Secondly, we continue the journey to make sure 
that investors have more confidence in where 
and how we make money. Our disclosures 
around risk and profitability have improved 
markedly over the last few years and we remain 
committed to doing more. The new divisional 
reporting arrangement will help here, including 
being transparent about those areas of the 
business where profitability improvement is most 
needed.

In his letter to shareholders Venkat sets out in 
more detail his vision for Barclays, including new 
financial targets, and a clear plan to achieve 
them.

Chairman’s introduction (continued)

This path to a simpler, better and more balanced 
bank is not just based on the work around 
Barclays’ shape, strategy and financial 
performance. It is also intimately tied to our 
expression of Purpose, which we have also 
decided to streamline to emphasise the way in 
which we need to operate. ‘Working together for 
a better financial future’ expresses our drive to 
deliver high quality products and services which 
help to improve livelihoods for customers and 
clients, helping them with the finance and advice 
to innovate, invest and grow. And for our 
communities, it is about using our scale and 
capabilities to fulfil potential. It is also clear that a 
greater focus on the consumer and on the UK as 
a whole are crucial here.

During 2023, we  continued to make progress to 
meet our ambition of being a net zero bank by 
2050. Capital is critical for a successful energy 
transition and we are targeting our financing and 
resources to energy companies committed to 
decarbonise and investing to enable the 
transition in the real economy. I am pleased to 
report that in 2023 we financed $67.8bn of 
Sustainable and Transition Financing, 
contributing towards our target of $1trn by the 
end of 2030.

In addition, earlier in February we published a 
revised energy policy to progress our climate 
strategy, with a commitment not to directly 
finance energy companies' new oil and gas 
projects, consistent with the IEA NZE scenario, 
and setting clear expectations of transition 
strategies and decarbonisation requirements for 
our clients. This policy change is an important 
lever for reducing our financed emissions as we 
continue towards aligning our financing portfolio 
to the goals of the Paris Agreement.

As you read this report you will also find powerful 
testimonies as to how Barclays is supporting our 
communities, including in our UK home market. 
In 2023 we marked the ten year anniversary of 
Barclays’ LifeSkills programme, which has helped 
millions of people transform their futures 
through its employability tools and learning 
resources. 

Our partnerships with sport are another 
meaningful demonstration of how we can 
support the development of vital skills and 
confidence which are critical to the future 
success of our communities. Building on our 
comprehensive sponsorship of girls’ and 
women’s football since 2019, in 2023 we debuted 
as the Official Banking Partner of Wimbledon, 
integrating it with our existing programmes to 
support employability and skills, our focus on 
sustainability, and connecting clients, customers 
and communities.  

The UK has been Barclays’ home for over 
300 years and as such we play an active part in its 
economic success. Against a backdrop of 
constrained public finances, high inflation and 
interest rates, we recognise the increasing 
imperative for financial institutions to play a 
prominent role in fostering sustainable economic 
growth. We have continued to do just that 
through 2023, from our growing network of 
Barclays Eagle Labs supporting entrepreneurship, 
to our close participation in public policy 
consideration of how the UK’s capital markets 
can be bolstered to unlock business growth. 

The various threads of our performance I have 
recounted are only made possible by the 
steadfast dedication and hard work of 
colleagues. On behalf of the Board I would like to 
thank all of them for their ongoing commitment 
to serve our stakeholders, and to deliver Barclays’ 
success.   

I am also grateful to all of my Board colleagues for 
their contributions this last year. We welcomed 
Marc Moses to our Board in January 2023 and Sir 
John Kingman to our Board and as Chair of 
Barclays Bank UK PLC in June 2023. Both bring a 
deep experience of financial services. Julia 
Wilson, who joined the Board in 2021, took over 
as Chair of the Audit Committee in April 2023 
and you can read her letter to shareholders on 
page 166. I would also like to reiterate my thanks 
to Mike Ashley and Crawford Gillies who retired 
from the Board during 2023, having supported 
Barclays through a period of considerable change 
during their tenure. 

Barclays PLC

Annual Report 2023 06

I look forward to discussing Barclays’ 
performance in 2023 and plans for the year 
ahead at our Annual General Meeting on 
Thursday 9 May 2024 in Glasgow, which is the 
home of our net zero campus and base for over 
5,000 colleagues. The meeting will take place at 
the Scottish Events Campus, Armadillo, Glasgow 
and shareholders will be invited to participate in 
person or online. 

2024 will be notable as we renew our focus on 
delivering high quality products and service to our 
customers and clients, and on improving our 
returns to investors.

Annual Report 2023 07

Our ambition to 
be the UK-centred 
leader in global 
finance 

“By being Simpler, 
Better and More 
balanced, we can deliver 
greater shareholder 
value by 2026.”

C. S. Venkatakrishnan

Group Chief Executive

Over the last decade we have made good progress 
building strong customer franchises in the UK and US, 
alongside the leading markets and banking business 
outside the US. We have also strengthened the bank 
financially, and improved our returns. From these strong 
foundations, we have a vision for the shape of a better 
run, more strongly performing and higher returning 
Barclays.

Introduction

Our progress and performance 

During this year, as in the previous one, we have 
seen increasing political and economic tensions 
around the world. Resurging nationalism is 
precipitating global decoupling, reversing the 
ratcheting integration of preceding decades. The 
effects are reflected in increasingly restrictive 
trade policies, subsidies, mistrust even among 
allies, and the resurgence of real conflict.

This riskier market, economic and political 
environment has several important implications 
for a global financial institution like Barclays. 
Notwithstanding global fragmentation, investors 
continue to need access to world markets. We 
have to provide this while managing the relatively 
higher risk of doing so. In the last decade, 
Barclays has largely curtailed or entirely shut 
retail operations in Africa, India and Europe. 
Our footprint today, operating in London and 
New York, and across major global financial 
centres, positions us well for this increasingly 
polarising world.

Perhaps most relevantly, our home in London, 
remains one of the leading capital market centres. 

We have built a strong position in the UK market, 
the product of more than three centuries of 
commitment, with c.20 million personal customers. 
In the last two decades, we have also built a growing 
customer franchise in the US, working in 
partnership with prominent US brands like Gap Inc. 
and American Airlines, through which we serve c.20 
million credit card customers. In parallel, we have 
established the leading international markets and 
banking business headquartered outside the US. 
Barclays Investment Bank has forged a global 
reputation for sophisticated execution and risk 
management, and is at a scale which competes 
directly with US peers. In Global Markets we are Top 
1
, while in 
3 in Credit and Fixed Income Financing
Investment Banking we continue to maintain a 6th 
2
position globally
. We led on a number of prominent 
deals through 2023, including Arm’s IPO – the 
largest to price since 2021.

As we have built our multinational footprint, we 
have also strengthened Barclays financially, and 
improved our returns. Over the last decade we 
increased our capitalisation from 10% to nearly 
14% CET1, against a backdrop of accelerating 
digital transformation, an evolving regulatory 
landscape including Basel III, and significant 
economic and geopolitical disruption. 

Since 2021, we have delivered consistent 
underlying returns above 10%, through an 
uncertain operating environment. This strength 
and resiliency has enabled us to return c.£9bn in 
dividends and buybacks to our shareholders 
since 2019, and since 2021 we have distributed 
33% of our market cap. With respect to 2023 we 
have announced c. £3.0bn in dividends and 
buybacks, an increase of 37% on 2022.  

We continued to deliver well in 2023, despite the 
mixed macroeconomic backdrop. Our income 
was £25.4bn, our CIR was 63% - in line with our 
target - and our RoTE was 10.6%, excluding the 
structural cost charge taken in Q4 2023. We 
generated a PBT of £6.6bn, and EPS of 32.4p. 
Our Vision

I have considerable ambition for Barclays. Simply 
put, I want us to be the UK-centred leader in 
global finance. At our core we will have a 
comprehensive and pre-eminent UK consumer, 
corporate, wealth and private banking franchise, 
complemented by a strong, specialist US 
consumer bank. Alongside both will be the 
leading non-US based Investment Bank.

I want Barclays to be renowned for excellent 
operational performance, strong product 
delivery, highly satisfied customers and clients, 
and robust liquidity, capital and risk management. 
The outcome of which is a strongly returning, 
highly valued global bank, centred in the UK, 
producing higher levels of total shareholder 
returns. 

Achieving our objective

We are building from the strong foundations I set 
out earlier, but we know this is not reflected in our 
shareholder experience. We have spent time 
examining the path we are on, and the direction 
we will take going forward, as we know we need to 
do better. I believe Barclays is capable of 
delivering further value for our shareholders. 

We need to continue to improve our operational 
and financial performance, and improve total 
shareholder returns. To do so, over the next three 
years we aim to make Barclays Simpler, Better 
and More balanced.

We will manage the bank along five focused 
business lines, each with ambition of scale and 
high returns. This will reduce the complexity of 
our reporting, and improve the accountability and 
transparency of each individual businesses 
performance.

Our UK ring-fenced consumer bank – Barclays UK 
(BUK) – today delivers consistently high returns, 
has entrenched scale, with full presence across 
products and clients. We will aim to establish a 
leadership position in the UK, ever-improving our 
customer propositions and service. Our emphasis 
is on regaining share within credit cards and 
unsecured lending, and delivering greater 
operational and cost efficiency. We aim to reduce 
our CIR from 58% in 2023 to c.50% in 2026.

We will split out Consumer, Cards and Payments 
(CCP) into three, separately reported businesses: 
Barclays US Consumer Bank, Barclays UK 
Corporate Bank and Barclays Private Bank & 
Wealth Management. 

Barclays US Consumer Bank (USCB), is a specialist 
partnership credit card provider in the US, with a 
market leading position in Travel and Airlines. 
Notwithstanding the lower RoTE in 2023 which is 
explained on page 21 of the Annual Report, we 
aim to be a partner of choice for America’s leading 
brands, particularly in Retail, achieving an ever-
more diversified portfolio of blue-chip clients. 

We will continue to invest in a scalable digital 
platform to increase operating efficiency, and 
sophisticated capital management techniques to 
enhance risk-adjusted returns. 

We will also seek to build further on our strengths 
in Barclays UK Corporate Bank, which has a long 
and successful history of fostering enterprise in 
the UK. We have relationships with 25% of UK 
2
, and see more than two in five of the 
corporates
UK’s credit and debit card transactions. We aim 
to build on this strength, expanding our share in 
lending, and modernising our systems to 
improve self-service capabilities. 

Barclays Private Bank and Wealth Management 
represents a significant opportunity to 
strengthen our retail and mass affluent franchise, 
linked to our strong consumer franchise and 
complementing our UK-centred Private Bank. 
We will offer robust financial management tools, 
priced fairly, managed transparently, constructed 
simply and delivered efficiently, in order for our 
clients to grow wealth responsibly at each stage 
of their personal financial journeys. 

Barclays Investment Bank today is the leading 
non-US based international markets and 
3
investment banking business
. It is at scale, with 
deep client relationships and a global reputation 
for sophistication in execution and risk 
management.

Chief Executive’s introduction (continued)

We aim to consolidate our position, broadening 
and deepening client relationships, monetising our 
investments in technology and capital, and driving 
stronger returns. To support this journey, we have 
moved the International Corporate Banking 
business into Investment Banking.

Operating our bank, and each of our businesses, 
extremely well is fundamental to improving and 
de-risking our financial outcomes. We will 
continue to drive operational and process 
efficiency across the group, by streamlining our 
workforce, simplifying decision making, 
upgrading legacy system architecture, and 
accelerating the pace of delivery. This will deliver 
improved cost income ratios across every 
business, even as we invest to drive better 
returns and improve resilience.  

I am also clear we must manage the bank in a 
consistently excellent way, to avoid unexpected 
and unnecessary losses from operational errors 
and give continued confidence to our 
stakeholders. We have implemented a group-
wide culture programme – Consistently Excellent 
– establishing a very high operating standard for 
the firm, and targeting best-in-class service 
across the group. We are making progress 
advancing this high standard across the bank as 
numerous examples throughout this Report will 
attest, but we have more to do as we aim to 
make it the essence of Barclays. 

Financially, we will increase the allocation of 
capital to higher-returning businesses. Over the 
next three years we will deliver a more evenly 
balanced allocation of RWAs, with more capital 
deployed to our highest returning consumer 
businesses, which attract higher investor 
multiples. 

RWAs in Barclays UK, Barclays UK Corporate 
Bank and Barclays Private Bank and Wealth 
Management will increase by around 4% points 
as a proportion of total RWAs. 

By no means is this to diminish the importance of 
our Investment Bank; rather, it is to place our 
consumer and corporate businesses on a 
similarly strong footing. 

Over the medium-term this will rebalance 
Barclays RWAs across our consumer and 
wholesale businesses, to support more 
consistent and higher returns. 

By being Simpler, Better and More balanced, we 
can deliver greater shareholder value by 2026. 
Our new financial framework includes a target to 
generate a Return on Tangible Equity of greater 
than 12% by that time, and to return at least £10 
billion to shareholders via a mix of dividends and 
1
buybacks
. 
Shaping Barclays for the future 

The business, operational and financial goals 
which we have outlined are an important part of 
success, but they are not all of it. In the 
increasingly multi-polar world we described at 
the outset, we must choose what we want to be 
and where. 

This year signifies our strengthened 
commitment to the UK. The UK economy 
continues to prove relatively resilient to global 
shifts and, as a UK headquartered bank, we are 
deeply rooted in our domestic market. With a 
renewed focus on businesses in which we can be 
successful, and a re-emphasis on delivering 
excellent customer service, we can build on our 
valuable brand and capture even more 
opportunity in our home market.

Note:

1 This multiyear plan is subject to supervisory and Board approval, 
anticipated financial performance and our published CET1 range 
of 13%-14%.

Conclusion

Our commitment to, and deep roots in, the UK 
have shaped our vision. As part of this resolve, we 
are purposefully engaged in initiatives to advance 
UK prosperity, from levelling-up essential life 
skills for 3.27 million people during 2023, to 
supporting ambitious start-ups and scale-ups 
across the UK. 

At the heart of the activity and ambition which I 
have detailed throughout this letter are our 
colleagues. Our success is driven by their hard 
work and dedication and to support our 
customers, clients and communities. I am 
pleased to note that Barclays is ranked as 
Number 1 on LinkedIn’s 2023 UK Top Companies 
list for the third year in a row, demonstrating that 
we have built an organisation of mutual respect 
and appreciation, and one in which our 
colleagues have opportunities to thrive.

2024 will be a crucial year for Barclays. To change 
the way we operate and achieve sustainable 
success will take strenuous effort, relentless 
focus and time. I am confident that our clear plan 
will achieve these objectives, and take us to new 
heights. 

Thank you.

The world in which 
we operate

Barclays is driven by a common Purpose: working 
together for a better financial future. To do so, we 
must be strong as an institution, prepared for the future, 
and able to navigate different market conditions and 
evolving trends. 

We regularly review our operating environment 
for emerging trends and adapt to address them. 
In 2021, we called out three long-term trends 
and continue to make good progress addressing 
these, as you will find detailed throughout 
the report:

The impact of technology on consumer 
products and services

The role of capital markets as the principal 
drivers of global growth

The transition of the global economy towards 
a low-carbon economy

Context: 
We actively navigate risk and uncertainty, and are vigilant to deliver for our customers, clients, 
and shareholders in any environment.

Primary considerations

Geopolitical
• Elections in over 

70 countries during 2024

• Conflict in Ukraine 
and Middle East

• US-China relations 

Further considerations

Climate: 
• Energy transition 
• More extreme climate cycles

Technology: 
• Generative AI, and related impact from regulators 

and cybersecurity
• FinTech adoption 

Regulatory: 
• Basel 3 endgame, and related regulated responses from 
countries including effects of AIRB regulations in the US

Recently, we have adjusted our strategy and 
operating model to reflect changes in the 
environment we operate in, and evolving 
demands from our customers, clients, 
regulators and shareholders. 

Macroeconomic
• Economic uncertainty: 

higher inflation and interest 
rates

• Higher systemic risk and 

volatility

three-year plan

Our Purpose

Our Priorities

We want Barclays to be 
renowned for an excellent 
operational performance, 
highly satisfied customers and 
clients, strong liquidity, capital 
and risk management, and 
predictable, attractive 
shareholder returns. Building 
on our strong foundations, we 
have a clear plan to achieve 
these objectives and deliver 
further value for shareholders 
by 2026. Over the next three 
years we will make Barclays 
Simpler, Better and More

Year in review

Barclays UK has been customer-focused and 
community-based for 333 years. In 2023 we focused 
on strengthening our customer and client 
propositions and improving our execution. Our strong 
franchise and valuable brand are reflected in our 
financial performance, with Barclays UK delivering a 
RoTE of 19.2%. Notwithstanding these results, and 
our progress over the course of 2023 to refine and 
enhance our customer service, we know we have 
more to do. 

During 2023, cost of living pressures and the rising 
interest rate environment continued to impact our 
customers in the UK. In response we enhanced the 
tools and information available to customers via our 
Money Management Hub – helping them better 
understand their spending and the steps they can take 
to improve their financial wellbeing. We also launched 
our Money 1:1 service, offering customers a 
personalised financial coaching session with a specially 
trained Barclays Money Mentor. 

To boost customers’ long-term financial resilience we 
provided options to switch to interest-only mortgages 
for six months and extensions of their mortgage term 
where appropriate. Additionally, we helped over 
103,000 new customers get on or move up the 
housing ladder during 2023 – including 33,000 first-
time buyers. We also proactively contacted 1.2 million 
customers to let them know they could earn more 
interest by moving to a different savings product. For 
our business clients, we ran more than 900 Business 
Health Pledge masterclasses during 2023. 

As part of our customer-centricity we remained 
focused on improving our customer experience, 
combining the best of digital with the human touch. 

The transformation of our physical service model 
means we are able to provide in-person support in our 
communities, while serving our customers more 
sustainably. In 2023 we expanded Barclays Local by 
more than 159 new sites and now have 
351 sites in total – in addition to 306 branches and 16 
mobile service points (vans). We are also participating 
in innovative new Shared Banking Hubs.

Improving existing propositions and adding 
innovative new ones are important ways we 
continue to drive growth in Barclays UK. To this end, 
in 2023 we completed the acquisition of Kensington 
Mortgage Company – an award-winning mortgage 
1
lender
 known for its strong support of specialist 
customer groups and the intermediary market.

Our Savings strategy is to help customers develop 
smart savings habits while supporting those already 
saving to make their money work harder. We offer 
personal customers interest rates of up to 5%, with 
our flexible products designed to help customers 
achieve their goals. For example, customers can 
segregate money from current accounts to develop 
savings habits, while Barclays Blue customers are 
rewarded with a higher rate in the months they have 
no withdrawals. 

In parallel, we continue to make good progress to 
ensure digital banking with Barclays is smooth, 
easy and rewarding – including by improving the 
navigation and functionality of our app. As a 
consequence, active app customers increased 
5% year on year in 2023. Across all our channels, 
over 80% of our customer transactions are now 
digitally enabled – up from 76% in 2022. While we 
will continue to help customers recognise and 
embrace the ease and convenience of our digital 
capabilities, our focus moving forward will shift to 
improving the depth and quality of engagement 
from customers already actively using them.

To further strengthen our customer propositions we 
also launched Visa Cashback Rewards, giving Barclays 
Blue customers cash back on their everyday spending.

Our progress to improve the customer 
experience in 2023 is reflected in Barclays UK’s 
improved Net Promoter Score, which increased 
by six points versus 2022. We recognise there is 
still more to do to improve our customer 
propositions and execution, and we will remain 
focused on doing so.

Barclays UK (continued)

Our focus on making communities better 
tomorrow than they are today is reflected in our 
growing network of Barclays Eagle Labs. Our 
37 business incubators across the UK – which 
include nine new locations added in 2023 – are 
part of our ambition to be a bank where 
entrepreneurs start, scale and achieve their 
growth ambitions. In 2023 Eagle Labs supported 
over 4,500 businesses, while Barclays UK more 
broadly supported over 47,000 new start-up or 
scale-up customers – including Climate Tech 
start-ups working on innovative technology to 
deliver a more sustainable future. We were also 
entrusted by the UK Government with a £12m 
Digital Growth Grant to further support the 
growth of UK tech start-ups and scale-ups over 
the next two years. The Grant will help deliver 
20 national programmes and more than 
8,000 business interventions, including our 
Sustainability Bridge programme, to enable 
ambitious entrepreneurs. 

Another key way we support customers is through 
our focus on sustainability. This year we expanded 
and improved sustainability-related propositions for 
customers, including a new Green Barclayloan for 
Business that offers no arrangement fees for lending 
above £25,000 on a range of green assets – 
supporting our business customers in their transition 
to net zero. We also expanded our existing Asset 
2
Finance proposition via our partner Propel
, offering 
business customers fixed rates on a wider range of 
green assets, including new fully electric vehicles and 
solar photovoltaic panels.  Additionally, we extended 
our Greener Home Reward scheme, which offers a 
cash reward of up to £2,000 for eligible residential 
mortgage customers who install eligible energy-
3
efficiency-related measures in their homes.

Note:

1 In 2023 Kensington Mortgage Company won 'Best Specialist Mortgage 

Lender' at both the What Mortgage and Your Mortgage Awards. It was also 
named 'Best Intermediary Lender' at the Personal Finance Awards and 
'Best Online Mortgage Provider' at the Moneyfacts Awards.

Shared Banking Hubs 

To reflect the shift in demand away from 
traditional bank branches – and the need to 
improve efficiency for those who still require 
in-person services – Barclays has 
participated in the creation of innovative new 
Shared Banking Hubs. 

These are physical spaces, similar to a 
traditional bank branch but shared between 
customers of any high street bank. The Hubs 
consist of a counter service operated by Post 
Office colleagues, where customers can 
withdraw and deposit cash, make bill 
payments and carry out regular banking 
transactions, in addition to private spaces for 
financial conversations. 

Over 100 Hubs have been announced by 
Cash Access UK in locations across the UK, 
helping Barclays UK provide our services in a 
better and more efficient way while serving 
our communities.

Kensington Mortgages

In March 2023 Barclays bolstered its support for the UK 
mortgage market by purchasing Kensington Mortgages, the 
UK’s leading residential specialist mortgage lender. Kensington 
Mortgages brings over 25 years’ experience of providing 
innovative and flexible mortgage products, serving fast-
growing customer groups including the newly self-employed, 
contract workers, borrowers with multiple sources of income, 
and those with a weaker credit history. This acquisition 
broadens our existing mortgage product range and further 
enhances our product capabilities. 

“We are 
creating more 
opportunities 
for our 
customers to 
connect with us 
outside of the 
traditional 
branch, putting 
us at the heart 
of local 
communities."

Year in review 

In 2023 we experienced a challenging market and 
wallet environment, characterised by inflation, 
macroeconomic uncertainty and heightened 
geopolitical tensions. These conditions contributed 
to subdued primary market activity, as reflected in 
the 16% year-on- year decline in the global 
1
.
investment banking wallet

Against this backdrop, the Corporate and 
Investment Bank (CIB) delivered a 8.4% RoTE (2022: 
10.2%). Our resilient CIB performance reflects the 
benefits of our income diversification, the strength 
of our client relationships, and close collaboration 
across Investment Banking, Corporate Banking and 
Global Markets. 

In Investment Banking, we continued to deliver for 
our clients through rigorous focus, consistent 
execution and a strong solutions mindset. We 
2
ranked sixth globally in 2023
, and in the UK we 
topped the investment banking league table - in 
3
fees earned - for the first time in six years
. 
Additionally, we continue to excel in areas of 
traditional strength, such as Debt Capital Markets 
2
where we rank fifth globally
, and we are successfully 
expanding in priority areas such as Equity Capital 
Markets, where our share grew by 70bps.

Among the year's highlights, Barclays was proud 
to serve as Joint Global Coordinator and Billing & 
Delivery Agent on Arm’s IPO. Please see the 
facing case study for further information.

Arm IPO 

In 2023 Barclays helped British 
semiconductor design company Arm 
become a publicly listed company through an 
Initial Public Offering (IPO) on the Nasdaq 
stock exchange. Barclays acted as Joint 
Global Coordinator and Billing & Delivery 
Agent on the IPO. The US $5.2bn offering is 
the largest IPO to price in 2023.

This transaction demonstrates the power of 
our Investment Banking and Global Markets 
businesses working together to deliver 
outstanding outcomes for our clients. This 
resulted from focused and consistent client 
coverage from across the entirety of our 
franchise - from ECM to Global Markets - and 
with teams from across Asia, the UK, and 
the US. 

It also reflects the value in building multi-year 
relationships with top clients. Barclays has 
had a relationship with Softbank for 18 years, 
over which we have executed numerous 
transactions.

Corporate and Investment Bank (continued)

The CIB continues to play a fundamental role in 
Barclays’ commitment to invest in the transition 
to a low-carbon economy. This includes delivery 
towards the Group target to facilitate $1tn of 
Sustainable and Transition Financing by the end 
of 2030, providing green, sustainable and 
transition products and services that will support 
our clients and the global economy to accelerate 
the transition to net zero.

In addition, we continue to invest thoughtfully in 
our talent to meet client demands and deliver the 
best service. In early 2024 we announced the 
formation of a new Energy Transition Group to 
support our ambition to be a leading adviser and 
financier to clients as they transition to a low-
carbon future. 

In Corporate Banking, revenues grew off the back 
of elevated deposits income which continued to 
benefit from a strong net interest margin, and 
increased deposit balances from clients. We 
continued to make progress expanding our 
international capabilities, building out our 
Corporate Banking businesses in the US and 
Europe, alongside strengthening our digital 
capabilities globally to provide our clients with 
seamless access to our transaction banking 
product set.

We continued to grow share of wallet with our 
Global Markets top 100 clients. Income from our 
top 100 clients is up 5% year on year, despite 
lower client activity in markets across the 
industry. Additionally, client market share data for 
the first half of 2023 indicates our Global Markets 
business now ranks fifth globally (up from sixth)

Our focus remains on delivering sustainable 
through-the-cycle returns and we have the 
breadth of capabilities across Fixed Income and 
Equities, combined with a top tier Financing 
business, to deliver on this. We continued to 
make progress against some of our key strategic 
initiatives, which offset compressed financing 
spreads and a weaker environment for 
intermediation. In parallel, we continued to grow 
our financing capabilities to deliver more stable, 
higher returning income.

Over the past five years our ranking in Prime 
Services has moved up from 7 rank to joint 
5 rank, complementing our existing strength in 
Fixed Income Financing where we ranked joint

generation projects, partnered with Barclays’ investment 
banking teams to successfully raise $734m through its IPO in 
February 2023 and $662m through its first Follow-on Offering

Year in review

Consumer, Cards and Payments (CC&P) 
delivered a RoTE of 6.7% (2022: 10.0%). Our 
performance was driven by the impact of higher 
impairment charges, partially offset by 
deepening client relationships and market share 
in growth businesses, alongside continued digital 
innovation to enhance propositions and services.  

The strength of our client relationships is 
reflected in the performance of our US 
Consumer Bank (USCB), where income is up 24% 
year on year – driven by our leading position as 
1
. 
the card of choice in the travel & airlines sector
Building on the success of our partnership with 
Gap Inc., we announced a new partnership with 
Breeze Airways to issue its first consumer credit 
card programme. In addition, USCB launched a 
new partnership with Microsoft and Mastercard 
to issue Xbox’s first co-branded credit card in the 
US. USCB’s retail deposits have grown 14% year 
on year, reflecting excellent competitive 
positioning, brand strength, and the broadening 
of our partner base.  

Continued investment in and focus on, 
enhancing digital propositions played an 
important role across our specialist businesses. 
In USCB, mobile app enhancements – including 
enabling facial biometrics ID as part of app 
authentication – helped boost the Android app 
star rating to 4.7 out of 5 in 2023, up from 4 in 
2022.

Barclays PLC

Annual Report 2023 21

As further testament of improvements to our 
digital platform, our USCB Digital tNPS – a newly 
tracked metric for USCB measuring customer 
experience at the digital journey level – increased 
from 59.8 in 2022 to a full year average of 61.3 in 
2023.

In parallel, we have remained focused on 
enhancing our product capabilities. In the first 
half of 2023 we launched the new JetBlue 
programme, a complete redesign to align with 
the airlines' new loyalty programme. 
Subsequently, we were recognised by J.D. 
1
Power
 for the JetBlue Plus Card, issued by 
Barclays, which ranked the highest among co-
branded airline credit cards - demonstrating the 
value it offers customers. 

The successful integration of Private Bank and 
Wealth Management in 2023 is helping build our 
advantage in reach and specialist capability. 
Combined income for 2023 is £1.2bn, alongside 
Client Assets and Liabilities of £74.1bn and 
invested assets of £108.8bn. Alongside the 
integration there has been an ongoing focus on 
enhancing the client experience, reflected in the 
launch of the Wealth Hub to 1.2 million Premier 
customers in Barclays UK, and providing UK 
Private Bank clients with an enhanced service 
experience.

Similarly, in Barclaycard Payments we saw a 29% 
year-on-year increase in digital logins and a 
corresponding 10% reduction in customers 
using our call centres, supporting our increased 
efficiency. This momentum reflects the 
introduction of new digital features – including 
the launch of Smartpay Anywhere and Smartpay 
Fuse, enabling small business customers to take 
online payments as part of a seamless 
experience.

Xbox

Barclays US Consumer Bank further diversified its 
credit card portfolio with the launch of the Xbox 
Mastercard, Microsoft’s first co-branded card in the US.

Using research and insights, the credit card product was 
custom-built to provide the Xbox community with an 
immersive digital experience across the entire 
customer journey – from applying through  the Xbox 
console and web, to earning and redeeming their card 
rewards, and personalising their card with their 
gamertag on one of five iconic Xbox-inspired designs.

Created with customer- and client-centricity in mind, 
the card aims to heighten enjoyment for Xbox players 
while deepening their loyalty and enhancing 
engagement with one of the world’s most recognised 
brands. It is currently available for Xbox Insiders in 50 US 
states through Microsoft digital channels including 
xbox.com.

We continued to build our client portfolio, signing 
new business deals in 2023 with prominent 
brands including department store Fenwick and 
plumbing and heating specialist Wolseley. 
Barclaycard Payments and Barclays Corporate 
Banking were chosen by Fenwick to provide a 
range of banking and payment services to 
support the growth and digitisation of the 
business – testament to the breadth of our 
business services, collaboration, and digital 
capabilities. 

Consumer Bank Europe delivered a strong 
performance, growing its deposit book 206% 
year on year, driven by our continued focus on 
enhancing the customer experience. We 
launched the in-app call facility to significantly 
improve the efficiency and speed of customer 
service. We also continued to be a leading 
provider of consumer finance through our credit 
cards and personal loans business. 

Private Bank and Wealth integration

On 1 May 2023 Barclays completed the 
transfer of its UK Wealth Management & 
Investments business to sit alongside the 
Private Bank. The transition of 300,000 clients 
and 1,000 colleagues has created one of the 
largest bank-owned Private Bank and Wealth 
Management businesses in the UK. 

The combined business, Barclays Private Bank 
and Wealth Management, provides UK clients 
with access to the full spectrum of wealth and 
private banking services while opening up 
access to the broader key markets and wealth 
corridors where Barclays provides Private 
Banking in Europe, the Middle East, Asia and 
Africa.

The integration will enable us to grow our client 
relationships in the UK and further develop our 
reputation as a trusted choice for Private Bank 
clients in selected international markets.

Customers and clients

We aim to build trust and loyalty by offering innovative 
products and services with an excellent customer and 
client experience. We seek to understand our customers’ 
and clients’ expectations and aspirations, and develop 
products and services to support them – especially 
during difficult economic conditions.

Engaging with customers 
and clients 

Barclays is committed to serving our customers' 
and clients' best interests. To do so we regularly 
engage them, building our understanding of their 
evolving needs and enabling us to adapt our 
products and services accordingly. We engage in 
a wide variety of ways, including running regular 
surveys, analysing customer complaints, direct 
interaction and drawing on data from millions of 
individual transactions. 

Our engagement is most significant with respect 
to our large retail presence in the UK, where we 
offer a wide range of products and services to 
approximately 20 million customers through 
Barclays UK.

Barclays UK runs on average eight panels per 
month for Personal, Premier and Business 
customers and clients to share their views on our 
products and services, and on their own financial 
health. These panels provide regular insights to 
bring us closer to our customers, and to inform 
our design principles and the transformation of 
our customer journeys. 

As described in the Barclays UK section of this 
report on page 17, inflation has been a dominant 
theme for customers during 2023 and we have 
adapted and enhanced our products and services 
to better serve them in response. One example is 
1
our Barclays Money Worries Hub
, which was 
launched to bring together the resources and 
advice our customers told us they needed in 
challenging economic times. This is in addition to 
our specific mortgages and personal savings 
initiatives also detailed on page 244. 

More broadly, Barclays UK collected over 
1.4 million pieces of customer feedback in 2023. 

Customers told us they wanted their experiences 
with Barclays to feel more personal, as well as 
showing continued demand for increased 
convenience and functionality of the Barclays app. 
In response we have introduced new design 
principles to ensure every new or updated 
customer experience feels personalised, and 
have continued to develop the capabilities of our 
app. Our work to ensure a seamless digital 
experience for customers is one of the reasons 
we have more active digital users than any other 
2
.
UK bank

While we continue to make progress addressing 
the volume of Barclays UK customer complaints, 
we recognise there is still more work to do to 
improve the overall customer experience and 
address and remove the root causes of customer 
complaints. This focus is at the core of our new 
vision and strategy as we work towards improving 
our propositions and execution in our consumer 
businesses, in order to deliver best-in-class 
service and ensure we have highly-satisfied retail 
customers. 

Customer and client feedback in Barclays US 
Consumer Bank has recently highlighted positive 
experiences with our specialists and customer 
agents, while areas for suggested improvement 
include making it even easier for customers and 
clients to interact with us. We are using this 
feedback to help prioritise improvements, for 
example simplifying the digital customer journey 
and reducing the need to contact our call centres 
as detailed on page 242.

Consumer Duty 

The new Consumer Duty marks the beginning of a step-change in UK consumer regulation, 
requiring firms to act to deliver good outcomes for retail customers – a principle underpinning 
Barclays’ ambition of being a consistently excellent organisation delivering best-in-class service 
for customers and clients. 

We have undertaken significant work to implement the Duty across the Group, and continue to 
embed this throughout the organisation. We continue to use and enhance data and insights to 
ensure our strategy, products and services for retail customers deliver the intended outcomes, 
with a focus on meeting the needs of people with vulnerable characteristics. 

For example, drawing on data and insights from our Rainy Day Saver product, we contacted over 
1.2 million customers to advise them that alternative products may offer a better interest rate for 
balances over £5,000. 

In the Corporate and Investment Bank, reflecting 
on engagement with and feedback from our 
clients, we continued to build the expertise, 
knowledge and capabilities they are looking for. 
We strengthened partnerships across business 
lines to deliver a more integrated set of solutions 
and services to global clients, and growing client 
mindshare.
Supporting customers and clients 

Our aim at Barclays is to offer an accessible, 
empathetic and inclusive service for our 
customers, including for those who may typically 
face barriers to accessing banking services – 
such as people living with disabilities, complex 
needs or experiencing difficult life events. 

During the course of 2023 we delivered a number 
of key measures to support the financial 
resilience of our customers against a challenging 
economic backdrop, including reaching out via 
SMS to 1.4 million customers to offer a free 
conversation about cost of living-related 
financial worries. In addition, we seek to support 
vulnerable customers and provide responsible 
and inclusive banking in an extensive range of 
ways.

* In Barclays UK, the Performance Framework through its design 
and approach encapsulates the Consumer Duty and looks to 
mitigate the risk of inappropriate practices. It provides guidance 
on Performance Management to promote the right culture to 
deliver good customer outcomes, supports colleague 
development and drives sustainable commercial performance.

Fraud and scams

A key way we support the financial resilience 
of vulnerable customers is through our focus 
on fraud and scams. While overall rates of 
fraud and scams continue to rise across the 
sector, Barclays has one of the lowest scam 
rates and highest reimbursement rates in the 
industry, due to our investment in robust 
security systems and commitment to 
educating customers¹.
Our fraud detection systems can determine 
in less than a second if a payment is likely to 
be a fraudster rather than a customer, and 
we continue to invest in security features 
that protect against fraud and scams – 
including ‘App ID’, which allows customers to 
verify they are speaking to a Barclays 
colleague. We are also part of the ‘Do not 
originate’ scheme, a partnership with the 
telecommunications industry, UK Finance 
and Ofcom to prevent customer phone 
numbers from being spoofed.
Fraud can only be stopped through cross-
sector collaboration. Barclays is a founding 
member of Stop Scams UK, a group made up 
of banks, telecoms and tech firms.

How we performed

How we performed

NPS for Barclays UK has improved through 
2023 to +17. Personal Customers with Blue 
or Premier accounts feel more positive about 
their experience, although a decline in 
Business Banking NPS means rebuilding and 
deepening relationships with clients is high on 
our forward agenda. Barclaycard NPS has 
also increased through 2023.

We are striving for highly satisfied customers 
and recognise that better service is a key 
lever. However, complaint volumes increased 
during 2023, driven by specific issues 
encountered by customers and rising levels 
of fraud and scams experienced across 
industry. A rigorous plan is in place to address 
these issues and to reduce the reasons for 
customers to complain, including a focus on 
improving our propositions and execution to 
deliver best-in-class service. 

Overall, our customer digital engagement 
improved year-on-year by 190bps, excluding 
Gap Inc. customers who display lower digital 
activity. The improvement reflects the 
introduction of new and enhanced digital 
engagement features and technology 
advancements.

In 2023 we maintained our rank of sixth 
across the Investment Bank in both Global 
Markets and Investment Banking, despite 
challenging market conditions and 
suppressed dealmaking.

Engaging with colleagues

Barclays has a diverse talent pool of around 
90,000 colleagues across the world. We engage 
in regular dialogue with our colleagues to 
understand what is working well and where there 
are opportunities to improve. This includes 
townhalls, skip-level meetings, site visits, leader-
led engagement and surveys. We maintain an 
engagement approach in line with the UK's 
Financial Reporting Council (FRC) governance 
recommendations.
Our regular all-colleague Your View surveys give 
individuals the opportunity to share their views 
on how they find working at Barclays. This year’s 
survey generally shows improvement to our 
scores: Engagement increased +2ppt to 86%, 
alongside our highest scores to date for 
Wellbeing (88%) and Inclusion (83%). In addition, 
our broader Continuous Listening Strategy 
includes pulse surveys deployed throughout the 
employee lifecycle, capturing insights that help 
us improve the colleague experience. 
Maintaining a strong and effective partnership 
1
, national works councils and the 
with Unite
Barclays Group European Forum helps us gather 
feedback. We continue to consult with colleague 
representatives on major change programmes 
impacting our people, to minimise compulsory 
job losses and focus on reskilling and 
redeployment.
Achieving a consistently excellent 
standard 

As our CEO discusses in his letter, Barclays 
continues to focus on delivering to a higher 
operating standard via our Group-wide cultural 
change programme, Consistently Excellent. This 
programme challenges colleagues to address 
five key areas – Precision, Service, Focus, 
Efficiency and Diversity of thought – to establish 
a new operating standard.

This higher standard is becoming part of our 
culture and we are working hard to equip 
everyone with the right skills to achieve this, while 
rewarding progress. We have incorporated it into 
our existing Values and Mindset behaviours and 
as part of an enhanced set of leadership 
behaviours. We also began updating our key 
processes for attracting, retaining and 
developing talent, planning for succession, and 
recognising and rewarding performance.
To help create a common understanding across 
the Group, we led Consistently Excellent 
workshops throughout 2023 for our senior 
leaders. In 2024, all colleagues will be invited to 
attend these workshops. 
Progress in embedding this new operating 
standard with colleagues is reflected in the 
results from our Autumn 2023 Your View survey. 
89% of colleagues felt their peers “have a good 
understanding of what it means to be a 
consistently excellent organisation”. Further, 
62% (+2ppt) of colleagues said it was “simple and 
straightforward to get things done at Barclays”, a 
concept in line with one of our key Consistently 
Excellent focus areas, although this result shows 
there is still more to be done in making Barclays 
more efficient.
Investing in our talent 

Our talent ambition underpins Barclays’ 
approach to talent attraction, retention and 
development. We relaunched our ambition in 
2023 to focus on the skills and capabilities we 
require for the future, and set the benchmark for 
what it means to lead at Barclays through our 
refreshed leadership framework. Together, these 
set clear behavioural expectations for our 
leaders, and enable our leaders to create the 
right culture for colleagues to deliver to a 
consistently excellent standard.
Using this framework we aim to empower 
Barclays leaders to create an environment of 
psychological safety and inclusion, and to foster 
a culture of learning and curiosity where 
colleagues can thrive – supporting all colleagues 
across Barclays to grow and progress their 
careers.

Colleagues (continued)

To empower our colleagues to attain sustainable 
high performance, we continued to deliver our 
flagship leadership development programmes: 
the Enterprise Leaders’ Summit, our Strategic 
Leaders Programme, and our award-winning 
Aspire programme. 
With our Diversity, Equity and Inclusion (DEI) 
agenda in mind, we continue to attract 
candidates who possess the capabilities, critical 
skills and experience required to provide 
exceptional service to our customers and clients. 
In 2023, our graduate intake was over 36% 
female, while our undergraduate Discovery 
Diversity Programme focused on showcasing 
successful career paths for underrepresented 
minorities. These hiring programmes have 
helped drive applications from a diverse pool of 
candidates. To further promote social mobility, 
we will continue our extensive apprentice hiring 
programme through engagement with 
educational institutions.
Delivering on our Diversity, Equity 
and Inclusion plans and ambitions 

At the end of 2023, 5.1% of UK and 21% of US 
colleagues were from underrepresented 
ethnicities, surpassing our ambitions two years 
early. We are now resetting this ambition to 
achieve a further 12.5% and 5% respective 
increase in the UK and the US by the end of 2025.
To hold ourselves accountable at a senior level 
we have set a new ambition to increase the 
number of Managing Directors from 
underrepresented ethnicities by 50% – to 84 in 
the UK and US combined by the end of 2025. At 
the end of 2023 this was 55. 
We are also progressing towards our ambition of 
33% representation of women in senior 
leadership roles (Managing Directors and 
Directors) by the end of 2025. At the end of 2023 
Δ
. 
this was 30%

Maintaining our focus on wellbeing 

In our Autumn 2023 Your View survey the 
Wellbeing Index score rose to 88% favourable 
(+2ppt year on year), demonstrating our 
maintained focus on wellbeing. 
We remain committed to supporting colleague 
wellbeing using data-driven insights and 
engagement through leader-led initiatives such 
as the 'Healthy to Talk' campaign on World 
Mental Health Day. This is supplemented by 
dedicated people leader workshops exploring 
practical ways to continue to embed wellbeing 
into ways of working.
There are now over 47,500 colleagues registered 
on our Be Well wellbeing portal – the highest 
number since its launch – while our mental health 
awareness eLearning has been completed by 
84% of colleagues and 90% of people leaders.
Introducing structured hybrid working 

Following our continuous test and learn 
approach, Barclays has adapted its ways of 
working to introduce structured hybrid working – 
supporting colleagues to connect in-person and 
plan their work to make the most of both their 
time in the office and remotely.
Building connections is a vital part of our culture. 
In our Autumn 2023 Your View survey, 76% of 
colleagues told us that their team’s hybrid 
approach enables them to deliver the best 
outcomes for our colleagues, clients and 
customers. We continue to monitor colleague 
perceptions and may evolve our hybrid working 
approach further as we gather insights and 
learnings.
Our people policies

Our people policies
 help us recruit the best 
people, provide equal opportunities and create 
an inclusive culture in line with our Purpose, 
Values and Mindset, and in support of our long-
term success. They are regularly reviewed and 
updated to ensure alignment with our broader 
people strategy. 

A great place to work

We were delighted to receive a number of awards in 2023 in recognition of our efforts, including: 

• Times Graduate Employer of Choice Award – Finance category 

• LinkedIn Top UK Employer – for the third consecutive year  

• Times Top 100 Graduate Employers – Top 10 

We are committed to paying our colleagues fairly 
and appropriately relative to their role, skills, 
experience and performance. This means our 
remuneration policies reward performance in line 
with our Purpose, Values and Mindset, and our 
consistently excellent standard. We also 
encourage our colleagues to benefit from 
Barclays’ performance by enrolling in our 
employee share ownership plans.

About this KPI and why we use it

About this KPI and why we use it

Colleague engagement is derived from the 
responses to three questions in our all-
colleague Your View survey that measure 
colleague advocacy, motivation and sense of 
personal accomplishment. It enables us to 
monitor how engaged our workforce is and 
closely relates to key organisational and 
colleague outcomes such as productivity, 
wellbeing and retention.  

This metric is used to monitor our progress 
against our gender ambition of 33% females 
at Managing Director and Director level by 
the end of 2025. 

How we performed

How we performed

Colleague engagement improved +2ppt to 
86% and we saw improvements across all 
three of the questions that make up the 
engagement score.  

We saw a marginal improvement since 2022. 
While we are making gradual long-term 
progress to achieve our ambition of 33% by 
the end of 2025, we still have more to do. 

About this KPI and why we use it

This is one of the three questions making up 
our colleague engagement score, specifically 
measuring advocacy of Barclays as an 
employer. In addition to being used as part of 
our engagement score, this question can 
also be used as an 'Employee Net Promoter 
Score' and is regularly tracked in our monthly 
pulse survey.  

How we performed

Colleague advocacy improved slightly year on 
year and is +13ppt above our pre-pandemic 
score of 73% in 2019 – and +5ppt above our 
external benchmark. 

About this KPI and why we use it

This question within our Your View survey 
measures colleagues’ perception of how well 
the Barclays Values are role-modelled by 
colleagues. The Values are our moral 
compass; the fundamentals of who we are 
and what we believe is right. 

How we performed

In 2023 we saw a +2ppt improvement year on 
year, which brings us in line with the previous 
high of 94% in 2020.

Our success is judged not only by our commercial

Our policies are a lever for reducing our financed 
emissions. In 2024, we updated our Climate 
1
: 
Change Statement, to include

• No project finance, or other direct finance to 
energy companies, for upstream oil and gas 
expansion projects or related infrastructure. 

• Restrictions for new energy company clients 
engaged in expansion from January 2025. 

• Restrictions on non-diversified energy 

companies engaged in long lead expansion. 

• Additional restrictions on unconventional oil 

and gas, including Amazon and extra heavy oil.

• Requirements for energy companies to have 

2030 methane reduction targets, a 
commitment to end all routine / non-essential 
venting and flaring by 2030 and near-term net 
zero aligned Scope 1 and 2 targets from 
January 2026.

• Expectations for energy companies to 

produce relevant information in relation to 
their transition plans or decarbonisation 
strategies by January 2025. 

Climate

Barclays is committed to achieving its ambition 
to be a net zero bank by 2050. We are focused on 
reducing our financed emissions through our 
policies, targets and financing. This includes 
working with our clients as they decarbonise and 
supporting their efforts to transition the real 
economy in a manner that is just, orderly and 
provides energy security.

We have now set 2030 reduction targets for 
eight of the highest-emitting sectors in our 
portfolio: Energy, Power, Cement, Steel, 
Automotive manufacturing, Aviation, Agriculture 
and Commercial Real Estate; and assessed the 
baseline and convergence point for our UK 
Housing portfolio. This meets our commitment 
under the Net Zero Banking Alliance (NZBA) to 
set targets for material high-emitting sectors in 
our portfolio.

Moray West offshore wind farm

In 2023 Barclays provided approximately 
£100 million in loans and CPI, IRS & FX 
hedging to support Moray West offshore 
wind farm, developed by Ocean Winds. 
Once constructed, the project is expected 
to provide a secure, reliable source of 
energy to supply the equivalent of 50% of 
Scotland’s domestic electricity – the same 
as the power needs of up to 1.33 million 
homes.

Society (continued)

We understand that capital is critical for a 
successful energy transition and are focusing our 
financing to those clients actively engaged in the 
energy transition.

The scale of our business gives us the 
opportunity to help finance the energy transition 
– to use our global reach, products, expertise and 
position in the global economy to work with our 
clients, including those in the energy sector, as 
they transition to a low-carbon business model.

In 2024, we also published the Barclays Transition 
Finance Framework, outlining the criteria for 
transactions to be included towards Barclays’ 
target to facilitate $1trn of Sustainable and 
Transition Finance between 2023 and 2030. 

In 2023, we financed $67.8bn of Sustainable and 
Transition Finance, demonstrating good 
momentum towards our target of $1trn by the 
end of 2030.
+

Please see page 70 of the Climate and Sustainability report 
for further detail on our Transition Finance Framework.

In addition, Barclays’ Sustainable Impact Capital 
portfolio has a mandate to invest up to £500m of 
the Bank’s own capital in sustainability-focused 
start-ups by 2027, helping accelerate the 
transition towards a low-carbon economy. To 
date, 21 investments have been made, deploying 
over £138m since 2020. Following investment, 
companies are offered access to the Bank’s 
wider ecosystem of support – including space at 
Rise, Barclays’ FinTech hubs, where cutting-edge 
start-ups and scale-ups can connect, create and 
scale their businesses.

Communities 

Barclays is committed to building a stronger, 
more inclusive economy that is better for 
everyone. We are supporting local communities 
where we operate by enabling people to develop 
the skills and confidence they need to succeed, 
and helping businesses to grow and create jobs. 

We regularly engage with our community 
partners to help shape our strategy and deepen 
our understanding of evolving societal issues. We 
request formal quantitative and qualitative 
information from our charity partners on a 
quarterly basis and regularly seek feedback from 
the CEOs we support through our Unreasonable 
Impact programme - a partnership between 
Barclays and Unreasonable Group, detailed 
further on the following page.  

Feedback and data from our community 
partners, charity partners and the businesses we 
support helps inform and evolve our 
programmes to ensure they best meet their 
needs. 
Skills and employability 

We believe everyone deserves the financial 
independence, security and opportunity that 
comes with a job – and a vibrant, skilled workforce 
ensures local communities and businesses can 
thrive. In 2023 our programmes reached more 
than 3.27 million people around the world, 
unlocking the skills and employment 
opportunities people need to progress. 

Barclays' LifeSkills programme has been 
delivering a positive impact in UK communities 
for a decade, helping millions of people develop 
the vital employability and financial skills they 
need to succeed at work, thrive in the digital age 
and better manage their money. Through the 
next chapter of our LifeSkills programme, 
Barclays has committed to upskilling 8.7 million 
people and placing 250,000 people into work by 
the end of 2027.

In addition, Barclays’ Military and Veterans 
Outreach programme provides support to service 
personnel, veterans and their families to develop 
the skills they need to transition to civilian life, build 
careers beyond the military and grow their own 
businesses. Our Digital Eagles programme, which 
upskilled more than 622,000 people in 2023, is 
enabling people to become more confident with 
technology and stay safe online. 

LifeSkills in the UK 

Barclays is proud of the positive impact LifeSkills has made over the past 
10 years. 

With social inequalities continuing to rise, there is more to do to support 
underserved communities – which is why we are putting socio-economic 
inclusion at the heart of the LifeSkills programme to give more help to 
people who would otherwise be left behind. 

The focus of new investment is for people in the UK’s most underserved 
communities and underrepresented groups. We are working in 
partnership with respected charities, the education sector, the business 
community and Barclays' colleagues to support families, young people 
and young adults to thrive – now and in the future.

Society (continued)

We also recognise the power of sport to engage 
and strengthen communities. The Barclays 
Community Football Fund has helped more than 
2,900 community sports groups make football 
more accessible to underrepresented groups, 
reaching more than 400,000 young people.

In 2023, as Official Banking Partner of The 
Championships, Wimbledon, Barclays made the 
largest ever partner donation to the Wimbledon 
1
Foundation
 and connected Barclays LifeSkills to 
the UK Set for Success programme and the 
Barclays Net Work programme in the US. 

Using sport, and through mentoring sessions 
with inspirational athletes, both initiatives provide 
young people from underserved communities 
the opportunity to develop valuable life skills. 

The UK Set for Success programme aims to 
support 3,900 people in 30 regions across the UK 
over the next four years.
Sustainable growth 

Businesses are the engines of growth and 
innovation in communities around the world, 
pioneering solutions to support the transition to 
a more sustainable, inclusive and just future.

Barclays is well-positioned with the capabilities, 
resources and networks to support the growth of 
these businesses at each stage of the lifecycle - 
from idea to IPO - with a dynamic package of 
innovative programming, workspaces and 
investment. In 2023, more than 5,600 businesses 
were supported through our programmes³.

Through our Unreasonable Impact programme, we 
support high-growth entrepreneurs around the 
world with the network, resources and mentorship 
to address global issues and scale their businesses. 
In 2023, Barclays committed to support an 
additional 200 ventures through the programme by 
the end of 2027. More than 300 ventures have been 
supported so far, collectively raising over $11bn in 
financing and employing more than 25,000 people.

Through Eagle Labs, we are also helping 
entrepreneurs in UK communities who are just 
starting out – giving them access to mentors, office 
space and a collaborative community.
Charitable giving and investment 
in our communities 

Barclays supports employees to make a positive 
difference to the causes that matter most 
to them. In 2023, we supported more than 
4,800 colleagues around the world to fundraise and 
donate to their chosen charities - with a total of 

Female Founder Accelerator 

In 2023, through Barclays’ Eagle Labs, we launched our first 
Female Founder Accelerator, in partnership with AccelerateHER 
— supporting 40 female-led technology businesses to address 
the gender imbalance in the entrepreneur community.

In 2024, the Female Founder Accelerator is funded by the UK 
Government and will support a further 100 businesses. During the 
nine-week programme, founders work with experts from across 
the entrepreneurial landscape in a series of masterclasses, with 
the focus on developing their business propositions further.

£7.6m, including matching, given to more than 
1,700 charities. We also supported 
10,360 colleagues to donate £2m in total, with 
matching, via our UK Payroll Giving programme. 
Barclays supports communities directly by investing 
money and skills in partnerships with respected 
non-governmental organisations, charities and 
social enterprises. Our investment amounted to 
£49.3m in 2023 including charitable giving, 
management costs and monetised work hours of 
Barclays' colleagues.
Suppliers

As a global institution, we have responsibility for a 
large supply chain. We engage directly with our 
Suppliers - our Third Party Service Providers 
(TPSPs) - to promote Diversity, Equity and Inclusion 
and we are committed to trying to identify and 
seeking to address the modern slavery risks in our 
supply chain.

We work closely with our TPSPs and set out our 
expectations in our Third Party Service Provider 
Code of Conduct (TPSP CoC). The TPSP CoC 
encourages our TPSPs to adopt our approach to 
doing business and details our expectations for 
matters including environmental management, 
human rights, diversity and inclusion and also for 
living the Barclays Values.

Wimbledon  

In 2023 Barclays launched a multi-year 
partnership with the All England Lawn Tennis 
Club as the Official Banking Partner of 
Wimbledon. In our first year, to accompany 
our partnership, we delivered an international 
campaign bringing in our customers, clients, 
colleagues and communities. 

• Customers benefited from perks and 

elevated Premier giveaways.

• We showcased two of our Unreasonable 
Impact businesses. 80 Acres Farms, a 
company also supported by Barclays 
Sustainable Impact Capital, built a one-of-
a-kind vertical strawberry farm on site, while 
CLUBZERØ supported us with returnable 
packaging. Over 6,000 Wimbledon 
attendees interacted with these two 
businesses over the course of The 
Championships, providing unique 
exposure. 

• Additionally, we delivered for our 

communities with the Wimbledon 
Foundation by leveraging Barclays LifeSkills 
to expand the UK Set for Success 
programme, and launched the Barclays Net 
Work employability programme in the US'.

Engaging with investors

Through the year we maintained active 
engagement with our stakeholders across a 
number of themes, including capital strategy and 
allocation, divisional performance and the impact 
of the changing macroeconomic environment. 

This bilateral engagement has helped inform our 
Investor Update and our plans to deliver further 
value to our shareholders and stakeholders. The 
combination of our 2023 Results 
Announcement, Resegmentation document, 
and the Investor Update in February 2024 
provide further detail on our three-year plan to 
deliver higher returns, our capital allocation 
priorities and revised financial targets, as well as 
the updated divisional structure we will report 
upon from Q1 2024.

We also engaged extensively regarding our 
climate strategy, methodology, and the actions 
we have taken to build a sustainable bank. 
Alongside this, our engagement also covered 
how we have utilised the Board and senior 
management to engage with other corporates 
on governance and the control environment.  

Shareholder feedback on ESG demonstrated a 
focus on the development of our climate 
strategy and policies. In February 2024, we 
updated our Climate Change Statement, 
including our policies, targets and financing to 
reduce financed emissions.

Our 2024 AGM will be hosted in Glasgow to 
continue our wider engagement with 
shareholders.

activity in both Global Markets and Investment 
Banking, partially offset by a strong performance 
in Corporate driven by Transaction Banking.

About this KPI and why we use it

About this KPI and why we use it

CET1 ratio is a measure of the capital 
strength and resilience of Barclays, 
determined in accordance with regulatory 
requirements. The Group's capital 
management objective is to maximise 
shareholder value by prudently managing the 
level and mix of its capital. This is to ensure 
the Group is appropriately capitalised relative 
to the minimum regulatory and stressed 
capital requirements, and to support the 
Group's risk appetite, growth, and strategy 
whilst seeking to maintain a robust credit 
proposition for the Group.

The ratio expresses the Group's CET1 capital 
as a percentage of its RWAs. RWAs are a 
measure of the Group's assets adjusted for 
their respective associated risks.

RoTE measures our ability to generate 
returns for shareholders. It is calculated as 
profit after tax attributable to ordinary 
shareholders as a proportion of average 
shareholders’ equity excluding non-
controlling interests and other equity 
instruments adjusted for the deduction of 
intangible assets and goodwill. This measure 
indicates the return generated by the 
management of the business based on 
shareholders’ tangible equity.

Achieving a target RoTE demonstrates the 
organisation’s ability to execute its strategy 
and to align management’s interests with 
those of its shareholders. RoTE lies at the 
heart of the Group’s capital allocation and 
performance management process.

How we performed

How we performed

The CET1 ratio decreased to 13.8% 
(December 2022: 13.9%), within our target 
range, as RWAs increased by £6.2bn to 
£342.7bn partially offset by an increase in 
CET1 capital of £0.4bn to £47.3bn.

Statutory RoTE was 9.0% (2022: 10.4%) 
including £0.9bn of structural cost actions in 
Q423.

Excluding Q423 structural cost actions, RoTE

Notes

We view total operating expenses as a key 
strategic area for banks. Those that actively 
manage costs and control them effectively 
will gain a strong competitive advantage.

The cost: income ratio measures total 
operating expenses as a percentage of total 
income and is used to assess the productivity 
of our business operations.

How we performed

Group operating expenses increased to 
£16.9bn (2022: £16.7bn) reflecting £0.9bn of 
structural cost actions in Q423, business 
growth and investments in resilience and 
controls, partially offset by lower litigation 
and conduct charges.

The prior year included £1.0bn of litigation 
and conduct charges related to the Over-
issuance of Securities.

How we performed

The Group cost: income ratio was 67% 
(2022: 67%). Excluding Q423 structural cost 
2
actions, Group cost: income ratio was 63%
as the Group delivered positive jaws of 1%.

How the Board has 
regard to the views 
of our stakeholders

You can read more about our key 
stakeholder groups and how we listen 
and respond to them, striving to create 
sustainable value for all those we serve in 
Our Stakeholders from page 23. You can also 
read about the key activities of the Board and 
decisions taken during the year, along with 
details of the Board’s engagement with 
colleagues in Key Board Activities in 2023 
in the Board Governance report.

Overview

Throughout the year, the Board and individual 
Directors engage directly and indirectly with 
stakeholders to ensure they have a deep 
understanding of the impact of the Group’s 
operations on key stakeholders, as well as their 
interests and views. This includes meeting with 
customers and clients, colleagues, investors, 
proxy advisers, key regulators, NGOs and other 
stakeholders.

This engagement, both directly and through 
reporting by executive management, to whom the 
day-to-day operations of the business are 
delegated, seeks to ensure the Board understands 
the key issues to enable the Directors to comply 
with their legal duty under Section 172(1). 

You can find out more about how the Directors 
have had regard to the matters set out in Section 
172(1) when discharging their duties, and the 
effect of those considerations in reaching certain 
decisions below.

Embedding a standard of consistent 
excellence across Barclays

As reported in our 2022 Annual Report, towards 
the end of 2022, Barclays established a group-
wide cultural change programme led by our 
Group Chief Executive, to set a standard of 
consistent excellence, recognising that both our 
stakeholders and management want Barclays 
to perform at a consistently very high level, each 
and every day. This programme challenges 
colleagues to address five key areas – service, 
precision, focus, simplicity and diversity of 
thought – to establish a new operating standard. 

This programme is supported by our existing 
Purpose, Values and Mindset. The Board 
recognises that this cultural change programme 
is key to driving better outcomes for Barclays' 
stakeholders, including for our investors, 
customers, clients and colleagues. As such, 
oversight of this programme has been a key area 
of focus for the Board in 2023.  

In 2023, the Board received updates on the 
progress of this programme at each Board 
meeting, including the key levers necessary 
to achieve the required outcomes. 

Board members have discussed with 
management the importance of ‘tone from 
the top’, recognising the need for senior 
leadership accountability and support in order 
to drive a broader cultural shift across the 
wider colleague base. 

In accordance with the Companies Act 2006 (the Act), 
this statement sets out how the Directors have had 
regard to the matters set out in Section 172(1) of the 
Act when performing their duty to promote the success 
of the Company under Section 172. 

What a consistently excellent standard means to Barclays

We are holding ourselves to a high standard across: 

Service:

Precision: 

Focus: 

Simplicity: 

world-class 
service 
for clients 
and customers, 
every time

in our operations,
our risk 
management 
and our controls 

on businesses 
and projects 
where we 
can excel

simplicity 
and efficiency, 
seeking out every 
opportunity 
to automate

Diversity 
of thought: 

championing 
new thinking, 
and challenging 
the status quo

The Board recognises that in order to drive 
change across the organisation it is key that 
colleagues understand and believe in the aims 
of the programme and recognise their personal 
accountability for delivering the right outcomes, 
including their role in challenging processes and 
controls that can be improved or simplified. 

To support this, a high profile internal campaign 
led by the Group Executive Committee has been 
launched which recognises and celebrates the 
successes of colleagues in driving simplification, 
and risk and control improvements across the 
organisation, providing real examples which bring 
the aim of the programme to life. Throughout 
2023, a programme of events has been held for 
management level colleagues, the aim of which is 
to ensure senior colleagues understand the 
importance of the programme objectives and 
that they are supported in developing the skills 
they need to implement and embed the change 
in the organisation. 

This included Consistently Excellent workshops for 
our senior leaders, to help create a common 
understanding across the Group. In 2024, all 
colleagues will be invited to attend these workshops. 
As part of that programme, our Group Chief 
Executive interviewed Brian Gilvary, our Senior 
Independent Director, about his experiences during 
his executive career of dealing with operational 
challenges and cultural change programmes.

A key part of achieving the aims of this cultural 
change programme is driving operational 
excellence. The Board Audit Committee has 
oversight of the execution and sustainable 
embedding of the Group’s key remediation 
programmes, and received regular briefings 
throughout the year on the progress of these 
programmes, including deep dives into 
specific projects.

Section 172(1) statement (continued)

The Board recognises that a cultural and 
behavioural change programme of this nature is 
both complex and multi-year and, as such, the 
embedding and sustainability of this programme 
will continue to be an area of focus for the Board 
throughout 2024 and beyond.

A key area to achieving success in this area is 
the related work to identify lessons learned 
from these remediation programmes, and 
to embed those learnings into standard 
business practices. 

The Board has discussed with management 
the need to ensure that desired outcomes are 
measured and tracked, with regular insight being 
provided to the Board and management relating 
to improvements in customer experience, 
operational excellence, risk management, 
colleague behaviour and financial delivery.

we must be ambitious and focused...

Barclays PLC

Annual Report 2023 39

A Consumer Duty lens has been applied in the 
development of the Barclays Group-wide change 
programme, Consistently Excellent, with the 
spirit of the Consumer Duty reflected in the 
‘world-class service for clients and customers’. In 
May 2023, the Chairman, together with Mary 
Francis (as BBPLC Consumer Duty Champion) 
and the BBUKPLC Consumer Duty Champion, 
visited our contact centre in Wavertree, 
Liverpool, to experience Consumer Duty in 
action, meeting with customer-facing colleagues 
and learning about how Barclays is addressing 
vulnerable customer needs.  

In late 2023, the Board received a further 
progress report on the continuing work to 
operationalise and embed the Consumer Duty 
across the Group, the roll-out of new Consumer 
Duty management information and ongoing 
planning for the second implementation date of 
31 July 2024 for closed products. 

One continuing area of Board focus is the Group 
oversight of work to develop robust data and 
monitoring capabilities to assess customer 
outcomes and identify potential or actual risks, 
and for reporting at business, Executive and 
Board level.

Given the Group-wide significance of the 
Consumer Duty, throughout 2023, there has 
been extensive engagement by the Boards of 
BPLC, BBPLC and BBUKPLC on this subject.

The Board will continue its oversight of BBPLC 
and BBUKPLC's embedding and implementation 
of the Consumer Duty in 2024, noting that, from 
July 2024, each of the BBPLC and BBUKPLC 
Boards is required to review and approve its first 
assessment as to whether each business is 
delivering good outcomes for its retail customers 
which are consistent with the Consumer Duty.

Implementing and embedding 
the new FCA Consumer Duty

In July 2023, the Financial Conduct 
Authority's (FCA) Consumer Duty came 
into force. The Consumer Duty is a new 
outcomes-based regulation, designed 
to ensure relevant financial services firms 
deliver good outcomes for retail customers 
consistent with the three cross-cutting 
rules to (i) act in good faith, (ii) avoid 
causing foreseeable harm, and (iii) enable 
and support retail customers, and the four 
retail customers outcomes relating to: 
(i) products and services, (ii) price and value, 
(iii) consumer understanding, and (iv) 
consumer support.

The implementation of, and ongoing compliance 
with, the Consumer Duty is the responsibility 
of the operating entities within the Group, 
primarily BBPLC and BBUKPLC. However, 
given the significance of the Consumer Duty, 
the Board also provides relevant oversight of 
the Consumer Duty across the Group. In this 
respect, in February 2023, the Board approved 
changes to its Matters Reserved in order to 
reflect its responsibility for this oversight. 

Throughout the first half of 2023, the Board 
retained oversight of Barclays' planning for the 
first Consumer Duty implementation deadline of 
31 July 2023 for in-scope products and services. 
In addition to receiving its regular updates on the 
status of the Group’s implementation plans, the 
Board received a final update on the Group's 
overall compliance readiness shortly before the 
July implementation deadline. This update 
included information on work conducted to 
ensure all relevant Group frameworks align with 
the Consumer Duty rules and guidance and 
ongoing work to embed the Consumer Duty, 
including the roll-out of mandatory Consumer 
Duty training for colleagues.

Description

Climate Change 
statement

The Barclays Climate Change Statement sets out our approach based on a 
consideration of all risk and market factors to certain energy and power 
sectors with higher carbon-related exposures or emissions from 
extraction or consumption, or those which may have an impact on certain 
sensitive environments or on communities, namely thermal coal mining, 
coal-fired power generation, mountain top coal removal, upstream oil and 
gas and unconventional oil and gas including oil sands, Arctic oil and gas, 
Amazon oil and gas, hydraulic fracturing ('fracking'), ultra-deep water and 
extra heavy oil. The statement outlines Barclays' focus on supporting our 
clients to transition to a low-carbon economy, while helping to limit the 
threat that climate change poses to people and to the natural 
environment. We conduct due diligence on a case-by-case basis on clients 
in sensitive energy sectors that fall outside the restrictions set out in our 
statement.

Forestry and 
Agricultural 
Commodities 
statement

We recognise that forestry and agricultural commodities sectors are 
responsible for producing a range of agricultural commodities such as 
timber, pulp & paper, palm oil, beef and soy that are often associated with 
environmental and social impacts, including climate change, deforestation, 
biodiversity loss and human rights issues. Our Forestry and Agricultural 
Commodities Statement outlines our restrictions and due diligence 
approach for clients involved in these activities,

Barclays' human rights statement expresses our commitment to 
respecting human rights as defined in the International Bill of Human 
Rights and the International Labour Organisation’s Declaration on 
Fundamental Principles and Rights at Work. Our approach to 
respecting human rights is guided by the UN Guiding Principles on 
Business and Human Rights and the OECD Guidelines for 
Multinational Enterprises on Responsible Business Conduct. The 
statement provides an overview of the evolving framework of policies 
and processes that seek to embed these commitments across our 
business.

Barclays publishes a Modern Slavery Statement made according to 
the requirements of section 54 of the UK Modern Slavery Act 2015 
and section 14 of the Australian Modern Slavery Act 2018 (Cth). We 
recognise that the nature of our business and global footprint means 
we may be exposed to modern slavery risks across our operations, 
supply chain, and customer and client relationships. We are 
committed to trying to identify and seeking to address human rights 
risks, such as modern slavery, across our value chain. In this 
Statement we report the progress made over the course of the year 
and outline our plans for the year ahead.

Barclays' Statement on the Defence and Security Sector outlines our 
approach to defence-related transactions and relationships. We 
recognise that various types of defence equipment are considered 
necessary for achieving internationally accepted goals, such as 
legitimate national defence and security purposes as set forth in the 
Charter of the United Nations, or peacekeeping missions. At the 
same time, we also recognise that the Defence and Security Sector 
involves equipment and activities that have the potential to lead to 
significant impacts on individuals, communities and the broader 
geopolitical landscape. Barclays conducts enhanced due diligence as 
appropriate on clients in scope of the Defence and Security 
Statement.

the Governance 
report in Part 3 of the 
Annual Report.

The Barclays Way is our code of conduct which outlines the Purpose, 
Values and Mindset that govern our way of working across our 
business globally. It constitutes a reference point covering all aspects 
of colleagues’ working relationships, and provides guidance on 
working with colleagues, customers and clients, governments and 
regulators, business partners, suppliers, competitors and the broader 
community with the aim of creating the best possible working 
environment for our colleagues.

The Board Diversity and Inclusion Policy is designed to ensure that all 
Board appointments and succession plans are based on merit and 
objective criteria, recognising the benefits of diversity, in all its forms, 
and that due regard is given to diversity and inclusion characteristics 
when considering Board Committee appointments. The Policy sets 
out measurable objectives for achieving diversity on the Board, 
including the Board's current target to ensure that, by 2025, the 
proportion of women on the Board is at least 40 per cent.

• See our section on 
diversity within the 
report of the Board 
Nominations 
Committee on page 
158 of Part 3 of the 
Annual Report.

Our approach to the way we do business needs to be adopted by our 
suppliers when acting on behalf of Barclays. To ensure a common 
understanding of our approach which will help us collectively drive the 
highest standards of conduct, we have created our Third Party Code 
of Conduct, which details our expectations for Environmental 
Management, Human Rights, Diversity and Inclusion; and living the 
Barclays Values.

Barclays health, safety and wellbeing statement of commitment sets 
out the Bank’s commitment to protecting the safety and wellbeing of 
our employees, customers, suppliers, and any individuals using our 
premises, by providing and maintaining a safe working environment 
that protects both physical and mental wellbeing. The effective 
implementation of the statement of commitment has resulted in the 
continual improvement of health and safety related performance and 
proactive hazard management, as well as increasing the number of 
sites where Barclay’s occupational health and safety management 
system is independently certified to ISO45001.

Principles have been a strong addition to the way we manage tax, 
ensuring that we take into account all of our stakeholders when 
making decisions related to our tax affairs. The same applies to 
our Tax Code of Conduct which is designed to ensure we file our

The Financial Crime Policy is supported by group-wide Standards 
that focus on four key risks anti-bribery & corruption (ABC); anti-
money laundering & counter-terrorist financing (AML); anti-tax 
evasion facilitation (ATEF) and sanctions, including proliferation 
financing, and is:  

•     Designed to ensure that all employees and Barclays 

businesses globally comply with UK, extra-territorial and 
locally applicable legal and regulatory obligations,

•     Designed to create an integrated and consistent framework 

upon which Barclays manages financial crime risk,

•     Supported by the Barclays Board of Directors,

•     Approved by the Group Chief Compliance Officer (member of 

the Group Executive Committee), and

•     Regularly reviewed to ensure it remains up to date.

Barclays aims to ensure that the privacy and security of personal

Barclays carefully evaluates non-profit organisations prior to 
partnering with them to ensure they align with its values. Barclays

The Board is responsible for the overall leadership of Barclays PLC, including setting the 
Group's climate strategy. The Board and, as appropriate, its Committees are 
responsible for the oversight of climate-related risks and opportunities in the Group. 
Each Board Committee has its own Committee Terms of Reference clearly setting out 
its remit and decision-making powers, including those relating to climate matters.

risks and opportunities

Oversight and management of Barclays' climate strategy is increasingly embedded in 
business-as-usual management structures, including a number of executive 
committees.

121 - 123, 233 - 
235

The executive management committees receive regular briefings on matters including 
climate change. Both risks and opportunities are considered by management. Climate-
related risks are assessed and escalated as appropriate through the various risk forums. 
In 2023, the Group Sustainability Committee was established as a dedicated forum to 
identify and discuss climate-related matters across the Group with a specific mandate 
to review and propose updates to the Group Climate strategy prior to approval by 
Group ExCo.

term

Climate risk is defined as the impact on Financial (Credit, Market, Treasury & Capital) 
and Operational Risks arising from climate change through physical risks and risks 
associated with transitioning to a lower carbon economy. Barclays faces exposure to 
climate-related risks, either directly through its operations and infrastructure or 
indirectly through its financing and investment activities. Time horizons are considered 
based on Barclays' planning cycles.

Barclays has enhanced its focus on sustainable finance over the last two years. At the 
end of 2022, we announced a new target to facilitate $1trn of Sustainable and 
Transition Finance. This followed a review of the financing requirements arising from 
the global transition to a low-carbon economy if the world is to avoid the worst effects 
of climate change and the potential addressable market for Barclays. During 2023 we 
built on this work to develop a Group-wide sustainable finance strategy to 
operationalise our ambition.

b) We describe the impact of climate-
related risks and opportunities on the 
organisation's businesses, strategy and 
financial planning

Barclays’ 2023 financial planning process included a review of our strategy, its 
implementation and tracking our progress on climate related targets, as well as, 
capturing a view of climate-related risks and opportunities, which aligns with how we 
manage other risks.

Our planning process also considered current climate policies to ensure they are 
included in the base scenario. 

The planning process included an assessment of our financed emissions reduction 
targets for some of our highest emitting sectors.

We also considered impairment over the horizon of the financial plan. At this point in 
time, there are no material amendments required to the financial plan.

Our Sustainable and Transition Financing target of $1tn is a key driver of our finance 
planning process with pathway to achieve this as well as risks and opportunities 
reviewed and agreed with business heads.

Barclays has performed two group wide climate stress tests during 2023, over and 
above existing macroeconomic internal stress tests, to assess Barclays’ financial 
resiliency to climate risks. 

131 - 136

The two scenarios include both physical and transition risks, including assessment of a 
tipping point (H1) as well as the knock on macroeconomic impacts (H2).

Results from the exercises have been integrated into Barclays internal capital adequacy 
assessment process to ensure Barclays remains sufficiently capitalised to both climate 
and macroeconomic stresses. 

The outputs are considered within Climate Risk Management and Financial Planning 
processes, such as assessment of climate impacts to ECL.

traditional risk categories such as credit risk, market risk, treasury and capital risk , 
operational risk and reputational risk. Barclays continues to develop and enhance 
processes for identifying, assessing and managing climate-related risks and drive 
integration of climate risk into its business activities and operations.

Climate Risk is a Principal Risk under Barclays' Enterprise Risk Management Framework. 
A Climate Risk Framework, Climate Risk Policy and relevant governance structures 
have been developed to foster a systematic and consistent approach for managing 
climate risk across the firm. Barclays has also established a climate risk appetite at the 
Group-level.

In line with our three-part climate strategy, we have set financed emissions 2030

this year of targets for the Aviation, Agriculture and UK Commercial Real Estate 
sectors).

c) Our targets used to manage climate-
related risks and opportunities and 
performance against targets

We have also expanded the scope of our UK Housing convergence point this year, as 
detailed on page	98. Each of our 2030 target ranges is developed with reference to a 
1.5°C-aligned scenario, such as the IEA Net Zero by 2050 scenario. We have reported 
our progress against each of these targets as at December 2023, as detailed on page 
86.

We have additionally calculated the financed emissions for the full in-scope balance 
sheet as at December 2022. This has enabled us to calculate the coverage of our 
reduction targets across our portfolio (including integration of 1.5 degree aligned 
scenarios, with ranges for certain sectors) and to assess the extent to which the 
business is aligned to a well-below 2 degrees pathway. Our calculations indicate that we 
have set reduction targets for 55% of our overall Scope1,2 financed emissions.

We also note our progress against our sustainable and transition financing between 
2023 and the end of 2030, our green financing between 2018-2030, and our balance 
sheet investment by the end of 2027.

We measure our Scope 1, Scope 2 and Scope 3 emissions and report these against 
our net zero operations strategy, as set out on pages 73-79. 

75, 88

On our financed emissions, we have:

i. Estimated the full in-scope balance sheet financed emissions as at December 2022 
using a methodology developed based on the PCAF Standard as set out on pages 
80-83; and 

ii. Calculated financed emissions and physical intensities for specific activities as at 
December 2023 where we have set 2030 targets which include the integration of 
1.5°C aligned scenarios, such as the IEA Net Zero 2050 scenario in our financed 
emission targets, and including the upper end of ranges for certain sectors, as set 
out on page 89

Alignment of our client portfolios to the goals and timelines of the Paris Agreement 
underpinned by Barclays' BlueTrack™ Methodology. Progress reported against the 
following sector targets: Energy, Power, Cement, Steel, Automotive Manufacturing and 
UK Housing (where we have set a convergence point). Targets have also been set in 
2023 for the first time against the following sectors: UK Commercial Real Estate, 
Agriculture, and Aviation.

Progress against our target to facilitate $1 trillion of Sustainable and Transition Finance 
between 2023 and the end of 2030.

We have considered our obligations under the UK's 
Financial Conduct Authority's Listing Rules and 
confirm that we have made disclosures consistent 
with the relevant Listing Rules and the Taskforce for 
Climate-related Financial Disclosures (TCFD) 
Recommendations and Recommended 
Disclosures.

Given the similarities between the TCFD 
Recommended Disclosures and the new climate-
related financial disclosures (required further to 
sections 414CA and 414CB of the Companies Act 
2006), and in order to avoid unnecessary duplication 
and deliver concise reporting, we have chosen to 
present information relating to the TCFD 
recommended disclosures alongside the relevant 
Companies Act 2006 requirements. 

For further information on where these 
disclosures can be found please refer to pages 
44 to 47 of this report.  

Looking ahead: TCFD sector specific 
requirements for asset managers

We continue our work to implement the TCFD 
sector specific guidance for asset managers 
(which represents a small part of our overall 
business) in accordance with the FCA Enhanced 
Climate-Related Disclosure Requirements for 
Asset Managers. We will report on this work 
during 2024, recognising the industry-wide 
challenge with data availability and accuracy to 
meet these requirements.

ESG Ratings and Benchmarks

ESG ratings performance
We remain committed to enhancing our disclosures and 
to engaging with industry-led initiatives intended to 
support an effective and trusted ESG ratings market.

In 2023, Barclays continued engaging with key 
ESG ratings agencies to provide clear and 
consistent disclosures to our stakeholders.

Five of the ratings we track were unchanged, two 
declined, and three improved.

The ESG ratings market is moving towards a 
more regulated environment in the EU. Here in 
the UK, an industry-led working group launched a 
Code of Conduct for ESG ratings and data 
product providers. Barclays supports the Code's 
principles of transparency, good governance, 
management of conflicts of interest, and robust 
controls.

Managing risk

Barclays PLC

Annual Report 2023 51

Prudently managing risk 
for stakeholders

Barclays is exposed to internal and external risks as part 
of its ongoing activities. These risks are managed as 
part of our business model.

Risk appetite

Three lines of defence

Monitoring the risk profile

Enterprise Risk Management 
Framework (ERMF)

At Barclays, risks are identified and overseen in 
accordance with the ERMF, which supports the 
business in its aim to embed effective risk 
management and a strong risk management 
culture.

The ERMF governs the way in which Barclays 
identifies and manages its risks.

The management of risk is then embedded into 
each level of the business, with all colleagues being 
responsible for identifying and controlling risk.

In 2023, the Conduct Risk Principal Risk was 
renamed "Compliance Risk" and now 
incorporates Conduct Risk as well as risks from a 
failure to comply with laws, rules and regulations 
applicable to the firm.

Risk appetite defines the level of risk we are 
prepared to accept across the different risk 
types, taking into consideration varying levels of 
financial and operational stress. Risk appetite is 
key to our decision-making processes, including 
ongoing business planning and setting of 
strategy, new product approvals and business 
change initiatives.

The Group sets its risk appetite in terms of 
performance metrics as well as a set of mandate 
and scale limits to monitor risks (i.e. to ensure 
business activities are aligned with expectations 
and are of an appropriate scale relative to the risk 
and reward of the underlying activities). During 
2023, the Group’s performance remained within 
its risk appetite limits.

“The ERMF governs the way in which Barclays 
identifies and manages its risks.”

The first line of defence is comprised of the 
revenue-generating and client-facing areas, 
along with all associated support functions, 
including Finance, Treasury, Human Resources 
and Operations and Technology. The first line 
identifies the risks, sets the controls and 
escalates risk events to the second line of 
defence. Employees in the first line have primary 
responsibility for their risks and their activities are 
subject to oversight from the relevant parts of 
the second and third lines.

The second line of defence is made up of Risk 
and Compliance and oversees the first line by 
setting limits, rules and constraints on their 
operations, consistent with the risk appetite. The 
third line of defence is comprised of Internal 
Audit, providing independent assurance to the 
Board and Executive Committee on the 
effectiveness of governance, risk management 
and control over current, systemic and evolving 
risks.

The Legal function provides support to all areas 
of the business and is not formally part of any of 
the three lines of defence, The Legal function is 
responsible for proactively identifying, 
communicating and providing legal advice on 
applicable laws, rules and regulations. Except in 
relation to the legal advice it provides or 
procures, it is subject to second line oversight 
with respect to its own operational and 
compliance risks, as well as with respect to the 
legal risks to which the Group is exposed.

Together with a strong governance process, 
using business and Group-level Risk Committees 
as well as Board-level forums, the Board receives 
regular information in respect of the risk profile of 
the Group, and has ultimate responsibility for 
Group risk appetite and capital plans. Information 
received includes measures of risk profile against 
risk appetite as well as the identification of new 
and emerging risks, which are derived by 
mapping risk drivers, identified through horizon 
scanning, to risk themes, and similar analysis.

During 2023, Barclays ran a stress test to assess 
its capital adequacy and resilience under a severe 
but plausible macroeconomic scenario. This 
stress test targeted risks such as inflation, 
financial stress and a shock on demand; with 
terminal low rates set to test the Group's 
vulnerabilities through Net Interest Income (NII) 
margin compression. The stress test outcome 
for macroeconomic tests assesses our full 
financial performance over the horizon of the 
scenario in terms of profitability, capital, liquidity 
and leverage to ensure the Group remains viable.
+

For further details of the stress test, 
please refer to page 55.

We believe that our structure and governance 
supports us in managing risk in the changing 
economic, political and market environments.
For further detailed analysis of approach to risk
+
management and risk performance, please see our full Risk
review on pages 254 to 372 of Part 3 of the Annual Report

Managing risk (continued)

The Enterprise Risk Management Framework defines nine Principal Risks

Principal Risks

Risks are classified into Principal Risks, as below

How risks are managed

Credit risk

Market risk

Treasury and 
Capital risk

The risk of loss to the Group from the failure of clients, customers or counterparties 
(including sovereigns), to fully honour their obligations to the Group, including the whole 
and timely payment of principal, interest, collateral and other receivables.

Credit Risk teams identify, evaluate, sanction, limit and monitor various forms of credit exposure, individually and 
in aggregate. The First Line delivers business plans and products within risk appetite and all limits set by the 
Second Line, by maintaining detailed financial forecasts, applying controls and managing risks to which they are 
exposed. 

The risk of loss arising from potential adverse changes in the value of the Group’s assets 
and liabilities from fluctuation in market variables including, but not limited to, interest rates, 
foreign exchange, equity prices, commodity prices, credit spreads, implied volatilities and 
asset correlations.

Liquidity risk

The risk that the Group is unable to meet its contractual or contingent obligations or that it 
does not have the appropriate amount, tenor and composition of funding and liquidity to 
support its assets.
Capital risk

The risk that the Group has an insufficient level or composition of capital to support its 
normal business activities and to meet its regulatory capital requirements under normal 
operating environments and stressed conditions (both actual and as defined for internal 
planning or regulatory testing purposes). This also includes the risk from the Group’s 
pension plans.
Interest rate risk in the banking book

The risk that the Group is exposed to capital or income volatility because of a mismatch 
between the interest rate exposures of its (non-traded) assets and liabilities.

Market Risk teams use a range of complementary approaches to identify and evaluate traded market risk 
exposures. These risks are measured, limited and monitored by market risk specialists. The First Line conduct 
trading activities within the risk appetite and all mandate & scale limits set by the Second Line.

Treasury and Capital risk is identified and managed by specialists in capital, liquidity and asset and liability 
management teams. A range of risk management approaches are used such as limits plan monitoring and stress 
testing.

Climate risk

The impact on Financial and Operational risks arising from climate change through physical 
risks, risks associated with transitioning to a low-carbon economy and connected risks 
1
arising as a result of second order impacts on portfolios of these two drivers.

The Group assesses and manages its climate risk across its businesses and functions in line with its net zero 
ambition by monitoring exposure to elevated risk sectors, conducting scenario analysis and risk assessments for 
key portfolios. The First Line delivers business plans and manages exposures within the climate risk appetite and  
limits set by the Second Line. Climate risk controls are embedded across the financial and operational principal 
risk types through the Barclays Group's frameworks, policies and standards.

Note:

1 Definition of climate risk amended as part of the update climate risk policy in 2023. See page 67 for further detail.

Managing risk (continued)

The Enterprise Risk Management Framework defines nine Principal Risks

Principal Risks

Risks are classified into Principal Risks, as below

How risks are managed

Operational risk

The risk of loss to the Group from inadequate or failed processes or systems, human 
factors or due to external events (for example, fraud) where the root cause is not due to 
credit or market risks.

Model risk

The potential for adverse consequences from decisions based on incorrect or misused 
model outputs and reports.

Compliance risk

The risk of poor outcomes for, or harm to, customers, clients and markets, arising from the 
delivery of the Group’s products and services (also known as 'Conduct risk') and the risk to 
Barclays, its clients, customers or markets from a failure to comply with the laws, rules and 
regulations applicable to the Group (also known as Laws, Rules and Regulations Risk, 'LRR 
Risk').

Reputation risk

The risk that an action, transaction, investment, event, decision, or business relationship 
will reduce trust in the Group’s integrity and/or competence.

Operational risks are managed in accordance with the Operational Risk Framework, owned and overseen by the 
Second Line, and the standards within the Barclays Control Framework. The primary responsibility for the 
management of operational risk rests within the business and functional units where the risk arises. Management 
complete Risk and Control Self-Assessments to assess operational risks and the effectiveness of the controls 
within processes. Identified risks, events and issues are escalated to senior management and the Board to 
ensure timely notification and to agree the appropriate response. 

The range of controls owned by First Line include: timely model identification, robust model development, 
testing, documentation, annual assessment, and ongoing performance monitoring. The range of controls owned 
by Second Line include: independent model validation, oversight over on-going model performance, and 
execution of overall model risk governance covering oversight and reporting and escalation to appropriate 
forums and committees.

The First Line are accountable for the overall assessment and management of compliance risks in their business 
or function and are responsible for implementing the requirements outlined in the Compliance Risk Management 
Framework (CRMF). 

Compliance must oversee adherence to the CRMF and the management of compliance risk, and provide 
independent Second Line of Defence oversight to all Barclays businesses, providing advice and challenge where 
appropriate.

Reputation risk is managed by embedding our Purpose and Values, and maintaining a controlled culture within the 
Group, with the objective of acting with integrity, enabling strong and trusted relationships to be built with 
customers and clients, colleagues and broader society. Each business assesses reputation risk using 
standardised tools and the governance is fulfilled through management committees and forums, clear escalation 
and reporting lines to the Group Board.

Legal risk

The risk of loss or imposition of penalties, damages or fines from the failure of the Group to 
meet applicable laws, rules and regulations or contractual requirements or to assert or 
defend its intellectual property rights. 

Legal risk is managed by the identification and management of legal risks by the legal function and the escalation 
of legal risk as necessary. The Group’s businesses and functions have responsibility for engagement of the Legal 
function in situations that have the potential for legal risk,

Viability statement

Consideration 
of the long-term viability 
of Barclays

Barclays PLC

Annual Report 2023 54

The financial statements and accounts 
have been prepared on a going concern basis.

Provision 31 of the 2018 UK Corporate 
Governance Code requires the Directors to 
make a statement in the Annual Report regarding 
the viability of the Group, including an explanation 
of how they assessed the prospects of the 
Group, the period of time for which they have 
made the assessment and why they consider 
that period to be appropriate.
Time horizon

In light of the analysis summarised below, the 
Board has assessed the Group’s current viability, 
and confirms that the Directors have a 
reasonable expectation that the Group will be 
able to continue in operation and meet its 
liabilities as they fall due over the next three 
years. This time frame is used in management’s 
Working Capital and Viability Report (WCR), 
prepared at the start of February 2024. The WCR 
is a formal projection of capital and liquidity based 
upon formal profitability forecasts. The 
availability of the WCR gives management and 
the Board sufficient visibility and confidence on 
the future operating environment for this time 
period.

The three-year time frame has also been chosen 
because:
▪

it is within the period covered by the formal 
medium-term plans approved by the Board 
which contain projections of profitability, cash 
flows, capital requirements and capital 
resources

▪

it is also within the period over which internal 
stress testing is carried out

▪

it is an appropriate horizon over which to 
consider the impacts of new regulations in the 
financial services industry. 

The Directors are satisfied that this period is 
sufficient to enable a reasonable assessment of 
viability to be made.
Considerations

In making its assessment the Board has:
▪ carried out a robust and detailed assessment 
of the Group’s risk profile and material existing 
and emerging risks (see below for further 
details), in particular those risks which senior 
management believes could cause the 
Group’s future results of operations or 
financial condition to differ materially from 
current expectations or could adversely 
impact the Group’s ability to meet its material 
regulatory requirements

▪

reviewed how those risks are identified, 
managed and controlled (further detail 
provided on pages 51 to 53)

▪ considered the WCR which provides an 

assessment of forecast CET1, leverage, Tier 1 
and total capital ratios, as well as the build-up 
of minimum requirement for own funds and 
eligible liabilities (MREL) up to the end of 2025

▪ considered the Group’s Medium Term Plan
▪
reviewed the Group’s liquidity and funding 
profile, including forecasts of the Group’s 
Internal Liquidity Stress Test (ILST), regulatory 
Liquidity Coverage Ratios (LCR) and Net 
Stable Funding Ratios (NSFR)

▪ considered the Group’s viability under a 

specific internal stress scenario (see below for 
further detail)

▪ considered the stability of the major markets in 
which it operates, supply chain resilience and 
material known regulatory changes to be 
enacted

▪ considered the sustainability of any future 

capital distributions

▪ considered scenarios which might affect the 

operational resilience of the Group

▪ considered factors that may inform the impact 
of a severe recession in major economies with 
affordability pressures on consumers from 
high inflation and rising interest rates, energy 
supply pressures, and financial markets 
instability

▪ considered the impact of the Group’s ambition 
to be a net zero bank by 2050 and support its 
clients’ transition to a low-carbon economy, 
including the need to continue to incorporate 
climate considerations into its strategy, 
business model, the products and services it 
provides to customers and its financial and 
non-financial risk management processes

▪

▪

reviewed the draft statutory accounts and the 
financial performance of the Group

reviewed the possible impact of legal, 
competition and regulatory matters set out in 
Note 25 to the financial statements on pages 
470 to 474.

The Group's Medium Term Plan is based on 
assumptions for macroeconomic variables such 
as interest rates, inflation, unemployment, which 
have been consistently applied for the purpose 
of forecasting the Group’s capital and liquidity 
position and ratios, as well as any credit 
impairment charges or releases.
Assessment of the Group's risk profile

Risks faced by the Group’s business, including in 
respect of financial, conduct and operational 
risks, are controlled and managed within the 
Group in line with the ERMF. Executive 
management sets a risk appetite for the Group, 
which is then approved by the Board. Limits are 
set to control risk appetite, within which 
businesses are required to operate.

Management and the Board then oversee the 
ongoing risk profile. Internal Audit provides 
independent assurance to the Board and 
Executive Committee over the effectiveness of 
governance, risk management and control over 
current and evolving risks.

A full set of material risks to which the 
organisation is exposed can be found in the 
material existing and emerging risks on pages 
258 to 271 .

Certain risks are additionally identified as key 
themes and monitored closely by the Board and 
Board Committees. These are chosen on the 
basis of their potential to impact viability during 
the time frame of the assessment but in some 
instances the risks may continue beyond this 
time frame.

Barclays PLC

Annual Report 2023 55

The results of the macroeconomic internal 
stress test were approved by the Board Risk 
Committee and allowed the Board to approve 
the Medium Term Plan as being able to sustain a 
severe but plausible scenario and remain within 
risk appetite.

Based on current forecasts, taking account of 
material known regulatory changes to be 
enacted and having considered possible stress 
scenarios, the current liquidity and capital 
position of the Group continues to support the 
Board’s assessment of the Group’s viability.

Viability statement (continued)

These particular risks include:
▪

the potential impact of increased recession 
risk heightened by the turbulent geopolitical 
outlook and volatile market conditions 

▪

▪

failure to successfully adapt the Group’s 
operations and business strategy to address 
the financial risks resulting from both: (i) the 
physical risk of climate change; and (ii) the risk 
from the transition to a low-carbon economy

legal proceedings, competition, regulatory and 
conduct matters giving rise to the potential 
risk of penalties, damages or fines, loss of 
regulatory licences and permissions and other 
sanctions, as well as potential adverse impacts 
on our reputation with clients and customers 
and on investor confidence and/or potentially 
resulting in adverse impacts on capital, liquidity 
and funding 

▪ sudden shocks or geopolitical instability in any 
of the major economies in which the Group 
operates which could alter the behaviour of 
depositors and other counterparties, affect 
the ability of the firm to maintain appropriate 
capital and liquidity ratios or impact the 
Group's credit ratings

▪ evolving operational risks (notably cyber 

security, technology and resilience) and the 
ability to respond to the new and emerging 
technologies in a controlled fashion.

As a universal bank with a diversified and 
connected portfolio of businesses, servicing 
customers and clients globally, the Group is 
impacted in the longer term by a wide range of 
macroeconomic, political, regulatory and 
accounting, technological, social and 
environmental developments. The evolving 
operating environment presents opportunities 
and risks in respect of which the Group continues 
to evaluate and take steps to appropriately adapt 
its strategy and its delivery.

Stress tests

The Board has also considered the Group’s 
viability under a specific internal stress scenario. 

The latest macroeconomic internal stress test, 
conducted in H2 2023, targets risks such as 
inflation, financial stress and a shock on demand; 
with terminal low rates set to test Barclays’ 
vulnerabilities through NII margin compression:

• severe UK recession (GDP low point -4.5%) 

brought by falling household real incomes, job 
losses leading to 8.3% unemployment rate, 
declining economic confidence and tight 
financial conditions. Other major economies 
experience very similar shocks

• high interest rates (peak 8.5% UK, 8.5% US) 
lead to additional stress in banking and non-
banking sectors. As financial conditions 
tighten, central banks rapidly reverse policy 
and low interest rates persist (1% UK, 1.5% 
US) to stimulate the economy and avoid an 
even worse outcome

• inflation, after a short-term spike (UK 10.4%, 

US 8.1%), begins to reduce towards the end of 
2025 gradually falling to 2% in the outer year 
forecast horizon. The short-term affordability 
pressures on customers ease as interest rates 
and inflation falls

• residential house prices in the UK decline 33% 
while in the US commercial real estate prices 
fall 45%, reflecting the contagion effects from 
the financial markets.

The stress test outcome for macroeconomic 
tests assesses our full financial performance 
over the horizon of the scenario in terms of 
profitability, capital, liquidity and leverage to 
ensure we remain viable.

In addition to a macroeconomic internal stress 
test, a climate internal stress test was run this 
year and presented to the Board Risk Committee 
for approval. See page 176. The exercise 
confirmed the Bank is financially resilient to 
climate risks. Refer to the 'scenario analysis' 
section in page 131 for the key learnings from 
the climate internal stress test.

The Group-wide stress testing framework also 
includes internal reverse stress testing 
assessments, conducted once a year, which aim 
to identify the circumstances under which the 
Group’s business model would no longer be 
viable, leading to a significant change in business 
strategy and to the identification of appropriate 
mitigating actions. Examples include extreme 
macroeconomic downturn (‘severely adverse’) 
scenarios, or specific one-off events, covering 
both operational risk and capital/liquidity items. 
Reverse stress testing is used to help support 
ongoing risk management and is an input to the 
Group’s recovery planning process.

Legal proceedings, competition, regulatory and 
remediation/redress conduct matters are also 
assessed as part of the stress testing process. 
Capital and the ILST are set at a level designed to 
enable the Group to withstand various stress 
scenarios. As part of this process, management 
also identified actions, including cost reductions 
and withdrawal from lines of business, available to 
restore the Group to its desired capital flight 
path. These internal stress tests informed the 
conclusions of the WCR.

Important Information

Forward looking statements

This document contains certain forward-looking 
statements within the meaning of Section 21E of 
the US Securities Exchange Act of 1934, as 
amended, and Section 27A of the US Securities 
Act of 1933, as amended, with respect to the 
Group. Barclays cautions readers that no 
forward-looking statement is a guarantee of 
future performance and that actual results or 
other financial condition or performance 
measures could differ materially from those 
contained in the forward-looking statements. 
Forward-looking statements can be identified by 
the fact that they do not relate only to historical 
or current facts. Forward-looking statements 
sometimes use words such as ‘may’, ‘will’, ‘seek’, 
‘continue’, ‘aim’, ‘anticipate’, ‘target’, ‘projected’, 
‘expect’, ‘estimate’, ‘intend’, ‘plan’, ‘goal’, ‘believe’, 
‘achieve’ or other words of similar meaning. 
Forward-looking statements can be made in 
writing but also may be made verbally by 
directors, officers and employees of the Group 
(including during management presentations) in 
connection with this document. Examples of 
forward-looking statements include, among 
others, statements or guidance regarding or 
relating to the Group’s future financial position, 
business strategy, income levels, costs, assets 
and liabilities, impairment charges, provisions, 
capital leverage and other regulatory ratios, 
capital distributions (including policy on dividends 
and share buybacks), return on tangible equity, 
projected levels of growth in banking and financial 
markets, industry trends, any commitments and 
targets (including environmental, social and 
governance (ESG) commitments and targets), 
plans and objectives for future operations and 
other statements that are not historical or 
current facts. By their nature, forward-looking 
statements involve risk and uncertainty because 
they relate to future events and circumstances. 
Forward-looking statements speak only as at the 
date on which they are made. Forward-looking 

statements may be affected by a number of 
factors, including, without limitation: changes in 
legislation, regulations, governmental and 
regulatory policies, expectations and actions, 
voluntary codes of practices and the 
interpretation thereof, changes in International 
Financial Reporting Standards and other 
accounting standards, including practices with 
regard to the interpretation and application 
thereof and emerging and developing ESG 
reporting standards; the outcome of current and 
future legal proceedings and regulatory 
investigations; the Group’s ability along with 
governments and other stakeholders to 
measure, manage and mitigate the impacts of 
climate change effectively; environmental, social 
and geopolitical risks and incidents, pandemics 
and similar events beyond the Group’s control; 
the impact of competition in the banking and 
financial services industry; capital, liquidity, 
leverage and other regulatory rules and 
requirements applicable to past, current and 
future periods; UK, US, Eurozone and global 
macroeconomic and business conditions, 
including inflation; volatility in credit and capital 
markets; market related risks such as changes in 
interest rates and foreign exchange rates; 
reforms to benchmark interest rates and indices; 
higher or lower asset valuations; changes in 
credit ratings of any entity within the Group or 
any securities issued by it; changes in 
counterparty risk; changes in consumer 
behaviour; the direct and indirect consequences 
of the conflicts in Ukraine and the Middle East on 
European and global macroeconomic conditions, 
political stability and financial markets; political 
elections; developments in the UK’s relationship 
with the European Union (EU); the risk of 
cyberattacks, information or security breaches, 
technology failures or other operational 
disruptions and any subsequent impacts on the 
Group’s reputation, business or operations; the 
Group’s ability to access funding; and the 
success of acquisitions, disposals and other 

strategic transactions. A number of these 
factors are beyond the Group’s control. As a 
result, the Group’s actual financial position, 
results, financial and non-financial metrics or 
performance measures or its ability to meet 
commitments and targets may differ materially 
from the statements or guidance set forth in the 
Group’s forward-looking statements. In setting 
its targets and outlook for the period 2024-2026, 
Barclays has made certain assumptions about 
the macro-economic environment, including, 
without limitation, inflation, interest and 
unemployment rates, the different markets and 
competitive conditions in which Barclays 
operates, and its ability to grow certain 
businesses and achieve costs savings and other 
structural actions. Additional risks and factors 
which may impact the Group’s future financial 
condition and performance are identified in the 
description of material existing and emerging 
risks beginning on page 258 of this Annual 
Report.

Subject to Barclays PLC’s obligations under the 
applicable laws and regulations of any relevant 
jurisdiction (including, without limitation, the UK 
and the US) in relation to disclosure and ongoing 
information, we undertake no obligation to 
update publicly or revise any forward-looking 
statements, whether as a result of new 
information, future events or otherwise.

Financing 
the transition

Barclays is working to 
reduce its Scope 1, Scope

emissions consistent with 
a 1.5°C aligned pathway, 
and counterbalance any 
residual emissions.

Barclays is committed to 
aligning its financing with 
the goals and timelines of 
the Paris Agreement, 
consistent with limiting 
the increase in global 
temperatures to 1.5°C.

Barclays is helping to 
provide the green and 
sustainable finance 
required to transform the 
economies, customers 
and clients we serve.

Our strategy is underpinned by the way we assess and 
manage our exposure to climate-related risk

Barclays PLC

Annual Report 2023 60

Our climate strategy is driven by consideration of relevant 
risks and opportunities and in alignment with our Purpose: 
working together for a better financial future for our 
customers, clients and communities. 

We have a clear shareholder endorsed climate 
strategy to achieve our ambition of being a net zero 
bank by 2050, by achieving net zero operations, 
reducing our financed emissions and financing the 
transition.

We are committed to achieving net zero operations 
and have continued to make progress, achieving a 
Δ
51%
 reduction of Scope 1 and 2 location-based 
greenhouse gas emissions milestone ahead of 
Δ
schedule. We continued to source 100%
renewable electricity for our global real estate 
portfolio and met our 90% Scope 1 and 2 market-
based emissions reduction target – reducing these 
Δ
.
emissions by 93%

We are also committed to reducing our financed 
emissions, those deriving from the activities of the 
clients that we finance and those generated in their 
respective value chains, by providing financial advice 
and support as they transition to a low-carbon 
economy.

We have now set 2030 emissions reduction targets 
for eight of the highest-emitting sectors in our 
portfolio: Energy, Power, Cement, Steel, 
Automotive manufacturing, Aviation, Agriculture 
and Commercial Real Estate; and have assessed 
the baseline and convergence point for our UK 
Housing portfolio. This meets our commitment 
under the NZBA to set targets for material high-
emitting sectors in our portfolio.

Our 2030 target-setting includes the integration of 
o
1.5
C aligned scenarios, such as the IEA Net Zero 
2050 scenario, in our financed emission targets, 
and includes ranges for certain sectors to reflect 

dependencies outside our control that will 
determine how quickly our financed emissions can 
be reduced in these sectors.

This year, we have further extended the scope of 
our calculations to cover the full in-scope balance 
sheet financed emissions, largely aligned to the 
PCAF Standard. We used our methodology for 
measuring our financed emissions and tracking 
them at a portfolio level against the goals and 
timelines of the Paris Agreement – this 
methodology is called BlueTrack™.

Capital is critical for a successful energy transition 
and we are focusing our financing to those clients 
actively engaged in the energy transition.

The scale of our business gives us the opportunity 
to help finance the energy transition – to use our 
global reach, products, expertise and position in the 
global economy to work with our clients, including 
those in the Energy sector, as they transition to a 
low-carbon business model.

To reduce reliance on fossil fuels the world needs to 
accelerate and scale the supply and capacity of 
renewables and climate tech solutions that will help 
to decarbonise high-emitting activities. The Climate 
Policy Initiative estimates that this requires at least 
1
$4.3trillion of climate finance a year by 2030
.

Barclays’ climate strategy (continued)

Barclays is committed to help finance the energy 
transition, In 2022 we set a target to facilitate $1trn 
of Sustainable and Transition Financing between 
2023 and the end of 2030.

Δ
 of 
During 2023, we facilitated $67.8bn
sustainable and transition financing. $67.4bn was 
Δ
sustainable financing and $0.4bn
 was transition 
financing that qualified against our new 
Transition Finance Framework.

We are also focused on investing and scaling the 
climate tech – hydrogen, carbon capture, 
batteries, amongst others – needed by society 
and our clients to transition, generate economic 
growth and create a new wave of green jobs. To 
support this, we have a mandate to invest up to 
£500m of Barclays’ own capital by the end of 
2027 and we have invested £138m into 21 
innovative companies to date.

An important lever for reducing our financed 
emissions is our policy. In February 2024, we 
updated our Climate Change Statement with 
new restrictions on financing upstream oil and 
gas, including unconventional oil and gas and 
additional Enhanced Due Diligence (EDD) 
requirements for biomass.

Fossil fuels are still required for many essential 
activities – including electricity generation, 
transport and heating. In the International Energy 
Agency NZE scenario, new long lead time 
upstream oil and gas projects are not required on 
a 1.5°C-aligned pathway. For current and future 
(declining) global demand to be satisfied, 
investment is needed to support existing assets, 
2
while clean energy is scaled
. Barclays 
understands the critical importance of energy 
being secure, reliable and affordable for our 
customers and clients.

Barclays will continue to support an energy 
sector in transition, focusing on the diversified 
energy companies investing in low carbon and 
with greater scrutiny on those engaged in 
developing new oil and gas projects.

The trajectory for our clients’ transition to a low-
carbon economy is influenced by a number of 
external factors, including market developments, 
technological advancement, the public policy 
environment, geopolitical developments and 
regional variations, behavioural change in society 
and the scale of change needed to adapt their 
business models. Client transition pathways will 
vary, even within the same sectors and 
geographies.

Many highly carbon-intensive sectors require 
finance to transition to a low carbon economy. 
Restricting the flow of capital to these sectors 
could be harmful to the pace of the transition, 
limiting the real terms impact on global warming. 
The energy companies unable or unwilling to 
reduce their emissions or play a role in the energy 
transition may find it increasingly difficult to 
access financing from Barclays.

We are committed to continuing the work we 
began in 2020. Our climate strategy will continue 
to evolve and adapt in light of the rapidly 
changing environment and the need to support 
governments and clients, in our efforts to meet 
our ambition of being a net zero bank by 2050.

Collaborating with the Transition Plan Taskforce

The Transition Plan Taskforce (TPT) was launched by HM Treasury in March 2022 with a mandate 
to bring together leaders from industry, academia, and regulators to develop good practice for 
transition plan disclosures for the finance sector and the real economy. Barclays participated in a 
number of working groups for the TPT, including inputting into the Banks Sector Guidance – which 
adds further depth and detail for preparers of transition plans operating in the banking sector. 
Barclays contributed to the development of the additional guidance, sharing its views on particular 
nuances of transition planning for banks – including the incorporation of nature and just transition 
elements. The guidance was published for consultation in October 2023, with Barclays 
participating in the launch event. 
Further details can be found at:

Guidance.pdf

Our approach to TPT disclosures

Over 2023, Barclays participated in a number of working groups of the Transition Plan Taskforce 
(TPT), supporting the development of its framework for transition plan disclosures. We are 
developing our approach to the TPT’s recommendations, taking into account relevant guidance 
as it develops, and elements of the TPT’s Disclosure Framework (including the Implementation 
Guidance and draft Banks Sector Guidance) are addressed in our climate related disclosures 
included in this Annual Report. During 2024, we will look to further develop elements of our climate 
disclosures including transition planning. This will be reflected in future disclosures, as we work 
towards publishing our own transition plan.

Risk and opportunities

TCFD Strategy Recommendation (a)

Climate-related risks identified over 
the short, medium and long term

Our climate strategy is underpinned by the 
way we assess and manage our exposure to 
climate-related risks. Climate risk is a 
Principal Risk within the Barclays Enterprise 
Risk Management Framework. 

Barclays faces exposure to climate-related risks 
either directly through its operations and 
infrastructure or indirectly through its financing 
and investment activities. The two main 
categories of climate-related risks are physical 
risks and transition risks.
Physical risks

Physical risks result from a changing climate and 
can be event-driven (acute risks), including 
increased frequency and/or severity of extreme 
weather events such as cyclone, hurricanes and 
flooding. Physical risks can also be driven by 
longer-term shifts in climate patterns (chronic 
risks) from sustained higher temperatures, 
leading to rising sea levels, rising mean 
temperatures and more severe weather events.
Transition risks

Transition risks result from the transition to a 
lower-carbon economy. This is likely to involve 
significant, rapid policy, regulatory and legal 
changes, as well as the evolution of technology 
and markets to adapt to a changing climate and 
associated impacts.
Time horizons

The impact of physical and transition risks can be 
significant and widespread, affecting Barclays' 
portfolio and financial performance over short-, 
medium- and long-terms horizons.

In the short term, physical risks arising from 
extreme weather events and climate-related 
disasters pose a direct threat to Barclays' 
physical assets and infrastructure. This can 
potentially result in immediate losses, increased 
costs for repair and higher insurance premiums. 
Similarly, acute events may also potentially 
damage the physical facilities of Barclays' clients 
or cause business disruptions, which may 
adversely impact the value of clients' assets, 
reduce their profitability and subsequently lead 
to potential increase in credit risk for Barclays. 
Additionally, operations in regions prone to high 
physical risks may also experience higher 
insurance premiums or limited insurance 
coverage.

Transition risks are expected to occur in all 
timeframes, but more broadly over the medium 
term. The cost of transitioning to cleaner 
technologies and sustainable business practices 
may strain the financial resources of businesses, 
affecting profitability and long-term viability. 
Financial institutions like Barclays could also face 
significant increases in costs and resources 
allocated to adhere to new policies, laws and 
regulations aimed at transitioning to a lower-
carbon economy. This in turn may lead to higher 
conduct and operational risks to Barclays. At an 
individual level, there may be challenges related 
to employment opportunities as businesses 
transition away from carbon-intensive practices. 
This in turn may impact the creditworthiness of 
Barclays' clients and their ability to repay loans.

Transition risks aimed at mitigating climate 
change can also impact the profitability and value 
of assets in Barclays' portfolio, particularly those 
linked to carbon-intensive industries. Companies 
perceived as slow to adapt or unresponsive to 
environmental concerns may face reputational 
damage or legal actions leading to decreased 
customer trust and investor support. 

With escalating concerns and heightened global 
awareness of climate risks, it is likely that litigation 
linked to these risks will increase. Additionally, 
Barclays may face greater scrutiny of the type of 
business it conducts – including in the form of 
adverse media coverage and an increase in 
climate-related litigation cases. This in turn may 
adversely impact customer demand for Barclays' 
products, returns on business activities, value of 
assets and trading positions, resulting in higher 
impairment charges. 

Looking to the longer term, the cumulative 
effects of global temperature rise are likely to 
become increasingly pronounced – influencing 
ecosystems, sea levels and societal structures. 
Climate change can also trigger tipping points 
through feedback loops that amplify its effects. 
Certain tipping points are already underway, 
manifesting in observable changes across the 
globe. Different tipping elements, such as the 
melting of ice sheets or changes in ocean 
circulation, have varying time horizons. As the 
science develops, we are observing that some 
tipping points may run on a shorter timeline than 
initially expected. Accordingly, the uncertainty of 
exact timeframes in which such tipping points are 
expected to materialise adds a layer of 
complexity – making it challenging to precisely 
predict when impacts will materialise.

When considering the timescales of climate-
related risks, Barclays has categorised short, 
medium and long term as follows:

• Short term (S): 0-1 year

• Medium term (M): 1-5 years

• Long term (L): 5-30 years.

The short-term timescale coincides with the 
short-term plan for annual budgets and granular 
financial plans. The medium term coincides with 
the five-year financial, capital and funding plans.

Climate change as a driver of risk

The feedback effects of climate risk drivers 
through macro and micro transmission channels 
are observed in Barclays' portfolio through 
traditional risk categories such as credit risk, 
market risk, treasury and capital risk, operational 
risk and reputational risk. The approach to 
identifying, measuring and managing climate-
related risks is consistent with other key risks, 
however there remains significant uncertainty 
around when these risks will materialise.

Climate risk is integrated into the broader 
Enterprise Risk Management Framework, 
aligning with other Principal Risks and ensuring a 
holistic approach to risk identification, 
assessment and management. Barclays' Climate 
Risk Framework facilitates a structured 
integration of climate risk considerations into the 
Bank's operations. It undergoes regular reviews 
and updates – including changes to risk 
taxonomy, definitions and methodology – to align 
with changing regulatory expectations and 
external developments. Following the annual 
review of the Climate Risk Framework in 2023, 
Barclays no longer considers that a separate 
category is needed to capture second-order 
impacts of physical and transition risk, as these 
impacts are already being captured and managed 
within the existing assessments and framework. 
Therefore, connected risks no longer features as 
a separate category.

The potential impacts of physical and transition 
risk drivers will vary across Barclays' portfolios 
depending on composition, industry, geographic 
location, business operations and other 
contextual factors. 

The tables below set out the example drivers, 
example potential impacts and expected time 
horizons of various physical and transition risks.

Building our understanding of nature-related risk

i

Nature-related risks arise from an organisation's 
dependencies and impacts on nature. These risks 
can be physical risks and transition risks, which in 
1
.
turn can present financial risks

As such, this year we have undertaken further work 
to develop our understanding of nature-related 
risks and how these relate to different industry 
sectors. Building on last year's heatmap analysis, we 
have updated our approach using publicly available 
data and explored a wider set of impacts and 
dependencies. This work has been designed to help 
build our understanding of the material nature-
related impacts, dependencies, risks and 
opportunities within priority industry sectors, and 
indicate where we might focus further analysis, as 
we continue to build our nature related assessment 
and decision-making capabilities.

Through this work, we have developed an updated 
heatmap by mapping industry classification codes 
and the associated qualitative nature-related 
2
impact and dependency ratings from ENCORE
3
and SBTN
 to Barclays' internal sector 
classifications. The mapping was undertaken for 
sectors with material impacts and dependencies as 
identified by TNFD in its Guidance for Financial 
4
.
Institutions

We then undertook an exploratory exercise which 
highlighted in which of these industry sectors 
particular nature-related impacts and 
dependencies are most likely to occur. 

This work created a heatmap with ratings 
representing an average global view of the 
potential impacts and dependencies that may 
be associated with the direct operations of 
companies in these sectors.

The preliminary heatmap analysis highlighted 
that, for most of the priority industry sectors, 
there are a number of potential impacts and 
dependencies rated as high or very high, 
including impacts related to land-use change, 
water use and pollution, as well as 
dependencies on ecosystem services such as 
ground and surface water, climate regulation 
and flood-storm protection. These insights will 
be used to help inform our future analysis, 
taking into account that this represents one 
data source, and specific nature related risks 
within the same sector might vary substantially 
from company or project and an aggregated 
heatmap is not necessarily representative of 
the actual impacts and dependencies of 
Barclays’ client base.

Our proposed next steps include building on 
the TNFD LEAP pilot undertaken in 2022/2023 
to conduct further sector-level analysis, taking 
into account the results of the heatmap, 
Barclays’ exposure and client base and 
emerging thinking on impact and risk data and 
methodologies.

Nature-related data, models and methodologies are a nascent area and therefore evolving and reliant on externally sourced data mapped to 
internal sector identifiers, with various limitations. We will continue to review the applied data, models, and methodologies, as such the results 
of similar assessments are likely to change in the future.

Risk and opportunities (continued)

TCFD Strategy Recommendation (a)

Climate-related opportunities 
identified over the short, medium 
and long term 

Barclays has enhanced its focus on sustainable 
and transition finance over the last two years. 
At the end of 2022, we announced a new target 
to facilitate $1trn of Sustainable and Transition 
Finance. This followed a review of the financing 
requirements arising from the global transition 
to a low-carbon economy if the world is to 
avoid the worst effects of climate change and 
the potential addressable market for Barclays. 
During 2023 we built on this work to develop a 
Group-wide sustainable finance strategy to 
operationalise our ambition.

The market opportunity

We recognise the opportunities arising from the 
global transition to a low-carbon economy – 
which will involve scaling up zero or near-zero 
emitting technologies and businesses and 
supporting emissions reductions in high-emitting 
and hard-to-abate sectors if the world is to avoid 
the worst effects of climate change. 

In 2022, we completed a review of the market 
and identified three medium-term thematic 
areas of potential opportunity for Barclays, as 
outlined below. Although markets may have 
evolved during 2023 we believe these still 
represent growth opportunities for Barclays.
Energy Transition Finance

The analysis indicated that, based on current 
policy, technology and market developments, 
Energy Transition Finance – including renewables 
and nascent or early-stage climate technologies 
that are needed to scale to support the transition 
to net zero – represents an estimated 10-year 
addressable opportunity of over $16trn across 
North America, Europe and Asia Pacific 
(excluding China). 

This extends to up to $24trn over the same time 
period if policy, technology and market 
developments step up to deliver on net zero by 
2050.

This consists of a number of mature and scaling 
technologies with renewable energy (including 
wind and solar) and low-emissions transport 
(including electric vehicles, fuel cell electric 
vehicles and mass transit) expected to make up 
over half of the addressable market through to 
2030. The analysis also indicated significant 
longer-term opportunities in financing the 
scaling of capabilities in nascent technologies 
such as carbon capture utilisation and storage 
(CCUS) and hydrogen solutions.
Sustainable finance instruments

Sustainable finance instruments represent an 
estimated $3.5trn-6trn annual issuance 
opportunity through to 2030 across North 
America, Europe and Asia Pacific (excluding 
China), with Europe  expected to remain the 
primary market for ESG debt.

The analysis indicated that all ESG instruments 
are expected to grow to 2030 with ESG debt 
excluding green bonds and loans represents an 
estimated 10-year $400-650bn cumulative 
financing opportunity for Barclays based on our 
global market share in sustainable finance 
instruments.
Retail and business banking

Barclays UK recognises the environmental and 
societal benefits – and the commercial 
opportunities – that can be delivered through 
financing the UK economy's transition to net 
zero. Embracing the challenge of capturing 
opportunities from the transition to a low-carbon 
economy aligns with Barclays’ Purpose and 
positions us to capitalise on the growing market 
for sustainable finance.

Our 2022 market review indicated that, within the 
UK, sustainable opportunities in retail and 
business banking represent a $225-286bn 
market opportunity by 2025, increasing to an 
estimated $640bn-1trn by 2030.

According to our 2022 market review, Green 
Home Mortgages represent the largest individual 
market for Barclays UK by 2030. We are actively 
exploring ways to unlock the decarbonisation of 
homes at scale by developing secured and 
unsecured lending for energy-efficiency-related 
technologies. We are also exploring strategic 
partnerships to provide customers and 
businesses with financing and guidance to make 
more sustainable choices. However, there are 
significant dependencies for this opportunity to 
be realised – namely customer demand, supply 
chain maturity and policy intervention.

Assessing the market opportunity

To determine the addressable global market 
for sustainable finance to 2030, Barclays' 
2022 market review  leveraged widely used 
and credible third-party sources including the 
IEA, IRENA, Climate Bonds Initiative and the 
IFC as well as Barclays' own industry, ESG and 
market research. The analysis considered 
the investment needed through to 2030 for 
the world to align to net zero, including the 
accelerated scenarios reflecting possible 
policy and market developments. Having 
determined the global addressable market, 
Barclays developed scenarios for the Bank's 
potential market for various asset classes, 
product sets, technological sectors and 
geographic markets, validated through 
comparison with historic growth rates and 
our projected share of the overall market.

$1trn Sustainable and Transition 
Financing Target

Following analysis of the market opportunity for 
sustainable financing, together with a review of the 
Group's capabilities, in December 2022 we 
announced a new target to facilitate $1trn of 
Sustainable and Transition Financing between 2023 
and the end of 2030, 
+

Further details of Barclays' sustainable finance targets can 
be found on page 101 and further details on how Barclays' 
products  and services are harnessing these opportunities 
from page 107.

We recognise that we must tackle the 
decarbonisation of 'hard-to-abate' sectors that 
are carbon intensive – including through scaling 
and commercialising new technologies such as 
hydrogen and carbon capture.  

During 2023 we developed a Transition Finance 
Framework, which we announced in early 2024.  
The Transition Finance Framework sets out the 
criteria for the inclusion of transition financing in 
our $1trn target. The inclusion of transition 
financing reflects our recognition of the 
importance of lending and facilitating funding and 
investing in technologies and activities that 
support GHG emission reduction (directly or 
indirectly) in high-emitting and hard-to-abate 
sectors.

TCFD Strategy Recommendation (a)

Group sustainable finance strategy 

Following the appointments of the CIB Head of 
Sustainable Finance in November 2022 and the 
Barclays UK Head of Social Purpose and 
Sustainable Finance in January 2023, a significant 
piece of work was undertaken to develop a Group 
sustainable finance strategy, which was presented 
to and discussed with the Board in July 2023. 

This work built on the findings of the 2022 market 
opportunity analysis and considered Barclays ' 
competitive strengths to identify strategic 
opportunities in sustainable and transition finance 
where we believe Barclays can differentiate itself 
and best support our clients and the global 
economy to accelerate the transition to net zero. 
The strategy aligns with the climate and 
environmental themes that were identified when 
we announced our $1trn Sustainable and 
Transition Financing target in December 2022 and 
therefore underpins our plan to deliver 
that ambition.

In the development of the strategy, we identified 
three sustainability themes which are important in 
the journey towards a net zero and sustainable 
future, where we see significant commercial 
opportunity and where we believe we can focus 
and differentiate:

The graphic below provides a summary of the 
themes and pillars. At the intersection of each 
theme and pillar we are developing tailored 
products and services for our clients and 
customers to help them deliver on their 
transition and sustainability objectives. 

For example, with our focus on climate 
technologies, we are supporting the development 
of start-ups in targeted technologies and nature 
from idea to IPO. We are also advising sustainable 
and Agtech companies on areas such as raising 
finance and M&A.

1 Decarbonising industry

2 Contributing to a nature-positive food system

3 Supporting consumers on the path to net zero

We also identified three pillars of competitive 
advantage for Barclays across those 
sustainability themes, through which we believe 
we can deliver for our clients by working 
collectively across our different businesses:

1 Our strength in the UK

2  Our focus on being a leading partner to climate 

technologies

3  The strength of our business across 

sustainable credit markets

Our strategy to deliver on our sustainable finance ambition

Three pillars where we can deliver for clients and stakeholders:

Support UK net zero

Leading climate tech partner

Sustainable credit markets

• Facilitate the flow of capital to consumers 

and businesses

• Facilitate the flow of capital to new and existing 
technologies critical to the net zero transition

• Leverage strength in credit markets to facilitate 

clients’ transition plans

• Deliver on our social purpose agenda by 

• Develop expertise and infrastructure financing 

• Play a leading role in the creation of carbon and 

supporting the just transition

solutions for the deployment of new technologies

biodiversity markets

• Support climate tech companies across the lifecycle, 

• Unlock additional sources of capital, including 

from startup to IPO

through securitisation, savings and investments

Three sustainability themes where we can focus and differentiate:

Decarbonising 
 industry

Support SMEs and corporates across major 
industries to decarbonise, deploy new 
technology and manage their transitions 

Contributing to a nature-
positive food system

Drive the evolution to sustainable 
agriculture and foods, and facilitate 
regenerative land use

Supporting consumers on the path 
to net zero 
Provide financing to facilitate consumer 
products to live and act sustainably, and 
support consumer-oriented climate tech 
and financing models

Barclays PLC

Annual Report 2023 71

Through our sustainable finance strategy and our 
$1trn Sustainable and Transition Financing target, 
we have set out an ambition and approach that will 
support our clients and customers in their 
transition. Delivery of the strategy will require a 
multi-year investment in our people and 
capabilities, which we are now accelerating the 
execution of.

Identifying nature-related 
opportunities

Nature-related financing presents future 
opportunities for the financial sector given 
the capital requirements to address and 
reverse nature loss: the biodiversity 
financing gap is estimated to be $700bn per 
year1. As we execute our sustainable 
finance strategy, we aim to identify 
opportunities to play a role in supporting 
the financing of nature.  

See section Financing nature on page 105 for details of 
our approach.

Implementing our Climate Strategy (continued)

TCFD Strategy Recommendation (b)  |  Strategic Pillar 1

Achieving net zero operations 

Although financed emissions account for 
the greatest proportion of our climate 
impact, we have also continued addressing 
our operational emissions – an important 
factor in meeting our ambition to be a net 
zero bank by 2050. 

Defining net zero operations 

We define net zero operations as the state in 
which we will achieve a GHG reduction of our 
Scope 1, Scope 2 and Scope 3 operational 
o
1
emissions
C-aligned 
 consistent with a 1.5
pathway and counterbalance any residual 
emissions.

We continue to review and develop our approach 
to net zero operations as standards to 
understand and define net zero evolve rapidly.
Net zero operations strategy 
Our net zero operations strategy has two 
components: 

• Reduce our Scope 1 and 2 emissions through 

energy efficiency, electrification of our 
buildings and vehicles, renewable electricity 
sourcing and replacing fossil-fuel-powered 
infrastructure with low-emission alternatives

• Reduce Scope 3 operational emissions by 

engaging with our key stakeholders, including 
2
suppliers
 and colleagues, to track, manage 
and reduce their GHG emissions – while 
embedding net zero principles across our 
policies and contractual requirements.

Progress to date

3
In 2023 we achieved our milestone
 of 50% 
reduction of our Scope 1 and 2 location-based 
GHG emissions ahead of 2030 – reducing these 
Δ
emissions by 51%
. We continued to source

Δ
100%

5
estate portfolio
 and continued to meet our 90% 
Scope 1 and 2 market-based emissions 
6
 – reducing these emissions by 
reduction target
Δ
. 
93%

Key contributors to our progress include global 
7
real estate portfolio right-sizing
 and energy 
efficiency programmes, as well as company 
vehicles electrification, and our continued focus 
on renewable electricity sourcing. 

For our Scope 3 operational emissions, our focus 
remained on engaging with our key stakeholders 
and making data enhancements, particularly by 
acquiring primary supplier data and evolving our 
accounting methodology in line with industry 
standards and best practice. We also continued 
to pursue the integration of ESG considerations 
and expectations into processes throughout the 
procurement lifecycle.

We expect that our progress against our net zero 
operations targets and milestones is likely to be 
variable and non-linear. Our net zero operations 
strategy is dependent on broader industry, 
technological and regulatory changes that are 
outside Barclays’ control and may affect our 
ability to achieve our targets and milestones. 
Further, as the accounting standards and data 
underlying our net zero operations strategy 
continue to evolve and be refined, this could 
impact our metrics, targets and milestones. 
Progress against our targets and milestones may 
also be impacted by management decisions 
based on key drivers unrelated to climate, for 
example prudent risk management practices. 

Our intent is to enhance data collection and 
accuracy to help identify key contributors to our 
impact, determine opportunities for 
improvement, and support the integration of 
sustainability into our business operations.

Notes: 
1 We have updated internal and external data which has resulted in minor updates to FY2022 EUI performance (a change from 265kWh/m2/year to 260 kWh/m2/year). 
2 In this Achieving net zero operations section, a reference to a "milestone” denotes an indicator we are working towards and report against.
3 We have updated internal data which has resulted in minor updates to FY2022 on-site renewable electricity capacity (from 0.26MW to 0.30MW). 
4 Targets are considered ‘science-based’ if they are in line with what the latest climate science deems necessary to meet the goals and timelines of the Paris Agreement – limiting global warming to well below 2°C above pre-industrial levels and pursuing efforts to limit warming to 
1.5°C. The Science Based Targets initiative (SBTi), a partnership between CDP, the United Nations Global Compact, World Resources Institute (WRI) and the World Wide Fund for Nature (WWF), provides companies with independent assessment and validation of targets and is 
currently the internationally accepted standard.  

5 Indicative number provided to illustrate the number of suppliers by total addressable spend that have committed to or have science-based targets in place. In our 2022 Annual Report we reported 47% progress based on a review of our top 500 suppliers by addressable spend. Our 

current progress is reported here based on a review of our top 2,000 suppliers by addressable spend.

6 Based on our indicative supply chain emissions inventory. DEFRA conversion factors – which Barclays uses to calculate spend data into supply chain emissions – were revised in 2023. These have been retrospectively applied to Barclays' 2018 baseline and 2022 disclosure, resulting 
in an increased 2018 baseline and recalculated 2022 metrics. In FY 2022 we reported 8% reduction in our supply chain GHG emissions and due to the changes in the DEFRA conversion factors and updated internal data, we recalculated the 2022 figure to be 17%. As our suppliers 
continue to develop the quality of emissions data for the goods and services we purchase, our reliance on spend data to calculate our emissions will reduce and the volume of primary data will increase. 

7 Campuses include 1 Churchill Place, Radbroke, Northampton, Glasgow, Pune, Whippany, 745 7th Avenue, Dryrock. 
8 Reported waste diversion performance for FY2022 has been recalculated from 65% to 49%, to account for an update in external data. 
9 Addressable spend is defined as external costs incurred by Barclays in the normal course of business where Procurement has influence over where the spend is placed. It excludes costs such as regulatory fines or charges, exchange fees, taxation, employee expenses or litigation 

costs, and property rent.

1 Our reporting of supply chain emissions includes the following GHG Protocol Scope 3 categories: Category 1: Purchased Goods and Services, Category 2: Capital Goods, Category 4: Upstream transportation and distribution. In 2023 we reported 

GHG emissions of Categories 1, 2 and 4 by aggregating these under Category 1. It is our intent to assign emissions to each of these separate categories in due course.

2 The methodology used to calculate our GHG emissions follows the 'Greenhouse Gas Protocol (GHG): A Corporate Accounting and Reporting Standard (Revised Edition)', defined by the World Resources Institute/World Business Council for 

Sustainable Development. We have adopted the operational control approach on reporting boundaries.

3 We continuously review and update our performance data based on updated GHG emission factor, improvements in data quality and updates to estimates previously applied. For 2023, we have applied the latest emissions factors as of 31 December 

2023. All location- and market-based figures are gross and do not include netted figures from carbon credits. 

4 Upstream and downstream leased assets include our third-party co-located data centres and a property we lease out to tenants. Upstream leased assets also include properties with landlord managed energy from central systems which are outside 

of our operational control. 

5 We selected 2018 as the baseline year for our supply chain emissions, to align with the baseline year used for other categories, and have since reported supply chain emissions for 2021, 2022, and 2023.
6 Reported emissions for Scope 2 location and market-based have been recalculated back to the 2018 baseline, due to updated internal and external data. The associated emissions have also been re-classified from Scope 2 electricity to Scope 3 

Category 8 (Upstream Leased Assets) as these emissions are currently outside of our operational control. In 2022 we reported Scope 2 location-based emissions of 103,422 tCO2e; the recalculated figure is 99,782 tCO2e. In 2022 we reported Scope 
2 market-based emissions of 1,883 tCO2e; the recalculated figure is 1,963 tCO2e. In 2022 we reported energy use of 467,939 MWh; the recalculated figure is 463,973 MWh.

7 We have recalculated FY 2022 Scope 3 Category 5 GHG emissions from 10,700 tCO2e to 352 tCO2e as DEFRA Material Use emission factors were incorrectly applied to waste production which resulted in an overstatement of emissions. 
Our operational footprint data follows a reporting period of 1 October 2022 to 30 September 2023.

Reducing our Scope 1 and 2 emissions 

In 2023, to reduce our Scope 1 and 2 emissions, 
we maintained focus on improving energy 
efficiency and replacing fossil-fuel-powered 
infrastructure with lower-emission alternatives. 
Energy efficiency measures reduce our overall 
energy demand and reliance on the grid to power 
our operations. Concurrently, by replacing fossil-
fuel-powered infrastructure, for example, by 
electrifying our buildings and company vehicles, 
we will aim to eliminate a significant part of our 
Scope 1 emissions and prepare our 
infrastructure to consume electricity from 
renewable sources.
Increasing energy efficiency 
To continually improve operational energy 
efficiency, in 2023 we maintained global demand 
1
 our 
reduction programmes and right-sized
global real estate portfolio – resulting in 44% 
energy consumption reduction against a 2018 
baseline. These efforts also contributed to 
2
progress against our global corporate offices,
energy use intensity (EUI) milestone by reducing 
our EUI by 27% against a 2018 baseline.

Our global energy optimisation programme 
contributed to our EUI reduction by adjusting 
corporate offices' settings and systems during 
periods of low or no occupancy to reduce our 
demand for energy while keeping our buildings 
3
running. In 2023
 the programme contributed to 
approximately 9.1 GWh in energy savings at our 
UK corporate offices – equivalent to the annual 
electricity consumption of approximately 2,600 
UK households. Programme projects included 
4
Glasgow campus baseload
 reductions, where 
we reduced overnight usage of building 
equipment such as our lighting, heating and 
cooling systems, and power reductions for our 
building equipment at 1 Churchill Place in 
London, planned over bank holidays. Moving 
forward, we plan to implement the energy 
optimisation programme at additional 
corporate offices.

Electrification and replacing fossil-fuel-
powered infrastructure  

Replacing fossil fuels 
with renewable energy

In 2023 we continued electrifying our real estate 
portfolio by replacing end-of-life natural gas 
heating and cooling equipment with electric-
powered alternatives and prioritising 
electrification in campus developments 
wherever possible, For example, at our Glasgow 
campus we replaced natural gas boilers with an 
air source heat pump – leading to an 84% 
reduction in Scope 1 GHG emissions compared 
to 2022 at that campus. As part of the campus 
redevelopments at 1 Churchill Place, we are 
electrifying our kitchen cooking stoves. We will 
continue to incorporate electrification and fossil-
fuel-powered infrastructure replacement into 
future real estate decisions.

As part of our commitment to Climate Group's 
EV100 initiative, we have also made progress in 
transitioning our corporate vehicle fleet to 
electric vehicles (EVs) or ultra-low emissions 
vehicles (ULEVs). By the end of 2023 88% of our 
UK fleet was converted to EVs and 42% of our 
global fleet was converted to EVs or ULEVs.

All UK colleagues provided with a company car 
for their role have also been offered funded 
home-charging equipment to ease the transition 
to a fully electrified fleet.

In addition, we are replacing existing mobile 
banking vans with electric vans, providing a less 
carbon-intensive method of serving our Barclays 
UK customers and communities compared to 
the previous diesel-fuelled vehicles.

Δ
In 2023 we maintained 100%
 renewable 
electricity sourcing for our global real estate 
portfolio
through instruments including green 
6
5
tariffs
 (55%) and energy attribute certificates
(EACs)(45%), continuing to meet our 2025 target 
ahead of schedule. 

We also maintained our long-term focus on 
planning additional on-site renewable energy 
installations and exploring tools like Power 
Purchase Agreements (PPAs) that bring 
additional renewable energy to the grid. 

We continued developing strategies for on-site 
renewable energy installations such as solar 
panels, and have coordinated with stakeholders 
like local utilities and planning boards with the 
intent of installing these types of projects in 
coming years. Sites with existing solar panel 
installations, including Glasgow, Pune, 
Northampton and Cambridge Eagle Lab, have 
0.40 MW of renewable electricity capacity.

7
Beginning in 2024, up to 80%
 of Barclays' annual 
UK electricity needs will be sourced through a 
PPA supporting Creag Riabhach, an onshore 
wind farm project in Scotland.
Scope 1 and 2 emissions data accounting

We continue to work on improving our data 
quality and accounting methodologies to make 
meaningful comparisons of emissions data over 
time and to make informed strategic decisions. 
Given the evolving nature of climate data and 
methodologies, past-period figures may change 
to reflect updates. To manage the impact of 
these changes we have detailed our operational 
climate data accounting approach in the ESG 
Reporting Framework on our ESG Resource Hub.	

Barclays PLC

Annual Report 2023 76

Embedding sustainability into operational 
practices

Across our operations we are introducing new 
standards and guidelines to help enable the 
integration of sustainability into decision 
making.

For example, in 2023 we introduced the 
Sustainability Design and Construction 
Checklist and Green Leasing Toolkit, which 
are guidelines that help integrate sustainability 
criteria into real estate processes in alignment 
with Barclays' net zero operations strategy.

Both guidelines help teams identify gaps in 
existing real estate processes for leasing 
transactions and in design and construction 
projects. They serve as a record of inclusion 
and applicability of sustainability criteria for a 
given project, allowing teams to flag 
inconsistencies between project design and 
sustainability expectations.

Notes:
1 By right-sizing we are optimising our space and associated 

resources for our operational needs.

2 Corporate offices include offices and campuses. 
3 Data represents reduction from 1 October 2022 to 

30 September 2023.

4 Baseload is the minimum load experienced by a building energy 
system over a given period of time, that must be supplied at all 
times.

5 Green tariffs are programmes in regulated electricity markets 
offered by utilities, allowing large commercial and industrial 
customers to buy bundled renewable electricity from a specific 
project through a special utility tariff rate.

6 Energy attribute certificates are the official documentation to 
prove renewable energy procurement. Each EAC represents 
proof that 1 MWh of renewable energy has been produced and 
added to the grid. Global EAC standards for renewable claims are 
primarily Guarantees of Origin in Europe and UK,Renewable 
Energy Certificates (RECs) in North America and International 
RECs (I-RECs) in a growing number of countries in Asia, Africa, 
the Middle East and Latin America.

Addressing our Scope 3 operational 
emissions

Supply chain

To support our net zero operations strategy, in 
2023 we continued to implement our supply 
chain net zero pathway.

As part of our pathway we are working towards a 
50% reduction in our supply chain GHG 
emissions by end of 2030 and a long-term 
milestone of 90% emissions reduction by the 
end of 2050 (both against a 2018 baseline). In 
developing our supply chain net zero emissions 
pathway, we used the Science Based Targets 
initiative (SBTi) Corporate Net Zero Standard and 
Target Setting Tool, consistent with a 1.5ºC-
aligned pathway.
Engagement and integration

Engagement with our suppliers is a key vehicle for 
change. Our strategy is to engage proactively and 
constructively across our supplier organisations to 
increase climate transparency and accountability, 
and promote emissions reduction. In 2023 we 
invited 489 of our suppliers to disclose climate-
related information such as governance, risk 
strategy, targets and performance, emissions 
methodology and data related to climate change, 
through CDP. We achieved a 75% participation 
rate, representing approximately 75% of Barclays' 
2023 supply chain emissions.

In 2022 we updated our standard supplier contract 
terms with requirements relating to climate 
change, including an obligation for our suppliers to 
have an emissions reduction programme in place 
by 2025, supported by a public reduction target 
and a commitment to achieve net zero GHG 
emissions no later than 2050. In 2023 we 
continued to embed the discussion and 
negotiation of these terms into new contracts and 
renewals. This is one of the steps we are taking to 
work towards our milestone of 90% of our 
suppliers, by addressable spend, to have science-
based GHG emissions reduction targets in place 
by end of 2030. The terms also include a 
requirement for our suppliers to periodically 
disclose their direct and indirect GHG emissions 
using a recognised standard, such as the GHG 
Protocol Corporate Accounting and Reporting 
Standard.

We have also continued to work internally with 
our Sourcing colleagues to embed the 
consideration of GHG emissions into some of 
our key tenders for Supplier and Product 
selection. We are starting to embed the 
consideration of GHG emissions at the point of 
demand through seeking less-GHG-emission-
intensive ways of meeting our needs. For 
example, the procurement process for capital 
projects now integrates sustainability into 
building design principles through embedding a 
Sustainability Design and Construction Checklist 
(see page 76 for more information). 

Barclays PLC

Annual Report 2023 77

Lastly, to support our engagement with 
suppliers, in 2023 we conducted an intelligence 
gathering exercise across our top 2,000 suppliers 
1
(based on spend
) to seek understanding of their 
position on environmental and social matters.
Data enhancement

Our strategy to achieve our milestones is 
underpinned by obtaining more accurate 
emissions data from our suppliers, to inform our 
approach to reducing emissions. Ultimately, we 
are reliant on our suppliers to provide accurate 
product-level primary data, in addition to 
reducing GHG emissions associated with the 
goods and services we purchase from them, to 
achieve emissions reductions across their own 
organisations. To measure progress towards our 
emissions reduction milestones and inform our 
supplier intervention strategy, reliable primary 
GHG emissions data will need to be collected and 
tracked over time across our supplier 
organisations. In 2022 primary data accounted 
for approximately 15% of our supply chain 
emissions inventory, increasing to 27% in 2023.

We understand that our success depends on 
that of our suppliers, and that progress may be 
variable and non-linear. Geographic 
considerations, resource capacities, data 
availability, legal requirements, market conditions 
and the varying transition pathways individual 
companies take, given the technologies available, 
may all affect the speed at which they can reduce 
emissions.

Supply chain baseline

DEFRA conversion factors – which Barclays 
uses to calculate spend data into supply chain 
emissions – were revised in 2023. These have 
been retrospectively applied to Barclays' 2018 
baseline and 2022 supply chain emissions, 
resulting in an increased 2018 baseline and 
revised 2022 figures. Our 2022 performance 
2
against supply chain milestone
 increased 
from 8% to 17% due to the change in the 
DEFRA conversion factors and updated 
internal data. As our suppliers continue to 
develop the quality of emissions data for the 
goods and services we purchase, our reliance 
on spend data to calculate our emissions will 
reduce and the volume of primary data will 
increase.

Notes

1 In this section, when referring to 'spend', this is addressable 
spend, defined as external costs incurred by Barclays in the

Leased assets and waste 
While our leased assets and waste emissions are 
lower than other operational emissions, we are 
pursuing opportunities to reduce them. 

For example, in 2023 we introduced a Green 
Leasing Toolkit to support engagements with 
landlords by encouraging the inclusion of our 
sustainability criteria throughout the leasing real 
estate lifecycle. The toolkit includes guidance 
and preferred contractual language for lease 
preferences.

We are also embedding circular economy 
principles within our operations. Further details 
are provided on page 79. 

TCFD Strategy Recommendation (b)  |  Strategic Pillar 1

Business travel

In 2023 we continued engaging with our 
stakeholders and colleagues to provide 
information and tools to encourage more 
sustainable travel choices. For example, we 
updated our booking and reporting platforms to 
highlight low-carbon modes of transport for our 
colleagues, including EV rentals where available. 
We provided colleagues with additional guidelines 
illustrating how they can reduce their travel 
emissions – identifying, for example, where they 
could combine multiple trips or switch from air to 
rail travel. We also continued to engage with our 
preferred airline partners to explore their plans to 
use sustainable aviation fuel (SAF). 

Our 2023 total colleague business travel 
emissions reduced by 43% against a 2018 
baseline – noting these emissions doubled 
compared to 2022 due to a return to business 
travel post-COVID. We will continue to engage 
with our stakeholders and provide colleagues 
with the tools and resources to align with our net 
zero ambition. Our intent is to improve the 
accuracy of our business travel data to better 
inform emission reduction strategies.

Carbon credits 

Supporting our colleagues 

We are currently reviewing our approach to the 
use of voluntary carbon market credits for 
operational emissions.

Our goal is to provide colleagues with the tools and 
support needed to help reduce their individual 
environmental footprints. 

We remain supportive of initiatives to enhance 
the integrity of the voluntary carbon market 
across both the supply and demand side.

In 2023, for example:

• We continued to expand our range of green 

benefits for colleagues, including our UK EV salary 
sacrifice and UK and Ireland Bike4Work schemes. 
In 2023 over 900 colleagues ordered EVs through 
salary sacrifice and over 650 made use of 
Bike4Work 

• Officially launched in 2022, our Barclays Go Green 

sustainability gamification programme helps 
colleagues take and track actions that reduce 
their personal environmental footprint. In 2023, 
colleagues participated in over 20,000 activities – 
such as switching off laptop equipment, opting 
for lower-carbon travel methods and replacing 
single-use items like cups with reusable 
alternatives

• Our 14 global employee-led environment 

networks created and participated in activities 
aligned with Barclays’ climate and sustainability 
strategy.

Nature and biodiversity 
in our operations 

Nature and biodiversity are intrinsically 
connected to our efforts to mitigate and adapt 
to climate change, maintain healthy communities 
and support productive, sustainable economies.

At the end of 2023 we started to identify and 
assess nature-related impacts and 
dependencies for our real estate operations 
informed by the Taskforce on Nature-related 
Financial Disclosures (TNFD) LEAP (Locate, 
Evaluate, Assess, Prepare) approach. This 
evaluation includes assessing our real estate 
operations' water, pollution, biodiversity and 
resource use impacts and dependencies. We will 
continue the assessment in 2024 to evaluate 
nature considerations in our operations moving 
forward. 

The assessment will support our focus on 
improving resource use and the ability to protect 
natural environments through circular design 
principles – including designing-out waste and 
pollution across our operations, recycling, and 
regenerating natural ecosystems.
Circular economy principles and zero waste 

We are working to embed circular economy 
principles across our operations by seeking to 
eliminate waste at the source through resource 
use reductions and by improving recycling rates.

landfill, incineration and the 

1
Across our key campuses
 we have an ambition 
to achieve and maintain TRUE (Total Resource 
Use and Efficiency) zero waste certified projects 
by end of 2035 with a milestone to divert 90% of 
waste from  
environment by end of 2035 – and in 2023 
achieved a 53% diversion rate of all waste, a 4% 
2
increase from the previous year
. Even though 
more colleagues have returned to work in our 
office locations, causing the total tonnage of 
waste to increase since 2022, the waste 
diversion rate from landfill and incineration has 
improved. 

This result illustrates that, while more waste has 
been created, we are diverting more of it through 
increased waste segregation and reduced waste 
stream contamination – as well as through the 
introduction of more reusable items in our 
campuses. 

For example, at our Glasgow and Pune campuses, 
we have increased waste segregation streams – 
making it easier for colleagues to put the correct 
waste in the correct bin. The increased waste 
segregation streams resulted in an average 
contamination rate of 14% between Pune and 
Glasgow, compared to our average of 45% at key 
campuses where these solutions have not yet 
been implemented. The overall reduction in 
contamination rates supports our recycling rates 
– and, ultimately, our waste diversion milestone.

In addition, we are working to divert food waste 
from landfill and incineration through projects 
including the installation of on-site composters 
at our Glasgow and Pune campuses and the 
creation of commercial food waste collection 
points at various office locations.  

In 2023 we also launched our reusable food and 
beverage dishware programmes across four key 
campuses with the aim to reduce single-use 
items and therefore waste.
Pollution management 

Barclays has controls in place to address 
pollution risks across our property portfolio 
globally where we operate generators and store 
diesel. The pollution risk controls are engineered 
to identify possible pollution sources and 
pathways for an uncontrolled release to cause 
environmental harm, assess mitigation measures 
and identify improvements and actions that can 
be taken to further enhance our pollution 
prevention and mitigation measures.

In 2023, 41% of our global real estate portfolio 
remains certified to ISO 14001, the international 
standard for designing and implementing an 
Environmental Management System (EMS).

Unreasonable Impact company Re:Dish powering 
sustainable solutions for Barclays

After receiving support from Barclays through the Unreasonable Impact programme, Re:Dish has 
brought its reusable dishware programme full circle to Barclays’ New York City, Wilmington and 
Whippany campuses.
As part of our ambition to become a net zero bank by 2050, Barclays is working to achieve and 
maintain TRUE (Total Resource Use and Efficiency) zero-waste-certified projects across key 
campuses by 2035. 
Re:Dish supports our goal by helping us remove hundreds of thousands of single-use items a year 
from our waste stream. Re:Dish delivers food and beverage containers to Barclays, collects used 
containers and cups to clean and sanitise, and returns them for reuse. Instead of requiring more 
materials and resources for new containers and specialised cleaning equipment, Barclays taps into 
an existing network of fit-for-purpose dishware and washing services that can efficiently 
accommodate fluctuating demand.  
In addition, Re:Dish and Barclays partnered to build colleagues’ understanding of circularity – an 
important contributing factor to the success of these programmes. Re:Dish containers have a QR 
code colleagues can scan to see exactly how many times that specific unit has been reused and the 
resulting estimated environmental impact.

Reducing our financed emissions

We are committed to aligning all of our 
financing to the goals and timelines of the 
Paris Agreement, consistent with limiting the 
increase in global temperatures to 1.5°C. To 
meet our ambition, we need to reduce the 
client emissions we finance – not just for 
lending but for capital markets activities, too.

We work closely with our clients to ensure that 
over time the activities we finance are aligned to 
the goals and timelines of the Paris Agreement. 
Consistent with our Purpose, and taking into 
account considerations of all relevant business 
factors, we continue to set emissions reduction 
targets for our portfolios where possible, aligned 
with the ambitions of the Net-Zero Banking 
Alliance (NZBA), of which we are a founding 
member. We also continue to set and follow clear 
restrictions on financing certain activities. 
+

Further details on our restrictive policies can be found on 

page 100.

The core building block for developing the transition 
framework for Barclays to be a net zero bank is our 
ability to estimate the full in-scope balance sheet 
financed emissions.

TCFD Strategy Recommendation (b)  |  Strategic Pillar 2
Basis of preparation

Our approach for calculating financed emissions 
is based on a methodology which has been 
developed using the PCAF Standard with the 
following key exceptions:

1 We have gone beyond the scope of PCAF’s 

definition of asset classes to additionally cover 
undrawn commitments, contingent liabilities 
and capital markets financing activities. For 
instance, in the case of a loan we consider the 
committed amount (both drawn and undrawn), 
as opposed to just outstanding amounts 
(which is the approach preferred by PCAF) for 
calculating financed emissions. 

2 We have also consistently used the book value 
of equity and debt for all clients to calculate the 
attribution factor, while PCAF recommends 
using the Enterprise Value Including Cash 
(EVIC) for listed entities. 

3 PCAF recommends calculating emissions at a 
client level. For certain sectors, clients could 
have presence in activities across multiple 
parts of the value chain and in such cases 
reported emissions may not be consistent and 
reliable to estimate financed emissions. To 
overcome this challenge we calculate 
emissions at an activity level, using a range of 
options aligned to the PCAF Standard's 
guidance to calculate client emissions. 

For certain activities – including fossil fuel 
exploration and production, electric power 
generation and automotive manufacturing – we 
employ asset-level production data to estimate 
client emissions. For activities such as cement 
and steel production, we use client-reported 
emissions. Where we do not have sufficient data 
on reported emissions or physical activities – for 
example in relation to mortgages where we do 
not have EPC data available – we use fall-backs 
based on emission factors. 

For an immaterial part of our balance sheet 
(c. 1%), where the appropriate sector fall-backs 
could not be reliably obtained, we have used the 
overall portfolio average economic emissions 
intensity to estimate emissions.
+ Our Financed Emissions Methodology paper (published in 
2024) provides more details of our methodology and can be 
found within the ESG Resource Hub: home.barclays/
sustainability/esg-resource-hub/reporting-and-disclosures/

Emissions coverage

Results

We have computed our overall financed 
emissions based on Scope 1 and Scope 2 of our 
clients’ emissions as at December 2022. Hence, 
these numbers follow a lag of one year when 
compared to other disclosures based on 
December 2023 in this report. The lag of one 
year is due to the lead time required to fully 
analyse our entire in-scope exposures. 

We have excluded our clients’ Scope 3 emissions 
from these calculations except for activities 
where we have set a target on Scope 3 emissions 
– which includes Energy Upstream, Automotive 
manufacturing LDVs, Aviation and UK 
Agriculture. - Livestock and Dairy Farming. This is 
due to challenges in sourcing reliable and 
consistent data, not just on reported Scope 3 
emissions but also the fall-back emission factors 
for downstream emission estimations. As we 
refine our approach and data sourcing strategy, 
we will assess the suitability of including Scope 3 
emissions in our financed emissions disclosures. 

Aligned to the guidance issued by the NZBA, our 
metrics and targets for all sectors capture 
emissions on a CO2e basis. For activities where 
we have set targets, we have assessed which 
GHGs are relevant and material for the 
respective sector.

Barclays has assessed the extent to which the 
o
business is aligned to a well-below 2 
C pathway 
by calculating an estimate of our financed 
emissions for the full in-scope balance sheet as 
at December 2022, which has enabled us to 
calculate the coverage of our financed emissions 
reduction targets across our portfolio (including 
integration of 1.5°C aligned scenarios and ranges 
for certain sectors to reflect dependencies 
outside our control that will determine how 
quickly our financed emissions can be reduced in 
these sectors).

Our estimation of our overall financed emissions 
indicates a total annual Scope 1,2 emissions of 
c.80MtCO2e for FY2022. Among these, we have 
set 2030 financed emissions targets covering 
our clients’ Scope 1,2 emissions (including 
integration of 1.5°C aligned scenarios and ranges 
for certain sectors and including UK Housing for 
which we have set a convergence point) for 55% 
of our full in-scope balance sheet financed 
emissions. Beyond this we have also set 2030 
targets integrating a 1.5°C aligned scenario 
covering Scope 3 emissions for Energy 
Upstream, Automotive manufacturing LDVs, 
Aviation and UK Agriculture – Livestock and Dairy 
Farming.

TCFD Strategy Recommendation (b)  |  Strategic Pillar 2
Data sourcing and data quality

We acknowledge the extent of data quality 
challenges inherent in the calculations of 
financed emissions for the full in-scope set of 
activities. The PCAF Standard provides guidance 
to measure data quality (DQ) through a hierarchy 
ranging from DQ1 (best) to DQ5 (worst) specific 
to each asset class. Our estimation of the data 
quality is also largely aligned to the PCAF 
Standard's guidance. 

Our current data quality is dispersed across 
DQ1-2 (reported emissions) data, DQ3 (deriving 
emissions from physical activity data) and DQ4-5 
(deriving emissions from revenue or asset-based 
emission factors). For activities where we have 
set targets, DQ is mostly concentrated across 
DQ1-2 and DQ3. We have identified a 
concentration of lower DQ scores for the 
category of activities where we are yet to set 
targets - including banks, financial institutions 
and sovereigns. This indicates that we need to 
consider the current estimate of financed 
emissions for these activities as highly 
preliminary and indicative only, and which can 
change materially as we improve data quality.

Climate data, models and methodologies are 
evolving – and are not yet at the same standard 
as more traditional financial metrics. Our 
financed emissions calculations rely on externally 
sourced data mapped to internal customer and 
client identifiers. The externally sourced data has 
various limitations for each sector, including lack 
of coverage, low resolution, consistency and 
transparency of company-reported data, as well 
as the time lag for external sources to report 
estimates or actuals.

Time lags could be as much as two years for data 
such as company value, company revenue share, 
emissions, production capacity and capacity 
factors. As a result our financed emissions 
metrics are at best an estimate of our clients' 
activities on a given date, using the external data 
available at that point in time.

Our approach to reporting financed 
emissions data

Given the evolving nature of climate data, models 
and methodologies, past-period metrics may 
change to reflect updates. To manage the 
impact of these changes we have adopted 
a principles-based approach to guide whether 
prior metrics and baselines should be restated 
or re-baselined. 

• A restatement involves updating the historical 
starting point for a period and recalculating the 
historical performance.

• A re-baseline involves keeping the historical 
performance constant and recalculating the 
current period baseline to ensure consistency 
when reviewing performance. The indicative 
historical baseline will also be disclosed.

Barclays PLC

Annual Report 2023 84

Due to this, direct like-for-like comparisons of 
financed emissions information disclosed may 
not always be possible from one reporting period 
to another. Where information is restated or 
re-baselined this will be identified or explained. 

In line with our reporting approach for past period 
metrics, we have re-baselined internal and 
external data, which has resulted in minor 
updates (less than 1%) to Energy, Cement and 
Automotive Manufacturing metrics and a c.2% 
impact to the Power metrics. The most material 
change has been the treatment of multi-client 
shared facilities, which has led to an additional 
c.4% impact in the baseline (2022) metrics for 
Automotive Manufacturing.

• Financed emissions metrics for all years impacted by the error will be restated, including the baseline year.

Our approach

• The updated methodology will be applied from the start of the current reporting period.

• The last reported financed emissions spot metric will be recalculated using the new methodology/data source to 

provide the new baseline. This will ensure consistency of data and methodology when calculating our performance.

• The recalculated baseline and the progress achieved to date will be used to disclose the theoretical baseline for the 

year in which the targets were originally set.

• The cumulative progress will be for the current reporting period (using the new methodology) and the progress up 

until the last reporting period (using the old methodology).

• The impact of updated external data will be included in the current period financed emissions data and the progress 

metric for the current reporting period.

• Data lags are inherent to the process and Barclays will endeavour to use the latest available data . Historically 

reported metrics will not be updated for data lags.

As part of our commitment under the NZBA, we 
1
have set targets for material
 high-emitting 
sectors in our portfolio. We have developed our 
BlueTrack
 methodology to measure and track 
our targets, which incorporate a 1.5°C scenario 
for our 2030 targets, for these high emitting 
2
material sectors
. BlueTrack
a benchmark for a sector that defines how 
financed emissions for a portfolio need to 
change over time, in line with the goals and 
timelines of the Paris Agreement – consistent 
with scenarios limiting the increase in global 
temperatures to 1.5°C. We measure the financed 
emissions within a selected boundary for a 
sector, then aggregate these into a portfolio-
level metric – which is then compared to the 
benchmark. 
TM

 is being expanded to cover the  

BlueTrack
Agriculture, Aviation and UK Commercial Real 
Estate sectors. The Residential Real Estate 
sector is also being expanded to include housing 
associations and small business buy-to-let 
lending, and is now referred to as UK Housing.

During 2023 we assessed our baseline emissions 
from our Shipping sector portfolio as part of our 
NZBA commitment to set targets covering the 
transportation sector. This assessment 
concluded that we provided limited financing to a 
small number of clients and have limited financed 
emissions overall. We have therefore not set a 
target for the Shipping sector at this time. We 
may reassess our approach in the future should 
this become a more material contributor to our 
overall financed emissions.
+ Our Financed Emissions Methodology paper (published in 
2024) provides more details of our methodology and can be 
found within the ESG Resource Hub at: home.barclays/
sustainability/esg-resource-hub/reporting-and-disclosures/

Sector boundaries 
We have set targets on the segment of the 
value chain where either (i) it is generally 
recognised that decarbonisation efforts are likely 
to spur the rest of the sector value chain to fall 
into alignment or (ii) where financiers are likely 
to have more influence over companies active 
in that segment. Our choice of segment is based 
on Barclays' own view, informed by guidance and 
recommended practice from portfolio alignment 
initiatives such as PACTA, SBTi and others. 
Emissions scope

TM

 we must 

For each sector target in BlueTrack
consider which of a company's emissions we 
should measure – for example, direct or indirect 
emissions, or selected greenhouse gases such 
as carbon dioxide and methane. We define this 
according to the GHG Protocol definition of 
Scope 1, 2, and 3 emissions. Within the boundary 
of our target we aim to capture the part of a 
company's value chain that generates  most of 
their emissions, taking into account 
considerations including materiality, consistency 
to benchmark, level of control and whether the 
emissions can be abated by the company. For 
example, our Upstream Energy target includes 
Scope 3 emissions – recognising they are 
significant for a company extracting fossil fuels. 
The financed emissions covered under 
BlueTrack
 are therefore a subset of the total 
financed emissions for each customer or client, 
as they only include the portion of the client's 
activities that are within both the value chain we 
have chosen for the sector and the scope of 
emissions we deem material for that activity. 
Use of carbon credits

TM

We do not allow company-purchased offsets 
such as carbon credits to reduce emissions, as 
we believe it is important to base a metric on 
operational activities under a company's control 
– rather than on unrelated credits, the availability 
of which may be limited. 

The methodology does allow company-operated 
removals, such as on-site carbon capture at a plant 
– however, given this is currently marginal in the 
context of emissions, there is currently no impact 
on our portfolio-financed emissions metrics.
Target metrics

Barclays uses two financed emissions metrics to 
set targets: 

1. Emissions Intensity: how much CO2e (Carbon 

Dioxide Equivalent) is released on average for a 
certain amount of economic activity or 
material produced; 

2. Absolute Emissions: a measure of the absolute 

emissions generated, or fair share, of the 
company's emissions over time. 

We use absolute emissions for the Energy and 
Agriculture sectors, whose decarbonisation 
pathway relies on a reduction in production 
volume as well as on a reduction in intensity. The 
Energy sector cannot reduce its carbon 
emissions intensity below a certain point – a 
barrel of oil cannot be decarbonised, for instance 
– and therefore a reduction in absolute carbon 
emissions is more appropriate. The Agriculture 
sector requires a shift away from the production 
of meat and dairy towards alternative protein 
sources, as farmers respond to changing diets.  
We use emissions intensity for the other sectors, 
whose decarbonisation pathway relies primarily 
on reduction in intensity rather than volumes.
These metrics are sensitive to factors which are 
not directly related to real world emissions, such 
as changes in the book value of debt and equity, 
for absolute emissions, and changes in revenue 
share for emissions intensity.
Reference scenarios

Each of our 2030 target ranges is developed with 
reference to a 1.5°C-aligned scenario. For the 
majority this is the IEA's Net Zero by 2050 
(NZE2050) scenario. In calculating a convergence 
point for our UK Housing portfolio and a target for 

UK Agriculture, we use a UK-focused Balanced Net 
Zero Scenario developed by the UK's Climate 
Change Committee (CCC BNZ). For the UK CRE 
portfolio we use the CRREM scenario that provides 
decarbonisation pathways across different 
property types consistent with the NZE2050 
scenario. For the Aviation sector we use the Mission 
Possible Partnership (MPP)'s 'Prudent' (PRU) 
scenario – a 1.5°C-compatible roadmap for the 
sector to achieve net zero emissions by 2050.
Baseline year 

We measure our financed emissions for each 
portfolio against a baseline metric determined in 
the year we first assessed that target. The baseline 
year therefore varies across the nine sectors 
assessed to date, to ensure we are using the most 
up-to-date data available when we set our targets – 
or, in the case of UK Housing, a convergence point.
Use of target ranges

For Power, Cement, Steel, Automotive 
manufacturing and Aviation, we have set 
emissions intensity targets using a target range. 
While we are clear on the reduction required to 
o
align with the 1.5
C benchmark pathway – the 
higher emissions reduction in the range – we 
recognise there are dependencies outside our 
control that will determine how quickly our 
financed emissions intensity can be reduced in 
these sectors. The lower emissions reduction in 
the range reflects our view of the sector, client 
pathways and commitments at the time of 
setting the target. We seek to achieve the higher 
emissions reduction, consistent with our net 
zero ambition, but achieving it will depend on 
external factors.

1 As defined in Foundations of Climate Mitigation Target Setting 
published by the UNEP Finance Initiative (unepfi.org/wordpress/

2 When we first developed BlueTrack, the best available scenario 

to develop Paris-aligned benchmarks for our financing portfolios 
was the International Energy Agency’s Sustainable Development 
Scenario (SDS) which was aligned to a 1.7°C world. The 2025 
targets set for the Energy and Power sectors were informed by 
the SDS scenario.

Update on progress against targets

We had set targets for our Energy and Power 
portfolios in 2020, and since then we had 
expanded the scope of sectors covered under a 
target to also include Cement, Steel and 
Automotive manufacturing. 

Financed emissions metrics

Additionally, we had announced a convergence 
point for the UK Housing sector. For all sectors 
where we have previously set targets, we have 
reported progress as at December 2023. 

We will keep our policies, targets and progress 
under review in light of the rapidly changing 
external environment and the need to support 
governments and clients both in delivering an 
orderly transition and providing energy security. 
It is important to note that progress towards our 
targets will likely be variable and non-linear. 

We may need to adapt our approach to respond 
to external circumstances and to manage the 
effectiveness and impact of our support for the 
transition, while remaining focused on our 
ambition of becoming a net zero bank by 2050.

Progress against 
our BlueTrackTM sector targets

TM

This report provides an update on our progress 
towards achieving our previously announced 
2025 and 2030 BlueTrack
 sector targets. In 
2023 and cumulatively, there are a number of 
drivers behind the changes in our portfolio 
emissions, including changes in our financing 
across both our lending and capital markets 
financing activity, our clients' emissions, client 
data and metrics such as company valuation, and 
other data inputs and methodology updates as 
defined in our Financed Emissions Methodology 
paper (published in 2024). We expect to continue 
to see these impact our metrics in the future as 
data availability and quality, methodologies, 
guidance, and best practices for calculating our 
financed emissions metrics – all of which include 
differing levels of estimation –continue to evolve 
and be refined.  
Energy

To date our absolute financed emissions from 
our upstream Energy portfolio are down 44% to 
Δ
42.5 MtCO2e
 from our 2020 baseline – an 
additional 12% reduction from our 2022 level. Of 
our total financed emissions, c.79% was related 
to oil, gas and natural gas liquids (NGLs) 
production, with NGLs being relatively 
immaterial. The remaining c.21% was 
attributable to coal production. Our progress in 
2023 largely reflects reductions in our total 
financing volumes for this portfolio as well as 
impacts from changes in company book values 
which can fluctuate year to year and thus impact 
cumulative and year-over-year progress (either 
positively or negatively) on our target.
Power

In 2023 our Power generation portfolio achieved 
a 26% cumulative reduction in emission intensity 
– an additional 17% reduction from our 2022 
levels. This reflects our clients' continued 
progress in reducing their own emissions 

intensity, which was identified in part through 
improved data collection and analysis, as well as 
net reductions in the intensity of our new lending 
activity – but was partially offset by a higher 
intensity mix for our capital markets financing. 

the decreased intensity reflects our clients' 
continued progress in achieving emissions 
reductions and a shift in our financing activity mix 
towards lower-emissions clients.
Automotive manufacturing

Additionally a material portion of our 2023 
progress was driven by a short-term transaction. 
There is a risk that we are not able to replace this 
with a transaction(s) of similar size and emissions 
intensity which could result in an increase in our 
reported emissions intensity.

TM

Within our Power portfolio our clients' ability to 
continue transitioning, and therefore our ability 
to continue increasing our green and transition 
financing to help deliver our BlueTrack
Sustainable Financing targets, are dependent, at 
least in part, on supply chains for renewable 
energy, required investments in grid 
infrastructure, a stable or positive policy 
environment, and other factors potentially 
beyond our control, including our clients' 
strategic or financing decisions. 

 and 

Despite our progress to date and the actions we 
have taken to manage our portfolio, the 
likelihood of achieving our targets – particularly 
the 2025 target where the potential 
management actions are narrowing – could be 
significantly impacted by the variables and 
dependencies described on this page. 
Cement

The emissions intensity of our Cement portfolio 
has reduced by a cumulative 8% against our 
2021 baseline – a decrease of 6% from last year’s 
metric. During 2023 we’ve seen a material 
number of our clients in this sector update their 
emissions intensity targets and receive SBTi 
validation as 1.5°C-aligned.
Steel

Our Steel portfolio emissions intensity has 
dropped by c.16% from our 2021 baseline – an 
additional 5% decrease this year. During 2023 

During 2023 our Automotive manufacturing 
portfolio's emissions intensity remained broadly 
flat. This reflects a reduction in the emissions 
intensity of our clients as they increase their 
electric vehicle sales, but was partially offset by 
year-over-year reductions in our clients' green 
bond issuance and a net increase in the 
emissions intensity of our lending activity due to 
the mix of our portfolio.
Future target progress

To date, emissions reductions in the real 
economy have not been sufficient to align 
economies to a 1.5°C pathway. 

We expect our progress against these targets will 
continue to be non-linear, due to the many 
external dependencies and variables beyond 
Barclays' control that may determine the pace of 
transition. For example, a recent assessment  
identified that plans, projections and policies for 
fossil fuel production by governments are not in 
line with the goals and timelines of the Paris 
1
.
Agreement

Going forward our metrics will continue to have 
the potential to reflect different levels of volatility 
and could be impacted by a variety of external 
factors, including but not limited to: 

• The pace and timing of our clients’ progress, 

on their individual transition pathways

•

Future technological advancements

• The public policy and regulatory environment

• Geopolitical or regional developments

• Updates to data inputs used by BlueTrack

TM

(e.g. company valuations).

The volatility of the mix and volume of capital 
markets financing, which is included in our 

Barclays PLC

Annual Report 2023 89

metrics, may also result in significant increases 
and decreases in our metrics. Our ability to 
achieve our targets may be affected positively or 
negatively by these external factors.

Our target progress in future years could be 
impacted by client portfolio decisions driven by 
other non-financial factors, such as counterparty 
risk, and other relevant business considerations. 
Changes in our financing activity for a single 
client within a portfolio can have a significant 
impact on our reported metrics and progress and 
may be outside of our control.

Progress against our targets may also be 
impacted by management decisions based on 
key drivers unrelated to climate or the transition, 
for example prudent risk management practices.

Specifically across the Cement, Steel and 
Automotive manufacturing portfolios, in addition 
to the general risks and dependencies outlined 
above, these targets are particularly sensitive to 
even minor changes in our financing mix or 
clients' emissions intensity, given the relatively 
limited number of clients included in these 
portfolios – so progress towards these targets 
could be particularly volatile and significantly 
impacted by the portfolio and client 
dependencies outlined above.

Managing our portfolios

We continue to manage our portfolios, balancing 
between our commercial objectives, prudent risk 
management practices and other non-financial 
objectives in support of our strategy. As part of 
this we take into account our relevant climate-
related risks and considerations, including how our

portfolios are performing against our BlueTrack
targets so this can be evaluated in context 
alongside other relevant business metrics.

TCFD Strategy Recommendation (b)  |  Strategic Pillar 2

We monitor our performance against our climate 
targets on a regular basis. Where we identify 
targets are potentially at risk of being missed – 
particularly as target dates draw nearer and the 
opportunities for us to take management actions 
narrow – we will continue to reassess our 
approach, taking into account broader business 
considerations including potential franchise 
impacts.

During 2023 we have continued to invest in 
building improved reporting, tools, and 
processes including our Client Transition 
Framework, which enables us to adjust 
management oversight based on our evolving 
estimates of our future potential performance 
against these targets. 
+ Further details of how climate risk-related 

considerations are managed can be found in the 
managing impacts in lending and financing section on 

page 236.

Client Transition Framework (CTF)

The CTF, first piloted in 2022, supports our 
evaluation of our corporate clients' current and 
expected future progress as they transition to a 
low-carbon business model.

We conduct these assessments annually for 
corporate clients in the Corporate and 
Investment Bank that are in-scope for sectors 
 targets have been set. As 
where BlueTrack
TM
new BlueTrack
 targets are set the CTF will be 
applied to our corporate clients in those sectors.

TM

During 2023 we enhanced our CTF based on 
recommendations from the external review of 
our pilot. The continued development of the CTF 
leverages climate expertise across Barclays and 
is informed by the evolving landscape and 
guidance from third-party frameworks such as 
TPI, CA100+ and SBTi, and other industry 
initiatives including the UK's Transition Plan 
Taskforce, and GFANZ. We have maintained the 
general structure of our assessments with 
component scores aggregating into an overall 
CTF score. 

The ambition component seeks to assess a 
client's alignment with our emissions reduction 
targets and 1.5°C scenario benchmarks across 
the past, present, near- and long-term future 
emissions. In our scoring assessments we place 
a higher weighting on their past, present and 
near-term future emissions targets than on their 
long-term ones.

The credibility component seeks to assess the 
qualitative elements of a client’s transition plan. It 
considers criteria that indicate the likelihood a 
client will meet its targets, such as board 
oversight, low-carbon technologies employed, 
and green capital or operational expenditure 
plans. We more heavily weight the criteria that 
are critical to having a credible plan than those 
that are determined to be supporting criteria. 

Most of these criteria are consistent across 
sectors, however, we also consider some sector-
specific criteria. In total we evaluate over 80 data 
points for each assessment. Examples of our 
CTF criteria include, but are not limited to: 

• The company’s ambition and targets to 

reduce operational (Scope 1 and 2) emissions 

• Historic Scope 3 disclosures and Scope 3 

reduction targets, along with a 2030 target 

• Any expansion of high-carbon activities  

• Forward-looking green capex plan to achieve 

their targets.

The sub-scores for each component are 
combined to arrive at an overall CTF score from 
T1 (best) to T5 (worst). 

We have codified where clients would be deemed 
out-of-scope for our CTF assessments. We 
have set a minimum revenue share threshold to 
identify which clients are required to be 
assessed, though clients below this threshold 
may still be assessed.

Embedding the CTF 

CTF assessments are increasingly used to inform 
decision-making across Barclays, including client 
engagement, restrictions on financing and 
capital allocation.

During 2023 we expanded how CTF scores are 
used in support of our broader climate strategy. 
The CTF informs our engagement with clients while 
also helping to identify and manage transition risk in 
our own financing portfolios.

Capital is critical for a successful energy 
transition and we are focusing our financing 
towards clients actively engaged in the energy 
transition. The scale of our business gives us the 
opportunity to help finance the energy transition 
– to use our global reach, products, expertise and 
position in the global economy to work with our 
clients, including those in the Energy sector, as 
they transition to a low-carbon business model. 

In 2023 we began climate-specific engagement for 
those clients with CTF scores of T4 and T5, 
facilitated by a newly established Client Transition 
Review Forum (CTRF). 

The CTRF consists of senior representatives from 
across Sustainable Finance, ESG & Sustainability, 
Climate Risk, Portfolio Management, and Banking 
and is chaired by the Head of Sustainable Finance. 
Informed by the CTF, this new forum conducts 
holistic reviews of our business appetite alongside 
the future client relationship potential. These are 
informed by the CTF assessment and take into 
account consideration of relevant risks and other 
business factors.		

We have found this engagement helps increase 
our connectivity with these clients and can be 
useful in identifying opportunities to further 
finance their transition. 

We are also using the CTF scores to inform our 
business and credit appetite as we look to 
manage transition risks within our portfolios. To 
do this we have begun implementing CTF-linked 
mandate and scale limits.

The CTF approach is kept under review and we are 
considering enhancements in 2024, including 
reviewing the weightings for criteria such as energy 
clients capex, to align elements more closely to our 
updated Climate Change Policy. 
CTF results

These reviews help determine our financing 
appetite for these clients (including consideration 
of client retention and conditions to refinancings), 
alongside implications for our emissions 
reduction targets, commercial, credit and 
reputational impacts.  Notwithstanding the 
outcomes of the CTRF reviews, financing 
decisions are transaction specific, and will 
continue to be subject to consideration by 
relevant committees, such as in relation to credit 
risk, reputation, and capital impact.  

As a newly established forum, its governance of the 
CTRF will continue to evolve to ensure it remains fit 
for purpose. 

We reviewed over 300 client counterparties at 
the CTRF in 2023, engaging with clients as 
appropriate, to help build awareness of the need 
to transition and gather information on how we 
can best support them in their journey. The CTF 
helps us prioritise client engagement, focusing 
on those most at risk of falling behind our 
transition expectations.

We have also begun to use the results from the 
CTF assessments to drive engagements with 
clients, facilitating discussions about their 
transition plans and providing insights such as 
highlighting how they benchmark against their 
peers. 

Note: Charts and figures exclude clients determined to be out 
of scope for the CTF assessments. Clients may have scores in 
multiple sectors but are included only once to avoid double-
counting.

Using our updated CTF methodology we 
completed assessments covering over 1,250 
counterparties during 2023 across our Power, 
Energy, Steel, Cement, Automotive 
manufacturing and Aviation BlueTrack
portfolios.

Energy and Power

Context: The Energy and Power transition

The successful transition of the Energy and 
Power sectors is crucial to achieve net zero by 
2050 as together they account for 75% of global 
GHG emissions, the majority of which come from 
the combustion of fossil fuels by end users – for 
1
example, in automotives and power generation
. 
Emissions from fossil fuel extraction, including 
from flaring and venting, is also significant – and 
responsible for 40% of global methane 
2
.
emissions

The global economy still uses fossil fuels for 
many essential activities – including electricity 
generation, transport and heating. The IEA 
scenarios to limit global warming to 1.5°C 
assume continued but reducing use of fossil fuels 
as part of the energy mix.  

As Energy and Power play a fundamental role in 
society, the transition must balance the need to 
address energy security and shift energy supply 
while meeting energy demand. Consideration 
must also be given to the need for a just 
transition, ensuring equitable access to energy 
across communities. 

We will continue to support an energy sector in 
transition, focusing on the diversified energy 
companies investing in low carbon and with 
greater scrutiny on those engaged in developing 
new oil and gas projects.
Notes:

Reducing our Energy and Power-financed 
emissions 

We have set targets to reduce our financed 
emissions from our Energy and Power portfolios 
in line with the decarbonisation pathway set out 
in the IEA Net Zero scenario (IEA NZE).

To meet our targets we utilise our full toolkit 
including CTF assessments, client engagement, 
portfolio management and restrictive policies, 
which are included in our Climate Change 
Statement.

As outlined on page 90 above, our CTF 
assessments evaluate over 80 data points for 
each assessment and, in relation to Energy and 
Power, include the following additional criteria:

• Methane emissions reduction targets (for 

Energy) 

• Commitments to phase-out thermal coal (for 

Power)

We actively engage with clients to help build 
awareness of the need to transition and gather 
information on how we can best support them in 
their journey. The CTF is helping us to prioritise 
client engagement, focusing on those most at 
risk of falling behind our transition expectations.  

We have established a climate portfolio 
management team to steer our portfolio 
towards achieving our targets and manage 
transition risks, using CTF scores to inform our 
business and credit appetite.

Total exposure to the Energy sector is subject to 
a constrained and closely monitored aggregate 
risk appetite. We have begun implementing CTF-
linked credit limits for the clients most at risk of 
failing to transition in line with our targets and 
climate risk appetite – currently identified as 
those with scores of T4 and T5.

We have a Climate Change Statement which sets 
out our positions and approach to sensitive 
sectors. In 2024 we have updated the Climate 
Change Statement to include new requirements 
for the Energy sector and restrictions on the type 
of exposures and risk we will finance going 
forward.

Barclays PLC

Annual Report 2023 92

Notwithstanding the outcomes of the CTRF 
reviews, financing decisions are transaction 
specific, and will continue to be subject to 
consideration by relevant committees, such as in 
relation to credit risk, reputation and capital impact.

By 2026, we will only provide financing to Energy 
clients with Scope 1 and 2 emissions reduction 
targets, methane emissions targets, and 
commitments to end all routine and non-
essential venting and flaring.

Clients are fully aligned with our NZE targets. This requires net zero targets (NZE 1.5°C-aligned 
or equivalent) across all relevant scopes, including Use of Sold Product (Scope 3, Category 11) 
by 2050 (for Energy), evidence of strong progress already made, and disclosures of advanced 
planning to reduce emissions further. 
Clients have targets across all relevant scopes and strong plans but may be missing some of 
the clarifying details of a T1 plan – or may not have demonstrated strong steps taken to date.
Clients may have very ambitious targets but lack the details to evidence that they will achieve it, 
a weak target but robust disclosures evidencing that they will achieve it, or a combination 
thereof. Energy clients without Scope 3 disclosures and Scope 3 targets cannot achieve better 
than T3.

Clients have poorly disclosed plans. They generally have some combination of targets that are 
weaker than the scenarios require, disclosures lacking in detail, or limited evidence that steps 
are already being taken.

T5  
(worst)

Clients have the default and lowest score. These clients provide limited publicly available 
information on their sustainability targets and strategy. A client must have publicly 
demonstrated transition planning including some evidence of their historic, current and future 
emissions reduction efforts to score better than T5.

Aviation

Currently there are no alternative power 
technologies – such as electric or hydrogen – for 
commercial aircraft that are expected to be at 
scale for the foreseeable future. Therefore, 
decarbonising the Aviation sector over the next 
10-15 years will require a significant increase in 
the historical pace of emissions reductions – 
which will be dependent on both the price and 
availability of sustainable aviation fuel (SAF) and 
the continued production and delivery of lower-
emissions aircraft. 
Our Aviation emissions intensity target

We have set a target to reduce the financed 
emissions intensity of our Airlines portfolio by 
11-16% by end of 2030 against a 2023 baseline, 
 methodology:
calculated using our BlueTrack

TM

• The lower emissions reduction in the range 

reflects a convergence point for our portfolio 
with the MPP PRU scenario, which is consistent 
with limiting global warming to 1.5°C.

• The higher emissions reduction in the range is 

aligned to the rate of emissions intensity 
reduction in the MPP PRU scenario, consistent 
with our approach for our other existing 2030 
targets.

Estimating our financed emissions

Barclays is a founding signatory to the Pegasus 
Principles – the first climate-aligned finance 
framework for the Aviation sector, developed by 
the Rocky Mountain Institute (RMI) in partnership 
with global banks and in consultation with leading 
airlines and lessors, The Pegasus Principles will 
launch publicly this spring.

In developing our approach for the Aviation 
sector we have worked closely to align our 
BlueTrack™ methodology with this common 
framework we expect will also be used by a 
number of other peer banks. By aligning 
ourselves with an emerging industry consensus 
approach we hope to create consistency and 
transparency for our clients and for our 
stakeholders in our own reporting. 

In line with the Pegasus Principles we are estimating 
the financed emissions and emissions intensity of 
our Aviation portfolio using a physical intensity 
metric, gCO2e/revenue-tonne-kilometre (gCO2e/
RTK). The scope of this portfolio target includes 
emissions related to direct combustion of jet fuel 
by aircrafts (tank-to-wake/Scope 1) and 
upstream production and refining (well-to-tank/
Scope 3) for commercial passengers (including 
belly cargo) and dedicated air cargo operators.

Emissions scope can differ based on the actual 
operator of the aircraft, as the owner of the 
aircraft may not necessarily be the operator – 
lessors versus airlines, for example. Military 
aviation, corporate jets, general civil aviation, tour 
operators and multi-modal logistics companies 
are out of scope due to low materiality (as a share 
of sector emissions) and data availability 
challenges.

Barclays PLC

Annual Report 2023 93

To do this we have partnered with PACE (Platform 
for Analysing Carbon Emissions), a Pegasus 
Principles-qualified data provider, to provide 
granular emissions and activity data based on 
specific flight routes and aircraft flown for each 
airline operator.

Further details on our financed emissions methodology can 
be found in our latest Financed Emissions Methodology paper 
(published in 2024) at: home.barclays/esg-resource-hub/
reporting-and-disclosures/

Future progress against this target

The general factors outlined on page 89 in 
relation to progress against our targets will 
equally be relevant to this portfolio. Additionally, 
and more specifically, we are clear as to the level of 
emissions reductions required to align with the MPP 
pathway – but we recognise there are many 
dependencies and variables outside of our control, 
and that of our clients, which will determine how 
quickly emissions intensity can reduce in this 
sector.

We note that our clients’ ability to meet their own 
targets is dependent on continued regulatory, 
policy, technical, and supply chain support for the 
industry – including the future availability and price 
of SAF – and clients' progress towards achieving 
their targets may impact our ability to achieve our 
own.

Additionally we note that, while we are setting an 
2030 interim target, many of our clients have set 
their own interim targets to a 2035 date to 
specifically account for hoped-for growth in SAF 
production – and, since the level and timing of 
that growth is an imperfect estimate, the 
pathway to our targets may not be linear (or 
close to linear), and may limit our ability to 
accurately determine whether we are on path to 
achieve, or are able to achieve, our own targets.

Agriculture

Barclays finances customers and clients across 
the agriculture-food value chain – from farmers 
and producers of food products to retailers and 
restaurants. As one of the largest lenders to 
farmers in the UK, Barclays is well placed to 
provide support through the changing nature of 
the Agricultural sector – in particular the ongoing 
shifts in consumer diets. Other factors important 
to consider are the impact of decarbonisation on 
broader food security and affordability, where 
upside and downside risks exist depending on the 
form the transition takes as well as the 
opportunity for carbon sequestration and 
improving biodiversity – given the sector controls 
71% of land in the UK.
+ Further information on our management of nature-related 

risks, including in the UK Farming sector, identified during 
our TNFD assessment of our European Agriculture and Food 
portfolio can be found on page 276.

To support UK farmers through this transitional 
period, Barclays finances activities that aim to 
reduce emissions in Agriculture and result in 
nature-positive outcomes. This includes 
investment in low-carbon farming measures and 
financing to improve machinery energy efficiency. 
We also have a dedicated Agriculture Technology 
Fund to support farming clients undertaking more 
sustainable practices or implementing energy-
efficiency improvements. In addition, we support 
early-stage companies developing technology 
solutions needed for the transition to net zero 
through our Sustainable Impact Capital portfolio. 
For example, in 2023 we invested in Agricarbon – 
a UK-based soil carbon measurement start-up. 
+ Further details on our Sustainable Impact Capital can be 

found on page 117.

Barclays engages with farmers to explore the 
challenges and opportunities that may emerge 
from the decarbonisation of the Agricultural 
sector. In 2023 we launched a survey of our UK 
Livestock and Dairy farming clients to better 
understand the challenges they may face in 
progressing towards net zero. 

We also work individually with clients using our 
Client Transition Tool (CTT) to identify nature 
and decarbonisation risks, as well as considering 
social risks. We support peer-to-peer learning 
through our Farm to Farm initiative that 
facilitates events for farmers in similar 
geographic areas to cultivate innovative 
sustainable farming practices. Over 100 farming 
clients attended Farm to Farm events in 2023, 
with further events planned for 2024. 
Estimating our financed emissions	

There are significant challenges to calculating 
emissions for the Agricultural sector, notably a 
critical lack of data on the activities and practices 
of our agricultural customers and clients, and 
modelling challenges around agricultural 
emissions intensity. This is exacerbated by the 
highly disaggregated nature of the farming 
industry – characterised by a large number of 
small farm holdings – which makes collating and 
processing data challenging, and requires the use 
of estimated data. 

As a result Barclays has focused its initial 
assessment on the UK Dairy and Livestock 
sector – which is responsible for c.70% of UK 
total agricultural GHG emissions. Barclays is 
setting a target to reduce the absolute emissions 
(MtCO2e) of our UK Dairy and Livestock portfolio 
by 21% by end of 2030, against a 2023 baseline – 
in line with the Balanced Net Zero (BNZ) 1.5°C-
aligned scenario developed by the CCC.

To help advance approaches to Agriculture-
financed emissions measurement, and target 
setting in the banking sector more broadly, 
Barclays is a member of the Banking for Impact 
on Climate in Agriculture (B4ICA) working group – 
which produced an introductory guide on target 
setting for the sector in 2022 and worked on a 
further update over 2023.

Future progress against this target

The general factors outlined on page 89 in 
relation to progress against our targets will 
equally be relevant to this portfolio. Additionally, 
and more specifically, the transition of the UK 
Dairy and Livestock sector is significantly 
dependent on broader consumer behavioural 
change and public policy interventions – which 
are outside Barclays' control and may affect our 
ability to achieve this target.    

Further, we expect the data underlying the UK 
Dairy and Livestock model to continue to evolve 
and be refined in order to address the challenges 
outlined above, and that this could impact our 
metrics and this target.

Carbon Clarity partnership supports UK farmers

Launched in 2018, the Rebuilding Thriving Local Economies initiative was launched in four 
locations across the UK to identify how Barclays can provide support over and above what we do 
every day as a bank. By collaborating with local people and organisations, it has focused on 
helping individuals develop skills and confidence – as well as supporting businesses to grow. In 
2023 Barclays partnered with The Royal Countryside Fund to expand its Carbon Clarity 
programme and provide free support for 53 farms in Somerset and Norfolk to understand how 
they could better manage carbon. The programme offered an introduction to carbon reduction 
on farms through group workshops, one-to-one support, and assistance in creating a carbon 
‘action plan’.

UK Commercial Real Estate

Estimating our financed emissions

The Commercial Real Estate (CRE) sector has a 
role to play in the decarbonisation of UK 
buildings, the second-highest-emitting UK 
sector. CRE represents the next highest portion 
of GHG emissions in that sector after residential 
buildings, primarily from the fossil fuel heating 
systems used. There are number of significant 
challenges to decarbonising the entire UK 
buildings sector, which require engagement and 
systematic change, outside of Barclays’ control 
and as further outlined on page 97. CRE sector 
challenges are further compounded by the 
added complexity of landlord-tenant dynamics – 
which requires collaboration on minimising 
energy use, sharing of energy data and 
consideration of energy intensity of fit-outs and 
retrofit solutions. Further, the diverse building 
stock in the UK is likely to require tailored client 
strategies for these retrofit solutions.

The different characteristics of the clients in this 
portfolio – which include institutional real estate 
investors and quoted real estate companies with 
their own transition strategies and stakeholder 
expectations – mean there are different and  
additional potential drivers of transition in this 
portfolio. Further, the relationship-led nature of 
the UK Corporate Bank and its in-house asset 
management expertise enables a client-first 
approach to influence transition planning at a 
portfolio level. We are therefore setting a target 
for this portfolio but recognise that there are 
significant challenges to achieving it as a result of 
factors outside of Barclays' control.

The in-scope portfolio represents the majority of 
the UK commercial and residential real estate 
investment financing to assets across a diverse 
range of sub-sectors including office, retail, 
industrial and logistics, and residential properties 
managed within the UK Corporate Bank.

To support the transition of our commercial real 
estate clients we have set a target to reduce the 
2
financed emissions intensity (kgCO2e/m
) by 
51% by end of 2030 against a 2023 baseline, 
calculated using our BlueTrack
 methodology 
and integrating the approach recommended by 
PCAF.   

TM

The emission reductions required aligns with 
CRREM 2022 – the leading global standard and 
initiative for operational decarbonisation of real 
estate assets – which provides the granularity of 
pathways for sub-sectors within the in-scope 
portfolio. We may expect our CRREM pathway to 
change if the portfolio materially changes.  

The high proportion of commercial properties 
within scope has created challenges in data 
matching to external sources. Consequently, we 
are investing in our systems to increase the data 
coverage and decrease the use of estimations in

Future progress against this target

The general factors outlined on page 89 in 
relation to progress against our targets will 
equally be relevant to this portfolio. Additionally, 
and more specifically, CRE is dependent on 
broader industry and regulatory changes which 
are required to deliver the decarbonisation of the 
UK energy grid, the phasing-out of fossil fuel 
heating, and the maturity of supply chain to 
deliver the required retrofit solutions. Regulation 
and policy advancement will also play a key role, 
especially in relation to supporting low-carbon 
heating and setting requirements in relation to 
EPC standards. These changes are outside 
Barclays' control and may affect our ability to 
achieve this target.

Further, as the data underlying our model 
continues to evolve and be refined to address 
the challenges outlined above, this could impact 
our metrics and this target.

We will continue to engage with clients to 
understand their approach to the transition and 
how Barclays can best support – ranging from 
education to tailored loan solutions. Over the 
medium term, supporting new residential 
developments through our Sustainable 
Residential Development Framework – which 
enables the classification and tracking of 
residential development loans to our UK 
Corporate Banking clients, as well as the 
deployment of sustainability-linked loans – which 
will support our housebuilding clients in achieving 
their sustainability goals including reducing 
emissions of new homes built.

) (Indexed December 2022 = 100)
Physical Intensity (kgCO2e/m

Buildings contributed 17% of total UK GHG 
emissions in 2022, of which residential buildings 
represented 75% – primarily from the use of oil and 
gas in heating and hot water. Decarbonising UK 
homes is a complex challenge that will require 
widespread engagement and systemic change. 

In an effort to confront and quantify these 
challenges we are expanding the scope of our 
previously announced UK Residential Real Estate 
convergence point. The expanded scope, renamed 
to UK Housing sector, now includes Social Housing 
and Business Banking Real Estate portfolios, 
alongside the previous scope of Barclays UK 
residential and Private Banking mortgage portfolios. 
The real estate portfolios within the UK Housing 
sector share similar underlying assets – 99% are UK 
residential properties – thereby referencing the 
same CCC BNZ pathway and sharing similar 
decarbonisation levers. Barclays continues to 
support the UK Housing sector through the 
provision of mortgages, financing of social housing 
providers and expanded product offerings designed 
to support the decarbonisation of the UK Housing 
stock.

Estimating our financed emissions

The decarbonisation of the UK Housing sector in 
line with the CCC BNZ scenario depends mostly on 
external changes and public policy interventions. 
Without these external changes, Barclays cannot 
materially decrease the emissions intensity of its UK 
Housing portfolio. Barclays has therefore chosen to 
identify the 2030 emissions intensity 'convergence 
point' – and measure our progress towards it – but 
not to set a formal target at this time. In 2022 we 
estimated the financed emissions and emissions 
intensity of our UK Residential Real Estate sector by 
integrating the PCAF approach into BlueTrack

TM
. 

In 2023 the emissions intensity for that sector 
increased by c.1% due to increased emissions 
from the UK electricity grid – despite an 
improvement in known EPC ratings for our 
Barclays UK mortgage portfolio. Going forwards, 
the additional portfolios making up the expanded 
scope of the UK Housing sector will be tracked. 

We continue to use the CCC BNZ scenario as the 
benchmark for this sector as it is specific to the UK, 
independent, developed by a credible institution and 
aims to achieve net zero emissions for the UK by 
2050. We are maintaining a convergence point of a 
40% reduction in CO2e emissions intensity by the 
end of 2030. However, to reflect the expanded 
scope, this will now be against a 2023 baseline for 
the UK Housing sector.

Annual Report 2023 98

Drivers of reduction in emissions 
in UK Housing

Key drivers in the transition to net zero in the UK 
Housing sector are the decarbonisation of the 
UK electricity grid and the phasing-out of fossil 
fuels in domestic heating through the switch to 
low-carbon heating – bringing cleaner energy 
into our customers' homes. This will largely be 
driven by the transition of the Power sector 
alongside UK Government policy to drive the 
decarbonisation of the UK electricity grid and 
promote take up of low-carbon heating. Barclays 
can play a role through supporting renewable 
energy projects and clients in the Power sector, 
through Sustainable and Transition Finance 
activity and through Sustainable Impact Capital 
investments.

Another key driver required to reach net zero in 
the UK Housing sector is to improve the energy 
efficiency of existing homes – which includes 
improving the fabric of homes and adopting 
other energy efficiency measures. Other key 
contributors include new homes being built to 
net zero standard, with low-carbon energy 
sources and high energy efficiency ratings, and a 
reduction in energy consumption through 
changes in behaviour.
+ Read more about the Barclays-commissioned report from 
Ipsos UK on consumer retrofitting behaviour on page 112.

As a mortgage lender to retail and business 
banking clients, we can support customers who 
choose to retrofit their properties, switch to low-
carbon heating, and explore ways to reduce their 
energy consumption by providing financial 
products, services and partner offers.

TCFD Strategy Recommendation (b)  |  Strategic Pillar 2

Our Social Housing business engages with clients 
on ESG, including where they are on their 
transition journey and what we can do to support 
them. The sector is already demonstrating above-
average energy efficiency in portfolios and many 
housing associations have a stated objective of 
moving stock to EPC C or better by 2030. Aligned 
to this objective the sector’s energy efficiency has 
been improving – and we are seeing examples of 
deep retrofit projects and newly delivered housing 
schemes with properties rated EPC band A/B.

As an established lender to the Social Housing 
sector, we continue to be an active market 
participant, are structuring some of our loans with 
sustainability metrics where this is within client 
appetite, and have amended covenant terms we 
are prepared to accept to support retrofit. 

However, we expect the overall impact of our 
actions to be low given the barriers to retrofitting 
– such as high upfront costs and current low 
customer demand due to low incentives to 
change. Additionally, the potential management 
actions available to Barclays are limited due to 
this being a portfolio of customers or end users 
who are retail in nature, and predominantly 
consisting of residential properties. 

To see more about Barclays actions with regards 
to the drivers of net zero for UK Buildings, please

Barclays UK mortgages portfolio. 

In line with our efforts to improve the energy 
efficiency of our UK Housing portfolio, Barclays 
has set an updated EPC ambition of 55% of 
properties and collateral in scope of our EPC 
ambition – with a known EPC to be rated band C 
or better by 2030.

3
As at the end of Q3 2023, 47.9%
 of Barclays 
properties and collateral in scope of our EPC 
ambition with a known EPC were rated band C or 
better. 

There are industry-wide challenges to ensure the 
properties in our portfolio have EPC certificates, 
given approximately one-third of housing stock 
in England and Wales does not have a valid EPC 
rating.

We intend to build on this assessment to deepen 
our understanding of the emissions associated 
with our financing activities. Informed by this 
work, we intend to consider the most appropriate 
approach to extend our target coverage with the 
aim of ensuring it covers relevant areas of the 
value chain and/or our financing activities. 

Together, our work to set financed emissions 
reduction targets as part of our commitment to 
the NZBA, and to establish a baseline 
assessment of the emissions associated with our 
financing activities consistent with the PCAF 
Standard, will aid our understanding of the extent 
to which our financing aligns with the goals and 
timelines of the Paris Agreement.

During 2024 we intend to further develop our 
approach to the implementation of the 
Transition Plan Taskforce (TPT)'s 
recommendations – and to include information 
relating to transition planning in future climate 
disclosures. As part of this, we intend to develop 
Sector Transition Strategies aimed at 
summarising our approach to support the 
transition in a particular sector.

Ongoing work on portfolio alignment 

As part of our commitment under the NZBA, we 
1
have set targets for material
 high-emitting 
sectors in our portfolio.

TM

, we have assessed our 

Using BlueTrack
financed emissions and have targets for eight 
high-emitting sectors. These targets cover our 
Energy, Power, Cement, Steel, Automotive 
manufacturing, Agriculture, Aviation, and CRE 
portfolios. We have also set a convergence point 
for UK Housing.

We previously assessed financed emissions for 
Aluminium – and, during 2023, for Shipping – but 
decided against setting targets. For Aluminium, 
this was the result of a detailed review of our 
Metals (Steel and Aluminium) portfolios, which 
found that Barclays does not have a material 
2
. For Shipping, 
exposure to the Aluminium sector
as explained on page 85 in relation to material 
sectors and net-zero-aligned targets, our 
assessment identified that due to our limited 
financing volumes and financed emissions across 
a small number of clients it would be difficult to 
set a target at this time.

During 2023 we also developed a high-level 
modelled assessment of the emissions 
associated with our financing activities across 
our portfolio, largely aligned to the PCAF 
Standard – including undrawn commitments, 
contingent liabilities and capital markets 
financing.

Restrictive policies

In addition to setting sector-specific emission 
reduction targets, consistent with our Purpose 
and driven by consideration of all relevant risks 
and other factors, we have set explicit 
restrictions to curtail or prohibit financing of 
certain activities in sensitive sectors. These 
policies are listed below and set out in detail 
within our statements and policy positions.

Our restrictive policies are regularly reviewed and 
updated in light of the rapidly changing external 
environment and are informed by engagement 
with our stakeholders, including shareholders, 
clients, subject specialists and civil society 
groups. In 2023 this included a review of nature-
related impacts and dependencies and social 
risks of different technology types to help inform 
our approach to due diligence.

Our Climate Change Statement sets out our 
positions and approach to sensitive sectors with 
tightening policy criteria and increasing 
expectations over time. In 2024 we have updated 
the Climate Change Statement to include new 
requirements for upstream oil and gas and 
restrictions on the type of exposures and risk we 
will finance going forward, as well as additional 
restrictions on financing in relation to the 
Amazon Biome, ultra-deep water and extra 
heavy oil).

For further details on the scope and application 
of the updated positions please see page 63.

Barclays will continue to support an energy 
sector in transition, focusing on the diversified 
energy companies investing in low carbon and 
with greater scrutiny on those engaged in 
developing new upstream oil and gas projects. 

The experience of the last few years leads us to 
recognise that client transition pathways will vary 
and the ability of our clients to meet our 
requirements may be affected (positively or 
negatively) by external factors, including, for 
example, the public policy and regulatory 
environment, technological advancement, 
geopolitical or regional developments, energy 
security, cost of living and just transition factors. 
We intend to continue to work with and support 
our clients as they transition their business and 
will monitor and engage with them on their 
progress and the impact of external factors over 
time, through our Enhanced Due Diligence and 
Client Transition Framework.

We anticipate that companies which are unable 
or unwilling to reduce or eliminate their emissions 
consistent with internationally accepted 
pathways may find it increasingly difficult to 
access financing, including through Barclays. 
Further restrictions are set out in our Position 
Statements relating to Forestry & Agricultural 
Commodities as well as World Heritage Site and 
Ramsar Wetlands, which were reviewed in April 
2023. In the latter case only minor changes were 
made.

We will continue to keep our policies, targets and 
progress under review in light of the output of 
both EDD and CTF reviews, the rapidly changing 
external environment and the need to support 
governments and clients, in our efforts to meet 
our ambition of being a net zero bank by 2050.

Forestry and Agricultural 
Commodities Statement

Barclays recognises the critical importance 
of addressing deforestation in delivering on 
global climate and biodiversity goals. A major 
cause of deforestation is the production of 
forestry and agricultural commodities such 
as timber, beef, palm oil and soy, and we 
have a position statement and due diligence 
approach that applies to clients involved in 
these activities (first published in 2019 for 
forestry and palm oil and refreshed in 2020 
to include soy).
We have engaged with investors, clients and 
civil society organisations on this topic, 
which has informed a review of our Forestry 
and Agricultural Commodities Statement. 
This was updated in April 2023 with a number 
of significant changes.
The updated Statement now covers clients 
involved in South American beef production 
or primary processing, and enhances the 
existing requirements for clients involved in 
soy and palm oil. Among other criteria, the 
Statement requires that these clients 
commit to having fully traceable and 
deforestation-free commodity supply chains 
by the end of 2025 – a position aligned with 
industry good practice guidance such as the 
Accountability Framework Initiative¹ and 
Agriculture Sector Roadmap for 1.5°C². 
In addition, the Statement requires that 
clients prohibit the production or primary 
processing of soy or beef from deforested 
areas of the Amazon, in recognition of the 
critical nature of this biome to biodiversity 
and climate objectives.

Financing the transition

In light of the progress made against our 
previously announced targets, and after a 
strategic review of the Group's capabilities, 
market demand and growth opportunities, in 
December 2022 we announced a new target 
to facilitate $1trn of Sustainable and 
Transition Financing between 2023 and the 
end of 2030. We also announced an 
extension of our Sustainable Impact Capital 
portfolio, with a new mandate to invest up to 
£500m into global climate tech start-ups by 
the end of 2027.

Facilitating $1trn of Sustainable and 
Transition Financing

At Barclays we are clear that addressing climate 
change is a complex challenge that demands a 
fundamental transformation of the global economy. 
Low-carbon technologies, infrastructure and 
capacity must be scaled up to meet growing energy 
demands and for the world to reach net zero. The 
financial sector has an important role to play in 
supporting the transition and we are determined to 
play our part. We are deploying financing to help 
scale-up the necessary activities needed in the 
transition to net zero.
+ For further details on climate-related 
opportunities see page 70.

In December 2022 we announced a new target, 
to facilitate $1trn of Sustainable and Transition 
Financing between 2023 and the end of 2030. 
This followed our two previously announced 
targets: to deliver £150bn of social, 
environmental and sustainability-linked financing 
by 2025, which we surpassed in 2021, and to 
deliver £100bn of green financing by 2030, which 
we surpassed in 2023. 

Our $1trn target encompasses the green, social, 
transition and broader sustainability-linked 
financing requirements of clients including 
corporates, governments and the public sector, 
financial institutions and consumers. This 
includes financing of climate and environmental 
solutions including green mortgages, energy-
efficient technology and renewable energy, as well 
as financing for broader social and sustainability 
work – including sustainability-linked structures and 
areas such as affordable housing. We are also 
facilitating funding into green technologies and low-
carbon infrastructure projects, as well as using our 
advisory capabilities, product sets and financial 
expertise to help our customers and clients realise 
their own transitions to a low-carbon economy.

The inclusion of transition financing in this target 
reflects our recognition of the importance of 
supporting the decarbonisation of hard-to-abate 
sectors that are carbon intensive. In early 2024 we 
announced our Transition Finance Framework 
(TFF), which outlines the criteria for transactions to 
qualify as transition financing and sits alongside our 
Sustainable Finance Framework (SFF) to define 
what can be included against this target. 
+ Examples of qualifying transactions can be seen in our case 

studies on pages 30, 115 and 116.

Our ability to meet the $1trn target and progress 
towards it from year to year will be dependent on 
a number of factors and variables outside our 
control. Factors such as market conditions, 
policy, laws, regulation, geopolitical 
developments and stakeholder expectations - 
including approaches to product labelling and 
regulatory scrutiny of green, sustainability-linked 
and social products - could impact lending and 
capital markets appetite and our approach to risk 
management, and therefore present a risk to our 
progress against, and delivery of, the target. 

Barclays PLC

Annual Report 2023 101

Additionally, new climate and decarbonisation 
technologies may scale at varying rates, including 
being reliant on the supply and demand of raw 
materials, which may impact financing volumes. 	
We will continue to review and adapt our approach 
to Sustainable and Transition Financing in 
response to the evolving market opportunities.
Progress against our $1trn target

Δ
During 2023 we facilitated $67.8bn
 of Sustainable 
and Transition Financing, of which $67.4bn was 
sustainable financing, slightly up on 2022 of $65.3bn, 
Δ
and $0.4bn
 was transition financing that qualified 
against our new Transition Finance Framework. Our 
Δ
facilitation of $67.8bn
 of Sustainable and Transition 
Financing in a challenging market demonstrates our 
continued focus on supporting our clients on their 
sustainability journeys.

1
Bond issuance
 was the largest product category in 
2023, accounting for 76% of total Sustainable and 
Transition Financing while loans and equity 
accounted for 19% and 3% respectively. This mix 
showed a small shift towards bond activity and away 
from loans compared to the mix of our 2022 
sustainable financing of $65.3bn, which comprised 
71% bond issuance, 26% loans and 2% equity.  
Sustainable finance

Sustainable financing, aligned to our Sustainable 
Finance Framework, consists of financing for 
dedicated use of proceeds, financing for clients 
with an eligible business mix in relevant 
environmental and social categories, and 
sustainability-linked financing which refers to 
general purpose funding. 

Social financing

Raising finance for clients including 
supranational, national and regional development 
Δ
institutions was a key driver of the $32.4bn
 of 
social financing facilitated in 2023 (2022: 
$30.0bn). In 2023, we continued to see issuers 
aligning their financing commitments to social 
use of proceeds bonds which allocate funds to 
categories such as access to healthcare, 
affordable housing and essential services. As in 
2022, we have also seen the use of social KPIs 
within sustainability-linked financing such as 
targets linked to gender diversity.
Environmental financing

Δ
In 2023, we facilitated $24.1bn
 of environmental 
financing (2022: $21.7bn). This performance 
reflected continued demand from our clients and 
our strategy to work with them to help facilitate 
their transitions to a low-carbon economy.
Sustainability-linked financing

Sustainability-linked bonds (SLBs) and 
sustainability-linked loans (SLLs) are forward-
looking, performance-based debt instruments 
issued with specific sustainability performance 
targets. Our sustainability-linked financing 
Δ
totalled $10.9bn
 in 2023 (2022: $13.7bn). The 
sustainability-linked market continues to be of 
importance to both investors and issuers alike 
who use these instruments to embed their 
sustainability targets into financing commitments 
and we look forward to continuing to work with 
our clients to innovate the product set.

We continue to drive wider commercial and 
strategic opportunities for Barclays UK, 
Corporate Banking and Investment Banking with 
those companies.

We continue to focus on decarbonisation 
technologies supporting transition within 
carbon-intensive sectors, particularly where 
Barclays has meaningful client exposure – such 
as Power, Industry, Transport, Agriculture and 
Real Estate – including solutions delivering 
carbon capture, carbon dioxide removal and 
green hydrogen.

Sustainable Impact Capital portfolio: 
Mandate to invest up to £500m into 
global climate technology start-ups

We firmly believe that innovation is key to tackling 
climate change and we are committed to 
supporting transformative change by investing 
our own capital in entrepreneurial companies. In 
2020 Barclays announced that it would invest up 
to £175m equity capital in environmentally 
focused climate technology companies by 2025 
– helping support our clients to transition 
towards a low-carbon economy, scale solutions 
to environmental challenges, and fill their 
growth-stage funding gaps. 

In evidence of the success of the investments, in 
December 2022 we announced an increase of 
the investment mandate to invest up to £500m 
by the end of 2027.

To date we have invested £138m into 21 
innovative companies. These investments have 
supported many aspects of climate tech 
innovation, from property retrofit solutions to 
long-duration energy storage and hydrogen 
technologies.

Barclays' Sustainable and Transition 
Finance Frameworks
Sustainable Finance Framework

We seek to be transparent about our approach 
to reporting against our sustainable finance 
targets. Our sustainable financing is tracked 
using the methodology set out in the Barclays 
Sustainable Finance Framework (SFF). This 
framework defines the criteria we use for social 
financing, sustainable financing, green financing 
and sustainability-linked financing. This includes 
‘dedicated purpose’ green and social financing, 
‘general purpose’ financing based on eligible 
company business mix and sustainability-linked 
financing, and sets out applicable criteria drawing 
on industry guidelines and principles. 

It should be noted that the methodology is reliant 
on a range of data sources including Dealogic 
and Bloomberg transaction listings and league 
tables, as well as other third-party data and 
verification sources including company 
disclosures to aid the classification of financing 
into eligible green and social categories. 

We recognise that the quality, consistency and 
comparability of the data relied upon is not yet of 
the same standard as more traditional financial 
metrics and presents an inherent limitation to 
the performance reported. We will continue to 
review available data sources and enhance our 
methodology and processes to improve the 
robustness of the performance disclosed. 

The legal and regulatory landscape relating to 
sustainable financing – including the naming and 
categorisation of products as ‘green’, ‘social’, 
‘sustainability-linked’ and otherwise – is rapidly 
evolving with differing regulations across 
jurisdictions. We may wish to revisit our approach 
in that context in the future.

There is currently no globally accepted 
framework or definition (legal, regulatory or 
otherwise) governing what constitutes 'ESG', 
'green', 'sustainable', or similarly labelled products 
– nor is there unanimous agreement on what 
attributes a particular investment, product or 
asset should have to be labelled as such. 

Furthermore, no assurance can be given that a 
globally accepted definition or consensus will 
develop over time. We will continue to monitor 
and comply with applicable jurisdictional 
regulatory taxonomy definitions and product 
labelling obligations as they emerge.

As innovation in sustainable finance continues to 
accelerate, we will continue to review and update 
our SFF, our measurement of our performance 
against targets, and keep our general approach 
under review. 

 We have updated our SFF to version 4.1, 
published in February 2024, which will apply to 
financing volumes from January 2024 tracked 
against our target to facilitate $1trn of 
Sustainable and Transition Financing between 
2023 and the end of 2030.

Transition Finance Framework

Our transition financing is tracked using the 
methodology set out in the Barclays Transition 
Finance Framework (TFF). 

Barclays has developed and published in February 
2024 the first version of the TFF for classifying 
financing as 'transition' for the purpose of 
tracking and disclosing our performance against 
our target to facilitate $1trn of Sustainable and 
Transition Financing between 2023 and the end 
of 2030. 

The inclusion of transition financing in this target 
reflects our recognition of the importance of 
lending, facilitating funding and investing in 
technologies and activities that support GHG 
emissions reduction, directly or indirectly, in 
high-emitting and hard-to-abate sectors.

The TFF is complementary to our Sustainable 
Finance Framework, The TFF augments the 
scope of Barclays' SFF and determines the 
eligibility of transition activities that sit outside 
the sustainable finance already covered by 
the SFF.  

As there is no universal consensus as to how to 
define 'transition' activities, Barclays has 
developed its own definition of transition finance 
as follows: 

Our definition of transition finance

Transition finance is any financing including 
lending, capital markets and other 
financing solutions provided to clients for 
activities – including technologies – that 
support GHG emissions reduction directly 
or indirectly in high-emitting and hard-to-
abate sectors towards a 1.5°C pathway.

The TFF outlines the criteria for eligible 
transactions with a set of defined principles to 
guide us in the application of our definition of 
transition finance as we support high-emitting 
clients and finance real economy 
decarbonisation.

As innovation and market principles in relation to 
transition finance continue to accelerate and 
evolve, we will continue to consider and develop 
our definition of transition finance and the 
coverage under the TFF.

Financing nature

As we execute our sustainable finance strategy, 
we aim to identify opportunities to play a role in 
supporting the financing of nature – in particular 
by bringing together our combined retail, 
corporate and investment banking activities. In 
2023 we identified the opportunity for Barclays 
to contribute to the goal of a nature-positive 
food system as one of three strategic themes 
during the development of our Group 
sustainable finance strategy. Although our 
financing activities in relation to nature may still 
be relatively nascent, we are aiming to expand 
on these and have provided some examples of 
progress made and initiatives developed in 
2023 below.

Supporting soil through technology 
investment

Regenerative agricultural practices have 
significant potential to support climate 
change mitigation and enhance the resilience 
of food value chains through improved soil 
health. Accurate measurement of soil carbon 
is a factor constraining the growth of 
regenerative practices in UK agriculture, 
where Barclays has a strong presence. 

The market for scalable, high-accuracy soil 
carbon measurement is nascent, with several 
early-stage companies pioneering new 
technologies. 

In Barclays UK we believe nature is a key area 
where we can make an impact, due to our 
prominent role in financing UK agriculture and 
agricultural land purchases. During the past 
year we have lent funds to customers to 
purchase land for deployment under the 
Biodiversity Net Gain scheme, and supported a 
leading wilding estate in commercialising its 
activities as it prepares for future sales from 
nature-positive outcomes. We also support 
farmers who seek to apply more sustainable 
farming practices, and have been actively 
investigating how we can support farmers to 
safely access private nature markets. Finally, 
Barclays Eagle Labs is supporting a Venture 
Launchpad cohort run by Carbon13 – focused 
on Land, Food and Nature.  

In 2023 SIC invested in Agricarbon, a UK-
based company that has developed market-
leading soil carbon measurement technology, 
to support the growth of regenerative 
agricultural practices.  

Agricarbon’s end-to-end measurement 
process – which involves automating lab-
based processes, including elemental analysis 
– addresses the gap in the market for 
scalable, high-accuracy soil carbon 
measurement. 

Agricarbon has grown rapidly since its 
commercial launch in 2021, and the company 
already serves an international client base 
including some of the world’s largest food and 
beverage companies, carbon project 
developers, and natural capital asset 
managers. With the proceeds from the 
fundraising, Agricarbon is seeking to 
accelerate its international expansion. 

We are supporting environmentally focused 
start-ups through our Sustainable Impact 
Capital (SIC) portfolio, led by Barclays’ Principal 
Investments team – which has a mandate to 
invest up to £500m by the end of 2027 in the 
equity of these companies, which target the 
goals and timelines of the Paris Agreement.

We are also actively developing nature-related 
products and solutions to support our clients in 
the Corporate and Investment Bank. In 2023 
we strengthened our coverage of Agriculture 
and AgTech companies through a senior hire in 
our Sustainable and Impact Banking team. 

We are also exploring other innovative financial 
structures that can redirect financing at scale 
towards nature, such as debt for nature swaps. 

In addition to client offerings, we have also 
identified the need to build institutional capacity 
to enable us and the broader industry to tackle 
the technical challenges involved in scaling 
financing towards nature-based solutions.

Financing coastal nature-based solutions 
document

The Sustainable Markets Initiative (SMI) 
Financial Services Task Force ( FSTF) is a 
group of CEO-level executives from some of 
the world’s largest banks. It brings together 
financial services leaders to develop and 
enable solutions that aim to help facilitate the 
transition to sustainable markets and support 
the rapid decarbonisation required across the 
real economy.

Barclays is a member of the FSTF and this 
year, alongside HSBC and with support from 
Pollination, developed the Financing Coastal 
Nature-based Solutions (NbS) document.  

The document serves as a practitioner’s 
guide to building awareness and addressing 
key potential considerations for embedding 
coastal NbS in financial structuring.

The guide identifies key considerations for 
financing coastal NbS projects in terms of 
commercial viability, risk mitigation and impact 
reporting through practical case studies, 
including a carbon credit project and debt 
conversion structures. The guide was 
produced as a foundational resource for 
building institutional capacity to understand 
coastal NbS within the context of the financial 
services industry. We expect the points raised 
in the guide, which includes the role of 
different asset classes in shifting capital 
towards coastal NbS, to evolve, incorporating 
the latest trends in coastal NbS financing.

How our sustainable financing 
supports the Sustainable 
Development Goals (SDGs)

The 2030 Agenda for Sustainable Development, 
adopted by all United Nations Member States in 
2015, provides a shared blueprint for peace and 
prosperity for people and the planet – now and 
into the future. At its heart are the 17 SDGs, 
which are a call for action by all countries – 
developed and developing – in a global 
partnership. Barclays is pleased to play its part, 
working in partnership with our stakeholders to 
support the delivery of the SDGs.

Since 2018 we have tracked our annual 
contribution to the SDGs through our financing 
activities. An illustrative breakdown of how our 
social and environmental financing contributes to 
the SDGs is provided in the chart opposite. 

Our financing covers a range of activities 
including debt and equity capital markets, 
corporate lending, trade finance and consumer 
lending. It helps to generate positive social and 
environmental outcomes through financing of 
activities such as, but not limited to, energy 
efficiency, renewable energy, affordable housing, 
basic infrastructure and services. Financing of 
activities set out in our SFF in turn supports 
progress towards achieving the SDGs.

For a full list of eligible social and environmental 
activities see the SFF, which shows how eligible 
social and environmental activities contribute to 
individual SDGs – supported through an analysis 
of the underlying SDG targets. As we evolve our 
understanding of how our financing contributes 
to the SDGs, we will refine our methodology 
accordingly.

Products and services  

We support a wide range of customers and clients 
– from individuals and small businesses through 
our consumer and business banking services, to 
mid-sized and larger businesses and institutions, 
including governments, through our corporate and 
investment banking services.  

Barclays' position in the market, offering retail, 
corporate and investment banking services, 
provides us the opportunity to deliver an end-to-
end proposition – offering innovative products and 
solutions to meet our clients' needs using the 
power of One Barclays. Through collaboration with 
our colleagues across businesses, we have built 
capabilities to help support the innovation needed 
to make the transition a success. For example, 
through our climate-technology escalator we 
provide support for scaling early-stage companies 
through tailored, specialist support at each stage 
of their development from idea to IPO. 

This helps to ensure these companies can access 
capital as they grow, for example through our

Sustainable Impact Capital mandate and network 
of accelerators, our corporate bank and via the 
capital markets.

During 2023, reflecting on engagement with and 
feedback from our clients, we continued to build 
the expertise and knowledge that clients are 
looking for as they scale their businesses and 
transition to a low-carbon economy. This included: 

• Continuing to strengthen our dedicated teams, 

capabilities and propositions supporting 
businesses developing and scaling the 
technologies that will help the world reduce 
emissions

• Providing the finance to scale-up the 

infrastructure and capacity to deliver the 
renewable energy the world requires

• Enhancing our teams through specialist hires in 
areas including sustainable project finance, ESG 
ratings advisory and carbon trading, as well as 
tailored sector training focused on 
decarbonisation pathways.

Working with our clients

We want to be by our clients' side as they 
transition their businesses to operate in a 
low-carbon economy. We are working on 
expanding our sustainable finance offering 
through our specialist teams to help clients 
navigate this period of extraordinary 
change.

Engaging clients through business and 
events 

We believe the transition to a low-carbon 
economy is a defining opportunity for innovation 
and growth – and that we can make the greatest 
difference by supporting and engaging with our 
clients as they transition, using our advisory and 
financial expertise to help them navigate this 
period of extraordinary change.  

As trusted advisers we continue to proactively 
engage with our clients on the risks and 
opportunities for their businesses arising from 
the transition to a low-carbon economy. This 
includes working with climate technology 
companies across their stages of development, 
and with larger, established and/or higher-
intensity clients on their transition journeys.  

We support clients executing their climate 
strategies, including supporting the facilitation of 
initial public offerings for climate-focused growth 
companies, acquisitions of emerging climate 
technology start-ups to diversify incumbent 
clients’ business models, and financing to 
mobilise the decarbonisation of operational 
activities. 

By way of example of the extent of our 
engagement, over the course of 2023 we had 
over 17,500 (2022: 15,000) engagements with 
clients within the Corporate Bank on ESG topics, 
thanks to focused efforts by relationship teams 
to raise ESG topics proactively. 

We also held numerous client events on ESG and 
sustainability topics, including our inaugural 
flagship Sustainable Finance Conference in New 
York with an attendance of over 400 people.
Engaging clients through our Client 
Transition Framework

The CTF, as outlined on page 90, supports us to 
direct our engagement efforts towards clients 
that are most exposed to the risk of failing to 
transition in line with the sectoral pathways 
reflected in our targets.  

This is informed by the outcomes of CTF 
assessments, allowing us to be targeted in our 
engagement efforts and provide clients with 
clear communication on our expectations for 
transition planning. It also helps inform our advice 
on how clients best take advantage of transition 
finance opportunities.
+ Further details on our Client Transition Framework on  

page 90.

Engaging clients through research

We provide thought leadership to support our 
clients using our in-house ESG Research 
capability. Clients who have access to our 
research publications tell us it prompts greater 
evaluation of their business needs – and we have 
seen a number of instances of this leading to 
broader conversations about the transition to a 
low-carbon economy, the ways investors can 
support the transition, and the ways Barclays is 
on hand to support. In 2023 we published over 
475 ESG-focused research reports.

bringing new ideas to life and enabling 
sustainable growth, supporting individuals, 
businesses, communities, and the wider

(fintech) innovation strategy is focused on 
sourcing ideas, technology and talent outside the 
Bank and supporting its adoption and 
dissemination within Barclays. 

Addressing climate change and the transition to 
net zero is a complex challenge. It will require 
innovation to drive real-world decarbonisation. 

The Group Innovation Office works to leverage 
its innovation capability and wider programmes 
of fintech initiatives to support the delivery of the 
Barclays Climate Strategy – and to contribute to 
the growth of Climate FinTech as a sub-sector of 
fintech under Rise, created by Barclays. The 
Group Innovation Office believes Climate 
FinTech has the potential to make the transition 
to a low-carbon future simpler, easier to 
implement and more affordable.

are more closely aligned to Barclays’ strategic 
priorities, including climate and sustainability.
Barclays Rise Growth Academy

The Rise Growth Academy helps scale high-
growth fintechs, including Climate FinTechs, and

Spotlight: GreenArc

Unreasonable Impact

GreenArc, a participant of the Rise Growth 
Academy 2023, is an impact analytics fintech 
that uses advanced AI techniques to help 
financial institutions measure and maximise 
the social and environmental impact of their 
investments. Investors are demanding 
greater accountability and transparency to 
address the growing concerns over the 
validity of sustainable finance, an industry 
concerned with claims of greenwashing, and 
thus a robust, data-driven impact 
measurement system will help enable 
financial institutions to credibly assess and 
report the impact of their investments.

Barclays Experimentation Hub

The Barclays Experimentation Hub – a business and 
technology sandbox-as-a-service offering – 
enables business units across the globe to rapidly 
test and evaluate third-party vendor solutions, 
while also providing a platform to influence industry 
through collaborative events and hackathons. Since 
2022 the Experimentation Hub has enabled 
Barclays to explore new technologies such as 
Generative AI, while also bringing together industry 
experts across topics such as digital currencies – 
exploring the application and business benefits of 
key innovations within technology and fintech. 
Experimentation has also supported Barclays 
teams in keeping pace with the rapidly changing 
landscape within ESG technologies and will 
continue to support Barclays' Climate Goals 
throughout 2024.

Through its Unreasonable Impact programme, a 
partnership between Barclays and Unreasonable 
Group which was renewed in 2023, Barclays has 
supported over 300 high-growth entrepreneurs 
that seek to address pressing social and 
environmental challenges by connecting them 
with a network of mentors and industry 
specialists, including experts from across 
Barclays. Through regional accelerators, at which 
the entrepreneurs can engage with this network, 
and other virtual and in-person events, the 
Unreasonable Impact programme is designed to 
help participating entrepreneurs to build 
strategic relationships and quickly solve key 
challenges facing their business in order to help 
them scale.

After achieving its goal to support 250 ventures 
by the end of 2022, Barclays will support an 
additional 200 entrepreneurs over five years 
through the Unreasonable Impact programme.

With billions in financing already raised by the 
companies that have participated in the 
programme, the partnership’s momentum 
continues to grow – and the ventures are driving 
innovations in a variety of industries from food 
and agriculture to energy and manufacturing.

Barclays has also invested its own capital into 
eight Unreasonable Impact companies through 
1
its Sustainable Impact Capital
 mandate, 
including Airex – creators of a smart air brick – 
and Brill Power, which has developed battery 
management technology that aims to extend 
battery life and throughput.

Barclays UK Consumer 
and Business Banking

We are engaging with our retail and business

want to take to become more sustainable – and 
the role finance can play. We are using this 
insight-led approach to design and develop 
sustainability-related products, offers and 
initiatives that meet the needs of our customers.

Throughout 2023 we have used new digital 
journeys in-app and online banking to support an 
additional 1.9 million customers to become 
paperless and reduce their paper waste by eight 
million envelopes. In 2024 we will continue our 
work to encourage further adoption of paperless 
banking and digitisation of communications, 
further reducing paper volumes. 

In 2023 we made a number of important hires to 
build our sustainability leadership team in 
Barclays UK. These colleagues will help drive our 
client propositions and position us well to drive 
the strategy in 2024. We continue to upskill and 
engage colleagues on sustainability issues to 
build our capability, encouraging colleagues to 
integrate sustainability considerations into their 
work supporting customers. This includes 
tailored training for our Consumer Bank and 
Business Bank colleagues, introducing our 
Sustainability Champions community to bring

Exploring home energy efficiency with British Gas

In partnership with British Gas, we ran an energy efficiency exhibition in the 
Plymouth city centre branch to help local customers explore ways they could make 
their homes more energy efficient. The ‘Exploring Home Energy Efficiency 
Exhibition’ ran for six weeks between October 2023 and December 2023, 
showcasing some of the technology that could help customers improve the energy 
efficiency of their home and potentially help lower their bills. Each week focused on 
a different energy efficiency theme, including low-carbon technology, retrofitting 
and the financial support available to households. Customers were able to learn and 
engage through weekly interactive sessions and Q&A panels made up of speakers 
from British Gas, Barclays and others. To coincide with National Green Careers 
Week in November, Plymouth City Council ran a series of carbon literacy events for 
career changers, job seekers and schools in the branch – and customers had the 
opportunity to take part in a ‘green careers fair’ to understand what a net zero 
career could look like for them.

Barclays UK Greener Home Reward

In 2023 we extended registrations for the 
Greener Home Reward scheme, which offers a 
cash reward of up to £2,000 for eligible 
residential mortgage customers who install 
eligible energy-efficiency-related measures in 
their homes using a registered TrustMark 
installer. We have seen continuing interest in 
microgeneration, with 45% of applications so far 
for solar panels and solar battery storage. 
However, demand for the offer remains limited. 
This exemplifies the challenges the sector faces 
to increase the take up of retrofitting.

Barclays UK is also committed to working 
collaboratively with the UK Government to 
encourage and inform the development of 
strategies and policies to drive more energy-
efficient homes and retrofitting – including 
through industry groups where appropriate, and 
through our own engagement with policymakers. 

Customer retrofitting research 
and parliamentary roundtable

Retrofitting homes with the aim of reducing 
carbon emissions in line with UK net zero 
targets is a challenge Barclays believes 
requires a collaborative response. In 
September 2023 we convened a roundtable 
in Parliament with representatives from UK 
Government, consumer groups, industry 
and academia to discuss a Barclays-
commissioned report from Ipsos UK on 
consumer retrofitting behaviour. The report 
identified potential barriers to action among 
‘able to pay’ homeowners who could 
potentially undertake retrofitting to increase 
the energy efficiency of their property. The 
report made a series of recommendations 
to improve uptake of retrofitting due to 
limited levels of this activity currently. There 
was agreement among roundtable 
representatives that there is a significant 
awareness gap that could be addressed by 
promoting the benefits of retrofitting and 
improving access to practical guidance. 
However, there were a range of views on 
how to share the burden of responsibility for 
these actions – with a number of attendees, 
including Barclays, underlining the important 
role for bolder UK Government leadership 
and policy to drive behaviour change.

Business Bank

Barclays continues to support Business Bank 
clients to understand the case for sustainability, 
recognising that clients are at varying stages of 
their transition to net zero.
Embedding sustainability across the 
Business Bank 

We continue to build our net zero expertise to 
give eligible businesses that bank with us the 
chance to explore the options available to them 
as part of transition plans towards net zero. In 
2023 we provided sustainability training for 
Business Bank colleagues, including Real Estate, 
Agriculture and Specialist Client Solutions teams.

For clients that prefer to self-serve, we created a 
series of educational videos to raise awareness 
of themes relating to the transition to a low-
carbon economy. 

In 2023 we launched an EPC dashboard to enable 
Real Estate Relationship Managers to provide a 
view of EPC ratings across a clients’ portfolio with 
Barclays UK – and use it to discuss potential 
benefits around EPC improvements.

In July 2023 we expanded our existing Asset 
Finance proposition via our partner Propel to 
offer fixed rates on a wider range of green assets 
including new fully electric vehicles, solar 
photovoltaic panels, battery storage units, LED 
lighting, heat pumps and electric vehicle charging 
points. In September 2023 we launched our 
Green Barclayloan for Business, which offers no 
arrangement fees for lending above £25,000 on a 
range of eligible green assets – supporting our 
business clients in their transition to net zero.

How we serve our clients

We continue to evolve our model to support our 
clients and capture the opportunities as they 
transition to a low-carbon economy. 

Following the appointment of the Global Head of 
Sustainable Finance in November 2022, in early 
2023 we established the CIB Sustainable Finance 
Management Team (CIB SF MT) with 
responsibility for driving the sustainable finance 
strategy in the CIB. The CIB SF MT acts as a 
consolidation point for the discussion and 
decision-making of key matters relating to the 
strategic direction of the CIB sustainable finance 
business, reviews financial performance and 
ensures a robust approach to climate risk 
management and controls.

At Barclays we use the concept of the Power of 
One Barclays, which brings our organisation 
closer together to create synergies and provide 
customers and clients with the full range of our 
products and services. We have applied this 
mindset to consider how we can best serve our 
clients' needs relating to Sustainable and 
Transition Financing through an integrated 
approach across Barclays' products and services. 
This has included the strengthening of our 
sustainable finance teams, working together to 
deliver for our clients and embedding 
sustainability across our sector and industry 
coverage teams.
Strengthening our sustainable finance teams

Through the continued investment in our team 
we are able to deliver a fuller suite of products, 
solutions and expertise to clients as they 
transition towards a low-carbon economy. 

During 2023 we invested significantly in our 
sustainable finance capabilities through key 
senior and specialist hires which have  
strengthened our existing teams and expanded 
our sustainable finance product offering. This 
included hiring new Heads of Sustainable Project 
Finance and Carbon & Environmental Products 
Trading, facilitating the expansion of our product 
reach into these areas in recognition of client 
demand and the commercial opportunity. 

We have also continued to strengthen our existing 
sustainable finance teams with the hiring of senior 
specialists including across ESG ratings advisory, 
AgriTech and battery technologies, and regionally 
focused sustainable finance specialists covering 
the Middle East, North Africa and Asia Pacific. 

Following growth in the team over the past few 
years, at the end of 2023 we had in excess of 90 
sustainable finance-focused bankers in the CIB, 
supported by ongoing investment in expertise in 
our sustainable finance and ESG-focused 
functional teams.
Working together to deliver for our clients

We continue to facilitate collaboration across CIB 
teams in order to work more closely together on 
sustainable finance topics and solutions. In 2023 
we created a Sustainable Finance Leadership 
Group bringing together key 'champions' of 
sustainable finance from across the CIB with a 
view to creating more frequent and deeper 
exchanges of ideas – which will help strengthen 
our dialogue with clients and drive better 
outcomes for them.

We believe that the strength of our franchise is 
truly unlocked when we work closely together 
across our teams. Examples of this included 
collaborations between our ESG advisory, 
industry coverage and Sustainable Impact 
Banking teams on M&A opportunities, as well as 
our industry teams bringing technical experts 
into client meetings to discuss 
decarbonisation options.

CIB Sustainable Finance ecosystem

Over the past year we continued to evaluate how 
sectors and companies are best covered by the 
Bank, and have adapted our model accordingly to 
provide the support and resources required by 
our clients. In January 2024 we announced the 
creation of our new Energy Transition Group – 
bringing together our Power, Energy and 
Sustainable Impact Banking (SIB) teams so we 
can better serve as lead advisers to clients in the 
Energy and Power sectors exploring potential 
energy transition opportunities.  

We also announced the creation of our new 
Sustainable Banking Group within Capital 
Markets, combining our Sustainable Capital 
Markets and ESG Advisory team (previously part 
of the SIB team).
Embedding sustainability in our business

Over the course of 2023 we continued to embed 
sustainability across our sector and industry 
coverage teams through a number of important 
initiatives to upskill our bankers and develop their 
expertise to engage with clients on the transition. 

We ran our first sector-level client activation 
programmes – focused on the Building Materials

sponsors and investors with dedicated 
sustainability capital, advising clients on

and Power and Utility sectors – accelerating the 
ability of our bankers to identify and capture 
sustainable finance opportunities by helping 
them focus on key decarbonisation levers in 
these sectors and how to deploy Barclays' 
products and services to help clients 
unlock them.

We recognise the importance of continued 
training and upskilling of our workforce, 
particularly in the rapidly developing climate 
technologies of the future, and ran a series of 
seminars and workshops throughout the year 
covering these key topics. In the second half of 
2023 we also developed a detailed sustainable 
finance training plan for colleagues across the 
CIB, which we will roll-out in 2024.

During 2023 we continued to develop our 
management information as it relates to our 
sustainable finance business, including 
appropriate KPIs and sustainable finance metrics 
on our bankers' scorecards, which are tracked 
monthly – increasing the visibility of our 
performance. We will continue to evolve our 
approach in this area in 2024.

As we see further growth in sustainable finance 
and the ESG market space the focus on controls 
remains imperative to enable our business to 
operate in a precise and scalable way. Dedicated 
ESG review and control fora are being stood up 
at the CIB and individual business level to provide 
oversight of greenwashing risks in the context of 
financing of clients in high emitting sectors. In 
addition, we have continued to strengthen our 
approach to climate risk governance within the 
CIB and review climate risk, financed emissions 
and transition finance metrics at appropriate fora 
and committees to provide financial and 
operational risk oversight.

Federal Republic of Germany: Green Bonds

Barclays acted as Joint Lead Manager on the Federal Republic of Germany’s €5.25bn 10Y Green 
Bond in April 2023, and €4.5bn 30Y Green Bond in June 2023. These transactions are intended to 
support the country’s transition towards a low-carbon, resource-efficient and sustainable 
economy. The funds raised from the bonds will be allocated towards eligible green expenditures 
including all areas of the federal budget that support the overall climate and sustainability targets 
set out in the Federal Republic of Germany’s Green Bond Framework. Furthermore, the eligible 
expenditures are mapped to the six environmental objectives of the EU taxonomy for 
environmentally sustainable economic activities. Barclays is pleased to support the German 
government in continuing its strategy of establishing a green yield curve for the euro area.

investment will also provide significant capital 
to scale Ohmium’s business, including 
accelerating its pioneering research and 
development programmes to reduce the 
cost of green hydrogen production. At that 
time, this transaction was the fifth hydrogen 
deal in 13 months for Barclays’ Sustainable 
and Impact Banking Group, now known as 
the Energy Transition Group, highlighting our 
deep sector knowledge across the entire 
hydrogen technology value chain and 
ecosystem.

Our approach to ESG research is differentiated 
through broad-based engagement with ESG 
issues and higher-quality insights with our 
investor clients. The ESG Research team 
collaborates with Equity and FICC research 
teams to identify and analyse material ESG 
opportunities and risks, and to integrate ESG into 
their analysis and recommendations. The team 
also analyses how investors measure and 
consider ESG factors in the investment process, 
helping asset managers structure their portfolios 
and investment decisions. 

Over 475 ESG-focused research reports were 
published in 2023. Our expectation is that topics 
such as climate change, decarbonisation and 
biodiversity – as well as other sustainability 
themes and specific ESG attributes – will 
continue to grow in importance, and that the 
global momentum behind ESG investing will 
continue at pace, making it an essential requisite 
for a large and growing number of investors. 

During 2023 ESG Research hosted and 
contributed content to client events around the 
world – including Barclays' first Sustainable 
Finance Conference in New York, its fourth 
annual ESG Research conference in London, its 
first Sustainable Finance Conference in 
Singapore, its Sustainable Policy Forum in 
Brussels and its ESG Emerging Market 
Corporate Day.

Sustainable Impact Capital programme 
by Barclays Principal Investments

Barclays' Treasury plays a key role in helping  
Barclays meet its climate goals by allocating, 
managing and governing its financial resources 
effectively and executing sustainable principal 
investments and transactions, supporting 
businesses to advance strategic climate 
objectives in the transition towards a low-
carbon economy. 
Sustainable Impact Capital

Our Sustainable Impact Capital portfolio, 
managed by the Barclays Principal Investments 
team in Treasury, has a mandate to invest up to 
£500m into global climate technology companies 
by the end of 2027 – helping support our clients’ 
transition towards a low-carbon economy. 

+ Further examples of our green innovation financing can be 
found at: home.barclays/sustainability/our-position-on-
climate-change/accelerating-the-transition/sustainable-
impact-capital/

We aim to drive change by strategically investing 
in visionary early-stage climate tech companies 
paving the way for solutions in clean energy and a 
reduction in GHG emissions. The Sustainable 
Impact Capital portfolio targets investments that 
could potentially catalyse transformative 
breakthroughs in technology, infrastructure and 
scalable practices.

Our aim is to bridge financing gaps and support 
the acceleration and scalability of solutions to 
environmental challenges. 

We have made meaningful progress towards 
building a portfolio of strategic investments. 
£138m of our £500m investment mandate has 
been deployed since 2020, with £49m invested in 
2023 – up 42% from 2022. 

We continue to focus on decarbonisation 
technologies supporting transition within 
carbon-intensive sectors, particularly where 
Barclays has meaningful client exposure – such 
as Power, Industry, Transport, Agriculture and 
Real Estate – including solutions delivering 
carbon capture, carbon dioxide removal and 
green hydrogen.

Advanced Electric Machines

Barclays’ Sustainable Impact Capital investment in Advanced Electric Machines (AEM) – a UK-
based sustainable motors and powertrain systems developer and manufacturer – signifies its 
support for innovative automotive technology. With the global transition to EVs there is growing 
demand for key raw materials – especially rare-earth minerals for use in magnets essential for 
EV motor production. However, the limited global production capacity of these materials poses 
a significant challenge.

AEM’s next-generation electric motors and powertrain systems are designed without rare-
earth magnets and copper windings, while focused on performance, range and efficiency. This 
breakthrough not only ensures a sustainable supply chain but also enhances recyclability – 
contributing to a circular economy. 

In an era where sustainable mobility solutions are crucial, Barclays’ investment in AEM 
represents a significant step towards unlocking electric mobility’s potential while addressing 
critical raw material challenges.

Sustainable Ventures

Barclays' Sustainable Impact Capital led Sustainable Ventures' first-ever fundraising round, with 
participation from angel investors. Sustainable Ventures is an active climate tech ecosystem in 
the UK. Its model combines funding, workspaces and expert support services – providing access 
to a pipeline of leading climate tech investment opportunities. Sustainable Ventures’ winning 
concept has supported over 500 climate tech companies to rapidly scale their technologies, 
drive increased returns, and directly create more than 5,500 jobs. Barclays understands that 
scaling climate technology companies require much more than venture capital. The investment 
in Sustainable Ventures affirms our commitment through providing access to the bespoke 
support programmes, professional services, and community these companies need and 
deserve – all designed to accelerate sustainable growth. Our investment will enable Sustainable 
Ventures’ regional expansion, starting with Manchester in 2024 – assisting the region in meeting 
its accelerated 2038 net zero target while delivering inclusive green jobs and boosting the 
economy.

Our Sustainable strategies seek to invest in 
businesses that provide products and services to 
support the transition to a more sustainable 
economy. These identify businesses we believe 
are able to mitigate ESG risks from an 
investment perspective, demonstrate high 
standards of non-financial ESG quality, and 
address sustainability considerations through 
their economic activities by aligning to at least 
one of the UN SDGs. Our Sustainable strategies 
also exclude certain companies that generate 
revenues over our internally defined thresholds 
from adult entertainment, alcohol, armaments,

BISL factors responsible investing into its 
discretionary portfolio and fund investment 
solutions. The vast majority of our clients’ assets 
are managed by external fund managers. We aim 
to assess each of those managers based on their 
ESG credentials among other relevant factors. 
Every manager’s offering is given a single 
standalone score from A to C for ESG 
considerations – reflecting both their intent and 
their outcome. We focus on how ESG is 
embedded across each of five key areas: the 
parent company; the people managing the 
assets; the investment philosophy employed; the 
robustness of the process; and the performance 
achieved. Ultimately, we award an ESG score for 
every fund we recommend or invest in. The team 
uses data from different sources, including 
investment managers and MSCI ESG Manager, 
and as such there may be some limitations in the 
data we use.

Industry initiatives
Private Bank

Barclays Private Bank Investment Management 
became a signatory of the Principles for 
Responsible Investment (PRI) in 2022, 
completing its first reporting to the PRI on 
responsible investing activities in 2023.

Being a signatory to the PRI allows us to publicly 
demonstrate our commitment to responsible 
investment. The PRI defines responsible 
investment as a strategy and practice to 
incorporate ESG factors in investment decisions 
and active ownership. Its goal is to help 
contribute to the creation of a sustainable 
financial system, with signatories committing to 
incorporate ESG issues via the six Principles in 
their investment practice.

Barclays Investment Solutions Limited

BISL became a signatory to the PRI in 2023. Prior 
to this, and since 2016, BISL’s subsidiary Barclays 
Asset Management Limited was a signatory. BISL 
also became a signatory to the UK Stewardship 
Code in 2023, which sets high stewardship 
standards for those investing money on behalf of 
UK savers and pensioners and those that 
support them. Stewardship is the responsible 
allocation, management and oversight of capital 
to create long-term value for clients and 
beneficiaries with the aim of achieving 
sustainable benefits for the economy, the 
environment and society.
Engagement and voting 
Private Bank and Barclays Investment Solutions 
Limited (BISL)

Both the Private Bank and BISL undertake 
engagement and voting in partnership with our 
stewardship services provider, EOS at Federated 
Hermes (EOS), in respect of certain holdings 
2
. We view 
relating to specific services
engagement and voting as an important 
mechanism through which to hold management 
to account and act as a lever to promote change 
in investee companies on material ESG issues 
where appropriate. We believe companies that 
can better manage material ESG issues could be 
less prone to severe incidents such as fraud, 
litigation or reputational risks. 

Voting forms an integral part of the Private Bank 
and BISL's overall stewardship strategy and is 
used as a tactical tool to achieve desired changes 
on ESG issues. Based on various metrics, BISL 
filters EOS's voting recommendations in relation 
to company holdings and, if deemed necessary, 
our portfolio managers may deviate from EOS's 
recommendation. 

At Private Bank, for our direct equity holdings, we 
use our rights as shareholders to seek and drive 
our desired changes. Following receipt of EOS’s 
voting recommendations, our Equity portfolio 
managers meet to discuss this information for a 
select number of voting issues in advance of 
making the voting decision on behalf of our 
clients. Our Equity portfolio managers are 
ultimately responsible for making voting 
decisions.

All voting activities sit alongside engagement 
practices, reflecting both the Private Bank and 
BISL approach of promoting constructive 
dialogue with investee companies by building 
long-term relationships to seek to influence ESG 
and other practices. This is mostly undertaken by 
EOS, which engages on behalf of clients including 
Barclays with a wide range of stakeholders – 
including government authorities, trade bodies, 
unions, investors and NGOs – to seek to identify 
and respond to market-wide and systemic risks.

Both the Private Bank and BISL make their 
engagement and voting activities publicly 
available to all stakeholders on the Barclays 
website. We believe such transparency is an 
integral part of good governance.

Embedding climate and 
sustainability into our business

We are embedding climate and sustainability 
throughout Barclays, taking into account the 
impact of climate-related risks and 
opportunities on our businesses, strategy 
and financial planning. 

Our Climate Strategy is underpinned by the way 
we assess and manage our exposure to climate-
related risk, as well as by our Purpose to work 
together for a better financial future for our 
customers, clients and communities.  

The risks associated with climate change are 
subject to rapidly increasing societal, regulatory 
and policy focus both in the UK and 
internationally. In 2022, Climate risk became a 
Principal Risk within our Enterprise Risk 
Management Framework, aiming to ensure a  
holistic approach to risk identification, 
assessment and management.

Barclays' Climate Risk Framework facilitates the 
structured integration of climate risk 
considerations into the Bank's operations. It 
undergoes regular reviews and updates –
including changes to risk taxonomy, definitions 
and methodology – which align to align the 
Framework with changing regulatory 
expectations and external developments. 
+ Further details on climate risk identification, assessment 

and management can be navigated via the Risk Review 
contents section on page 254.

We continue to build on our inclusion of Climate 
Strategy and climate-related risks and 
opportunities in our financial planning, working to 
further embed these considerations into our 
products and services and operations. 

We have continued to work on embedding 
climate and sustainability considerations into the 
culture of the organisation through training and 
knowledge building. We have developed several 
climate- and sustainability-related mandatory 
and non-mandatory training initiatives across the 
organisation and provided training to a number of 
functions across the Group. 
Impact of climate-related risks 
and opportunities on our business, 
strategy and financial planning

Barclays’ 2023 financial planning process 
included a review of our strategy, its 
implementation, and tracking of our progress 
against climate-related targets – as well as 
capturing a view of climate-related risks and 
opportunities.

During 2023 we enhanced our monthly reporting 
framework to cover a view of the balance sheet 
and revenue from Sustainable Financing. This 
supports our ability to review our sustainable 
financing portfolio at greater granularity and 
improve relevant business engagement through 
the financial planning process. Enhancements 
were made to help us further evaluate the 
portfolio's performance and identify 
opportunities to maximise revenue generation 
activities. 

These outputs have been incorporated in our 
financial planning process for 2023. Our planning 
process also considered current climate policies 
to ensure they are included in the base scenario. 

We also considered impairment over the horizon 
of the financial plan. At this point in time, there 
are no material amendments required to the 
financial plan. 

All key businesses and functions are involved in 
integrating climate-related risks and 
opportunities into our financial planning process. 
Implementing our Climate Strategy is managed 
through central Sustainable Finance teams under 
the Heads of Sustainable Finance for both CIB 
and Barclays UK. We are developing processes 
and levers that we anticipate will allow us to 
further engage and impact the businesses we 
work with. 

For example: 

• The three pillars of our Climate Strategy, as 

well as our Sustainable and Transition 
Financing target of $1trn, are key drivers of our 
finance planning process with a pathway to 
achieve this as well as risks and opportunities 
reviewed with business heads

• We continue to develop our green, sustainable 
and transition finance banking product sets, 
including for retail customers, (for example 
green mortgages), bonds/loans (including 
Project Finance for renewables) and 
securitised products

• We strive to continue to decarbonise our own 

operations, reducing our Scope 1 and 2 
emissions and our Scope 3 operational 
emissions

Barclays PLC

Annual Report 2023 121

• We are tracking progress towards portfolio 

alignment of our financed emissions with the 
goals and timelines of the Paris Agreement 
through BlueTrack™, which includes a number 
of portfolio alignment metrics and levers 
available to manage the portfolio against these 
targets while understanding their financial 
implications. The metrics are subject to 
second-line review by the Climate Risk team to 
assess the strategy against the targets. We 
have developed an internal approach to track 
and monitor progress against our targets and 
how we govern these internally 

• We conduct portfolio reviews to monitor 

whether business activities are conducted 
within Barclays’ mandate and aligned with our 
expectations, and whether they are of an 
appropriate scale relative to the risk and 
reward of the underlying activities. Mandate & 
Scale Exposure Controls form part of our 
overall Risk Appetite Control Framework and 
climate risks have been integrated into annual 
credit portfolio reviews for elevated risk 
sectors since 2020. Furthermore, we have 
introduced mandate and scale limits linked to 
scoring within our Client Transition 
Framework.

Implementing our Climate Strategy (continued)

Barclays PLC

Annual Report 2023 122

A range of scenario analyses was undertaken this 
year with the aim to further uncover areas of risk 
and opportunity, as well as integrate climate 
scenario analysis into our strategic and financial 
planning. This included two climate stress-tests 
with the results allowing Barclays to understand 
resilience to Climate risk in those scenarios.

The strategic review of sustainable financing was 
also refreshed during the year across Barclays UK 
and the CIB. The review built upon both new and 
previously identified commercial opportunities. 
The output was considered in the financial 
planning process, including incremental revenue, 
cost and capital.

Key opportunities continue to reside within 
Equity Capital Markets, Debt Capital Markets and 
lending, and some smaller new markets. 

The planning process included an assessment of 
our financed emissions reduction targets for 
some of our highest-emitting sectors: Energy, 
Power, Cement, Automotive and Steel. Barclays 
has set absolute emissions or emissions intensity 
targets for these sectors and the impacts of 
meeting them are integrated into the financial 
planning process.

Barclays continues to engage with our clients to 
support their transition to a low-carbon 
economy. Our current emissions targets are not 
forecasted to materially impact financial 
performance over the next five years. 

The financial planning process also covered a 
review of our net zero operations strategy.

Building on the hiring of our Heads of Sustainable 
Finance in CIB and Barclays UK, over the past 
year we have continued to grow our existing 
talent with several strategic hires – with a focus 
on expanding our product capabilities as we 
continue to drive performance against our 
selected targets. Each hire will allow us to further 
accelerate our Climate Strategy and increase co-
ordination, with a focus on how we can help our 
customers and clients with their individual 
transitions to a low-carbon economy. 

We will continue to further enhance how our 
Climate Strategy is embedded into the way we 
think about financial planning over the coming 
years – reflecting on the progress we made 
during 2023.

Skills, culture and training  
Building our expertise

We are aware that responding effectively to 
climate and sustainability issues is one of the 
greatest challenges facing businesses, investors, 
and society today. In 2023 we continued to 
educate colleagues on sustainability and climate 
change risk and opportunities, their impact on 
society and the Bank, and Barclays' strategy and 
response. 

As we strengthen our sustainability capability and 
culture, our colleagues continue to build insights 
and expertise to help execute our Climate 
Strategy. We have made online learning available 
to grow everyone’s knowledge, and created 
upskilling for specific areas in line with strategic 
priorities – including mandatory training and 
targeted development for certain teams relevant 
to their roles and responsibilities. This is 
alongside investment in our future pipeline of 
colleague skills through a newly created 
apprenticeship programme. A communications 
campaign informed colleagues of how Barclays is 
responding to climate change and sustainability 
more broadly, reinforcing how they can take 
action – including building their knowledge and 
skills in this area.

Our suite of Sustainability training resources is 
supporting wider awareness across the 
organisation, comprising of videos and e-
learning. We intend to evolve this during 2024. 
The topics covered include addressing climate 
change, principles of sustainability, how we 
support our communities, and modern slavery. 

During 2023 a mandatory online climate risk 
training module was provided to 12,306 
colleagues across Risk, Compliance, Internal 
Audit, Markets Post Trade and Business Banking. 
This training focused on the elevation of climate 
to a Principal Risk.

TCFD Strategy Recommendation (b)  

The 2023 financial planning process used a five-
year climate baseline scenario to consider the 
impacts of climate risks. The baseline scenario 
considered the impact of current and agreed 
climate policies across the UK, US and EU on 
macroeconomic variables such as GDP and 
Unemployment. This was done via a detailed 
assessment of climate policy impacts, likelihood 
of implementation and current level of policy 
progress. The outcome of this assessment led to 
a comparison between the climate baseline 
scenario and the scenarios used for financial 
planning, indicating a current de minimis impact 
on the macroeconomic variables used to project 
financial performance. We will continue to review 
how climate risks manifest in the economy 
through a baseline scenario – and, where these 
impacts increase, will consider those within our 
financial planning process.

Workstreams specifically related to finance have 
been further embedded within our overall global 
financial planning processes, including dedicated 
climate management reporting information. 
Further details of how this work has served as an 
input in our five-year financial planning process 
are set out below – including our approach to 
sustainable financing, targets and capital 
investments. 

During the 2023 financial planning process we 
assessed the financial impact of embedding 
individual parts of our Climate Strategy, new 
initiatives and targets across our businesses. 
This includes the wholesale credit book, 
sustainable financing and sustainable lending in 
the CIB, and initiatives across our retail 
businesses such as green mortgages and 
sustainable investing. Build-out of new product 
capabilities including Global Project Finance are 
also captured.

was delivered to 15,319 colleagues in 2023 
across the Corporate and Investment Bank, 
Trade and Working Capital, Wholesale 
Onboarding and Group FCO, Finance, 
Compliance and Public Policy and Corporate 
Responsibility – further developing colleagues' 
knowledge of the core elements of ESG. This 
module focused on how Barclays manages 
climate risk, as well as covering the Group 
sustainability-related statements and internal 
standards and how they should be applied.

Further details on Barclays' sustainability statements and 
policy positions can be found from page 40.

In Q3 2023, Sustainability September – 
a communications campaign across the 
organisation – helped engage colleagues on key 
sustainability-related topics. This included short 
videos, a series of live recorded conversations 
with senior leaders, and associated reading 
materials. 

To ensure our workforce of the future is well 
positioned to understand climate risk, in 
November 2023 we introduced a new 
Sustainability Apprenticeship – targeting 
internal colleagues and working in partnership 
with an external provider. The apprenticeship is 
one of six selected by industry experts to mark 
His Majesty The King’s Coronation, gaining 
recognition for educating people to understand 
and develop ways to facilitate the transition to a 
low-carbon economy. This will encourage the 
building of a long-term pipeline of knowledge 
throughout Barclays.

We also collaborated with external suppliers to 
deliver accredited development programmes 
for teams seeking to build specialist 
sustainability knowledge. For example, a 
development programme began in 2023 for 300 
Corporate Bank colleagues in our Sustainability 
Academy pilot to develop their climate and 
sustainability knowledge. We intend to support 
more Corporate Banking colleagues through 
the programme during 2024. In addition, we 
delivered training to colleagues in the Business 
Bank on strategies for supporting SME 
customers on their transition to net zero. 

In Barclays UK we launched our Sustainability 
Champions community to bring together our 
most engaged colleagues. In the Consumer 
Bank specifically, we provided training on home 
energy efficiency and climate risk for mortgage 
advisors, and hosted a webinar for mortgage 
brokers on retrofitting. We are continuing to 
build a targeted learning proposition for our 
Corporate and Investment Bank to support 
their ongoing development on the client 
transition strategy.

Training on greenwashing was delivered to 
targeted colleagues in Barclays UK, Private Bank 
and Wealth Management, Corporate Bank, 
Legal, Compliance, Marketing and Corporate 
Communications in EMEA, the US and APAC. 
This covered topics including forthcoming 
regulation and how to identify and mitigate 
greenwashing risk.

Incentives  
For the Executive Directors of Barclays PLC,
an element of each of their annual bonus 
awards and Long-Term Incentive Plan awards is 
driven by non-financial performance measures 
– including measures relating to climate and 
sustainability. 

Barclays’ performance against non-financial 
measures, including ESG metrics, is also 
explicitly considered in the determination of the 
incentive pool – directly impacting pay levels of 
the wider workforce. 

Non-financial performance for the Executive 
Directors’ 2023 annual bonus and the 2023 
incentives pool was assessed against three 
categories: Customers and clients; Colleagues; 
and Climate and Sustainability. The latter 
included climate-related measures such as 
performance against our Sustainable and 
Transition Financing target, financed emissions 
reduction targets, carbon footprint reduction, 
and increase in renewable energy usage – as 
well as measures relating to our investment 
in communities.

TCFD Strategy Recommendation (b)  

Just transition and nature 
and biodiversity

We have continued to develop our work on 
just transition and nature and biodiversity, 
which are intrinsically connected to efforts 
to mitigate and adapt to climate change. 

Just transition

During 2023 we continued to see progress on 
just transition, with efforts from policymakers, 
industry initiatives, civil society and the private 
sector.

Following the COP27 Implementation Plan, the 
first Annual High-level ministerial roundtable on 
just transition took place during COP28 to 
discuss the work programme on just transition 
pathways. In the UK, the Transition Plan 
Taskforce (TPT) integrated the 
recommendations of the Just Transition 
Working Group in the Disclosure Framework, 
encouraging companies to disclose whether – 
and how – they have identified, assessed and 
taken into account the impacts and 
dependencies of the transition plans on 
stakeholders, society, the economy and the 
natural environment throughout their value 
chain. 

In turn, the Taskforce for Nature-related 
Financial Disclosures (TNFD) Disclosure 
Framework included recommendations to 
disclose details of human rights policies and 
engagement activities with respect to the 
assessment and response to nature-related 
dependencies, impacts, risks and opportunities. 

In this context Barclays continues to 
acknowledge the role financial institutions play in 
supporting a just transition. We have also 
continued our efforts to build an approach to just 
transition that considers the social risks and 
opportunities of the transition and seeks to 
engage relevant stakeholders.   

As we pilot our approach to just transition in our 
Client Transition Framework, the findings of our 
pilot show that 40% of the assessed clients have 
committed to a just transition. We will consider 
these findings in our engagement with clients. 
We also intend to include social considerations as 
we develop our transition plan. 

Barclays UK has continued to identify 
opportunities to address the social challenges of 
the transition in the context of the energy crisis. 
For example, in 2023 we launched a pilot with our 
strategic partner British Gas, aiming to support 
thousands of customers experiencing low 
financial wellbeing in accessing support with their 
energy bills and relevant grants to make energy-
efficiency-related improvements to their homes. 

We have continued to contribute to the 
development of a just transition approach for the 
financial sector through our engagement with 
initiatives and the organisation of thought 
leadership events and discussions, as described 
below: 

• During New York Climate Week Barclays 
hosted an event with UNEP FI, Ceres and 
Boston Consulting Group (BCG), bringing 
together leaders in the sustainability and 
finance space to discuss the role finance can 
play in ensuring an equitable climate transition.

Barclays PLC

Annual Report 2023 124

• During COP28 Barclays co-hosted and 

organised three events alongside its partners:

– an event with LSE discussing the barriers to 

investing in emerging markets and 
mobilising debt markets; 

– an event with Ceres on the regional 

approach to financing a just transition; and 

– an event with BCG and Ceres discussing 

whether financial institutions can facilitate a 
just transition through cleantech financing 
and green jobs. 

• As part of our participation in the LSE 

Financing a Just Transition Alliance (FJTA), we 
contributed to the report 'Sowing seeds: How 
finance can support a just transition in UK 
agriculture', which was designed to increase 
understanding across the financial sector of 
how it can support a just transition in 
agriculture by mobilising more finance towards 
companies committed to and making 
progress to support a just nature transition.

• Barclays is a Founding Funder of LSE's Just 
Transition Finance Lab, which launches in 
February 2024. The Lab plans to work on the 
development of financial tools and 
instruments for the just transition, metrics to 
measure just transition performance; identify 
appropriate policy reforms to help to mobilise 
finance for the just transition, and develop 
case studies that demonstrate how just 
transition finance can be applied in practice. 

Cognisant of the importance of local approaches 
for just transition and the integration of the 
voices of impacted stakeholders, we also 
organised a stakeholder engagement, with the 
support of Ceres, that allowed us to access the 
perspectives of investors, non-profits, and 
community leaders to help our understanding of 
just transition in the US.

Our approach to nature 
and biodiversity 

Banks have an important role to play in 
contributing to nature-positive finance and 
managing their nature-related risks.

Nature is a key sustainability focus for Barclays and 
the wider industry going forward, given that nature 
and its ecosystem services fundamentally 
underpin economies and societies. Nature is also 
important to the banking sector due to the 
interlinkages with climate change and social 
impacts, with disclosure requirements moving 
towards a holistic approach to nature, climate and 
social risks and opportunities. During 2023 nature 
loss continued to be recognised within new and 
emerging guidance and regulation. Significantly for 
companies and financial institutions, the TNFD 
finalised its framework for organisations to assess 
and disclose nature-related risks and 
opportunities. Upcoming disclosure requirements 
on nature-related topics were confirmed under 
the EU Corporate Sustainability Reporting 
Directive, as well as within guidance published by 
the TPT regarding incorporating nature-related 
impacts and dependencies associated with 
climate transition plans.

We continue to work to build an understanding of 
the ways our activities and those of our clients 
impact and depend on nature. This includes 
engaging with industry and cross-sector groups 
as detailed in the 'Engagement' section on the 
following page. We continue to explore how to 
integrate these considerations into policy and 
process and reviewing the ways our financing 
activities can contribute to nature.

Given the interdependencies across the climate, 
nature and social agendas, reviewing ways we 
can address these areas holistically is important. 
For instance, drawing on the work of the TPT, we 
are considering nature-related topics in our 
sector approach for Agriculture. See page 93 for 
details.

Implementing our Climate Strategy (continued)

TCFD Strategy Recommendation (b)  

During 2023 we worked on setting the 
foundation to our approach on nature through 
planning and preparation to understand nature-
related regulatory obligations and disclosure 
frameworks, and build consensus for strategic 
action in 2024. We recognise the need for 
continuous improvement with regard to available 
data and technologies, in particular noting the 
complexity and challenge given the number of 
nature attributes and their associated metrics. 
During 2023 we engaged with a number of data 
providers to better understand data availability 
and capability. The following sets out a summary 
of this work.
+ Further information on our approach to nature can be found 

throughout the report.

Nature-related risk in financing

We include financing restrictions that seek to 
address nature-related risk within our position 
statements on Forestry and Agricultural 
Commodities, World Heritage Sites and Ramsar 
Wetlands, and Climate Change. We continue to 
review and monitor how we can strengthen our 
approach. In 2023 we undertook a significant 
update of our Forestry and Agricultural 
Commodities Statement to expand the scope to 
include, for the first time, requirements for 
clients involved in South American beef 
production or primary processing and enhanced 
the existing requirements for clients involved in 
palm oil and soy. See page 100.

We have continued to develop our approach to 
evaluating nature-related risk in financing. This 
included building on work across 2022-23 in 
which we piloted the TNFD Framework on our 
lending portfolio for Agriculture and Food in 
Europe, with a focus on UK Farming – in which 
Barclays has a significant presence. The results 
informed development of new questions for the 
Client Transition Tool (CTT) for UK farmers, 
which are due to be incorporated in 2024. See 
page 93 for details of our approach to the UK 
Agriculture sector. In recognition of nature-
related impacts identified in the agricultural value 
chain, we also strengthened our approach to 
financing agricultural commodity sectors 
exposed to significant deforestation risk.

We refined the work undertaken in 2022 to 
develop a sectoral heatmap, refreshing the 
industries included to align with the TNFD’s 
priority sector list. Our proposed next steps 
include consideration of the TNFD LEAP 
framework to conduct further sector-level 
analysis. See page 69 for more details.
+ Further details can be found in our position statements on 
the Barclays ESG Resource Hub at: home.barclays/ 
sustainability/esg-resource-hub/
Further details on our position statements can be found in 
the non-financial information statement from page 40.

Nature-related financing

Nature-related financing presents significant 
future opportunities for the financial sector, 
given the capital requirements to address and 
reverse nature loss. The biodiversity financing 
gap is estimated to be $700bn per year¹.

We will continue to work towards meeting our 
green and sustainable finance targets, which 
include financing relevant to nature. 

Our Sustainable Finance Framework includes 
categories such as Sustainable Food, Agriculture, 
Forestry, Aquaculture and Fisheries, which we 
have mapped to nature-related UN SDGs – 
including SDG14, Life Under Water, and SDG 15, 
Life on Land.

In Barclays UK we believe the nature transition is 
a key area where we can make an impact due to 
our prominent role in financing UK agriculture 
and agricultural land purchases. In 2023 
examples of nature-related financing have 
included lending funds in relation to the 
Biodiversity Net Gain scheme and support for 
farmers who seek to apply more sustainable 
farming practices.

We are supporting environmentally-focused 
climate technology start-ups through our SIC 
portfolio led by Barclays’ Principal Investments 
team. We are also exploring nature-related 
products and solutions for our clients in the CIB. 
See page 105 for details.

Engagement

We see appropriate collaboration and 
engagement across industry as essential for 
sharing learnings across the sector and a 
successful nature-related transition.

In 2023 we continued to provide feedback to the 
TNFD – both bilaterally, as part of our 
membership of the TNFD Forum, and through 
industry groups ahead of the finalisation of the 
TNFD Framework.

Barclays PLC

Annual Report 2023 125

Barclays provided input into the nature 
components of the TPT's disclosure guidance 
for climate transition plans as part of the TPT’s 
Nature Working Group. See page 61 for details of 
our wider engagement with TPT.

We continued engagement with a number of 
industry and cross-sector groups, including the 
UN Principles for Responsible Banking (PRB) 
Nature Working Group – with which we fed into a 
guide to setting targets relating to banks' 
practices and processes on nature. We further 
provided input into the LSE's FJTA's publication 
on a just nature transition – see page 124 for 
details.

As part of the Sustainable Markets Initiative’s 
Financial Services Task Force, Barclays co-led 
the publication of a guide on Financing Coastal 
Nature-based (NbS) Solutions - see page 105 for 
details.

Barclays completed the third and final year of our 
partnership with the Blue Marine Foundation, 
which had the aim of supporting them in seeking 
to deliver their goal of ensuring that at least 30% 
of the global ocean is effectively protected and 
the other 70% sustainably managed by 2030. 
Our donation contributed to conservation 
outcomes including support for more than 
445,000km of newly designated Marine 
2
Protected Areas (MPAs), 900km
 of newly 
proposed MPAs, and advocacy and educational 
outreach to support the ongoing protection and 
restoration of the ocean – including through the

Engaging with industry

We know that leveraging the relationships 
we hold with stakeholders can support all of 
us in achieving our objectives. 

Continued engagement in the financial sector 
and other areas of the real economy and public 
sector will be important in delivering the actions 
necessary to meet our global sustainability goals. 
At a minimum, strategic partnerships with key 
stakeholders enables knowledge sharing and 
supports informed decision making. 
Collaborating with NGOs, academia, government 
agencies, private sector peers and local 
communities enhances our ability to understand, 
assess and address the intricate issues 
associated with climate change. These 
partnerships have the potential to uncover 
opportunities to deploy capital into areas that 
suffer from existing financing gaps and scale 
companies to disrupt markets and innovate for 
impact. During 2023, Barclays contributed to 
several workstreams across climate, nature, just 
transition, and advancing data and reporting 
standards.

Our involvements in these workstreams 
highlighted the significant financing gaps that 
exist across sectors and markets. This theme 
was in full focus throughout our conversations at 
London Climate Action Week, New York Climate 
Week, and COP28 in Dubai, where we hosted and 
co-hosted several action-oriented sessions. At 
COP28 we sponsored the Start-Up Village 
located in the Green Zone, which enabled over 
100 start-ups to demonstrate their various 
climate technologies on a world stage – including 
three Barclays SIC portfolio companies: 
ZeroAvia, GeoPura, and ECOncrete.

PCAF Capital Markets working group 

Barclays has been an active member of the Partnership for Carbon Accounting Financials (PCAF) 
– an industry-wide initiative that aims to build consensus on approaches to carbon accounting, 
disclosure and portfolio alignment – since 2020. In 2023, and for the third year running, Barclays 
co-chaired the PCAF Capital Markets working group comprising eight other banks.

The working group has developed a standard to account for the facilitated emissions associated 
with capital markets transactions, which was published in December 2023. The Standard (Part B) 
builds on the extensive work carried out by the working group over the past three years and 
follows on from the 2021 Discussion Paper, the 2022 Proposed Methodology document, and two 
public consultations.

launched in 2020 by His Majesty King Charles III, when he was Prince of Wales. Barclays has co-led the Net Zero working group since 2021 and 
in 2023 co-led the Nature-based Solutions (NbS) working group. We co-hosted a series of FSTF workshops at London Climate Action Week 
and New York Climate Week contributing towards the launch of the Coastal Nature-based Solutions Practitioner's guide in November 2023.

In 2023 Barclays contributed to the Transition Plan Taskforce (TPT)'s publication of sector-agnostic and sector-specific guidance 
documents. This included taking part in the TPT Sandbox, participating in the Banking, Metals & Mining, Food & Beverage, Nature and Just 
Transition working groups, and providing expert reviews for the Oil & Gas working group.

Barclays has been a member of United Nations Environment Programme – Finance Initiative (UNEP FI) for over 20 years and was a founding 
signatory of the UN Principles for Responsible Banking (PRB) as well as joining the Net-Zero Banking Alliance in 2021. From 2021 Barclays' Group 
Head of Sustainability has been a member of the global UNEP FI Banking Board and the European Regional Board, and our CEO joined the 
Leadership Council in 2022. Throughout 2023 Barclays has contributed to the PRB 2030 process, a strategic project to further develop the UN 
PRB framework, and participated in the Nature Target Setting Working Group – helping build guidance and inputting on case studies.

Barclays joined over 40 financial institutions and stakeholders to form the Financing a Just Transition Alliance in 2021. In 2023 we contributed 
to a report titled 'Sowing seeds: How finance can support a just transition in UK agriculture', which was designed to increase understanding 
across the financial sector of how it can support a just transition in agriculture by mobilising more finance towards companies committed to 
and making progress to support a ‘just nature transition’. Barclays became a Founding Funder of the Just Transition Finance Lab, launched on 
20 February 2024.

Barclays has been an active member of the Ceres Company Network since 2019. In 2023 we partnered with Ceres to conduct a stakeholder 
engagement as a follow up to the research Ceres conducted in 2022 on our just transition strategy. We additionally co-hosted a series of 
just-transition-focused workshops at both New York Climate Week and COP28.

Barclays is a member of the Taskforce on Nature-related Financial Disclosures (TNFD) Forum, a consultative network of institutional 
supporters who share the vision and mission of the TNFD. Throughout 2023 we actively provided feedback on the draft TNFD disclosure 
guidance, which was officially launched in September 2023.

In 2023 Barclays contributed to the GFANZ Decarbonization Methodology working group, which at COP28 in December 2023 published a 
'Technical Review Note on Scaling Transition Finance and Real-economy Decarbonization, a Supplement to the 2022 Net-Zero Transition 
Plan Report'.

Barclays became a founding member of the Net-Zero Banking Alliance in 2021 and contributed to the development of NZBA guidelines throughout 
2023. Barclays co-leads the NZBA Autos and Trucking Working Group, which published a white paper on emerging practice in climate target setting 
for automotive sector financing, and contributed to the NZBA Real-Estate Working Group – which published a similar paper in December 2023.

As part of Barclays' three-year partnership with Oxford University, we made progress on developing new datasets and methodologies for 
measuring emissions in the agriculture sector – which Barclays will leverage moving forward as it enhances its work in this area.

Barclays has been a member of PCAF since 2020. During 2023 we co-chaired the Capital Markets Working Group of eight global banks – the 
work from which resulted in the publication of the PCAF Facilitated Emissions Standard (The Standard, Part B), which outlines how financial 
institutions should account for the emissions associated with the facilitation of capital markets activities. 

The Climate Financial Risk Forum (CFRF) brings together UK regulators and senior financial sector representatives to share their experiences 
in managing climate-related risks and opportunities. During 2023, Barclays chaired the Climate Financial Resilience Working Group.

Barclays became a Strategic Partner of the RMI (formerly Rocky Mountain Institute) Center for Climate-Aligned Finance, which acts as an 
implementation partner to banks to align their investments with a net zero future, in 2022. In 2023 we participated in and hosted one of RMI's 
Alignment Forum in-person workshops, seeking to identify best practices within the financial sector. In Q3 2023 Barclays became a Founding 
Consortium Collaborator to support the expansion of RMI’s Oil Climate Index plus Gas – a public tool that uses a transparent, standardised 
methodology to estimate methane and other GHG emissions from equivalent barrels of oil and gas. RMI has currently modelled two-thirds of 
the world’s oil and gas assets. We also joined the joint RMI and UK Finance Transition Finance Alignment Forum.

Barclays became a member of the Banking for Impact on Climate in Agriculture (B4ICA) in 2021 – an initiative convened by the World Business 
Council for Sustainable Development that brings together banks and expert partners to develop technical recommendations and practical 
solutions to align banks’ financial portfolios in the food, agriculture, and land-use space towards net zero and Paris Agreement goals. In 2023 
we contributed to B4ICA's 'Foundational Practices for Banks: Base lining, net-zero target-setting and reporting financed emissions across 
the agriculture and food value chain'.

Barclays joined the Center for Climate and Energy Solutions (C2ES) Business Environmental Leadership Council (BELC) in 2022. In 2023 we 
collaborated with C2ES on a range of issues, including participating in their technology working group and co-hosting an event at COP28 on 
supporting the global climate technology momentum.

In the final quarter of 2023, Barclays partnered with the UK Business Climate Hub – an online portal supporting SMEs on their journey to net 
zero. Barclays is helping shape and enhance the resources the Hub provides to UK business, ensuring our SME clients' voices are heard and 
their needs met. This new partnership will help each SME client understand why sustainability is important for their business and what 'good' 
looks like in the context of their industry.

Barclays' approach to public policy 

We have a responsibility to engage with 
governments and policymakers 
constructively, while remaining politically 
neutral.

Transparency and governance

As a major economic and societal contributor to the 
communities in which we operate – whether via the 
products we offer, the customers and clients we 
serve, the colleagues we employ, or the contribution 
we make through our community investment 
programme – we believe it is also important to 
contribute to relevant public policy debates. We 
seek to engage constructively with policymakers in 
jurisdictions where the firm operates, including with 
governments, legislatures, regulators and other 
organisations.

In our discussions we seek to make contributions 
that are accurate, honest and evidence-based. 
Barclays’ advocacy and engagement activities, 
including direct and indirect lobbying, must also be 
undertaken in line with our internal controls – 
including Barclays’ code of conduct (The Barclays 
Way), which requires that "where we engage with 
governments and regulators on issues relevant to 
our business, we are honest and transparent in our 
communication with them". The Barclays Way also 
provides detailed guidance on speaking up and 
raising concerns, directing employees to speak up if 
they see "behaviours and practices that are not in 
line with our Barclays Values" – making clear that 
speaking up, whether formally or informally, will not 
come at a consequence to them. We also believe 
that Barclays should only engage on issues where 
we have a legitimate interest – for example where 
there is a consequence for our business, our 
customers and clients, or our colleagues. Barclays’ 
Group Head of Strategic Policy is responsible for the 
co-ordination and oversight of public policy 
advocacy.

Barclays retains the services of public affairs 
agencies in certain jurisdictions. These agencies 
primarily assist with political monitoring and 
strategic advice. We work very closely with these 
agencies on a day-to-day basis, to help ensure that 
the Strategic Policy Group has oversight of the work 
being undertaken for Barclays.

Advocacy with public officials in the US is publicly 
reported, as required by the Lobbying Disclosure 
Act. Barclays also discloses its EU advocacy 
activities on the European Commission’s 
Transparency Register.

In addition, Barclays is a member of a number of 
trade associations globally. These associations work 
to represent their members, and for many this 
involves undertaking work to shape industry’s 
collective response to various public policy issues. 
We seek to be an engaged and productive member 
of all associations in which Barclays participates, 
predominantly through the committees and 
working groups formed by each. Active participation 
in the discussions and working groups facilitated by 
these trade associations helps encourage the 
adoption of policy positions consistent with 
Barclays’ public policy objectives. Where we identify 
divergence on key policy matters we seek to engage 
and influence these positions. The Strategic Policy 
Group also supports senior executives occupying 
trade association board positions, as appropriate.

As part of our commitment to transparency we 
publish a range of information on our Public Policy 
Engagement website, including certain details 
regarding the aforementioned agencies and trade 
association memberships. We also publish details of 
Barclays’ bilateral responses to material 
government and public policy consultations on 
certain issues with which we are principally engaged, 
in the UK and EU, either in full summary or part. In 
other jurisdictions, including across Asia and the US, 
responses to public consultations are published on 
the respective government websites.

Climate policy engagement

Barclays seeks to proactively engage in climate and 
sustainable finance-related public policy 
conversations and development, directly and 
indirectly, consistent with our business strategy – 
including our ambition to be a net zero bank by 
2050 and our commitment to aligning our 
financing with the goals and timelines of the Paris 
Agreement.

We proactively pursue opportunities for senior-
level dialogue with policymakers to demonstrate 
private sector leadership on sustainable finance 
and the energy transition. We provide feedback, as 
an individual institution and via trade associations 
to relevant consultation processes launched by 
standard setters, multilateral organisations and 
NGOs, including those that could inform future 
policy recommendations. We also engage with 
governments and other key stakeholders to 
promote policies that facilitate greater investment 
in climate solutions. This includes participating in 
key international and domestic forums – such as 
the United Nations Climate Change Conference 
(COP28) and the UK’s Global Investment Summit 
2023 – to promote net-zero-aligned public policy 
at senior levels.

Barclays endeavours to support the development 
of public policy positions that facilitate sustainable 
finance and the broader energy transition through 
proactive engagement in relevant trade 
association working groups, where we seek to 
promote positions consistent with our ambition to 
be a net zero bank by 2050. We engage with many 
trade associations on climate issues and will 
continue to do so to promote our net zero 
objectives. Reflective of the pace of developments 
and regional differences in approaches to 
sustainability, there can be diverging views within 
trade associations. Many of these trade 
associations also do not focus exclusively on 

Barclays PLC

Annual Report 2023 129

sustainability, but rather engage across the full 
breadth of financial services-related policy – and do 
not have stated positions in relation to net zero.

Where misalignment between an association’s 
advocacy position and Barclays’ own net zero 
ambitions is identified, we seek to manage this 
appropriately by addressing it through proactive 
engagement where possible. Where there is a 
material and ongoing difference identified through 
our routine engagement, Barclays may publicly 
dissent from a trade association’s position. Should 
a trade association adopt a material position that, 
following engagement, remains irreconcilable with 
our Values or strategy, we can exercise the option 
to end our membership. 

In 2023 we undertook another internal review of 
the climate policy positions of certain material 
trade associations, including their alignment with 
our ambition to be a net zero bank by 2050 and our 
commitment to aligning our financing with the 
goals and timelines of the Paris Agreement. A list 
of these trade associations in scope can be found 
on our Public Policy Engagement web page. This 
review was informed by publicly available 
information on each trade association’s website, 
which could include climate policy position 
statements and, where directly related to climate, 
consultation responses, commission reports and 
statements from an association’s senior 
leadership. For a number of trade associations in-
scope of the review, we were unable to identify a 
clearly articulated position on net zero. Of those 
with a clear position, the majority were considered 
to be aligned or partially aligned with our net zero 
by 2050 ambition. In 2023 we began to proactively 
engage with trade associations to better 
understand their climate policy positions and 
activities, and we will continue to keep our 
approach under review.

Scenario analysis

Climate scenario analysis forms a key part of 
Barclays' approach to assessing and 
quantifying the impact of physical and 
transition climate risks on the Bank's 
portfolios¹. It represents a tool in better 
understanding the significant uncertainty 
that arises from how climatic weather 
patterns will change, as well as the rapidly 
evolving nature of the climate transition 
from government policies, new technologies 
and changing individuals' sentiment. 

Through climate scenario analysis, these risks 
and uncertainties can be translated into financial 
impacts to the Bank, allowing Barclays to better 
understand the resilience of its business 
strategy. 
History and evolution

Since 2018 Barclays has progressively developed 
its internal scenario analysis capabilities, 
developing new climate assessment 
methodologies, running internal targeted 
exercises with external subject matter experts, 
and participating in regulatory climate stress-
testing.

Barclays PLC

Annual Report 2023 131

Barclays continues to build its use of scenario 
analysis to explore and further understand the 
evolving landscape – identifying areas of risks and 
opportunities – to challenge existing 
assumptions of future climate pathways and 
measure and size of the risks of climate change 
to the Bank.

Note

1 Informed by the Basel Committee on Banking Supervision's 2021 
'Climate-related financial risks - measurement methodologies' 
report, Barclays considers climate scenario analysis as forward-
looking projections of climate risk outcomes, with climate stress-
testing a subset of this where the exercise is designed to 
evaluate financial resiliency to a severe but plausible scenario.

TCFD Strategy Recommendation (c)  

Barclays' resilience to climate 
scenarios 

Based on the exercises undertaken to date, 
our understanding is that Barclays' strategy 
remains resilient to climate scenarios. This 
assessment includes consideration of two 
climate stress tests completed in 2023, 
with further details included in subsequent 
sections of this chapter. 

In addition Barclays considers the impact of 
climate scenarios within its financial 
planning process, including the use of a 
baseline climate scenario within the 
Medium Term Planning process and the 
financial impacts from Barclays meeting its 
sectoral BlueTrackTM targets, aligned to 
1.5°C scenario pathways. Finally, Barclays 
has considered the impact of climate 
scenarios within its assessment of 
Expected Credit Losses reported under 
IFRS9, for year-end 2023. More detail on 
these two elements can be found on page 
121 and 310 respectively.

Nevertheless, given the evolving climate 
landscape, we seek to further enhance our 
capabilities and modelling in order to refine 
our understanding of the Bank's resilience 
to various climate scenarios, particularly 
given high uncertainty within climate 
scenario analysis. 

The aims of our two climate stress tests, each 
with their own scenario, were to assess Barclays' 
financial resiliency to climate risks over and above 
the financial impact of existing macroeconomic 
internal stress tests – and the extent to which 
Barclays would remain within risk appetite. 

Both stress tests were designed as Bank-wide 
exercises, conducted over a five-year time period, 
to assess an accelerated transition and specific 
climate vulnerabilities to the Bank's business plan. 

These exercises include an assessment of the 
financial impact to our clients of a structural 
decline in fossil fuel demand and consumption and 
shift towards low-carbon products and services.

The two scenarios have been internally designed 
with consideration of Barclays' specific portfolio 
vulnerabilities. External scenarios such as those 
provided by the Network for Greening the 
Financial System (NGFS), while offering granular 
and detailed scenario information for financial 
institutions, tend to focus on longer trends and 
display limited volatility, with assumptions that 
may be less relevant to our specific businesses. 
As such we have designed scenarios with a 
greater focus on short-term tail risks and 
volatility to assess Barclays' resiliency.

Results of the two exercises indicate a c.10% 
drag on the Bank’s profitability, falling in the range 
projected for the UK banking sector by the Bank 
of England's 2021 Climate Biennial Exploratory 
Scenario (CBES). In addition the exercises 
represent a c.10-20% uplift in losses incurred in 
existing macroeconomic internal stress tests. In 
order to manage and mitigate these potential 
risks, Barclays has for the first time quantitatively 
integrated the results of its stress tests into its 
internal capital adequacy assessments, ensuring 
the Bank remains appropriately capitalised for 
climate risks, and to ensure business resilience.

The results of our exercises have highlighted 
risks within our key businesses to either Physical 
Risk, Transition Risk or both. We have aggregated 
results for Barclays' three main business units, 
Barclays International, Retail and SME Banking, 
and Head Office, in the heatmap on the right for 
the stress test most recently completed. 

The assessment indicates the relative impact 
from the climate scenario against Barclays' 
medium-term plan, calculated as the additional 
losses compared to the expected business cycle. 

Losses appear highest in the Barclays 
International segment relative to the baseline. 
This is predominantly attributed to our Global 

Banking & Markets business, driven by exposure 
to more carbon intensive sectors that are most 
impacted from the fast transition scenario, such 
as the introduction of carbon pricing schemes. In 
addition, cascading transitional impacts drive up 
unemployment, stressing our cards portfolios. 

Meanwhile, within Retail, UK residential real 
estate exposures face increased acute physical 
events and additional energy remediation costs. 
Further detail of these exercises is included in 
subsequent sections.

Climate stress tests

Two climate stress tests have been 
conducted during 2023, each with their 
own short-term scenario, to assess the 
Bank's financial resiliency to transition and 
physical risks. The H2 exercise builds upon 
the learnings from H1, enhancing climate 
stress testing design, integration, and 
execution as part of the Bank's planning 
and stress-testing framework. Key 
developments include full macroeconomic 
scenario expansion, the broadening of 
assessment scope, and the refinement of 
climate methodologies. 

Climate stress test (H1)

In the first half of 2023 Barclays performed a Bank-
wide climate stress test, which tested the impact 
of a tipping point event, with subsequent shifts in 
consumer behaviour and financial market activity. 
The scenario began with a substantial weakening 
of the Atlantic Meridional Overturning Circulation, 
leading to a disruption in heat transfer and 

changes in atmospheric circulation – resulting in 
direct physical risk events across the globe. 
Structural changes in weather patterns drive 
indirect physical risks, and industries reliant on a 
stable climate begin to deteriorate. As climate 
disasters manifest, societal actors including 
governments, markets, consumers and NGOs 
take action in attempts to curb further 
materialisation of climate risks. This exercise was 
used to test the Bank's resilience to credit, market, 
operational, liquidity, and reputational risks arising 
from climate change. The scenario was developed 
internally, based on the latest scientific research 
from the IPCC, with review by Oxford University. 
Results and insights

Overall, losses represent a c.10% drag on profits, 
falling in the range projected in the Bank of 
England's CBES. Climate impacts were driven 
notably by fossil-fuel-intensive industries and 
assets, and those sectors where consumers 
'vote with their feet' and change spending 
patterns to more sustainable options. While 
physical risks losses represented a lower portion 
of overall losses across businesses, physical risks 
are significant and concentrated in industries 
with high reliance on buildings and infrastructure. 
Climate internal stress test (H2)

During the second half of 2023 Barclays 
undertook a climate stress test, part of an annually 
scheduled climate stress-testing programme, in 
line with existing internal macroeconomic stress 
tests. The formal integration of climate stress-
testing into the Bank's Stress Testing Framework 
is an important development and further embeds 
ongoing management of climate risks, enables 
consistent analysis of how these risks change 
through time, and incorporates into assessments 
of the Bank's risk appetite. In order to 
appropriately assess Barclays' resiliency to 
climate-related changes, we assess scenarios 
against our internal climate risk register, to select 
those most relevant to both self-identified areas 
of risk and those that require further exploration.

Scenario

Stage 1:

Stage 2:

Stage 3: 

The scenario narrative was designed over a five-year 
timeframe aligned with the Bank's Medium Term 
Planning and Internal Stress Testing scenarios. 
Specific variables were expanded using a 
combination of models and Subject Matter Expert 
(SME) judgement by Barclays' internal Scenario 
Expansion Team to assess both physical and 
transition Climate Risks. The exercise is designed to 
complement conventional Barclays macroeconomic 
stress-testing, and seeks to understand:

1) How climate can influence conventional 
macroeconomic stressed environment 
pathways and severity; and

2) The incremental impact of climate above 
macroeconomic stressed pathways. 

The climate scenario involves initial policy 
announcements that trigger immediate asset 
repricing, while more stringent policy 
requirements unfold over a longer time horizon – 
dampening recovery in the outer years as 
depicted in the below chart through stages 1, 2, 
and 3. Against this backdrop the scenario also 
includes consideration of physical risk, notably 
hazards of which Barclays' clients are most 
susceptible to such as flood and drought. 

Implications and policies of the three stages are 
outlined below: 

a) Consumer preferences shift toward greener 
products and practices while consumption is cut 
to cope with the recessionary environment. 
Behavioural shifts are pronounced at sector level 
as consumers turn away from firms who finance 
carbon-heavy industries. 

b) Investors reassess their participation with certain 
firms. Those with heavy exposure to brown income 
and/or assets, combined with poor transition plans, 
are negatively impacted in equity markets – with 
capital reallocated to greener firms.

c) In the UK, existing proposals to tighten EPC 
minimum standards are accelerated, bringing 
forward the compliance date for Buy-to-Let, 
Social Housing, and Commercial Real Estate 
buildings to be at EPC C or above. 

a) As the economy moves past peak recession, 
large parts of it start to consider how it can build 
back greener. Under continued behavioural 
pressure from consumers and investors, large-
scale plans for transitioning to a more 
sustainable business model occur where 
possible. 

The return of capital on these plans and the 
associated delay to recovery leads to a slight 
prolonging of the stress, but the creation of a 
transition plan leads to confidence in financial 
markets by investors. 

b) Additional policies in the UK and US are 
accelerated or announced. For example, the 
Government will rapidly increase the investment 
and deployment of EV charging infrastructure to 
support faster transition in the automotive 
sector.

a) The EU and UK governments ramp up their 
existing emissions trading schemes to achieve 
1.5C, with a carbon price shock increasing $150/
tCO2 within 12 months from 2026 and 
continuously increasing. This dampens 
economic recovery and leads to prolonged 
higher inflation as production costs are higher 
due to increased energy costs. However, to 
some extent, this is offset by both public and 
private investment to enable faster transition. 

b) Introduction of Carbon Border Adjustment 
Mechanisms, resulting in supply-side shocks, a 
reduction in exports, and other trading frictions. 

Scenario impact (Illustrative only)
+

A series of risk events lead to a 
drastic shift in public sentiment, 
demanding a policy response. 
Faced with a severe economic 
recession, impactful policies are 
announced to take effect during 
economic recovery. However it 
leads to an immediate repricing 
of assets. 

Existing government climate 
policies come into affect and 
contribute to the recovery, as 
these policies are largely 
investment and funding which 
will spur on economic activity.

More stringent government climate policies - the 
expansion of the Emissions Trading Scheme (ETS) and 
the rapid introduction of a Carbon Border Adjustment 
Mechanism (CBAM) - come into effect. This induces a 
carbon price shock and leads to a dampened recovery.

Resilience of our strategy (continued)

TCFD Strategy Recommendation (c)  

The scenario will have significant impacts on 
Barclays, including: 
1) Amplified market shocks: additional to 

existing macroeconomic shocks, there will be 
further equity and credit shocks for brown 
industries and financiers, as a result of 
immediate repricing. 

2) Amplified credit deterioration: additional 
credit risk on brown industries as a result of 
lower earnings expectations and refinancing 
risks.

3) Increase in frequency of physical risk events: 

throughout the time horizon, there is an 
increase in the occurrence of physical hazards 
such as flood, hurricanes and droughts. 

Following the above narrative, scenario variables 
are provided with varying levels of granularity. For 
example, global variables – notably demand in 
climate-sensitive sectors such as Energy, Power 
and Automotive – national variables – including 
unemployment rates, GDP, HPI, CPI, 
government legislation on EPC with further 
distinction between commercial and residential 
real estate – and property level variables, 
including subsidence and flood. Calibration is 
guided by the narrative with consideration for 
compounding effects of existing economic 
downturn and climate stresses, informing the 
shape and magnitude of variable calibration over 
the scenario horizon. 

Material technological development has not 
been assumed within the economic projections, 
given the immediate and short time horizon of 
the scenario. Variables are leveraged to assess 
impacts on Credit Risk, Market Risk, 
Counterparty Credit Risk, Underwriting, Non-
traded Market Risk, Income and Balance Sheet, 
Expenses, Pension, Liquidity, and Capital across 
Barclays – with a focus on UK, US, and EU regions. 

Results and insights 

Overall, losses are comparable with those seen in 
H1, also representing a c.10% drag on profits. 
While losses are significant, they remain 
manageable within the Bank's existing risk profile.

Within Barclays International, losses were driven 
mostly by companies operating in heavily 
emission-intensive industries due to rising carbon 
prices over the scenario, or those within sectors 
where demand for products and services rapidly 
fall due to consumer behaviour shifts or wider 
decarbonisation of the economy. In addition, 
market pressures and government policies on 
low-energy-efficiency Commercial Real Estate 
leads to deterioration in these markets both in the 
UK and US. 

In addition, rising unemployment rates across 
Barclays' major operating geographies cause 
negative impacts on consumer affordability 
through the loss of jobs and a weakened 
macroeconomic environment. Nevertheless, 
Barclays remains resilient to these additional 
losses, and current risk management mitigates 
these macroeconomic drivers. 

Retail and SME segment is impacted by higher 
frequency of acute events with real estate and 
agricultural assets susceptible to physical risks 
such as drought and flood. Despite this, the 
portfolios remain resilient due to availability of 
household insurance and the strong loan-to-
value profile of the lending. Sensitivity analysis was 
conducted to severely constrained household 
insurance availability, with Barclays remaining 
resilient, albeit noting small populations would be 
impacted significantly. 

Barclays PLC

Annual Report 2023 134

We will continue to refine and adapt our insurance 
assumptions to reflect ongoing changes in 
market expectations. In addition, while transition 
policies on emissions reduction and energy 
efficiency improvements do yield greater impacts, 
especially as customers begin to price energy 
performance more explicitly in their decisions, the 
resultant drag on annual profits remains 
manageable. 

We acknowledge, however, that further advances 
in modelling capability and data availability are 
needed to fully understand the extent of these 
losses, given high uncertainty in climate scenario 
analysis. For example, the scenario does not 
capture compounding and interaction effects 
between physical and transition risks that could 
potentially amplify such loss. 

As such, Barclays' annual climate stress-testing 
cycle is in place to address these uncertainties, by 
testing our business resilience under different 
climate scenarios and continuously refining our 
climate methodologies. 

2023 Enhancements and beyond

During 2023 Barclays made several key 
enhancements across climate scenario 
development, climate risk modelling, and 
the ways we embed climate learnings into 
our risk management.

• Climate scenarios are designed and developed 
with our internal specialist scenario expansion 
team, leveraging the tools and approaches of 
the existing scenario expansion processes and 
supplementing these with specific climate 
analysis. This ensures consistency in climate 
scenario design alongside existing regulatory 
internal scenarios, as well as detailed and 
granular climate scenario expansion.

• Climate risk models are developed according 
to Barclays' Climate Credit Risk Adjustment 
Framework, such that model execution across 
our suite of climate models follows a 
consistent process – adhering to defined 
principles and integrated strategically with our 
existing model suite whilst still having the 
flexibility to include portfolio-specific 
constraints and characteristics. Although for 
stress-testing purposes Barclays' focus 
remains on five-year scenarios aligned with 
our usual planning horizon, models in 
development are designed to enable 
assessment of longer horizons – 10 years or 
longer – should we decide to explore these in 
the future.

Climate Credit Risk Adjustment Framework

Further design and piloting of Barclays' climate 
risk model methodology is underway, focusing on 
integrating new climate modelling techniques 
into the Bank's existing financial analysis 
processes. The target state is a flexible and 
adaptable process that can support various 
modelling techniques and allow us to test a wide 
range of possible future scenarios. Estimates of 
incremental credit risk spreads will be integrated 
with Capital, Impairment and Stress Testing 
Models to quantify climate risk. 
Residential Real Estate 

We have continued to improve our 
understanding of how physical and transition 
risks could impact our Mortgages portfolio in the 
UK, reflecting on learnings in previous scenario 
analysis exercises such as the Bank of England's 
Climate Biennial Exploratory Scenario, engaging 
with specialist data providers, and undertaking 
quantitative analysis of the impacts of 
climate risks.

Challenges and limitations

The focus of physical risk analysis has been on 
understanding the impacts of flood and 
subsidence, and considering these at a property-
specific level – including the interaction of these 
risks and insurance provision, and how impacts 
may lead to changes in property values and our 
customers' affordability.

For transition risks, the potential costs from 
energy remediation action taken by customers 
are considered – such as upgrading their 
properties' EPC rating in favour of more energy 
efficient homes in consideration of energy costs 
and accounting for changes in property valuation 
across the market.

The uncertainty around the regulatory landscape 
for these risks is high, and Barclays continues to 
try and improve its understanding of how EPC 
regulation could feed through to customer 
impacts. The schematic below outlines the 
Climate Mortgage model. 

The impact of climate physical and transition 
drivers at a customer level are assessed, yielding 
probability of default (PD) and loss given default 
(LGD) spreads that are fed downstream into our 
existing stress-testing models.  

The Residential Real Estate Model will act as a 
pilot implementation for the Climate Credit Risk 
Adjustment Framework. Over time, we intend to  
incorporate additional climate risk drivers such as 
coastal flooding and storm damage, and refine 
modelling of customer behaviour in this market 
as the evidence on how customers respond to 
climate-related risks becomes apparent. 

Having undertaken a number of climate 
scenario analysis exercises, Barclays has 
gained a greater understanding of the 
challenges and nuances of climate 
modelling and continues to develop new 
and enhance existing tools for scenario 
analysis and stress-testing. 

Data

There exist inherent challenges in climate 
modelling due to limitations in data quality and 
availability, given the short history of climate 
assessments within the financial services industry.

• Data coverage is often lacking, where a subset 

of assets may not have the appropriate 
information publicly disclosed. Climate 
scenario risk analysis requires approaches and 
tools that are more granular (e.g. focus on 
company-level analysis), which differs from 
more traditional stress-testing exercises 
conducted at portfolio or sector level. This 
creates a need for more granular data that 
Barclays may not typically have maintained 

• While high data granularity is desirable to model 
client specific features, the balances between 
high data granularity and the additional insights 
provided must be investigated to assess the 
appropriate level of modelling 

• Data coherence issues may present 

inconsistencies in modelling. Emissions data is 
often one-year lagged, thus where the latest 
quarter/year financials are available, the 
emissions data may not be reflective of the 
company's operations, especially where there 
has been substantial growth or decline, 
mergers and acquisitions or other special 
activities. 

Scenario

There exist inherent uncertainties with scenario 
design largely attributed to limited history of the 
interactions between climate risks and the 
economy.

• Timing and interactions of physical and 

transition risks can greatly impact the Bank's 
assessment of capital adequacy and resilience. 
Assumptions around such compounding 
effects, while nuanced, are critical to our loss 
assessment and subsequently risk 
management processes and business 
strategy 

• There is a significant level of uncertainty with 
climate stress-testing projections in (i) how 
the scenario will manifest; (ii) how customers 
and clients will react; and (iii) the final loss 
quantification

• An understanding of compounding risks and 

feedback loops between financial systems, the 
economy, and climate risks remains a 
challenge, given the lack of historical 
precedent of such interactions. Over longer 
time horizons, it becomes increasingly difficult

Resilience of our strategy (continued)

Barclays PLC

Annual Report 2023 136

• Enhancing attractiveness of technological 
innovations for lenders: A key commercial 
constraint on the scalability of climate 
technologies is access to cost-competitive 
capital. Improving risk-adjusted returns is 
required to incentivise private financial flows 
towards nascent technologies and developing 
nations – essential to limit global warming to 
1.5°C. Blended finance mechanisms have 
potential to unlock large quantities of private 
investment when both public and philanthropic 
funds provide first loss tranches. The 
subsequent adjusted risk-return profiles can 
make previously high-risk investments 
marketable
+ Barclays is committed to scaling climate solutions through 
our Sustainable Impact Capital portfolio, with a mandate to 
invest up to £500m in global climate tech start-ups by the 
end of 2027. For further information see page 117.

TCFD Strategy Recommendation (c)  

Macro-dependencies and objectives

We consider the following areas to 
represent some of the macro-
dependencies that may impact our clients, 
customers and suppliers, and thus our 
ability to deliver our Climate Strategy. 

• Enhancing policy clarity in the real economy: 

Comprehensive, economy-wide 
decarbonisation policies are required across 
sectors and regions. The absence of clearly 
defined milestones for full decarbonisation at a 
national level introduces ambiguity over the 
channelling of financial resources to ensure an 
orderly and just transition

• Optimising carbon-pricing mechanisms: 

A comprehensive carbon-pricing scheme is 
a key lever to address the current market 
failure of externalities from GHGs emissions. 
The UK and EU announcements for a carbon 
border adjustment mechanism (CBAM) will go 
some way to addressing this dependency. 
However, IMF research¹ shows prices (avg $6/
tCO2) are currently insufficient to achieve 
1.5°C or 2°C targets

Note:

1 imf.org/en/Blogs/Articles/2022/07/21/blog-more-countries-

are-pricing-carbon-but-emissions-are-still-too-cheap

• Addressing sector-specific challenges: 

• Global harmonisation of regulation: 

To date, an increasing number of countries 
and territories have some degree of 
mandatory ESG disclosure. Non-financial 
regulatory requirements are necessary for 
investors to accurately assess climate-related 
risks – however, major jurisdictions risk 
hindering the transition through regulatory 
fragmentation. As a bank with a global 
presence, interoperability of regulatory 
frameworks is essential to enable focused 
progress towards net zero.

In addition to the risks arising from our clients' 
and suppliers' transitions, we are also dependent 
on wider market and geopolitical developments 
outside our control. For example, progress may 
be impacted by geopolitical developments that 
result in energy supply pressures or the varying 
pathways individual companies take to transition.

Myriad sector-specific challenges persist. This 
year a backlog of grid connectivity requests for 
new renewable power projects highlighted the 
complexity of a transition to net zero. Delays 
to approval for low-carbon projects impacts 
investor confidence, slowing the transition
+ For more information on sector-specific challenges and 
dependencies, see BlueTrackTM sector pages 92 to 99.

• Cultivating consumer confidence and 

investment incentives: Increased confidence 
in the multi-faceted and potential financial 
benefits of decarbonisation among society 
would help spur action. Clear messaging and 
incentives for households and businesses to 
generate tangible returns on investment in 
low-carbon products is critical for driving the 
transition towards net zero, particularly in 
sectors reliant on consumer behaviour such as 
Housing and Agriculture

• Improving access to sustainability-related 

risk and impacts data: Accurate assessments 
of client data, including Scope 3 emissions, is 
needed to enable a data-driven approach 
required to mitigate non-financial risks and 
plot the path to net zero. The evolving nature 
of corporate and financial sector reporting, 
and the persistent challenges stemming from 
data gaps, can hinder progress towards these 
goals 
+ Barclays remains engaged in the development of 

mechanisms to bridge these gaps, highlighted by our work 
with the Transition Plan Taskforce to set out transition plan 
disclosure guidance. For further details see page 61.

Important information/Disclaimers

Information provided in climate and 
sustainability disclosures 

What is important to our investors and 
stakeholders evolves over time, and we aim to 
anticipate and respond to these changes. 
Disclosure expectations in relation to climate 
change and sustainability matters are particularly 
fast moving, and differ from more traditional 
areas of reporting including in relation to the level 
of detail and forward-looking nature of the 
information involved and the consideration of 
impacts on the environment and other persons.  
We have adapted our approach in relation to the 
disclosure of such matters. Our climate and 
sustainability disclosures take into account the 
wider context relevant to these topics, which 
may include evolving stakeholder views, the 
development of our climate strategy, longer 
timeframes for assessing potential risks and 
impacts, international long-term climate- and 
nature-based policy goals and evolving 
sustainability-related policy frameworks. Our 
climate and sustainability disclosures are subject 
to more uncertainty than disclosures relating to 
other subjects, given market challenges in 
relation to data reliability, consistency and 
timeliness – the use of estimates, judgements 
and assumptions which are likely to change over 
time, the application and development of data, 
models, scenarios and methodologies, the 
change in regulatory landscape, and variations in 
reporting standards.

 These factors mean disclosures may be 
amended, updated, and recalculated in future as 
market practice and data quality and availability 
develops, and could cause actual achievements, 
results, performance or other future events or 
conditions to differ, in some cases materially, 
from those stated, implied and/or reflected in 
any forward-looking statements or metrics 
included in our climate and sustainability 
disclosures. We give no assurance as to the 
likelihood of the achievement or reasonableness 
of any projections, estimates, forecasts, targets, 
commitments, ambitions, prospects or returns 
contained in our climate and sustainability 
disclosures and make no commitment to revise 
or update any such disclosures to reflect events 
or circumstances occurring or existing after the 
date of such statements. 
Disclaimers

In preparing the climate and sustainability 
content within the Barclays PLC Annual Report 
wherever it appears, we have:

• Made certain key judgements, estimations and 
assumptions. This is, for example, the case in 
relation to financed emissions, portfolio 
alignment, classification of environmental and 
social financing, operational emissions and 
sustainability metrics, measurement of climate 
risk and scenario analysis 

Barclays PLC

Annual Report 2023 137

• Continued (and will continue) to review and 
develop our approach to data, models, 
scenarios and methodologies in line with 
market principles and standards as this subject 
area matures. The data, models, scenarios and 
methodologies used (including those made 
available by third parties) and the judgements, 
estimates and/or assumptions made in them 
or by us are rapidly evolving, and this may 
directly or indirectly affect the metrics, data 
points, targets, convergence points and 
milestones contained in the climate and 
sustainability content within the Annual 
Report. Further, changes in external factors 
which are outside of our control such as 
accounting and/or reporting standards, 
improvements in data quality, data availability, 
or updates to methodologies and models and/
or updates or restatements of data by third 
parties, could impact – potentially materially – 
the performance metrics, data points, targets, 
convergence points and milestones contained 
in the climate and sustainability content within 
the Annual Report. In future reports we may 
present some or all of the information for this 
reporting period (including information made 
available by third parties) using updated or 
more granular data or improved models, 
scenarios methodologies, market practices or 
standards. Equally, we may need to re-
baseline, restate, revise, recalculate or 
recalibrate performance against targets, 
convergence points or milestones on the basis 
of such updated data. 

• Used climate and sustainability data, models, 
scenarios and methodologies we consider to 
be appropriate and suitable for these purposes 
as at the date on which they were deployed. 
This includes data, models, scenarios and 
methodologies made available by third parties 
(over which we have no control) and which may 
have been prepared using a range of different 
methodologies, or where the basis of 
preparation may not be known to us. 
Methodologies, interpretations or 
assumptions may not be capable of being 
independently verified and may therefore be 
inaccurate. Climate and sustainability data, 
models, scenarios and methodologies are 
subject to future risks and uncertainties and 
may change over time. Climate and 
sustainability disclosures in this document, 
including climate and sustainability-related 
data, models and methodologies, are not of 
the same standard as those available in the 
context of other financial information and use 
a greater number and level of judgements, 
assumptions and estimates, including with 
respect to the classification of climate and 
sustainable financing activities. Climate and 
sustainability disclosures are also not subject 
to the same or equivalent disclosure 
standards, historical reference points, 
benchmarks or globally accepted accounting 
principles. Historical data cannot be relied on 
as a strong indicator of future trajectories in 
the case of climate change and its evolution. 
Outputs of models, processed data, scenario 
analysis and the application of methodologies 
will also be affected by underlying data quality, 
which can be hard to assess, or challenges in 
accessing data on a timely basis

Forward-looking statements

Barclays PLC

Annual Report 2023 139

This document contains certain forward-looking 
statements within the meaning of Section 21E 
of the US Securities Exchange Act of 1934,
as amended, and Section 27A of the US 
Securities Act of 1933, as amended, with respect 
to the Group. Barclays cautions readers that
 no forward-looking statement is a guarantee 
of future performance, and that actual results
or other financial condition or performance 
measures could differ materially from those 
contained in the forward-looking statements. 
Forward-looking statements can be identified by 
the fact they do not relate only to historical or 
current facts. Forward-looking statements 
sometimes use words such as ‘may’, ‘will’, ‘seek’, 
‘continue’, ‘aim’, ‘anticipate’, ‘target’, ‘projected’, 
‘expect’, ‘estimate’, ‘intend’, ‘plan’, ‘goal’, ‘believe’, 
‘achieve’ or other words of similar meaning. 
Forward-looking statements can be made in 
writing but may also be made verbally by 
directors, officers and employees of the Group, 
including during management presentations, 
in connection with this document. Examples
 of forward-looking statements include, among 
others, statements or guidance regarding or 
relating to the Group’s future financial position, 
business strategy, income levels, costs, assets 
and liabilities, impairment charges, provisions, 
capital, leverage and other regulatory ratios, 

capital distributions – including policy on 
dividends and share buybacks – return on 
tangible equity, projected levels of growth in 
banking and financial markets, industry trends, 
any commitments and targets – including ESG 
commitments and targets – plans and objectives 
for future operations, and other statements that 
are not historical or current facts. By their nature, 
forward-looking statements involve risk and 
uncertainty because they relate to future events 
and circumstances. Forward-looking statements 
speak only as at the date on which they are made. 
Forward-looking statements may be affected by 
a number of factors, including, without limitation: 
changes in legislation; regulations, governmental 
and regulatory policies, expectations and actions, 
voluntary codes of practices, and the 
interpretation thereof; changes in International 
Financial Reporting Standards and other 
accounting standards, including practices with 
regard to the interpretation and application 
thereof and emerging and developing ESG 
reporting standards; the outcome of current and 
future legal proceedings and regulatory 
investigations; the Group’s ability along with 
governments and other stakeholders to 
measure, manage and mitigate the impacts of 
climate change effectively; environmental, social 
and geopolitical risks and incidents, pandemics 

and similar events beyond the Group’s control; 
the impact of competition in the banking and 
financial services industry; capital, liquidity, 
leverage and other regulatory rules and 
requirements applicable to past, current and 
future periods; UK, US, Eurozone and global 
macroeconomic and business conditions, 
including inflation; volatility in credit and capital 
markets; market-related risks such as changes in 
interest rates and foreign exchange rates; 
reforms to benchmark interest rates and indices; 
higher or lower asset valuations; changes in 
credit ratings of any entity within the Group or 
any securities issued by it; changes in 
counterparty risk; changes in consumer 
behaviour; the direct and indirect consequences 
of the conflicts in Ukraine and the Middle East on 
European and global macroeconomic conditions, 
political stability and financial markets; political 
elections; developments in the UK’s relationship 
with the European Union (EU); the risk of 
cyberattacks, information or security breaches, 
technology failures or other operational 
disruptions and any subsequent impacts on the 
Group’s reputation, business or operations; the 
Group’s ability to access funding; and the 
success of acquisitions, disposals and other 
strategic transactions. A number of these 
factors are beyond the Group’s control. 

As a result, the Group’s actual financial position, 
results, financial and non-financial metrics or 
performance measures or its ability to meet 
commitments and targets may differ materially 
from the statements or guidance set forth in the 
Group’s forward-looking statements. In setting 
its targets and outlook for the period 2024-2026, 
Barclays has made certain assumptions about 
the macro-economic environment, including, 
without limitation, inflation, interest and 
unemployment rates, the different markets and 
competitive conditions in which Barclays 
operates, and its ability to grow certain 
businesses and achieve costs savings and other 
structural actions. Additional risks and factors 
that may impact the Group’s future financial 
condition and performance are identified in the 
description of material existing and emerging 
risks beginning on page 258 of this 
Annual Report.

Subject to Barclays PLC’s obligations under the 
applicable laws and regulations of any relevant 
jurisdiction – including, without limitation, the 
UK and the US – in relation to disclosure and 
ongoing information, we undertake no obligation 
to update publicly or revise any forward-looking 
statements, whether as a result of new 
information, future events or otherwise.

Directors’ report: Our governance framework

Barclays PLC

Annual Report 2023 150

A Group-wide governance framework 
facilitating effective decision-making
Driving long-term sustainable value for our shareholders, with regard to 
the interests of our stakeholders.

Group structure 

Barclays PLC (BPLC) is the Group’s 
parent company and has a premium 
listing on the London Stock Exchange. 

Each of the Group’s key operating 
entities - Barclays Bank PLC (BBPLC), 
Barclays Bank UK PLC (BBUKPLC), 
Barclays Europe, Barclays US LLC and 
Barclays Bank Delaware - has its own 
board (with Executive and Non-
Executive Directors) and board 
committees. 

These main operating companies are 
supported by our Group-wide service 
company, BX, which provides 
technology, operations and functional 
services to businesses across the 
Group.

Barclays PLC

BBPLC

Barclays Europe

Barclays US LLC

Barclays Bank Delaware

BBUKPLC

BX

Our governance framework

The Board recognises that effective 
governance is key to the successful 
development and execution of the Group’s 
strategy. We think of governance as how 
the Board makes decisions and provides 
oversight to promote Barclays’ success for 
the long-term sustainable benefit of our 
shareholders, having regard to the 
interests of our stakeholders (including our 
clients, customers, colleagues and the 
society and wider environment in which we 
operate).

Our Group-wide governance framework 
is constructed to:

• facilitate the effective management of 

the Group by our Group Chief Executive 
and his ExCo across our 
diverse businesses 

• support and provide oversight and 

constructive challenge of the Group’s 
major subsidiary boards in the UK, 
Ireland and the US, consistent with the 
legal, regulatory and independence 
requirements applicable to 
those entities.

Generally, there is one set of rules for the 
Group. Group-wide frameworks, policies 
and standards are adopted throughout the 
Group unless local laws or regulations (for 
example, the ring-fencing obligations 
applicable to BBUKPLC) require otherwise, 
or ExCo deems that it would otherwise be 
appropriate in a specific instance.

Corporate Governance 
Operating Manual 
Our Corporate Governance Operating 
Manual outlines how the Group’s significant 
subsidiaries (and their respective boards 
and board committees) should interact 
with each other. It also provides guidance 
and clarity for management and Directors 
as to how these relationships and 
processes should work in practice. This is a 
dynamic document that evolves with the 
changing nature of the Group.
The role of the Board 

The BPLC Board sets the Purpose, 
strategic direction and risk appetite for the 
Group and is the ultimate decision-making 
body for matters of Group-wide strategic, 
financial, regulatory or reputational 
significance. 

We partially consolidated and streamlined 
the membership of the BPLC and BBPLC 
Boards in 2019, to improve efficiency and 
co-ordination while reducing complexity 
and unnecessary duplication. 

As a result, membership of the BBPLC 
Board is a subset of the BPLC Board. All 
members of the BPLC Board (except the 
Senior Independent Director, Chair of 
BBUKPLC and at least one other Non-
Executive Director) also serve on the 
Board of BBPLC.    

We believe that having members of the 
BPLC Board serving as the Chairs of some 
of the Group’s main subsidiaries supports 
improved efficiency, escalation and co-
ordination while ensuring an appropriate 
focus is given to matters relevant to each 
entity.

Matters reserved to the Board 

Matters reserved solely for the decision-
making power of the Board are set out in 
our bespoke Matters Reserved to the Board. 
Those matters include material decisions 
relating to:

• strategy

• risk appetite

• medium term plans

• capital and liquidity plans

• risk management and controls 

frameworks

• approval of financial statements

• approval of large transactions 

• approval of share allotments, dividends 

and share buybacks. 

Responsibility for the Group’s business on 
a day-to-day basis has been delegated by 
the Board to the Group Chief Executive, 
supported by his ExCo, to make and 
implement operational decisions. 
Information provided to 
the Board 

The Group Chairman is responsible for 
setting the Board’s agenda, primarily 
focused on strategy, performance, value 
creation, culture, stakeholders and 
accountability. The Chairman also ensures 
that Board members receive timely and 
high-quality information to enable them to 
make sound decisions and promote the 
success of BPLC. 

The Group Company Secretary, working in 
collaboration with the Group Chairman, is 
responsible for ensuring good governance 
and information flow, to support the 
Board’s effectiveness. In 2023, we 
continued to strive for balanced papers 
which clearly identify substantive issues 
and key points for the Board’s attention, 
continuing the momentum created in 
previous years.

The Board is kept informed of key business 
developments throughout the year 
through regular updates from the 
Executive Directors and senior 
management, in addition to the 
presentations delivered to the Board and 
the Board Committees as part of formal 
meetings.
+

Details of key Board activities for 2023 are set 
out on pages 153 to 155.

Directors are able to seek independent 
and professional advice at Barclays’ 
expense, where required, to enable them 
to fulfil their obligations to the Board. 
Attendance at Board meetings

Directors are expected to attend every 
Board meeting. Where a Director is not 
able to attend a Board meeting, the 
relevant Director’s views are made known 
to the Group Chairman in advance of the 
meeting. The Chairman also meets 
privately, on a regular basis, with each 
Non-Executive Director.
+

Details of Director attendance at Board 
meetings in 2023 are shown on the next page.

Board Committees 

The Board is supported in its work by its 
Committees - the Board Nominations 
Committee, Board Audit Committee, 
Board Risk Committee, Board 
Remuneration Committee and the Board 
Sustainability Committee - each of which 
has its own terms of reference clearly 
setting out its remit and decision-making 
powers. This structure enables the Board 
to spend a significant proportion of its time 
focusing on the Group’s strategy. 

The Board Committees are comprised 
solely of Non-Executive Directors, with the 
exception of the Board Sustainability 
Committee of which the Group Chief 
Executive is an Executive member.

The Chairs of each Committee report on 
their Committee’s work at every scheduled 
Board meeting. 
Board effectiveness

The effectiveness of the Board, its 
Committees and individual Directors are 
assessed on an annual basis. We carried 
out an internally facilitated effectiveness 
review for 2023, which was led by the SID 
and supported by the Group Company 
Secretary. In line with the requirements of 
the Code, we intend to conduct an 
externally-facilitated review of the Board, 
Board Committees and individual 
Directors in 2024. 
+ You can read more about the 2023 effectiveness 

review, and progress against recommendations 
from the 2022 review, in the Board Nominations 
Committee report on page 164.

Directors’ report: Key Board activities

Key Board activities in 2023

Keenly focused on strategy to drive the long-term success of Barclays.

Throughout 2023, the Board devoted 
significant attention to Barclays’ strategy, 
working closely with the Group Chief 
Executive and his ExCo both to drive 
forward the implementation of the Group’s 
strategy as set by the Board and to 
challenge itself on Barclays' strategic 
ambitions. 

Against a backdrop of geopolitical 
tensions, together with high interest rates 
and inflationary pressures, the Board 
remained focused on driving sustainable 
long-term value for the benefit of all of our 
stakeholders. You can read about how the 
Board has taken into account stakeholder 
interests in our Section 172(1) statement 
in the Strategic report from page 38.

Within the overarching consideration of 
Group strategy matters, the Board 
continued to give significant consideration 
to our climate and sustainability strategy. 
Given the importance of the work to 
address the climate challenge, the Board 
approved the establishment of the Board 
Sustainability Committee in March 2023. 
The Board Sustainability Committee 
supports the Board's oversight of the 
Group's climate strategy and sustainability 
agenda, including our ambition to be a net 
zero bank by 2050. Please see the Board 
Sustainability Committee report on page 
180 for further detail. 

You can read more about the key areas 
of Board focus in 2023 in the rest of 
this section.

Spotlight

Board engagement with 
colleagues

The Board strongly believes in the 
importance of engaging with our 
stakeholders and hearing their views, 
which brings valuable outside 
perspectives to the Board. In particular, 
the Board recognises that our 
colleagues are critical to our success. 
Ensuring that Board members have an 
opportunity to engage directly with 
colleagues is an important part of our 
method of workforce engagement and 
helps the Board take the issues of 
interest to our colleagues into account 
in its decision-making. During 2023, 
Board engagement with colleagues 
included: 

• The Group Chairman and Mary 

Francis visited our contact centre in 
Wavertree, Liverpool, to experience 
the Consumer Duty 'in action', 
meeting with customer-facing 
colleagues and learning about how 
Barclays is addressing vulnerable 
customer needs. 

• The Group Chief Executive and 
Group Finance Director hosted 
quarterly all-colleague town halls on 
Barclays' financial performance.

• Robert Berry and Sir John Kingman 
visited Barclays branches in London 
where they met colleagues.

• The Group Chief Executive hosted 

the Citizenship and Diversity Awards 
to celebrate colleagues who have 
made a positive impact in their 
communities and have helped to 
strengthen the diversity, equity and 
inclusion (DEI) culture within 
Barclays.

• Julia Wilson participated in a 

celebration event to congratulate 
newly promoted Managing Directors 
from across the Group.

• The Group Chairman, along with 

other Board members, visited the 
new trading floors at our head office 
in London, meeting colleagues in the 
Markets business and experiencing 
the trading floors first-hand.  

• Board members spent time with 

Barclays UK colleagues based in the 
UK and India. 

• The Group Finance Director met 

colleagues during visits to our New 
York, Glasgow and Northampton 
Campuses, and hosted other 
colleague events including an event 
to mark International Women's Day.

succession planning and evaluating Board 
performance. 

Through its work, the Committee ensures 
that the Board has the right balance of

background and thought to be able to 
provide informed and constructive 
challenge to management while acting 
fairly in the interests of our stakeholders. 
Committee membership

Directors’ report: Board Nominations Committee report (continued)

Board size   

As at 31 December 2023, the size of the 
Board was 13.  

Continuing to review the optimal size of 
the Board is an important part of the 
Committee’s medium and longer-term 
succession planning. As part of this, the 
Committee takes into account the need 
for the Board to be small enough to 
operate in an efficient and collaborative 
manner yet large enough to ensure an 
appropriate mix of skills and diversity, to 
support succession planning and to 
accommodate the additional roles and 
responsibilities of some of our Directors 
on Board Committees, and on the Boards 
of BBPLC, BBUKPLC, Barclays Europe, 
Barclays US LLC and BX. 

The Committee considers that the size of 
the Board contributes to its effectiveness. 

Composition

Through considering the skills, 
experience, knowledge and diversity 
required for effective Board, Board 
Committee and ExCo composition, as 
well as overseeing the annual Board, 
Board Committee and individual 
Director effectiveness evaluations 
(outlined later in this report), the 
Committee regularly reviews 
composition and succession planning 
and Non-Executive Director 
recruitment priorities. 

You can find biographies for each 
Director, including details of the skills, 
experience and knowledge they bring 
to the Board, their Board Committee 
memberships and other principal 
appointments on pages 145 to 148.  

Changes to Board composition 
in 2023 

The Committee oversaw a series of 
changes to Board and Board Committee 
composition during the course of 2023, 
building on the progress made in 2022. 
Board and Board Committee changes are 
set out in the table on the previous page of 
this report. 

The Board considers that these changes 
have enhanced the effectiveness of the 
Board and relevant Committees, providing 
valuable input and support to their work as 
well as bringing new and diverse 
perspectives to discussions.

We continued to strengthen the 
composition of the Board with the addition 
of two Non-Executive Directors in 2023. 
Marc Moses, appointed with effect from 23 
January 2023, brings to the Board a strong 
technical finance background and 
extensive knowledge of banking and 
financial services. Sir John Kingman has a 
deep background in financial services, 
gained from his executive and non-
executive career, and joined as a Non-
Executive Director with effect from 
1 June 2023, upon taking up his role as 
Chair of BBUKPLC. 

Mike Ashley retired from the Board at the 
conclusion of our AGM on 3 May 2023 and 
Crawford Gillies retired shortly thereafter 
on 31 May 2023, each having served on the 
Board for around nine years. Both Mike and 
Crawford made a significant contribution 
to the Group during the course of their 
tenure, for which the Committee and the 
Board are very grateful.

Directors’ report: Board Nominations Committee report (continued)

Diversity

The Committee and the Board 
recognise the benefits of diversity in all 
its forms, including in relation to 
gender, ethnicity, age, sexual 
orientation, disability and socio-
economic background.

Having due regard for the benefits of 
diversity - at Board, Board Committee 
and ExCo level - is a vital part of the 
Committee’s role in leading 
appointments and succession planning 
for these key roles.   

Gender and ethnic diversity 
reporting

Disclosures in the form prescribed by the 
new UK Listing Rules requirements relating 
to gender and ethnic diversity of the Board 
and executive management can be found 
in this section.

Data relating to the gender and ethnic 
diversity of the Board was collected by way 
of a questionnaire. This questionnaire 
asked all individual Board members to 
disclose their gender identity and ethnic 
background, on a voluntary self-reporting 
basis, by selecting options aligned with 
those in the left-hand columns of the 
tables to the right (and therefore included 
the option not to specify an answer).

Barclays’ employees (including executive 
management, as defined in the table to the 
right) are asked to confirm their gender 
and ethnicity at the onboarding stage, on a 
voluntary self-reporting basis, by selecting 
options (which include the option not to 
specify an answer). Data relating to the 
gender and ethnic diversity of executive 
management (as defined) was sourced 
from this existing data, which is held within 
Barclays’ secure HR system.
Board Diversity and Inclusion 
Policy 

On the recommendation of the 
Committee, the Board adopted a revised 
version of the Board Diversity and Inclusion 
Policy on 8 February 2024.

The policy confirms the Board is 
supportive of the Group’s culture in which 
Barclays is committed to continuing to 
build a diverse, equitable and inclusive 
workplace, and that the Board recognises 
the benefits of a diverse, equitable and 
inclusive Board, reflective of the 
communities in which we operate, in 
driving effective decision-making.

objective criteria, recognising the benefits 
that diversity, in all its forms, brings to the 
Board, and that due regard will be also 
given to diversity and inclusion 
characteristics when considering Board 
Committee appointments.  

The policy sets out the Board’s existing 
gender and ethnic diversity targets 
detailed in the table on the following page, 
which are aligned with the targets 
recommended by the FTSE Women 
Leaders Review on gender diversity and 
the Parker Review Committee Report into 
Ethnic Diversity of UK Boards, which are 
reflected in the Listing Rules.

Directors’ report: Board Nominations Committee report (continued)

In addition, the policy also confirms the 
Board's ongoing commitment to operating 
in a way that supports diversity, equity and 
inclusion, where Directors’ views are both 
encouraged and heard.

As set out in the table within this section, 
at 31 December 2023, the proportion of 
women on the Board was 38%. While this 
fell short of the 40% target set out in the 
Listing Rules, FTSE Women Leaders 
Review and our Board Diversity and 
Inclusion Policy, the Board satisfied the 
target of having at least one woman in a 
senior Board role. 

As we reported in our 2022 Annual Report 
and as set out in our Board Diversity and 
Inclusion Policy (as described above), the 
Committee and the Board remain 
committed to ensuring that all Board 
appointments and succession plans are 
based on merit and objective criteria, with 
due regard given to diversity, and focused 
on meeting our gender diversity targets as 
set out in our Board Diversity and Inclusion 
Policy by 2025 while continuing to bring the 
very best, diverse talent we can attract to 
the Board. You can read more about the 
Board appointment process and 
succession planning in the sections that 
follow.  

We also recognise and embrace the 
benefits of diversity at Board Committee 
level. As at 31 December 2023, Board 
Committee gender diversity was 
as follows: 

• Board Nominations Committee 

– 40% women 

• Board Audit Committee 

– 50% women

• Board Risk Committee 

– 43% women

• Board Sustainability Committee 

– 43% women 

• Board Remuneration Committee 

– 60% women

Gender diversity within ExCo, 
ExCo direct reports and the 
wider workforce 

Group-wide, Barclays remains committed 
to its DEI vision and strategy, which was 
refreshed in 2022, and includes a series of 
principles and strategic priorities designed 
to support Barclays make progress against 
the six DEI agendas including its Gender 
Ambition, which is focused on improving 
gender diversity in senior leadership across 
Barclays.

The Board received an update during the 
year on Barclays' DEI ambitions, including a 
focus on the Gender Ambition, as 
described in the Key Board activities 
section on page 153.  

In 2022, Barclays announced its refreshed 
Gender Ambition of 33% representation of 
women in senior leadership roles - 
Managing Directors and Directors - by the 
end of 2025, having achieved its initial 
target of 28% representation of women in 
these roles by the end of 2021.

To achieve this ambition, Barclays focuses 
on the retention, development, 
progression and hiring of diverse talent at 
all levels. Regular reporting on progress 
against ambitions is shared with senior 
management. As at 31 December 2023, 
representation of women among 
Managing Directors and Directors was at 
30%Δ globally, and Barclays is focused on 
continuing its efforts to identify diverse 
talent in the market and develop existing 
diverse talent within Barclays.

The Committee is also mindful of the 
voluntary target recommended by the 
FTSE Women Leaders Review of 40% 
representation of women for ExCo and 
their direct reports by the end of 2025.

As at 31 December 2023, representation 
of women among ExCo and their direct 
reports stood at 27%Δ, remaining level with 
the 2022 year end position. 

While this fell short of the FTSE Women 
Leaders Review recommendation, 
increasing gender diversity within both 
ExCo and their direct reports, to ensure 
a diverse pipeline for ExCo succession, 
remains a key priority for Barclays and the 
Committee. 

In 2023, Barclays continued to have one 
ex-officio position on ExCo, with each 
appointee serving for a four-month 
rotation. This initiative, first introduced in 
2016, broadens the scope of perspectives 
and contributions made to ExCo, while also 
providing appointees with exposure to 
matters of Group-wide significance and 
further leadership experience. In 2023, 
all three holders of this position 
were women.

There are additional initiatives and actions 
being taken across our businesses to 
further strengthen the senior leadership 
pipeline; these include using the ex officio 
position at business unit executive 
committees, sponsorship programmes to 
support individual development and 
working with senior recruitment partners 
to strengthen our external pipeline.

Ethnic diversity reporting as at 
31 December 2023 

As at 31 December 2023, 23% of the 
Board (three members) were from a 
minority ethnic background (excluding 
minority white ethnic groups), meeting the 
targets set out in the Listing Rules, the 
recommendations contained within the 
Parker Review Committee Report into the 
Ethnic Diversity of UK Boards and the 
ethnic diversity target in the Board 
Diversity and Inclusion Policy. 

Alongside the Board, the Committee 
continues to support the Group’s 
Multicultural agenda, including Barclays' 
Underrepresented Race and Ethnicity 
Ambition. Venkat, our Group Chief 
Executive, has made a significant 
contribution to Barclays’ diversity agenda. 
Having achieved our Race at Work 
ambition to double the number of Black 
Managing Directors globally from nine to 
18 by 2022, in January 2023, we set a new 
ambition to increase the population of 
Managing Directors from 
underrepresented ethnicities by at least 
50% by the end of 2025.

You can find more information on Barclays’ 
continued commitment to its Multicultural 
agenda, including information regarding

talent. Open advertising for Board 
positions was not used in 2023.

The Committee will continue to review the 
Board’s recruitment priorities and give 
further consideration to the desired skills 
and experience for potential candidates, to 
ensure that due consideration continues 
to be given to strong potential candidates 
who would enhance the effectiveness of 
the Board.  
Non-Executive Director 
independence 

In line with the requirements of the Code, 
a majority of our Board comprises 
independent Non-Executive Directors. 
The independence of our Non-Executive 
Directors is considered by the Committee 
on an annual basis, having regard to the 
independence criteria set out in the Code. 
As part of this process, the Committee 
reviews the length of tenure of all 
Directors, which can affect independence, 
and makes any recommendations to the 
Board accordingly.

The Committee reviewed the 
independence of all Non-Executive 
Directors serving on the Board as at 31 
December 2023. The independence of 
those who had served on the Board for 
more than six years (Diane Schueneman 
and Mary Francis) and more than nine 
years (Tim Breedon) was subject to a more 
rigorous review. The Committee remains 
satisfied that the length of their tenure has 
no impact on their respective levels of 
independence or the effectiveness of their 
contributions. The Committee and the 
Board consider all of the Non-Executive 
Directors to be independent.

For further details of the Committee’s 
review of the independence of Tim 
Breedon, please refer to the Succession 
section below.

During 2023, Mike Ashley and Crawford 
Gillies stepped down from the Board. Mike 
and Crawford did not raise any concerns 
about the operation of the Board or 
management.

Process for 
appointments

The Committee leads the process for 
Board appointments, ensuring that all 
appointments are based on merit and 
objective criteria - focusing on the 
skills, experience and knowledge 
required for the Board’s effectiveness 
and to support the continued delivery 
of the Group’s strategy - while also 
promoting diversity of background 
and opinion.  

Appointments to the Board are made 
following a formal, rigorous and 
transparent procedure, facilitated by 
the Committee with the aid of 
external search consultancy firms, as 
outlined in further detail below.

Non-Executive 
Director recruitment

The Committee regularly reviews and 
updates a series of skills-based Non-
Executive Director recruitment priorities. 
These priorities underpin the searches 
required for the Board to ensure orderly 
succession as Non-Executive Directors 
approach the end of their tenure and to 
ensure an optimum balance of skills and 
experience on the Board. 

The Committee considered and refreshed 
the priorities in 2023, in light of Non-
Executive Director recruitment activity, 
including the appointments of Marc Moses 
and Sir John Kingman during 2023 and two 
Non-Executive Directors having stepped 
down from the Board in 2023 at the end of 
their tenure. The Committee has agreed 
that all Board members should have the 
opportunity to meet leading candidates, 
and that diversity should remain a priority 
in all searches.     

Based on the agreed priorities, the 
Committee has set rigorous criteria for the 
roles it is seeking to fill, both in terms of 
experience and personal qualities. 
Independent search firms Spencer Stuart 
and Egon Zehnder supported our targeted 
external mapping and search processes 
for additional Non-Executive Directors to 
complement the range of skills on the 
Board in 2023, based on the agreed 
criteria. Diversity of background and 
experience remain at the forefront of 
those searches. 

Spencer Stuart and Egon Zehnder do not 
have any connection to Barclays or any of 
the Directors other than to assist with 
searches for executive and non-executive

In 2023, the Committee reviewed and endorsed a refresh of the process for Board and Board Committee

Our standard practice is to appoint any new Non-Executive Director or Chair to the Board for an initial three-year 
term, subject to annual re-election at the AGM (as outlined below). This may be extended for a further term of up to 
three years. 

As such, our Non-Executive Directors typically serve up to a minimum of six years, although this period may be 
extended where considered appropriate by the Committee.

All Directors are subject to appointment or reappointment (as appropriate) each year by shareholders at the AGM.

and reappointment

Time commitment 

All new Directors are asked to disclose 
their other significant commitments, which 
are then taken into account by the 
Committee when considering any 
proposed appointment to ensure that 
Directors can discharge their 
responsibilities to Barclays effectively. 
Expected time commitments are agreed 
with each Non-Executive Director on an 
individual basis, and include time to 
understand the business and complete 
training as well as time to attend and 
prepare for formal Board and Board 
Committee meetings. In considering 
whether a Director has sufficient time to 
commit to their role, the Committee has 
regard to regulatory and Code 
requirements, as well as key investor and 
proxy advisor guidelines. Details of the 
external executive and non-executive 
directorships held within listed companies 
for each of the Directors are set out in the 
table on this page. You can find details of 
other principal appointments for each 
Director in the Board of Directors section 
from page 145. 

The Committee reviewed the existing 
commitments disclosed by each of Marc 
Moses and Sir John Kingman ahead of their 
respective appointments to the Board, and 
was comfortable that these would not 
impact their ability to devote such time as 
is necessary to discharge their duties to 
Barclays effectively.  

Before accepting any significant new 
commitment outside of Barclays, all 
Directors must seek approval from the 
Board (providing an indication of expected 
time commitment). Prior to approving any 
significant new external commitment for a 
Director, the Board reviews all relevant 
facts and circumstances (including the 
expected role and time commitment, as 
well as the nature of the external 
organisation).

All Directors are expected to commit 
additional time as necessary to their work 
on the Board, where circumstances 
require. For the year ended 31 December 
2023 and as at the date of publication, the 
Board is satisfied that none of the 
Directors is over-committed and that each 
of the Directors allocates sufficient time to 
their role in order to discharge their 
responsibilities effectively. A record of 
each Director’s time commitments is 
maintained.

Conflicts of interest

The Board has the authority to authorise 
Director conflicts of interest, in 
accordance with the Companies Act 2006 
and BPLC’s articles of association. This 
ensures that the influence of third parties 
does not compromise the independent 
judgement of the Board. Directors are 
required to declare any potential or actual 
conflicts of interest that could interfere 
with their ability to act in the best interests 
of the Group.

Directors’ report: Board Nominations Committee report (continued)

A conflicts register recording actual and 
potential conflicts of interest, together 
with any Board authorisations of conflicts, 
is maintained. Authorisations are for an 
indefinite period but are reviewed on an bi-
annual basis by the Board. The Board also 
considers the effectiveness of the 
conflicts authorisation process.

The Board retains the power to vary or 
terminate conflicts authorisations at any 
time.

The Group Company Secretary consults 
the Group Chairman when designing each 
bespoke induction schedule, taking into 
account the particular needs of the new 
Director.  

When a Director is joining a Board 
Committee, their induction schedule will 
also include an induction to the operation 
of that Committee. 

An overview of training and development 
delivered to the Board during 2023 is 
described in the table below. 

Director training and 
development

The Committee supports the Group 
Chairman in developing and monitoring 
effective induction, training and 
development for the Board in accordance 
with its Terms of Reference (available at 
home.barclays/who-we-are/our-
governance/board-committees ). 
Directors are provided with the 
opportunity to take part in ongoing training 
and development, but can also request 
specific training, as required. 

All Directors receive a comprehensive 
induction tailored to their individual 
requirements on appointment, designed 
to provide them with an understanding of 
the operation of the Group and its strategy 
and key business areas and functions.

ExCo succession 

The Committee approves all changes to 
ExCo composition prior to announcement, 
taking into account executive succession 
plans.

In 2023, the Committee received updates 
regarding succession planning and 
proposed appointments for ExCo, 
including in relation to the review of the 
balance of skills and diversity on ExCo and 
for key successors. The Committee 
approved the ExCo changes in 2023, as set 
out on page 149, prior to implementation.     
+ You can read more about gender diversity 

within ExCo and their direct reports in the 
Diversity section of this Board 
Nominations Committee report.  

Succession

Through robust succession planning 
throughout the year, the Committee 
ensures that we will continue to strike 
the right balance of skills, experience, 
diversity and effectiveness on the 
Board, Committees and ExCo, as well 
as accounting for current and 
anticipated future business needs.  

The Committee’s vital work in this area 
includes both medium-term planning 
(orderly refreshing of the Board, 
Committees and ExCo) and long-term 
planning (looking ahead to the skills 
that may be required on the Board and 
the ExCo in the future).

Committee consideration of 
succession

As at 1 November 2023, Tim Breedon had 
served on the Board for 11 years. In early 
2024, the Committee undertook a 
rigorous assessment of Tim’s continued 
independence, as it had done in the two 
previous years. Following careful 
consideration, the Committee concluded 
that it remained appropriate for Tim to 
continue to serve on the Board beyond his 
11-year tenure. 

In reaching this conclusion, the Committee 
recognises the significant value that Tim 
continues to bring to Board discussions, 
particularly given his breadth of financial 
services sector experience and deep 
knowledge of risk and regulatory issues. 

Both the Committee and the Board 
continue to believe that it is advantageous 
for Group-wide decision-making to have 
the Chairs of the Group’s significant 
subsidiaries sit on the BPLC Board, 
considering that this provides connectivity 
with the Group's significant subsidiaries, 
bringing with it important insight into Board 
discussions. With these factors in mind, 
and in light of Tim’s ongoing role as Chair 
of Barclays Europe, the Group’s principal 
European subsidiary, the Committee and 
the Board consider it is appropriate for Tim 
to continue as an independent Non-
Executive Director on the BPLC Board in 
the near-term. 

Given the Board's preference for the 
Chairs of the Group's significant 
subsidiaries to also be represented on the 
Board, in light of Tim's tenure, the 
Committee is giving due consideration to 
potential successors for his roles on the 
Board and as Chair of Barclays Europe. 

Diane Schueneman will have been on the 
Board for nine years in June 2024, and the 
Committee is also giving due 
consideration to potential successors for 
her roles on the BPLC Board and as Chair 
of BX.
Tenure

The Committee and the Board consider 
that length of tenure is only one of the 
factors to be considered with respect to 
Director independence, and accordingly, 
that tenure alone should not result in a loss 
of independence. The Committee and the 
Board are confident that Tim remains 
independent and continues to provide 
effective challenge, advice and support to 
management on business performance 
and decision-making. Having undertaken a 
rigorous review of Tim’s performance as a 
Non-Executive Director and taking into 
account other relevant factors that might 
be considered likely to impair, or could 
appear to impair, his independence 
including as set out in Provision 10 of the 
Code, the Committee and the Board 
consider Tim to be independent.

Evaluation

Board, Committee and individual Director evaluation process

The Committee ensures that a formal 
and rigorous review of the 
performance of the Board, Board 
Committees and individual Directors is 
undertaken each year, in line with the 
requirements of the Code.

The 2023 effectiveness review was

effectiveness review

As reported in last year's Annual Report, 
the 2022 Board effectiveness review was 
facilitated internally, in line with the Code. 
The 2024 Board effectiveness review is 
expected to be externally facilitated, in line 
with Code requirements that the Board 
effectiveness review be conducted by 
an external facilitator at least every

Actions taken during the year

Areas

Discussion of key 
areas of focus  

Board agendas

In the context of what is understandably a structured 
meeting agenda, Board members would welcome the 
opportunity for more unstructured discussion of key areas 
of focus for the Board - whether in regard to particular 
matters on the agenda or other macro or external 
developments since the previous meeting.

Introduction of standing Board agenda item for open 
discussion of major current topics with Board members.   

Consideration should continue to be given to the 
structure of Board agendas to ensure that time allocations 
are appropriate.

The format of certain standing Board agenda items 
continued to evolve, with positive Board feedback 
received on changes made. 

Board materials 

Continued focus on ensuring balanced papers which 
clearly identify substantive points and key issues for the 
Board’s attention.

Additional time allocated on the Board agenda for 
discussion of material items. 

The Group Chairman and Group Chief Executive 
continued to work with management to ensure that 
substantive points and key issues for discussion by the 
Board were as clear and concise as possible within papers 
presented to the Board.

Committee reporting 
to Board

Engagement with 
senior executives 

Continued focus on Committee reporting to the Board, to 
ensure the Board has the right level of visibility on key 
areas of focus.

Inclusion of written reports of certain Committee 
meetings within Board papers, in addition to thematic, 
forward-looking reports.  

Continue to identify opportunities for more informal 
engagement between the Non-Executive Directors and 
senior executives outside the boardroom.

More informal engagement included engagement with 
management on Board papers, Board and Committee 
dinners with relevant senior executives, Board support for 
certain client events and Board engagement with 
colleagues as described in the Key Board activities section. 

External perspectives included the external briefing 
provided to the Board Sustainability Committee on policy 
and regulatory developments in relation to biodiversity 
and nature.

Outside perspectives  Continue to identify opportunities to bring external 

perspectives into the Board.

Individual Director effectiveness

All Directors in office at the end of 2023 
were subject to an individual effectiveness 
review. The Group Chairman considered 
each Director’s individual contribution to 
the Board as well as any feedback received 
as part of the broader Board and Board 
Committee effectiveness reviews.

Based on these reviews, the Board 
accepted the view of the Committee that 
each Director to be proposed for election 
or re-election at the 2024 AGM continues 
to be effective and contributes to Barclays’ 
long-term sustainable success.

All of the current Directors of the 
Company intend to submit themselves for 
election or re-election at the 2024 AGM 
and will be unanimously recommended by 
the Board for election or re-election as 
appropriate.

2023 Board effectiveness review

Feedback provided by interviewees as part 
of the 2023 Board effectiveness review 
provides important insight into the Board’s 
performance, including areas in which the 
Board could be more effective.

Following consideration of the findings of 
the 2023 Board effectiveness review, the 
Committee remains satisfied that the 
Board is operating effectively.
Feedback from 2023 review

Feedback from this review indicated that 
the Board is operating well and effectively, 
with Board members commenting 
favourably on the culture of the Board, 
where members feel able to share their 
different perspectives and views. Board 
members emphasised how this culture is 
supported by the inclusive style of the 
Group Chairman and his values-driven 
approach. The review indicated that Board 
composition is considered to be a 
strength, bringing together a range of 
diverse and complementary backgrounds, 
including deep financial services expertise. 
The interaction between the Board and 
the Board Committees was commented 
upon favourably, with regular reporting 
ensuring the Board has good visibility on 
key areas of focus. The review highlighted 
the positive relationship between the 
Board and management, and an 
appropriate level of support and challenge. 
Recommendations from 2023 review 

The 2023 review outlined the following key 
recommendations: 

• consider how Board agendas might be 

structured to (i) allow for deeper 
discussion of business performance; 
and (ii) create more flexibility for 
discussion of key topics and reflections 
within the agenda

• identify opportunities for more open and 
wide-ranging discussions on big picture 
issues

• continue to focus on ensuring balanced 
papers which clearly identify substantive 
points and key issues for the Board’s 
attention

• continue to identify opportunities to 
bring external perspectives into the 
Board.

2023 Board Committee 
effectiveness review

The Board Committee reviews are an 
important part of the way Barclays 
monitors and improves Committee 
performance and effectiveness, 
maximising strengths and highlighting 
areas for further development. 

The results of the 2023 Board 
Nominations Committee effectiveness 
review are reported below, and the results 
of the reviews of the effectiveness of the 
other Board Committees are reported 
within their individual reports elsewhere in 
this Board Governance report.  

Following consideration of the findings of 
the 2023 Board Committee effectiveness 
reviews, the Committee remains satisfied 
that each of the Board Committees are 
operating effectively. 
Review of Board Nominations 
Committee effectiveness

The results of the 2023 review confirm the 
Committee is operating effectively. It is 
considered well constituted and chaired, 
providing high-quality oversight and 
constructive challenge to management in 
the areas within its remit. The review 
highlights that the Committee is 
considered to have the right level of skills 
and experience. 

Feedback indicates that the allocation of 
time between agenda items in Committee 
meetings is appropriate, with sufficient 
time for discussion and challenge, and 
focus on the right areas. 

The Committee’s interaction with the 
Board, Board Committees and senior 
management is considered effective, 
noting that sufficient time is allocated at 
Board meetings for the Chair to report to 
the Board on the work of the Committee. 
Feedback indicated that concurrent 
meetings of the BPLC and BBPLC Board 
Nominations Committee continue to be 
effective, with coverage of BBPLC matters 
within concurrent meetings considered 
appropriate.  

Interaction with the BBUKPLC Board 
Nominations Committee was also 
considered effective, confirming that the 
Committee continues to exercise 
sufficient oversight of issues relevant to 
the Committee’s remit relating to 
BBUKPLC.

Annual Report 2023 166

Focused on a robust internal control 
environment

Overseeing the integrity of our financial disclosures and the effectiveness 
of the internal control environment.
Dear Fellow Shareholders

I was appointed as Chair of the Committee 
in April 2023 and so this is my first report of 
the Board Audit Committee as Committee 
Chair. 

I would like to extend my thanks to my 
predecessor, Mike Ashley, for his careful 
stewardship of the Committee and 
diligence in handing it over to me. We also 
welcomed Marc Moses to the Committee 
on 23 January 2023, bringing his strong 
technical finance background with a deep 
knowledge of banking and financial 
services.

During the year, the Committee has had a 
significant focus on management’s 
initiatives to drive sustainable 
improvements in the Group’s internal 
control environment. Specifically, the 
Committee received regular updates on 
the internal control environment from the 
business heads, Group Chief Internal 
Auditor, Group Chief Controls Officer and 
KPMG, identifying any thematic trends 
which may be arising across the Group and 
encouraging management to take a pro-
active approach in identifying areas for 
enhancement.

The Committee also maintained close 
oversight of an internal programme 
established by the Group Chief Executive 
at the end of 2022, and led by the Group 
Chief Operating Officer, to improve senior 
oversight of the more material regulatory 
remediation programmes with a view to 
enhancing controls in order to achieve a 
consistently excellent operating 
environment across the Group. This 
programme operates in parallel with the 
broader cultural change programme led by 
our Group Chief Executive, which you can 
read more about in the Section 172(1) 
statement in the Strategic report.

The Committee recognises that 
maintaining a robust system of internal 
control is a continuous journey and there 
will always be programmes in train to 
ensure that ongoing improvements are 
made. As part of this, the Committee has 
been receiving reports on an internal 
programme to enhance the system

of risk management and internal control 
for compliance with laws, rules and 
regulations. Financial crime controls also 
continue to be an area of significant focus 
for the Group and the Committee is 
closely following management’s progress 
in this area to ensure that the control 
framework is robust. Previous reports of 
the Committee also highlighted significant 
work by management on control 
remediation and enhancement 
programmes in relation to trading controls. 
While that work remains ongoing, the 
Committee was pleased to see significant 
progress made during 2023, with key 
remediation programmes in those areas 
scheduled to achieve significant 
milestones or complete during 2024.

To decide whether any control issues 
required specific disclosure in this Annual 
Report, the Committee continued to apply 
similar concepts to those used for 
assessing internal control over financial 
reporting for the purposes of the US 
Sarbanes-Oxley Act (SOx). The 
Committee is satisfied that there are no 
control issues which are considered to be a 
material weakness and which merit specific 
disclosure. 

In overseeing the integrity of our financial 
disclosures, the Committee was mindful 
that the macroeconomic environment 
during the year remained challenging with 
continuing high interest rates, inflationary 
pressures and geopolitical uncertainty. 
The Committee received regular updates 
from the Group Finance Director and 
Group Chief Accounting Officer, focusing 
on key areas including credit impairment 
and coverage, provisions, valuations and 
tax. The Committee will continue to closely 
monitor management’s judgements in 
these areas and their disclosure. 

The Committee works closely with the 
Board Risk Committee and Board 
Sustainability Committee, ensuring a 
streamlined view of matters of relevance 
across the Committees. The Committee 
welcomed enhanced reporting by 
management with the incorporation of 
operational risk dashboards to provide a 
more holistic view across the controls and 
risk space. This is expected to support the 
effective and efficient consideration by the 
Board Audit Committee and Board Risk 
Committee of matters relevant to both 
committees.

Looking ahead

Management has made some significant 
progress on remediation during the course 
of 2023; maintaining that momentum in 
2024 will be a key focus of the Committee.

Finally, after some five years in the role, 
and having made significant progress in 
the operation and methodologies used by 
BIA, Lindsay O’Reilly will be stepping down 
as Group Chief Internal Auditor during 
2024. The Committee will be looking to 
approve the appointment of a new Group 
Chief Internal Auditor in the coming 
months and would like to extend its thanks 
to Lindsay for her invaluable support, which 
is continuing through this transition period.

Julia Wilson

Chair, Board Audit Committee

19 February 2024

The results of the Committee 
effectiveness review for 2023 confirm the 
Committee is operating effectively. It is 
considered well constituted and chaired, 
providing an effective and appropriate level 
of challenge and oversight of the areas 
within its remit. Feedback recognised the 
effective transition of the Chair in April 
2023. The review highlights that the 
Committee is considered to have the right 
level of skills and experience, including 
recent and relevant financial experience, 
and is of an appropriate size. Feedback 
indicates that the Committee is 
considered to operate at the right level of 
debate, and confirms that the allocation of 
time between agenda items in Committee 
meetings is appropriate, with sufficient 
time for discussion and challenge. 

The Committee’s interaction with the 
Board, Board Committees and senior 
management is considered effective, 
noting that sufficient time is allocated at 
Board meetings for the Chair to report to 
the Board on the work of the Committee. 
Feedback indicated that concurrent 
meetings of the BPLC and BBPLC Board 
Audit Committee continue to be effective, 
with coverage of BBPLC matters within 
concurrent meetings considered 
appropriate. 

Interaction with the BBUKPLC Board Audit 
Committee was also considered effective, 
confirming that the Committee continues 
to exercise sufficient oversight of issues 
relevant to the Committee’s remit relating 
to BBUKPLC.

Please see the report of the Board 
Nominations Committee for details on the 
process for conducting the 2023 
Committee effectiveness review. 

With respect to climate matters, the 
Committee received input from the Board 
Sustainability Committee on our external 
climate and sustainability narrative 
disclosures. Best practice and regulation 
regarding climate and sustainability 
reporting and related assurance are still 
evolving, while investor and other 
stakeholder appetite for information 
continues to grow, and this is an area to 
which the Committee will continue to have 
close regard. Barclays’ climate strategy 
remains a key focus of the Group and the 
Committee continues to monitor that the 
impact of climate change has been 
addressed in preparing the Group’s 
financial statements. 

The independent assurance and challenge 
provided by both Barclays Internal Audit 
(BIA) and KPMG as statutory auditor are 
critical to the Committee’s oversight role 
in relation to internal controls and financial 
reporting. For this reason, the Committee 
continues to hold regular separate private 
sessions with each of the Group Chief 
Internal Auditor and the lead KPMG audit 
engagement partner without 
management present.

The Committee has oversight of Barclays’ 
whistleblowing programme and I took over 
the role of Group Whistleblowers' 
Champion upon my appointment as 
Committee Chair. During 2023, I met with 
the FCA and also held regular meetings 
with the Whistleblowing team to 
understand their key areas of focus and 
the Committee continues to receive 
detailed semi-annual whistleblowing 
updates. 

Throughout the year I also held regular 
meetings with a number of other 
colleagues and stakeholders to discuss 
any material and emerging key issues 
impacting the Group (including its key 
subsidiaries) and of relevance to the 
Committee. This included regular 
meetings with the Chair of the BBUKPLC 
Board Audit Committee, the Group 
Finance Director, Group Chief Internal 
Auditor and lead KPMG audit partner. As 
Committee Chair, throughout the year I 
also engaged regularly with the Group’s 
key regulators, including meeting with 
representatives of the PRA, FCA and 
FRBNY.

Committee composition and 
meetings

The Committee is composed solely of 
independent Non-Executive Directors. 
Membership of the Committee is designed 
to provide the breadth of financial expertise 
and commercial acumen that the 
Committee needs to fulfil its responsibilities. 
Its members as a whole have recent and 
relevant experience of the banking and 
financial services sector, in addition to 
general management and commercial 
experience; and are financially literate. Julia 
Wilson, the Committee Chair, and who is the 
designated financial expert on the 
Committee for the purposes of SOx, has 
significant corporate finance, tax and 
accounting experience including serving as 
the Group Finance Director of 3i plc from 
2008 to 2022 and as Chair of the board audit 
committee at Legal & General Group plc. 

In 2023, the Committee met 12 times, with 
no ad hoc meetings held during the year 
(2022: 14 times, including four ad hoc 
meetings). Attendance by members at 
Committee meetings is shown on page 166. 

Primary activities  

Committee meetings were attended by 
representatives from management, 
including the Group Chief Executive, 
Group Finance Director, Group Chief 
Internal Auditor, Group Chief Controls 
Officer, Group Chief Risk Officer, Group 
Chief Operating Officer, Group General 
Counsel and Group Chief Compliance 
Officer, as well as representatives from the 
businesses and other functions, and from 
BBPLC senior management reflecting the 
partially consolidated operation of the 
BPLC and BBPLC Committee meetings. 
The lead audit engagement partner of 
KPMG also attended Committee 
meetings. 

The Board, together with the Committee, 
is responsible for ensuring the 
independence and effectiveness of the 
internal audit function and external 
auditors. The appointment and removal of 
the Group Chief Internal Auditor is a 
matter reserved to the Committee, and 
the appointment and removal of the 
external auditor is a matter reserved to the 
Board based on the recommendation of 
the Committee. Neither task is delegated 
to management.

Role of the Committee

The role of the Committee is to 
review and monitor, among other 
things:

• the integrity of the Group’s financial 

statements and related 
announcements

• the effectiveness of the Group’s 

internal controls

• the independence and 

effectiveness of the internal and 
external audit processes

• the Group’s relationship with the 

external auditor

• the effectiveness of the Group’s 

whistleblowing procedures.

The Committee’s terms of reference 
are available at home.barclays/who-
we-are/our-governance/board-
committees/ 

The Committee discharged its responsibilities in 2023 through monitoring the effectiveness of the internal control environment and 
internal and external audit processes, as well as the integrity of financial statements and related announcements having regard to the 
current macroeconomic environment.

Financial reporting
Fair, balanced and 
understandable 
reporting

(including Country- by-
Country Reporting and 
Modern Slavery 
Statement)

In light of the Board’s obligation under the 
Code, the Committee assesses external 
reporting to ensure it is fair, balanced and 
understandable.

In addition to this Annual Report and associated year-end reports, the 
Committee also reviewed the Group’s half-year and quarterly results 
announcements and the presentations to analysts. The Committee informed 
these reviews through: 

• consideration of reports of the Group Disclosure Committee

• direct questioning of management on the transparency and accuracy of 

disclosures

• consideration of the results of management’s processes relating to financial 

reporting matters, including the output of the Group’s internal control 
assessments and the SOx s404 internal control processes.

The Committee closely considered the Group's financial disclosures and 
provided feedback, including on areas where disclosures could be enhanced. 

Recognising the increasing focus on, and prominence of, ESG reporting, the 
Committee considered the governance and assurance framework for such 
disclosures. The Committee emphasised the importance of management 
continuing to review and enhance the processes and controls around the 
disclosures (particularly in relation to the underlying data) as the disclosure 
framework and expected use of the information evolves. 

Having evaluated all of the available information, the assurances by 
management and underlying processes used to prepare the published financial 
information, the Committee concluded and recommended to the Board that 
the 2023 Annual Report and Accounts are fair, balanced and understandable.

Barclays makes certain assumptions and 
estimates, analysis of which underpins 
provisions made for the costs of customer 
redress. The Committee analyses the 
judgements and estimates made by 
management to evaluate the adequacy of 
the provisions, including with regards to 
Barclays' provisioning for legacy conduct 
issues.

The Committee monitors management's 
judgements in relation to expected credit 
losses (ECLs), which are modelled using a 
range of forecast economic scenarios. They 
use forward-looking models which require 
judgements to be made over modelling 
assumptions, including: 

•

•

•

•

the determination of macroeconomic 
scenarios to be used

the methodology for weighting of 
scenarios 

the criteria used to determine significant 
deterioration in credit quality 

the application of management 
adjustments to the ECL modelled output.

The Committee considers management's 
judgement in relation to goodwill and 
intangibles. The carrying value of goodwill 
and intangible assets is assessed on the 
basis of discounted forecast future earnings. 
Given the significant component of earnings 
attributable to net interest income, such 
forecasts are particularly sensitive to the 
level of long-term interest rates and 
assumed levels of future lending. The period 
over which intangible assets are amortised 
appropriately reflects the useful economic 
life.

Barclays is engaged in various legal, 
competition and regulatory matters which 
may give rise to provisioning based on the 
facts.

The level of provisioning is subject to 
management judgement on the basis of 
legal advice and is, therefore, an area of 
focus for the Committee.

Barclays exercises judgement in the 
valuation and disclosure of financial 
instruments, derivative assets and certain 
portfolios, particularly where quoted market 
prices are not available.

The Committee is responsible for 
considering the Group's tax strategy and 
overseeing compliance with the Group's Tax 
Principles. Barclays is subject to taxation in a 
number of jurisdictions globally and makes 
judgements with regard to provisioning for 
tax at risk and to the recognition and 
measurement of deferred tax assets.

The Committee reviewed and challenged management’s approach to conduct 
provisions throughout the year and was satisfied that management's 
judgement and approach resulted in an adequate and appropriate level of 
provision in relation to the various conduct matters.

As part of its monitoring, the Committee considered regular reports from 
management on:

•

the impact of the macroeconomic environment, including high interest 
rates, inflationary pressures and unemployment levels

• model changes and model validation, and the impact of this on the use of 

post-model adjustments

•

the refresh of macroeconomic variables and associated weighting.

The Committee closely considered management’s judgement on impairment 
coverage levels, including the impact of increasing delinquency levels in certain 
areas of the portfolio.

Having considered and scrutinised the reports, the Committee agreed with 
management’s conclusion that the impairment provision was appropriate.

The Committee considered management's reports on its assessment of the 
Group's goodwill balances and intangibles to identify any indicators of 
impairment, including the methodology and controls applied to the process. 

The Committee was satisfied with management's determination on the 
indicators of impairment and quantum of the impairment amount identified.

The Committee received regular reports on the status of current legal, 
competition and regulatory matters and considered the impact of those 
matters on the Group’s provision levels. It also oversaw enhancements in the 
reporting to the Committee on these matters. It considered management’s 
judgements on the level of provision to be taken and accompanying 
disclosures and agreed that the level of provision at the year end was 
appropriate. 

The Committee also reviewed the disclosures made in respect of legal, 
competition and regulatory matters, and concluded that they provided 
appropriate information for investors.

The Committee scrutinised management's approach to valuations, including in 
respect of pensions and the leveraged finance portfolio.

The Committee was satisfied with the accounting treatment in respect of the 
various matters.

The Committee:

•

•

received reports from the Global Head of Tax, including updates on the work 
of the Tax Management Oversight Committee

reviewed the appropriateness of provisions made for uncertain tax 
positions and management’s approach to the tax treatment of index-linked 
gilts and its impact on the Group’s effective tax rate

• considered the impact of the UK Government’s implementation of the 

OECD’s global minimum tax rules

• monitored the Group’s interactions with tax authorities and the material tax 

risks for the Group.

The Committee approved the UK Tax Strategy statement published in the 
Country Snapshot report and recommended the Country Snapshot to the 
Board for approval.

Conclusion/action taken

Going concern and viability 
Going concern 
and long-term 
viability

Barclays is required to assess whether it is 
appropriate to prepare the financial 
statements on a going concern basis. In 
accordance with the Code, Barclays must 
provide a statement of its viability. To 
support this, the Committee considers both 
the going concern assumption and the form 
and content of the Viability Statement.

The Committee considered both the going concern assumption and the form 
and content of the Viability Statement taking into account: 

•

•

•

the MTP and Working Capital Report

the forecast capital, liquidity and funding profiles

the results of stress tests based on internal and regulatory assumptions.

The Committee recommended to the Board that the financial statements 
should be prepared on a going concern basis and that there were no material 
uncertainties that would impact the going concern statement which required 
disclosure. 

The Committee recommended the Viability Statement to the Board for 
approval.

The Committee assesses the distributable 
reserves position in considering 
management’s proposals for distributions 
(dividends and share buy-backs) for the full 
year ended 31 December 2022 and for the 
half year ended 30 June 2023.

Having regard to the distributable reserves available to the Company, the 
Committee reviewed and reported to the Board on proposals for (i) a dividend 
for the financial year ended 31 December 2022 of 5.0p per share along with a 
share buy-back of up to £500m; and (ii) a dividend for the half year ended 
30 June 2023 of 2.7p per share along with a share buy-back of up to £750m.

In early 2024, the Committee reviewed and reported to the Board on the 
distributable reserves position for the full year dividend for the year ended 
31 December 2023 along with a proposed share buy-back.

The Committee considers the effectiveness 
of the overall control environment, including 
the status of any significant control issues 
and the progress of specific remediation 
plans.

The Committee:

• considered feedback received from regulatory stakeholders on the Group’s 

internal control environment and management’s response

• evaluated and tracked the status of the more significant control matters 

through regular reports from the Group Chief Controls Officer

• discussed reports from heads of key businesses (including Barclays UK and 
BBPLC) on their control environment, together with views from the second 
and third lines of defence.

The Committee received regular deep dive reports on the more material 
remediation programmes across the Group, keeping a close eye on 
management’s progress and delivery against key milestones, including 
through to closure of a programme and validation by BIA. The Committee 
challenged management’s approach to measuring progress and emphasised 
the importance of qualitative factors such as the embedment and 
sustainability of programmes. 

The Committee considers the adequacy of 
the Group’s arrangements to allow 
colleagues to raise concerns in confidence 
and anonymously without fear of retaliation, 
and the outcomes of any substantiated 
case.

The Committee received detailed semi-annual reports on whistleblowing from 
management. It monitored key whistleblowing metrics, the 'speak up' culture 
across the Group (and key metrics underpinning this) and any potential 
whistleblowing trends which might emerge.

The Committee also monitored the implementation of enhancements to the 
whistleblowing process following the external benchmarking review conducted 
in 2022.

Through regular reports from BIA, the Committee:

•

•

•

•

reviewed and agreed internal audit plans, methodology and deliverables for 
2023, including consideration of how regulatory priorities and required 
regulatory coverage has been reflected in the plan

reviewed BIA's audit reports in relation to specific audits, key areas of focus 
and themes 

tracked the levels of adverse audits and issues raised by BIA and monitored 
related remediation plans

received regular updates on BIA colleague matters, including colleague 
engagement and resourcing 

• discussed BIA's assessment of the control environment and management 

control approach in Group companies and functions. 

The Committee noted the independence of the BIA function, and through 
reviewing BIA's quality assurance updates was pleased to see the reports 
demonstrating the independence of BIA’s quality assurance function. 

The Committee considered and was comfortable with the approach by BIA to 
embed the UK Consumer Duty into the BIA framework.

The Committee conducted a performance assessment of BIA for 2023 and 
concluded it was satisfied with BIA's performance against its objectives agreed 
with the Committee Chair at the beginning of the year.

At the end of the year, the Committee approved the 2024 audit plan, detailing 
the number of audits to be undertaken and the focus areas. It also approved 
BIA's Audit Charter following the annual review.

The Committee:

• met with key members of the KPMG audit team to discuss the 2023 audit 

plan and KPMG’s areas of focus

• approved the 2023 audit plan and the main areas of focus for the year

• assessed regular reports from KPMG on the progress of the 2023 audit and 

any material accounting and control issues identified

• discussed KPMG’s draft reports on control areas of focus and the control 

environment ahead of the 2023 year end

• approved the terms of the audit engagement letter and associated fees for 

2023, on behalf of the Board.

The Committee sought KPMG's views on a number of specific matters, 
including management's approach to critical accounting judgements and 
estimates, and sought to understand where KPMG had challenged 
management's assessment prior to reaching a conclusion. This included 
considering KPMG challenge in relation to key controls matters and the 
approach to disclosures in the Group's full year, half-year and interim financial 
results. 

The Committee considered KPMG’s response to the PRA Written Auditor 
Reporting for 2022, and discussed with KPMG the questions in scope for the 
2023 Written Auditor Reporting.

External auditor

Following an external audit tender in 2015, KPMG was appointed as Barclays’ statutory auditor with effect from the 2017 financial year. 
Stuart Crisp, Barclays’ lead audit engagement partner, has been in the role since 2022 and attends all meetings of the Committee.
Assessing external auditor effectiveness, objectivity and independence and non-audit services

The Committee is responsible for assessing the effectiveness, objectivity and independence of the Group’s statutory auditor. This 
responsibility was discharged by the Committee throughout the year at formal meetings, during private meetings with KPMG and 
through discussions with key Group executives. In particular, the Committee assessed KPMG’s effectiveness, objectivity and 
independence in the following ways:

Throughout the year

• Met with senior members of the KPMG audit team from 

the UK, Ireland and US to discuss the approach to the 2023 
audit.

• Reviewed regular reports from management on the non-

audit services provided by KPMG to Barclays.

• Reviewed regular reports from management detailing any 

employees or workers hired from KPMG.

• Discussed with KPMG their consideration of internal 

controls over financial reporting.

• Considered areas in which KPMG had challenged 

management’s assumptions in areas of key judgement.

• Assessed any potential threats to independence that were 
self-identified and reported by KPMG, all of which were 
regarded by the Committee as being adequately 
addressed.

Annual assessment, audit quality 
and external findings

• The Group undertakes an annual formal assessment of 

KPMG’s performance, independence and objectivity. The 
assessment for 2023 was conducted in early 2024, by way 
of a questionnaire completed by key stakeholders across 
the Group who have regular interaction with KPMG. The 
questionnaire was designed to evaluate KPMG’s audit 
process, its effectiveness and overall output.

• Consistent with previous years, in 2023 KPMG nominated 

a senior partner of the audit team to have specific 
responsibility for ensuring audit quality. The Committee 
received reports from him during the year on his 
assessment of audit quality.

• The findings of the FRC’s Audit Quality Report on KPMG 
published in July 2023, including its inspection of the 
Barclays audit for the year ended 31 December 2021, 
provided further comfort to the Committee on the quality 
and effectiveness of KPMG’s audit, acknowledging that 
there remains areas for improvement.

Outcome

Taking into account the result of all of the above, the Committee considered that KPMG maintained its independence and 
objectivity, exercised robust challenge and demonstrated professional scepticism in the audit process. The Committee was 
therefore satisfied that the audit process was effective.

Non-audit services

In order to safeguard the auditor’s 
independence and objectivity, Barclays has 
in place the Group Policy on the Provision 
of Services by the Group Statutory Auditor 
(the Policy) setting out the circumstances 
in which the auditor may be engaged to 
provide non-audit services. The Policy 
applies to all Barclays subsidiaries and 
other material entities over which Barclays 
has significant influence. The core principle 
of the Policy is that non-audit services 
(other than those legally required to be 
carried out by the Group’s auditor) should 
be performed by the auditor only in certain 
controlled circumstances. A summary of 
the Policy can be found at home.barclays/
who-we-are/our-governance/auditor-
independence/

The Policy sets out the type of services 
that the auditor is permitted to carry out 
and pre-approves certain of these services 
provided the fee is below a certain 
threshold, except for specific categories of 
permitted services that require explicit 

Committee approval. All other permitted 
services must be approved in advance by 
the Committee. The Policy requires that all 
proposed work must be sponsored by a 
senior executive who is not involved in any 
work to which the proposed engagement 
relates. The audit assignment partner 
must also confirm that the engagement 
has been approved in accordance with the 
auditor’s own internal ethical standards 
and does not pose any threat to the 
auditor’s independence or objectivity. 

The Policy is reviewed by the Committee 
on an annual basis to ensure that it is fit for 
purpose and that it reflects applicable rules 
and guidelines. The Policy is aligned with 
both the FRC’s requirements and KPMG’s 
own internal policy on non-audit services 
for FTSE 350 companies, which broadly 
restricts non-audit work to services that 
are ‘closely related’ to the audit. 

In early 2023, KPMG advised the 
Committee that, following on from an 
event notified to the Committee in late 
2022, a further instance had been 

identified of a KPMG member firm having 
provided services in connection with the 
preparation of local statutory accounts of 
a small overseas subsidiary not in scope for 
the Group audit. KPMG assured the 
Committee, having made appropriate 
enquiries of their member firms providing 
services to the Group, that these were 
isolated instances. In these circumstances, 
the Committee agreed with KPMG’s 
assessment that this had not impaired 
their integrity or objectivity. 

In view of the events notified by KPMG, the 
Committee reviewed the Policy in early 
2023 to determine whether any revisions 
were required to ensure such events did 
not arise again. While it was determined 
that the Policy provided sufficiently clear 
guidance in terms of prohibited non-audit 
service work, certain enhancements were 
made to the Policy to further support the 
operation of the Policy including by 
specifying examples of the type of work 
prohibited under each headline service.

The Statutory Audit Services for Large Companies Market 
Investigation (Mandatory Use of Competitive Tender Processes 
and Audit Committee Responsibilities) Order 2014

An external audit tender was conducted in 2015 and the decision was made to 
appoint KPMG as Barclays’ external auditor with effect from the 2017 financial year. 

Barclays is in compliance with the requirements of The Statutory Audit Services for 
Large Companies Market Investigation (Mandatory Use of Competitive Tender 
Processes and Audit Committee Responsibilities) Order 2014, which relates to the 
frequency and governance of tenders for the appointment of the external auditor 
and the setting of a policy on the provision of non-audit services. 

As explained in previous Committee reports, provided that KPMG continues to 
maintain its independence and objectivity, and the Committee remains satisfied 
with its performance, the Board does not intend to tender for an alternative external 
auditor to be appointed before the end of the current required period of 10 years. 
Accordingly, any tender is expected to be in respect of the 2027 financial year 
onwards and is likely to take place in 2025. The Committee has reconfirmed that it 
would not be appropriate to tender before this date. The Committee observed that 
there has been significant rotation of the senior members of the audit team since 
2017 and more recent changes in certain members of the Barclays senior finance 
team, both of which have reduced any potential familiarisation threat.

The fees payable to KPMG for the year 
ended 31 December 2023 amounted to 
£78m (2022: £71m), of which £14m (2022: 
£13m) was payable in respect of non-audit 
services. A breakdown of the fees payable 
to the auditor for statutory audit and non-
audit work can be found in Note 39 of the 
financial statements. Of the £14m of non-
audit services provided by KPMG during 
2023, the significant categories of 
engagement, i.e. services where the fees 
amounted to more than £500,000, 
included: 

• audit-related services: services in 

connection with CASS (Client Assets 
Sourcebook) audits

• other services in connection with 

regulatory, compliance and internal 
control reports and specific audit 
procedures, required by law or 
regulation to be provided by the 
statutory auditor

• other attestation and assurance 

services, such as ongoing attestation 
and assurance services for treasury 
and capital markets transactions to 
meet regulatory requirements, including 
regular reporting obligations and 
verification reports.

Providing considered risk oversight 
through challenging times

Proactive risk management in a dynamic risk environment.

Dear Fellow Shareholders 

During 2023, the Committee focused on 
the financial and operational challenges 
arising from ongoing macroeconomic 
uncertainty and geopolitical tensions, 
overseeing management’s proactive 
approach to positioning the Group 
appropriately for the uncertain 
environment.

The macroeconomic outlook was defined 
by central bank efforts to contain inflation 
through higher interest rates, balanced 
against the desire to protect economic 
growth and employment. As the year 
came to a close, market participants 
remained focused on the expected turn of 
the rates cycle and the implications for 
asset prices and the credit cycle. The 
Committee remained watchful of these 
events and other risks, such as the 
potential for disorderly market corrections 
and economic slowdowns across the 
globe; alongside wider geopolitical 
tensions and their impact on Barclays’ 
portfolios and businesses. Throughout the 
year the Committee heard from and 
challenged senior business leaders, in 
addition to second line risk and compliance 
colleagues, about how they consider and 
manage risks as they execute their 
business strategies, including any 
mitigating actions being taken. 

2023 was undoubtedly a challenging year 
for the banking sector with significant 
market volatility, particularly in the first half 
of the year, coupled with the collapse of a 
number of US regional banks and the 
takeover of a distressed global bank. In 
addition to overseeing Barclays’ 
management of its liquidity and capital 
positions, the Committee reviewed 
management’s learnings from these 
events to help ensure that Barclays 
remains resilient through periods of stress.

commitments and ad hoc meetings being called at 
short notice, Mohamed A. El-Erian was unable to 
Notes
attend two scheduled meetings, Diane Schueneman 
was unable to attend one scheduled meeting and 
one ad hoc meeting and Brian Gilvary was unable to 
attend one ad hoc meeting. 

Alongside financial risks, the Committee 
oversaw management’s work to drive 
robust operational risk management 
across Barclays; in this regard, the 
Committee considered the risks of cyber-
related attacks and their potential impact 
on customers and clients, and heard from 
management about ongoing work to 
strengthen the bank’s cybersecurity 
defences. In addition, the Committee 
monitored work in Barclays UK designed to 
reduce risk by improving the control 
environment and drive efficiencies. 

The Committee tracked Barclays' progress 
towards ensuring it can recover its most 
important business services in the event of 
material service disruption within tolerance 
by the regulatory deadline of March 2025.

Financial crime risk across the financial

recognition of the growing risks, the 
Committee closely monitored 
management’s work to identify and 
mitigate financial crime risk across the 
Group, in line with increased regulatory 
expectations. 

Conduct risk remains a key area of 
oversight. The Committee oversaw 
management’s preparations for the 
implementation of the Financial Conduct 
Authority’s (FCA) ‘Consumer Duty' in July 
2023, and continues to monitor 
management's efforts to ensure good 
outcomes for retail customers. 

During the year, the Committee reviewed 
changes to the Group’s Enterprise Risk 
Management Framework (ERMF), to 
underpin work to strengthen how the 
Group manages the risks of non-
compliance with laws, rules and regulations 
(LRR). As part of this a new LRR risk was 
established alongside conduct risk under a 
new Principal Risk called Compliance risk.

Directors’ report: Board Risk Committee report (continued)

Looking ahead 

The Committee actively encourages 
management to be alert to areas of 
emerging risk, particularly in light of the 
rapidly evolving macroeconomic, 
geopolitical and technological 
environments. As we move into 2024, 
geopolitical tensions, macroeconomic 
uncertainty and inflationary pressures are 
expected to continue, with further 
uncertainty on the horizon in light of the 
upcoming election cycles in many of our 
key markets, including the US and UK. The 
Committee will continue to work with 
management to anticipate, stress test and 
prepare for periods of volatility to prevent 
outsized or unexpected losses 
materialising and to manage emerging 
risks as they arise. 

Robert Berry

Chair, Board Risk Committee

19 February 2024

The Committee continued to oversee how 
climate change is driving financial and 
operational risks, the materiality of their 
impact and how Barclays is managing them 
through the Climate Principal Risk 
Framework. The Committee received 
updates on the Bank’s ongoing 
advancements to its climate risk 
management approach, including the 
development of a risk appetite, monitored 
through a range of quantitative metrics. 
The Committee also heard from senior 
business leaders about how climate risks 
are being integrated into their business 
strategies and plans.

The Committee approved the results of 
the 2023 internal climate stress test (CST) 
and considered lessons learned that will 
enable Barclays to better assess specific 
climate vulnerabilities as well as the impact 
that climate factors can have on the 
financial stresses used to calibrate overall 
risk appetite. The Committee will continue 
to maintain close oversight of the annual 
CST as it is further integrated into the 
Group’s planning and stress testing 
framework. 

As part of its work overseeing climate risk, 
the Committee worked closely with the 
Board Audit Committee and Board 
Sustainability Committee, ensuring a 
streamlined view of matters of relevance 
across the Committees. 

The Group uses models and data to 
support a broad range of business 
decisions and risk management activities 
across the Group. This is an area impacted 
by rapid technological change and 
increasing regulatory scrutiny and the 
Committee continued to focus on the 
Bank’s approach to managing the 
associated risks, including its approach to 
developing and validating models, and 
monitoring of their performance through a 
volatile macro environment.

The volume of regulatory change across 
the global financial services industry is 
significant. The Committee heard from 
management about the impact of these 
changes for Barclays and the work 
necessary to ensure compliance. This is an 
area to which the Committee expects to 
devote attention in 2024 and beyond. 

By way of a final word, in 2023, the 
Committee oversaw a change to the 
senior management of the Compliance 
function, with the appointment of a new 
Group Chief Compliance Officer, Kirsty 
Everett, who took up the role in July 2023. 
In 2023 we also welcomed both Marc 
Moses and Sir John Kingman (Chair of 
Barclays UK) to the Committee, both of 
whom bring with them a deep knowledge 
of financial services.
Committee effectiveness 

The results of the Committee 
effectiveness review for 2023 confirm the 
Committee is operating effectively; it is 
considered well constituted and chaired, 
providing an effective and appropriate level 
of challenge and oversight of the areas 
within its remit. Feedback noted members’ 
wide and diverse skills and experience, 
recognising that recent additions to 
Committee composition had been positive 
in providing the Committee with a deeper 
retail perspective. Feedback indicates that 
the Committee is considered to operate at 
the right level of debate. It also confirms 
that the allocation of time between agenda 
items in meetings is appropriate, with 
sufficient time for discussion and 
challenge. 

The Committee’s interaction with the 
Board, Board Committees and senior 
management is also considered effective, 
noting that sufficient time is allocated at 
Board meetings for the Chair to report to 
the Board on the work of the Committee. 
Feedback indicated that concurrent 
meetings of the BPLC and BBPLC Board 
Risk Committee continue to be effective, 
with coverage of BBPLC matters within 
concurrent meetings considered 
appropriate. 

Interaction with the BBUKPLC Board Risk 
Committee was also considered effective, 
confirming that the Committee continues 
to exercise appropriate oversight of issues 
relevant to the Committee’s remit relating 
to BBUKPLC.

Nominations Committee for further details 
on the process for conducting the 2023 
Committee effectiveness review.

Directors’ report: Board Sustainability Committee report

Driving forward our net zero ambition

Overseeing our climate and sustainability strategy.

Dear Fellow Shareholders

I am delighted to present to you the first 
report of the Board Sustainability 
Committee. 

In March 2020, Barclays announced its 
ambition to be a net zero bank by 2050, 
becoming one of the first banks to do so. In 
2023, we continued to pursue 
opportunities and support our clients as 
they transition their businesses to a low-
carbon economy. 

When I wrote to you ahead of our 2023 
AGM, I highlighted that a key commitment 
for Barclays over the subsequent 12 
months was to help finance this transition 
and in December 2022 we announced a 
new target to facilitate $1trn of Sustainable 
and Transition Financing between 2023 
and 2030, and increased our investment 
mandate to £500m of capital to invest in 
early-stage climate-tech companies by the 
end of 2027. Today we are reporting 
$67.8bn financing facilitated towards the 
$1trn Sustainable and Transition Financing 
target and £138m invested since March 
2020 in 21 climate-tech companies. 

A second key priority was to assess 
baseline emissions for the four remaining 
high-emitting sectors in our portfolio, as 
well as developing a high-level modelled 
assessment of our overall balance sheet, 
consistent with the approach outlined by 
the Partnership for Carbon Accounting 
Financials (PCAF). We have announced 
new targets for Aviation, Commercial Real 
Estate and Agriculture, and published our 
first high-level modelled assessment under 
PCAF. We have also published our updated 
Climate Change Statement which includes 
new restrictions on oil and gas financing. In 
particular, we will stop directly financing 
new oil and gas projects, and have set clear 
expectations for our energy clients to 
produce transition or decarbonisation 
plans and set near-term targets to reduce 
emissions.

The final key priority was to refine our 
Client Transition Framework so as to 
improve our ability to work with clients in 
high-emitting sectors on their individual 
transition plans. This will allow us to 
measure and monitor our clients’ 
decarbonisation progress and assess the 
implications for our targets, and to offer 
more tailored support to clients’ transition 
requirements.

Having cross-membership on the 
Committee with the Chairs of our Board 
Audit, Remuneration and Risk Committees, 
as well as connectivity with the BBUKPLC 
Board, helps to ensure a streamlined 
approach to Board-level oversight of all 
climate and sustainability related matters.
Committee effectiveness

The results of the Committee 
effectiveness review for 2023 confirm the 
Committee is operating effectively. It is 
considered well constituted and chaired, 
providing high-quality oversight and 
constructive challenge to management in 
the areas within its remit. The review 
highlights that the Committee is 
considered to have the right level of skills 
and experience, including climate/
sustainability expertise, and is of an 
appropriate size. The review noted the 
benefits of having cross-membership 
between the Committee and the Board Risk 
Committee and the Board Audit 
Committee, and having the Group Chief 
Executive as a member of the Committee 
in the context of the development of 
Barclays’ climate strategy as well as the 
skills and experience he brings to the 
Committee.

Note

1 There were four scheduled Committee meetings 
held in 2023. Owing to prior commitments, Brian 
Gilvary was unable to attend two meetings and Dawn 
Fitzpatrick was unable to attend one meeting.

The Board has direct oversight of and 
responsibility for the Group’s climate and 
sustainability strategy. However, given the 
importance of this work and the growing 
importance of other sustainability areas, 
including nature and biodiversity, in March 
2023 the Board approved the 
establishment of a new Board 
Sustainability Committee to support and 
advise the Board in its oversight of climate 
and sustainability matters.

The Committee receives presentations 
into the challenges and opportunities in 
this area (including external input on 
specific areas of focus), undertakes 
detailed reviews and discussions and 
makes recommendations to the Board on 
key topics. The table on page 182 provides 
an overview of the Committee’s work in 
2023 supporting the Board in overseeing 
the activities to meet our climate priorities. 

In addition to myself, the members of the 
Committee are Robert Berry, Dawn 
Fitzpatrick, Mary Francis, Brian Gilvary, C.S. 
Venkatakrishnan and Julia Wilson. Tracy 
Corrigan also attends Committee 
meetings as a non-executive 
representative of the BBUKPLC Board.

As an Executive member of the Committee, our Group Chief Executive brings 
invaluable climate and sustainability insight to the Committee’s discussions, 
including the views of key external stakeholders. He is also a member of the UNEP 
FI Leadership Council and a member of the CNBC ESG Council, and through those 
roles he is able to bring external perspectives of key climate/sustainability matters 
to the Committee’s discussions.

Directors’ report: Board Sustainability Committee report (continued)

Feedback indicates that the Committee is 
considered to operate at the right level of 
debate, and that the allocation of time 
between agenda items in Committee 
meetings is appropriate, with sufficient time 
for discussion and challenge, and focus on 
the right matters. 

The review concluded that the 
Committee’s interaction with the Board, 
Board Committees and senior 
management is considered effective, 
noting that sufficient time is allocated at 
Board meetings for the Chair to report to 
the Board on the work of the Committee 
and to provide feedback on key 
sustainability policy matters in support of 
the Board’s continued oversight. Feedback 
indicated that concurrent meetings of the 
BPLC and BBPLC Board Sustainability 
Committee are effective, with coverage of 
BBPLC matters within concurrent 
meetings considered appropriate. The 
addition of a representative to the 
Committee from the BBUKPLC Board at 

the beginning of 2024 was considered to 
support ongoing BBUKPLC Board 
engagement in respect of sustainability 
matters impacting the Group.

Please see the report of the Board 
Nominations Committee for further details 
on the process for conducting the 2023 
Committee effectiveness review.
Looking ahead

Looking ahead to 2024, a key focus for the 
Committee will be oversight of 
management’s development of Barclays' 
transition plan, informed by the work of the 
UK's Transition Plan Taskforce, in 
conjunction with ongoing work to 
implement the Group’s climate strategy by 
supporting clients with their transition 
plans. 

A critical component of the work 
undertaken to addressing the climate 
challenge is the approach by governments 
with respect to climate and sustainability 
policy and financing. The importance of 

having clear requirements for the 
transition, and clarity and consistency in 
respect of government policy and 
financing, are key in supporting all those 
committed to transitioning to a low carbon 
economy. This is an area to which the 
Committee will have close regard this year. 

Finally, as indicated above, nature and 
biodiversity are areas of growing 
importance on the sustainability agenda. 
The Committee is looking forward to 
building on the work done in 2023 and the 
external briefing it received on this subject 
by having a greater focus on the impact of 
these areas, including how they can be 
reflected in Barclays’ own ambition to be a 
net zero bank.

by representatives from management, 
including the Group Head of Public Policy 
and Corporate Responsibility, the Group 
Head of Sustainability, the Global Head of 
Sustainable Finance and the Head of Legal, 
Public Policy and Corporate Responsibility. 

Role of the Committee

The role of the Committee is to provide oversight of climate matters and the 
sustainability agenda, and in particular to:

• support and advise the Board on its oversight of climate and sustainability matters 

relating to (i) the services and products provided to Barclays’ clients and 
customers, (ii) particular sectors, and (iii) its own corporate activities

sustainability strategy

• review and make recommendations to the Board on the suitability of the Group’s 
climate and sustainability strategy, position statements, frameworks, ambitions, 
metrics, and targets

• report to the Board on the climate and sustainability matters for which it is 

responsible, escalating issues and making recommendations to the Board where 
appropriate.

The Committee’s terms of reference are available at home.barclays/who-we-are/
our-governance/board-committees/ 

Primary activities

During 2023, the Committee received updates from management in relation to the Group’s climate and sustainability strategy, as well 
as internal and external briefings and reports on climate and sustainability matters. Set out below are the key areas of focus for the 
Committee's work in 2023.
Areas of focus

Conclusion/action taken

Climate and sustainability 
strategy

Target setting and progress 
against targets

The Committee:

• Considered management's sustainable finance strategy proposals, which focused on the actions required to 
accelerate support for our clients as they transition and for the Group to achieve its sustainable financing 
target and ambition to be a net zero bank. 

• Considered areas where the Group could focus, providing the greatest opportunity to support global 
endeavours to transition to a low carbon economy and help the Group achieve its strategic ambitions.

• Reviewed proposals for the Group’s updated oil and gas policy and endorsed new restrictions on oil and gas 

financing. 

The Committee:

• Considered management’s proposals for new targets and endorsed new targets for three additional sectors 

– Aviation, Agriculture and Commercial Real Estate. 

• Monitored the Group’s progress against its climate and sustainability targets. As part of this, the Committee 
received updates on progress towards the target to facilitate $1trn of Sustainable and Transition Financing 
by the end of 2030, and considered initiatives that were underway to provide further capability to achieve the 
target.

You can read more about Barclays’ sector targets and 
progress against them in the Strategic report on page 89.

Investor feedback

Client Transition Framework 
(CTF)

The Committee considered investor feedback and the perspectives of both our institutional investors as well 
as our retail shareholder base. During the year, members of the Committee engaged with institutional investors 
on climate-related matters, helping inform the development of our climate strategy. 

The Committee received updates on the Group’s work on the CTF, including management’s approach to 
working with clients going through CTF assessments, expected outcomes following the assessments and 
proposed expansion of the application of the framework following further targets set by the Group.

You can read more about the CTF in the Strategic report 

on page 90.

Directors’ report: How we comply

Reporting against the Code's principles 
and provisions

As Barclays PLC is listed on the London Stock Exchange, the principles and provisions of the Code apply, a copy of which can be found 
at frc.org.uk 

For the year ended 31 December 2023, and as at the date of this report, we are pleased to confirm that Barclays PLC has complied in 
full with the requirements of the Code. This section and our Board Governance report sets out how we complied with the Code in 2023. 

By virtue of the information included in the Annual Report, we comply with the corporate governance statement requirements of the 
FCA’s Disclosure and Transparency Rules (DTRs). The information required to be disclosed pursuant to DTR 7.2.6 is located on pages 
185 to 190. Information in relation to the Board Diversity and Inclusion Policy, as required to be disclosed pursuant to DTR 7.2.8A, can 
be found on pages 158 to 160.

Barclays is permitted by NYSE rules to follow UK corporate governance practices instead of those applied in the US. Any significant 
variations must be explained in Barclays' Form 20-F filing, found at the Securities and Exchange Commission’s EDGAR database or on 
our website, home.barclays 

The way in which Barclays has applied the principles and provisions of the Code during 2023 is summarised below and on the next page.

Board Leadership 
and Company Purpose

Division of 
Responsibility

Composition, Succession 
and Evaluation

Our Board governance is designed to 
deliver an effective and entrepreneurial 
Board, which discharges its role effectively 
and efficiently. Details can be found on 
pages 150 to 152, including our Group-wide 
governance framework and the Board's 
responsibilities. Key Board activities for 
2023 are set out on pages 153 to 155. 
The Board is fully supportive of The Barclays 
Way, which sets out our Purpose, Values 
and Mindset, and is our Code of Conduct, 
providing a path for achieving a dynamic and 
positive culture in the Group. Refer to page 
245 for further detail. 

Our Group Whistleblowing Standard 
enables colleagues to raise any matters of 
concern anonymously and is embedded 
into our business. Further information can 
be found on page 246. 

Throughout 2023, we engaged with our 
stakeholders through a variety of means. 
Refer to page 23 of the Strategic report for 
further detail about how Barclays engages 
with our stakeholders. You can read about 
how the Board engages with stakeholders in 
our Section 172(1) statement in the 
Strategic report from page 38 and 
examples of the Board's engagement with 
colleagues during 2023 can be found on 
page 153.

The majority of the Board comprises 
independent Non-Executive Directors. 
The Group Chairman and Group Company 
Secretary work in collaboration to ensure an 
effective and efficient Board, as further 
described in Our governance framework 
from page 150. All Directors have access to 
the advice of the Group Company 
Secretary.

The roles of Chair, Group Chief Executive, 
SID and Non-Executive Directors are 
defined within the Barclays Charter of 
Expectations, along with the behaviours and 
competencies for each role, as outlined on 
page 152. Directors are expected to 
commit sufficient time to ensure they can 
discharge their obligations to Barclays 
effectively, as detailed in our Board 
Nominations Committee report on 
page 161. 

The Board is responsible for setting the 
strategy for the Group. The day-to-day 
management of the Group is delegated by 
the Board to the Group Chief Executive who 
is supported by his ExCo, the composition 
of which is outlined on page 149. 

Details of the number of meetings of the 
Board and its Committees, and the 
individual attendance by Directors, can be 
found in Our governance framework on 
page 152 and in each respective Board 
Committee report.

All Board and senior management 
appointments are viewed through a diversity 
lens and are based on merit and objective 
criteria, which focus on the skills and 
experience required for the Board's 
effectiveness and the delivery of the Group's 
strategy. 

A revised Board Diversity and Inclusion Policy 
was adopted on 8 February 2024. For further 
detail, refer to the Board Nominations 
Committee report on page 158.

Board appointments are made following a 
rigorous and transparent process facilitated 
by the Board Nominations Committee, with 
the aid of external search consultancy firms. 

All Directors are subject to annual re-election 
at the AGM. See page 185 for further detail. 

Each year, we carry out an effectiveness 
review to evaluate the performance of the 
Board, Board Committees and individual 
Directors. In line with the Code, the review 
was conducted internally for 2023, and is 
expected to be conducted externally in 2024. 
Refer to the Board Nominations Committee 
report on page 164 for details of the 2023 
effectiveness review as well as progress 
against the findings from the 2022 review.

Directors’ report: How we comply (continued)

Audit, Risk and 
Internal Control

The Board, together with the Board Audit 
Committee, is responsible for ensuring the 
integrity of this Annual Report and that the 
financial statements as a whole present a fair, 
balanced and understandable assessment of 
Barclays' performance, position and 
prospects.

The Board, together with the Board Audit 
Committee, is responsible for ensuring the 
independence and effectiveness of the 
internal audit function and external auditors.  

The Directors are responsible for ensuring 
that management maintains an effective 
system of risk management and internal 
control and for assessing its effectiveness. 
Such a system is designed to identify, 
evaluate and manage, rather than eliminate, 
the risk of failure to achieve business 
objectives and can only provide reasonable, 
and not absolute, assurance against material 
misstatement or loss. 

Processes are in place for identifying, 
evaluating and managing the Principal Risks 
facing the Group. A key component of The 
Barclays Guide is the ERMF. The purpose of 
the ERMF is to identify and set minimum 
requirements of the main risks to the 
strategic objectives of the Group.

The Group is committed to operating within 
a strong system of internal control. The 
Barclays Guide contains the overarching 
framework setting out the approach of the 
Group to internal governance. 

Key controls are assessed on a regular basis 
for both design and operating effectiveness. 
Issues arising out of these assessments, 
where appropriate, are reported to the 
Board Audit Committee. 

The Board Audit Committee oversees the 
control environment (and remediation of 
related issues). It also reviews annually the 
risk management and internal control 
system. 

The Board Audit Committee has concluded 
that throughout the year ended 31 
December 2023 and to date, the Group has 
operated an effective system of internal 
control that provides reasonable assurance 
of financial and operational controls and 
compliance with laws and regulations. 

You can read more about the Board Audit 
Committee and its work, including its 
oversight of the internal control framework 
and areas of ongoing enhancement, from 
page 191.

Remuneration

The Remuneration report from page 191 
sets out the purpose and activities of the 
Board Remuneration Committee, a 
summary of the remuneration policy for the 
Executive Directors and how it is aligned 
with the policy for the wider workforce, as 
well as the Directors’ remuneration 
outcomes for 2023.

The remuneration policies and procedures 
support the Group's strategy and enable us 
to reward sustainable performance, which is 
a key element of our Remuneration 
Philosophy, in line with our Values, Mindset 
and risk expectations.

All Executive Director and senior 
management remuneration policies are 
developed in accordance with the Group's 
formal and transparent procedures 
(ensuring that no Director is involved in 
deciding their own remuneration outcome) 
and are, where possible, aligned to wider 
workforce policies.

Board Remuneration Committee members 
exercise independent judgement and 
discretion when determining remuneration 
outcomes, considering the company and 
individual performance, wider workforce 
and other relevant stakeholder 
considerations.

dividend totalling 2.7p per ordinary share, 
paid in September 2023, the total dividend

Employee Benefit Trusts (EBTs) holding 
shares in Barclays in connection with the 
operation of our employee share plans has 
lodged evergreen dividend waivers on 
shares held by it that have not been 
allocated to employees. The total amount

Support for candidates and colleagues 
with disabilities and long-term 
conditions 

Barclays is committed to attracting and 
retaining a diverse workforce, and our 
commitment to inclusion means we want 
to ensure that candidates with disabilities 
and long-term health conditions receive 
support and adjustments in the application 
process and beyond. Barclays welcomes 
applications from all candidates and is 
committed to ensuring reasonable 
adjustments (accommodations) are put in 
place to ensure a fair and inclusive 
recruitment process. Barclays is 
committed to providing all colleagues with 
the support and tools they need to have a 
productive and fulfilling career. We can 
consider making adjustments to remove 
or reduce barriers colleagues might face if 
they have a disability, health concern or 
mental health condition We also ensure 
opportunities for training, career 
development and promotion are available 
to all.
Research and development

In the ordinary course of business, the 
Group develops new products and services 
in each of its business divisions.

Greenhouse gas emissions, 
energy consumption and energy 
efficiency action

Although financed emissions account for 
the greatest proportion of our climate 
impact, we have also continued addressing 
our operational emissions – an important 
factor in meeting our ambition to be a net 
zero bank by 2050.
Progress to date

1
In 2023 we achieved our milestone
 of 
50% reduction of our Scope 1 and 2 
location-based GHG emissions ahead of 
2030 – reducing these emissions by 51%Δ. 
We continued to source 100% renewableΔ 
2
electricity
 for our global real estate 
3
portfolio
 and continued to meet our 90% 
Scope 1 and 2 market-based emissions 
4
 – reducing these 
reduction target
emissions by 93%Δ.
Key contributors to our progress include 
5
global real estate portfolio right-sizing
and energy efficiency programmes, as well 
as company vehicles electrification, and 
our continued focus on renewable 
electricity sourcing.

For our Scope 3 operational emissions our 
focus remained on engaging with our key 
stakeholders and making data 
enhancements, particularly by acquiring 
primary supplier data and evolving our 
accounting methodology in line with 
industry standards and best practice. We 
also continued to pursue the integration of 
ESG considerations and expectations into 
processes throughout the procurement 
lifecycle.

We expect that our progress against our 
net zero operations targets and 
milestones is likely to be variable and non-
linear. Our net zero operations strategy is 
dependent on broader industry, 
technological and regulatory changes that 
are outside Barclays’ control and may 
affect our ability to achieve our targets and 
milestones. Further, as the accounting 
standards and data underlying our net zero 
operations strategy continue to evolve 
and be refined, this could impact our 
metrics, targets and milestones.

Directors’ report: Other statutory and regulatory information (continued)

Notes

1 In this section, a reference to a 'milestone' denotes an 
indicator we are working towards and report against.
2 We maintained 100% renewable electricity sourcing for 
our global real estate portfolio through instruments 
including green tariffs (55%) and energy attribute 
certificates (EACs)(45%).

3 Global real estate portfolio includes offices, branches, 

campuses and data centres.

4 In this section, a reference to a 'target' denotes an 
indicator linked to our executive remuneration.
5 By right-sizing we are optimising our space and 
associated resources for our operational needs.

Progress against our targets and 
milestones may also be impacted by 
management decisions based on key 
drivers unrelated to climate, for example 
prudent risk management practices. Our 
intent is to enhance data collection and 
accuracy to help identify key contributors 
to our impact, determine opportunities for 
improvement, and support the integration 
of sustainability into our business 
operations.

These measures build on those taken 
during 2022 to implement our net zero 
operations strategy. Further information is 
available on page 191 of the Barclays PLC 
Annual Report 2022. 

GHG Emissions Table and Notes

We have disclosed global GHG emissions 
and energy use data as required by the 
Large and Medium-sized Companies and 
Groups (Accounts and Reports) Regulations 
2008. See the ESG Data Centre for further 
details on our annual operational GHG 
emissions since 2018, including our Scope 1,

1 The carbon reporting year for our GHG emissions is 1 October to 30 September. The carbon reporting year is not fully aligned to the financial reporting year covered by this Directors’ 

report. Details of our approach to assurance over the data is set out in the 2023 Barclays Strategic report.

2 The methodology used to calculate our GHG emissions follows the 'Greenhouse Gas Protocol (GHG): A Corporate Accounting and Reporting Standard (Revised Edition)', defined by the 
World Resources Institute/World Business Council for Sustainable Development. We have adopted the operational control approach to define our reporting boundary. For 2023, we 
have applied the latest emission factors as of 31 December 2023. Reported emissions for Scope 2 location and market-based have been recalculated back to the 2018 baseline, due to 
updated internal and external data. The associated emissions have also been re-classified from Scope 2 electricity to Scope 3 Category 8 (Upstream Leased Assets) as these emissions 
are currently outside of our operational control. In 2022 we reported Scope 2 location-based emissions of 103,422 tCo2e; the recalculated figure is 99,782 tCO2e. In 2022 we reported 
Scope 2 market-based emissions of 1,883 tCo2e; the recalculated figure is 1,963 tCO2e. In 2022 we reported energy use of 467,939 MWh; the recalculated figure is 463,973 MWh.
3 Scope 1 emissions include our direct GHG emissions from natural gas, fuel oil, company cars and HFC refrigerants. In the case of company-owned vehicles, emissions are limited to UK 

vehicles only as this is the only country in which expense data is available. 

4 Scope 2 GHG emissions include our indirect GHG emissions from purchased electricity, purchased heat, cooling and steam . Market-based emissions have been reported for 2023 and 

2022. We have used a zero emission factor where we have green tariffs or energy attribute certificates in place globally.  

5 Scope 3 category 1, 2 and 4 emissions are excluded as these emissions cannot be broken down by country. Scope 3 category 1, 2 and 4 emissions can be found in the Operational 

Footprint tab of the ESG Data Centre. 

6  Intensity ratio calculations have been calculated using location-based emission factors only.
7 Energy consumption data is captured through utility billing; meter reads or estimates. Principal measures we have undertaken in 2023 to improve energy efficiency include the following: 

• Right-sized our global real estate portfolio, therefore optimising our space and associated resources for our operational needs. 
• Deployed our global energy optimisation programme by adjusting corporate offices' settings and systems during periods of low or no occupancy to reduce our demand for energy 

while keeping our buildings running. In 2023 the programme contributed to approximately 9.1 GWh in energy savings at our UK sites – equivalent to the annual electricity 
consumption of approximately 2,600 UK households. 

Δ    2023 data subject to independent limited assurance under ISAE (UK) 3000 and ISAE 3410. Current and previous limited assurance scope and opinions can be found within the ESG

Directors’ report: Other statutory and regulatory information (continued)

Share capital
Share capital structure

The Company has ordinary shares in issue. 
The Company’s Articles also allow for the 
issuance of sterling, US dollar, euro and 
yen preference shares (preference 
shares). No preference shares have been 
issued as at 16 February 2024 (the latest 
practicable date for inclusion in this report). 
Ordinary shares therefore represent 100% 
of the total issued share capital as at 
31 December 2023 and as at 16 February 
2024 (the latest practicable date for 
inclusion in this report).
Details of the movement in ordinary share 
capital during the year can be found in 
Note 27 to the financial statements. 
The rights and obligations attaching to the 
Company's ordinary shares and 
preference shares are set out in the 
Company's Articles, copies of which are 
available on the Company's website at 
home.barclays/corporategovernance 
Voting

Every member who is present in person or 
represented at any general meeting of the 
Company, and who is entitled to vote, has 
one vote on a show of hands. Every proxy 
present has one vote. The proxy will have 
one vote for, and one vote against, a 
resolution if he/she has been instructed to 
vote for, or against, the resolution by 
different members or in one direction by a 
member while another member has 
permitted the proxy discretion as to how 
to vote.
On a poll, every member who is present in 
person or by proxy and who is entitled to 
vote has one vote for every share held. In 
the case of joint holders, only the vote of 
the senior holder (as determined by the 
order in the share register) or his/her proxy 
may be counted. If any sum payable 
remains unpaid in relation to a member’s 
shareholding, that member is not entitled 
to vote that share or exercise any other 
right in relation to a meeting of the 
Company unless the Board otherwise 
determines.
If any member, or any other person 
appearing to be interested in any of the 
Company’s ordinary shares, is served with 
a notice under Section 793 of the 
Companies Act 2006 and does not supply 
the Company with the information 
required in the notice, then the Board, in its 
absolute discretion, may direct that that 
member shall not be entitled to attend or 
vote at any meeting of the Company. 

Person interested

2
BlackRock, Inc.

Notes 

The Board may further direct that, if the 
shares of the defaulting member 
represent 0.25% or more of the issued 
shares of the relevant class, dividends or 
other monies payable on those shares 
shall be retained by the Company until the 
direction ceases to have effect and no 
transfer of those shares shall be registered 
(other than certain specified ‘excepted 
transfers’). A direction ceases to have 
effect seven days after the Company has 
received the information requested, or 
when the Company is notified that an 
excepted transfer of all of the relevant 
shares to a third party has occurred, or as 
the Board otherwise determines.
Transfers

Ordinary shares may be held in either 
certificated or uncertificated form. 
Certificated ordinary shares may be 
transferred in writing in any usual or other 
form approved by the Group Company 
Secretary and executed by or on behalf of 
the transferor. Transfers of uncertificated 
ordinary shares must be made in 
accordance with the Companies Act 2006 
and the CREST Regulations.
The Board is not bound to register a 
transfer of partly paid ordinary shares or 
fully paid shares in exceptional 
circumstances approved by the FCA. 
The Board may also decline to register an 
instrument of transfer of certificated 
ordinary shares unless (i) it is duly stamped, 
deposited at the prescribed place and 
accompanied by the share certificate(s) 
and such other evidence as reasonably 
required by the Board to evidence right to 
transfer, (ii) it is in respect of one class of 
shares only, and (iii) it is in favour of a single 
transferee or not more than four joint 
transferees (except in the case of 
executors or trustees of a member).
The Company is not aware of any 
agreements between holders of securities 
that may result in restrictions on the 
transfer of securities or voting rights.
Variation of rights

The rights attached to any class of shares 
may be varied either with the consent in 
writing of the holders of at least 75% in 
nominal value of the issued shares of that 
class, or with the sanction of a special 
resolution passed at a separate meeting of 
the holders of the shares of that class. The 
rights of shares shall not (unless expressly 
provided by the rights attached to such 
shares) be deemed varied by the creation 
of further shares ranking equally with them 
or subsequent to them.

Limitations on foreign shareholders

There are no restrictions imposed by the 
Articles or (subject to the effect of any 
economic sanctions that may be in force 
from time to time) by current UK laws 
which relate only to non-residents of the 
UK and which limit the rights of such non-
residents to hold or (when entitled to do 
so) vote the ordinary shares.
Exercisability of rights under an 
employee share scheme

EBTs operate in connection with certain of 
the Group’s Employee Share Plans (Plans). 
The trustees of the EBTs may exercise all 
rights attached to the shares in 
accordance with their fiduciary duties, 
other than as specifically restricted in the 
documents governing the Plans. The 
trustees of the EBTs have informed the 
Company that their normal policy is to 
abstain from voting in respect of the 
Barclays shares held in trust. The trustees 
of the Global Sharepurchase EBT and UK 
Sharepurchase EBT may vote in respect of 
Barclays shares held in the EBTs, but only 
as instructed by participants in those Plans 
in respect of their partnership shares and 
(when vested) matching and dividend 
shares. The trustees will not otherwise 
vote in respect of shares held in the 
Sharepurchase EBTs.
Special rights

There are no persons holding securities 
that carry special rights with regard to the 
control of the Company.
Major shareholders

Major shareholders do not have different 
voting rights from those of other 
shareholders. Information provided to the 
Company by substantial shareholders 
(holding voting rights of 3% or more in the 
financial instruments of the Company) 
pursuant to the DTRs are published via a 
Regulatory Information Service and is 
available on the Company’s website. As at 
31 December 2023, the Company had 
been notified under Rule 5 of the DTRs of 
the following holdings of voting rights in 
its shares.
 Between 31 December 2023 and 
16 February 2024 (the latest practicable 
date for inclusion in this report), the 
Company has not received any additional 
notifications pursuant to Rule 5 of 
the DTRs.

Directors’ report: Other statutory and regulatory information (continued)

Powers of Directors to issue and allot or 
buy back the Company’s shares

The powers of the Directors are 
determined by the Companies Act 2006 
and the Company’s Articles. The Directors 
are authorised to issue and allot shares 
and to buy back shares subject to, and on 
the terms of, the annual shareholder 
approval at the AGM. Such authorities 
were granted by shareholders at the 2023 
AGM. It will be proposed at the 2024 AGM 
that the Directors be granted new 
authorities to issue and allot and buy back 
shares.
Repurchase of shares

On 13 March 2023 and 28 July 2023 the 
Company commenced share buy-back 
programmes to purchase its ordinary 
shares of £0.25p each up a maximum 
consideration of £500m and £750m, 
respectively. The first share buy-back 
programme concluded on 14 April 2023 
and the second share buy-back 
programme concluded on 23 October 
2023. The Company repurchased for 
cancellation 343,041,720 ordinary shares 
at a volume weighted average price of 
145.7549 pence per ordinary share during 
the first buy-back programme and 
493,603,770 ordinary shares at a volume 
weighted average price of 151.9437 pence 
per ordinary share during the second buy-
back programme. The purpose of the buy-
back programmes was to reduce the 
Company’s number of outstanding 
ordinary shares. 

In aggregate, the Company purchased 
836,645,490 ordinary shares during 2023 
with an aggregate nominal value of 
approximately £209m (this represented 
approximately 5.5% of the Company's 
issued share capital as at 31 December 
2023) for an aggregate consideration of 
£1,250m excluding taxes and expenses.
All of the repurchased ordinary shares 
have been cancelled. 

No further shares have been repurchased 
since the completion of the second share 
buy-back programme on 23 October 
2023. The maximum number of ordinary 
shares which could be repurchased by the 
Company as part of any share buy-back 
under the authority for on-market share 
buy-backs granted at the 2023 AGM is 
1,093,533,143 ordinary shares (being 
1,587,136,913 less the 493,603,770 
shares repurchased as part of the second 
share buy-back programme).
Distributable reserves

As at 31 December 2023, the distributable 
reserves of the Company were £21,162m 
(2022: £21,701m).

Change of control

There are no significant agreements to 
which the Company is a party that take 
effect, alter or terminate on a change of 
control of the Company following a 
takeover bid. There are no agreements 
between the Company and its Directors or 
employees providing for compensation for 
loss of office or employment that occurs 
because of a takeover bid.
Controls over financial reporting

A framework of disclosure controls and 
procedures is in place to support the 
approval of the financial statements of the 
Group. 

Specific governance committees are 
responsible for examining the financial 
reports and disclosures to help ensure that 
they have been subject to adequate 
verification and comply with applicable 
standards and legislation. 

Where appropriate, these committees 
report their conclusions to the Board Audit 
Committee, which debates such 
conclusions and provides further 
challenge. Finally, the Board scrutinises and 
approves results announcements and the 
Annual Report to ensure that appropriate 
disclosures have been made. This 
governance process is designed to ensure 
that both management and the Board are 
given sufficient opportunity to debate and 
challenge the financial statements of the 
Group and other significant disclosures 
before they are made public. 
Management’s report on internal control 
over financial reporting 

Management is responsible for 
establishing and maintaining adequate 
internal control over financial reporting 
under the supervision of the principal 
executive and financial officers, to provide 
reasonable assurance regarding the 
reliability of financial reporting and the 
preparation of financial statements, in 
accordance with (a) UK-adopted 
international accounting standards; and (b) 
International Financial Reporting 
Standards (IFRS) as issued by the 
International Accounting Standards Board 
(IASB), including interpretations issued by 
the IFRS Interpretations Committee.  

Internal control over financial reporting 
includes policies and procedures that 
pertain to the maintenance of records 
that, in reasonable detail: 

• accurately and fairly reflect transactions 

and dispositions of assets 

• provide reasonable assurances that 

transactions are recorded as necessary 
to permit preparation of financial 
statements in accordance with UK-
adopted international accounting 
standards and IFRS and that receipts 
and expenditures are being made only in 
accordance with authorisations of 
management and the respective 
Directors 

• provide reasonable assurance regarding 

prevention or timely detection of 
unauthorised acquisition, use or 
disposition of assets that could have a 
material effect on the financial 
statements. 

Internal control systems, no matter how 
well designed, have inherent limitations 
and may not prevent or detect 
misstatements. Also, projections of any 
evaluation of effectiveness to future 
periods are subject to the risk that internal 
control over financial reporting may 
become inadequate because of changes in 
conditions or that the degree of 
compliance with the policies or procedures 
may deteriorate.

Management has assessed internal 
control over financial reporting as at 31 
December 2023. In making its 
assessment, management utilised the 
criteria set out in the 2013 COSO 
framework. Management has concluded 
that, based on its assessment, internal 
control over financial reporting was 
effective as at 31 December 2023. 

The system of internal financial and 
operational controls is also subject to 
regulatory oversight in the UK and 
overseas. Further information on 
supervision by financial services regulators 
is provided under Supervision and 
Regulation in the Risk review section on 
pages 363 to 372.
Changes in internal control over financial 
reporting  

There have been no changes that 
occurred during the period covered by this 
report, which have materially affected or 
are reasonably likely to materially affect the 
Group’s internal control over financial 
reporting.

Directors’ report: Other statutory and regulatory information (continued)

Disclosure of information to the auditor

Preparation of accounts

Each Director confirms that, so far as he/
she is aware, there is no relevant audit 
information of which our auditor is 
unaware and that each of the Directors 
has taken all the steps that he/she ought 
to have taken as a Director to make 
himself/herself aware of any relevant audit 
information and to establish that our 
auditor is aware of that information. This 
confirmation is given pursuant to Section 
418 of the Companies Act 2006 and 
should be interpreted in accordance with, 
and subject to, those provisions.
Directors’ responsibilities

The following statement, which should be 
read in conjunction with the Auditor’s 
report set out on pages 396 to 412, is 
made with a view to distinguishing for 
shareholders the respective 
responsibilities of the Directors and of the 
auditor in relation to the accounts.
Going concern

The Group’s business activities and factors 
likely to affect its future development and 
performance are disclosed in the Strategic 
report and Risk review sections of this 
report. The financial performance is 
disclosed within the Financial review with 
funding, liquidity and capital details 
contained within the Risk performance 
section. The Group’s objectives and 
policies in managing the financial risks to 
which it is exposed are discussed in the 
Risk management section.

The Directors considered it appropriate to 
prepare the financial statements on a 
going concern basis.

In preparing each of the Group and 
company financial statements, the 
Directors are required to:

• assess the Group and Company’s ability 

to continue as a going concern, 
disclosing, as applicable, matters related 
to going concern

• use the going concern basis of 

accounting unless they either intend to 
liquidate the Group or the Parent 
company or to cease operations, or 
have no realistic alternative but to do so.

The Directors are required by the 
Companies Act 2006 to prepare Group 
and Company accounts for each financial 
year and, with regard to Group accounts, in 
accordance with UK-adopted international 
accounting standards. The Directors have 
prepared these accounts in accordance 
with (a) UK-adopted international 
accounting standards; and (b) IFRS as 
issued by the IASB, including 
interpretations issued by the IFRS 
Interpretations Committee. Pursuant to 
the Companies Act 2006, the Directors 
must not approve the accounts unless 
they are satisfied that they give a true and 
fair view of the state of affairs of the Group 
and the Company and of their profit or loss 
for that period.

The Directors consider that, in preparing 
the financial statements, the Group and 
the Company have used appropriate 
accounting policies, supported by 
reasonable judgements and estimates, 
and that all accounting standards which 
they consider to be applicable have been 
followed.

The Directors are satisfied that the Annual 
Report and financial statements, taken as a 
whole, are fair, balanced and 
understandable, and provide the 
information necessary for shareholders to 
assess the Group and Company’s position 
and performance, business model and 
strategy.

The Directors are responsible for such 
internal controls as they determine are 
necessary to enable the preparation of 
financial statements that are free from 
material misstatement, whether due to 
fraud or error.
Directors’ responsibility statement

The Directors have responsibility for 
ensuring that the Company and the Group 
keep accounting records which disclose 
with reasonable accuracy the financial 
position of the Company and the Group 
and which enable them to ensure that the 
accounts comply with the Companies Act 
2006.

The Directors are also responsible for 
preparing a Strategic report, Directors’ 
report, Directors’ remuneration report and 
Corporate Governance Statement in 
accordance with applicable law and 
regulations.

The Directors are responsible for the 
maintenance and integrity of the Annual 
Report and Financial Statements as they 
appear on our website. Legislation in the 
UK governing the preparation and 
dissemination of financial statements may 
differ from legislation in other jurisdictions.

The Directors have a general responsibility 
for taking such steps as are reasonably 
open to them to safeguard the assets of 
the Group and to prevent and detect fraud 
and other irregularities.

The Directors, whose names and functions 
are set out on pages 145 to 148, confirm 
to the best of their knowledge that:

(a) the financial statements, prepared in 
accordance with (i) UK-adopted 
international accounting standards; and (ii) 
IFRS as issued by the IASB, including 
interpretations issued by the IFRS 
Interpretations Committee, give a true and 
fair view of the assets, liabilities, financial 
position and profit or loss of the Company 
and the undertakings included in the 
consolidation taken as a whole; and

(b) the management report, on pages 4 to 
58, which is incorporated in the Directors’ 
report, includes a fair review of the 
development and performance of the 
business and the position of the Company 
and the undertakings included in the 
consolidation taken as a whole, together 
with a description of the Principal Risks and 
uncertainties that they face.

On behalf of the Board, I am pleased to 
present the Remuneration report for 2023. 
Over the next few pages, we set out our 
key considerations and the remuneration 
decisions we took as a result – both for the 
Executive Directors of Barclays PLC and 
for the wider workforce. 
Since last year’s report, Sir John Kingman 
and Julia Wilson have joined the 
Committee – bringing new perspectives 
and a wealth of experience. I would like 
formally to welcome them both.

I would also like to thank you, our 
shareholders, for the support you showed 
at our 2023 Annual General Meeting, 
approving both our current Directors’ 
Remuneration Policy to apply for three 
years from the date of that meeting – 
supported by 97% of shareholder votes – 
and the implementation during 2022 of our 
previous Directors' Remuneration Policy.
Performance in 2023 

As always, our remuneration approach is 
rooted in our commitment to reward 
sustainable performance. As the Group 
Chief Executive sets out in his review, our 
diversified income approach has enabled 
us to continue to deliver well in 2023 
despite an external backdrop of persistent 
uncertainty – with heightened volatility 
across asset classes, some significant 
market disruption, and escalating 
geopolitical tensions. In this testing 
environment, we took deliberate, proactive 
steps to protect the Group: maintaining a 
prudent approach to risk management; 
managing our balance sheet with care; and 
continuing to invest in talent and 
technology in sustainable growth areas, 
while maintaining our focus on costs.

Barclays demonstrated its sound footing in 
2023 and continued to see solid income

performance across all three of our 
operating businesses – resulting in Group 
income of £25.4bn, up 2% on 2022. 
Operating expenses for 2023 were 
£16.9bn, a 1% increase on 2022, reflecting 
business growth, investment spend and 
inflation – delivering statutory profit before 
tax of £6.6bn (2022: £7.0bn), down 6%. 

This included £927m of structural cost 
actions taken in the fourth quarter to help 
drive future returns, having reviewed the 
shape, efficiency and focus of our 
businesses. Excluding these costs, profit 
before tax was £7.5bn (2022: £7.7bn, 
excluding the Over-issuance of Securities) 
and RoTE was 10.6%, achieving our 
greater-than-10% target. Our primary 
frame of reference was financial outcomes 
1
on this basis
, to understand the 
underlying performance of the business 
separate from the costs associated with 
the decisions we made to shape its future. 
We ended the year with a CET1 ratio of 
13.8%, within our target range of 13% to 
14%. We will deliver increased capital 
distributions to shareholders, up c.37% on 
2022, via a total dividend for the year of 
8.0p per share and £1.75bn of announced 
share buybacks – equivalent to a total 
payout of c.19.4p per share.

Although income is down for some 
business areas, those reductions are from 
a starting point of strong 2022 
performance for most business areas.
The Corporate and Investment Bank in 
2023 saw income down slightly, a resilient

performance given the unsettled 
macroeconomic backdrop and the lowest 
investment banking wallet in the last 
2
decade
. Global Markets continued to 
grow its income from our top 100 clients 
and maintained its revenue ranking of 
3
sixth
. Investment Banking also maintained 
its sixth rank globally, despite the subdued 
dealmaking environment, and returned to 
4
first in the UK
, up from fourth in 2022. For 
Consumer, Cards and Payments, income 
was up 18%, reflecting the expansion and 
deepening of our client relationships – 
including our latest partnership launch with 
Microsoft and Mastercard. Income was 
also up in Barclays UK, supported by the 
higher interest rate environment, partially 
offset by competition in mortgage and 
savings products.

The Committee has maintained its focus 
on ensuring we reward performance that is 
sustainable. During 2023 the management 
team has been embedding a new 
operating standard – Consistently 
Excellent – which aims to transform the 
operational resilience of Barclays. Raising 
our operating standards and reducing the 
impact on financial performance of 
unexpected issues will strengthen our 
foundation to deliver sustainable 
performance. This was reflected in our 
objective setting, performance 
assessment and reward processes for 
senior colleagues for 2023, and in our 
recognition platform for all colleagues, and 
will be embedded more deeply and widely 
during 2024. Striving to achieve a 
consistently excellent standard is 
becoming part of our culture, and initial 
feedback suggests our work to equip all 
colleagues with the right skills to achieve 
this resonates as a way of driving 
long-term success. 
Colleague remuneration 

Alongside rewarding sustainable 
performance, our Fair Pay Agenda 
continues to underpin all our remuneration 
decisions – ensuring we are paying 
colleagues fairly for the work they do and 
recognising the contributions of all, within 
the resources available to us. This is 
especially pertinent given the challenges 
colleagues continue to face – particularly 
those who are lower-paid, given higher-
than-normal increases in the cost of living 
over recent years. You can read more in 
the 'Wider workforce remuneration' 
section on page 204 and in our sixth annual 
Fair Pay Report published alongside this 
Annual Report. We have also published our 
pay gap figures for employees in the UK 
and in Ireland. 

Paying at least a living wage to all our 
colleagues is a central element of our Fair 
Pay Agenda. We continue to ensure we 
meet or exceed living wage benchmarks in 
every jurisdiction in which our employees  
are based. In the UK our employees  
already received more than the Living 
Wage Foundation’s benchmarks, and we 
are further increasing our minimum UK 
full-time equivalent salary to £24,000. We 
continue to meet or exceed Fair Wage 
Network living wage benchmarks in all 
other countries.

We have continued our work to be simpler, 
more transparent and more consistent in 
how we pay our more-junior colleagues. 
For more junior roles in Barclays UK and 
the support functions in the UK, we publish 
starting salaries by role – providing 

transparency for job candidates and 
existing staff alike. From 2023, the 
performance rating of each individual 
across this population consistently drives 
their annual bonus outcome as a 
percentage of their salary. In previous 
years a range of different approaches were 
used and the annual bonus outcomes for 
many of these roles were discretionary.

In setting this year's incentive pool we 
considered Barclays’ financial and non-
financial performance, and the 
performance of the individual businesses 
that make up the Group, in both absolute 
and relative terms. We considered each 
business's contribution to the 
achievement of our strategic targets and 
its importance to our future success. The 
Committee also wanted to recognise the 
resilience across our operating businesses, 
delivered against a backdrop of 
macroeconomic uncertainty, as well as the 
support our colleagues provided to 
customers and clients. Taking all of this 
into account, the Committee has 
approved a Group incentive pool for 2023 
performance of £1,745m (2022: £1,790m), 
down 3% compared to the final incentive 
pool for 2022, which included a c.£500m 
reduction for risk and control issues that 
came to light during 2022. Risk and 
conduct adjustments to the 2023 
incentive pool are materially less than 
those for 2022, so the incentive pool 
before risk adjustments each year fell by 
c.15% from 2023 to 2022.

This level of incentive funding for 2023 
reflects the lower year-on-year financial 
outcomes in some business areas, while 
also enabling us to reward colleagues for 
the performance delivered – recognising 
the progress made towards our strategic 
priorities and our ambition to be 
consistently excellent in our operations. 
We also considered the competitive 
market for hiring and retaining the talent 
we need to achieve those priorities in the 
future. In doing so, we weighed the views 
and expectations of you as shareholders, 
of our customers and clients, of our 
colleagues, and of our stakeholders in 
wider society. Consistent with our Fair Pay 
Agenda, we have chosen to protect the 
incentive outcomes for our more junior 
colleagues – so, in business areas where 
incentive spend was down year on year, 
more senior colleagues experienced 
greater reductions in annual bonus awards. 
As always, a significant portion of the pool 
will be delivered in shares, most of which 
will be deferred over a number of years.

Remuneration report (continued)

Executive Director remuneration

The Executive Directors' pay in 2024

The Committee carefully considered the 
performance measures for the Executive 
Directors’ 2024 annual bonus and the 
2024-2026 LTIP, and updated elements of 
both the financial and non-financial 
measures in each plan to better reflect the 
revised targets set out under 'Our 
strategy' from page 11, and our long-term 
climate strategy.

For the 2024 annual bonus, a total 
operating expenses measure replaces 
cost: income ratio – reflecting the 
continued importance of cost discipline 
while providing a more focused and simpler 
measure of cost control within the year. 
Other financial measures and weightings in 
the bonus are unchanged. 

For the 2024-2026 LTIP we have 
increased slightly the weighting of RoTE, 
from 25% to 30%, given the focus on 
improving RoTE within the Group's 2026 
targets. This is accommodated via a small 
reduction to the weighting of the relative 
total shareholder return measure from 
25% to 20%. All other financial measures in 
the LTIP remain unchanged from the 
previous year's award, including the 
continued use of cost: income ratio as a 
longer-term cost measure.

We also reviewed the non-financial 
measures for both the 2024 annual bonus 
and 2024-2026 LTIP, to ensure they 
reflect the Group’s shorter- and longer-
term priorities. Our commitment to align 
our financing with the goals and timelines 
of the Paris Climate Agreement has been 
and remains a key component of our 
climate strategy. Many of our climate and 
sustainability targets are longer term, 
including through to 2050, and progress 
towards these is expected to be non-
linear. As such, we have retained the 
Climate & sustainability category within the 
Strategic non-financial assessment for the 
annual bonus and LTIP, but increased its 
weighting in the LTIP from 10% to 15% – 
accommodating this by reducing the 
weighting of the LTIP risk-related 
measures (which this year also incorporate 
assessment of operational excellence) 
from 10% to 5%. 

Determining Executive Directors' pay 
outcomes

The Committee considered the Executive 
Directors’ annual bonus outcomes in the 
context of the Group’s performance and 
the performance of each Executive 
Director during 2023.

The 2023 annual bonus outcome for C.S. 
Venkatakrishnan (known as Venkat) was 
53.3% of maximum, and for Anna Cross 
was 54.3% of maximum (2022: 75.4% for 
both). Profit before tax provided a 21.1% 
outcome out of a possible 50%, and the 
cost: income ratio provided a 2.7% 
outcome out of a possible 10%. 
Performance against the strategic non-
financial measures was good, which 
resulted in a 16.5% outcome out of a 
possible 25% and the performance of each 
of the Executive Directors against their 
personal objectives was also assessed and 
taken into account (13.0% for Venkat and 
14.0% for Anna out of a possible 15%).

Before finalising those outcomes, the 
Committee reflected on their 
appropriateness. We reviewed the 
underlying financial health of the Group, 
which is strong and well-capitalised. We 
considered the bonus outcomes in the 
context of those for the wider workforce, 
ensuring suitable alignment both this year 
and over a multi-year period, and also 
compared to historical outcomes for the 
Executive Directors in the context of 
performance each year. We concluded 
that the outcomes are appropriate in the 
context of the performance achieved and 
that no further discretionary adjustment 
was warranted. 

Neither Venkat nor Anna Cross 
participated in the 2021-2023 LTIP cycle, 
as neither was an Executive Director at the 
time those awards were granted. The 
Committee did, however, assess 
performance against the measures for this 
LTIP cycle to determine the vesting 
outcome for the previous Group Finance 
Director, who is the sole remaining 
participant. This was 53.2% of the 
maximum, as outlined later in this report. 

The Committee decided to grant awards 
under the 2024-2026 LTIP cycle with a 
face value at grant of 140% of Fixed Pay 
for Venkat and 134% of Fixed Pay for Anna 
Cross, reflecting the personal contribution 
made by each to a solid 2023 performance 
– and to provide each with a significant 
incentive award subject to forward-looking 
performance conditions during 2024 to 
2026.

At the same time the ways we approach 
and monitor risk, and ensure a high 
standard of operational performance, are 
fundamental to delivering sustainable 
performance every year. To reflect our 
focus on this across Barclays, we have 
included a Risk & operational excellence 
category within the Strategic non-financial 
element of the 2024 annual bonus, with a 
weighting of 10% – accommodated via a 
slight reduction in the weighting of other 
Strategic non-financial bonus measures. 
The Climate & sustainability, Customers & 
clients, and Colleagues categories are 
each weighted 5%.

The Committee will continue to review the 
measures and weightings for the Executive 
Directors' incentives each year, to ensure 
they appropriately support the delivery of 
our strategy and reflect our priorities.

In early 2024, the Committee reviewed the 
level of Fixed Pay for Venkat and Anna 
Cross, in the same way and at the same 
time as fixed pay was reviewed for the 
wider workforce. The Committee 
increased Fixed Pay by 2.5% for both 
Venkat and Anna, resulting in Fixed Pay of 
£2,947,000 and £1,845,000 respectively,  
effective from 1 March 2024. These 
percentage increases are significantly 
lower than the average across the wider 
workforce, in particular for other UK 
employees within the scope of the 2024 
UK pay deal with the union Unite – with a 
5.55% budget for salary increases for 
junior employees and a 3.75% budget for 
other union-recognised employees. Even 
following these Fixed Pay increases, the 
total compensation opportunity for each 
Executive Director remains well behind the 
median opportunity for equivalent roles 
across our international banking peer 
group.
Shareholder alignment 

Of the total variable pay awards to Venkat 
and Anna Cross in respect of 2023 
performance (2023 annual bonus plus 
2024-2026 LTIP), 96% and 94% 
respectively will be in shares that must be 
retained for a period of between one and 
eight years from grant – aligning the 
Executive Directors' interests with those 
of our shareholders. Both Venkat and Anna 
Cross already have significant 
shareholdings.

Remuneration report (continued)

Group Chair and Non-Executive 
Director fees

The Committee periodically reviews the 
Group Chair's fee, and the Directors' 
Remuneration Policy allows for increases 
of up to 20% during the policy's three-year 
term. The Committee last increased the 
Group Chair's fee with effect from 1 
January 2023, having considered the fee in 
the context of the Chair fees paid across 
our international banking peer group – with 
a particular focus on the UK banks, given 
the regional differences in both the role 
and pay for non-executive directors 
including chairs. Prior to that, this fee had 
remained at the same level since 2015. 
Early in 2024, the Committee approved a 
2% increase in the Group Chair's fee, from 
£840,000 to £856,800, effective 1 January 
2024. Each year £100,000 of the fee will 
continue to be used to purchase Barclays 
shares that will be retained on the Group 
Chair's behalf until he retires from the 
Board. No other changes were made to 
the Group Chair's remuneration 
arrangements or benefits.

In January 2024 the Board reviewed the 
other Non-Executive Directors' fees, 
which were also last increased with effect 
from 1 January 2023, and approved 2% 
increases to those fees effective 
1 January 2024 (with the relevant Non-
Executive Directors having recused 
themselves from those discussions). 
Update in respect of Jes Staley's 
remuneration 

As outlined in the 2021 Annual Report, 
Jes Staley stepped down from the role of 
Group Chief Executive on 
31 October 2021 and his unvested awards 
were suspended pending further 
developments in respect of the regulatory 
and legal proceedings related to the FCA 
and PRA investigation regarding Mr Staley.

In October 2023, the FCA issued a 
Decision Notice in relation to Mr Staley. 

The Committee considered the detailed 
findings in this Decision Notice and 
concluded that Mr Staley should be 
ineligible for or forfeit a number of his 
awards, including the bonus award in 
respect of the 2021 performance year, all 
of his unvested LTIP awards – both those 
for which the performance had already 
been assessed and those still subject to 
performance conditions – and his other 
unvested deferred bonus awards from 
earlier years. The total value of the lapsed 
LTIP awards and forfeited deferred bonus 
awards at that time was £17.8m. 
Looking ahead

As we move into 2024, the Committee 
maintains its commitment to rewarding 
sustainable performance. 

We will use our remuneration policies and 
practices to incentivise the Executive 
Directors and the management team to 
deliver our three year plan, improving 
operational and financial performance, and 
improving shareholder returns. 

We will support the management team to 
use performance management and pay:

– to align the wider workforce to those 

same priorities

– to reinforce the importance of good 
conduct, strong controls and risk 
management and

– to support Barclays' Purpose, Values 
and Mindset, and our ambition to 
achieve a standard of being consistently 
excellent.

We will continue to engage with our 
shareholders and other stakeholders on 
pay and will be meeting with our largest 
shareholders to discuss our pay outcomes 
for 2023. 

Beyond this, we will maintain focus on our 
Fair Pay Agenda, continuing to support our 
colleagues and ensuring the way we pay 
our people supports the long-term health 
and success of the Group.

Chair, Board Remuneration Committee 
February 2024 

Removal of the regulatory 
requirement to operate 
a 2:1 'bonus cap'

With effect from 31 October 2023, 
the PRA and FCA removed the UK 
regulatory requirement for certain 
banks, including Barclays, to apply a 
maximum 1:1 ratio of variable to fixed 
remuneration for employees who are 
deemed to have a material risk impact 
on their firm – known as Material Risk 
Takers (MRTs) – or up to a 2:1 ratio if 
shareholders approve the adoption of 
that higher maximum. Our 
shareholders approved the adoption 
of a 2:1 maximum ratio for Barclays 
MRTs around the time that these 
regulations first came into effect.   
Going forward, such banks – including 
Barclays – will be permitted to set their 
maximum variable pay ratios to be 
greater than 2:1.

As the new regulations were published 
close to the end of 2023, the 
Committee determined that the 2:1 
cap would continue to apply in 
Barclays for the 2023 performance 
year. The Committee will consider this 
further in respect of 2024 and future 
years. 

A relatively small number of our 
employees are potentially impacted 
by this regulatory change. Our 
Executive Directors’ maximum 
variable pay opportunity is governed 
by the Directors' Remuneration Policy 
that shareholders approved at our 
2023 AGM, and therefore is 
unchanged by these new regulations. 
The Directors' Remuneration Policy 
will continue to apply until a new policy 
is approved by shareholders. No new 
Directors' Remuneration Policy is 
proposed for 2024.

Wider workforce remuneration

Our remuneration philosophy

Our Fair Pay Agenda

Our remuneration philosophy applies to all employees and sets out 
the way we approach remuneration. Its aim is to be as simple and 
clear as possible, while ensuring strong alignment with risk and 
conduct as well as our Values and Mindset. It is also closely aligned 
with Provision 40 of the FRC's UK Corporate Governance Code. 
The remuneration decisions set out in this report are a result of the 
application of our remuneration philosophy in respect of 2023.

Paying people fairly is an essential element of our pay philosophy. 
We have developed our fair pay approach over a number of years, 
and we continue to ensure that fairness is a key and explicit 
consideration in the way we make all of our pay decisions.
Our fair pay principles

Fair pay for the lowest paid 
Paying fairly for work done, in a simple and transparent way.

Philosophy

Attract and retain 
talent needed to 
deliver Barclays’ 
strategy

Align pay with 
investor and other 
stakeholder 
interests

Reward sustainable 
performance

Support Barclays’ 
Values and culture

Align with risk 
appetite, risk 
exposure and 
conduct 
expectations

Be fair, transparent  
and as simple  as 
possible

Long-term success depends on the talent of our 
employees. This means attracting and retaining  
an appropriate range of talent to deliver against 
our strategy, and paying the right amount for that 
talent.

Remuneration should be designed with 
appropriate consideration of the views, rights and 
interests of stakeholders. This means listening to 
our shareholders, other investors, regulators,

Alignment of remuneration policy for the wider workforce and Executive Directors

Most elements of remuneration policy are aligned for the wider workforce and the Executive Directors. Differences in policy 
implementation between seniority levels reflect our remuneration philosophy. For example, the balance between fixed and variable pay 
is shifted toward fixed pay for employees in more-junior roles and towards variable pay for those in more-senior roles. A large 
proportion of variable pay for senior employees, or the majority of variable pay and half of Fixed Pay for the Executive Directors, is 
delivered in shares over multiple years – aligning their interests more closely with those of shareholders – whereas pay is primarily in 
cash for more-junior employees. Aligned with our Fair Pay Agenda, UK employer pension contributions are also higher for our junior 
employees. 

The table below provides a summary of remuneration arrangements for the wider workforce and the Executive Directors.

Reflects the individual’s role, skills and experience and is reviewed annually. Fixed pay is 
increased where justified by role change, increased responsibility or a change in the 
market rate for the role. Salaries may also be increased in line with local statutory 
requirements and with union and works council commitments.

All in salary for most, paid in cash. Some 
roles are also entitled to receive certain 
cash allowances.

All in salary for most. For a small number of 
senior employees (2% globally) a 
proportion is delivered in Role Based Pay 
(RBP), in cash or shares, to recognise the 
seniority, scale and complexity of their role. 
The RBP value may change, for example, 
where justified by a role or responsibility 
change or a change in the market rate for 
the role.

Reflects the individual’s role, skills and 
experience, set to provide a market-
competitive total compensation

Annual increases are typically no more than 
the average increase for UK employees.

50% is delivered in cash (paid monthly), and 
50% in shares. The shares are delivered in 
four equal quarterly instalments and are 
then subject to a holding period, with 
restrictions lifting over five years.

Annual bonuses incentivise and reward the achievement of Group, business and 
individual objectives, and reward employees for demonstrating individual behaviours in 
line with Barclays’ Values and Mindset. All employees are considered, subject to eligibility 
criteria.

Assessed against predetermined targets 
and measures to align with financial 
performance, strategic non-financial 
performance and personal performance. 

Delivery

In cash following the performance year.

Long Term 
Incentive Plan 
(LTIP) award

Not applicable to the wider workforce.

For many a proportion of annual bonus is 
deferred to future years. Deferred 
bonuses are generally delivered half in 
deferred cash and half in deferred shares, 
released in equal annual instalments over 
three, four, five or seven years, with a 
further six or 12-month holding period for 
some roles.

The majority of annual bonus is generally 
deferred in shares and then subject to a 
further 12-month holding period. Across 
the annual bonus and any LTIP award 
combined, deferral will always at least meet 
regulatory requirements.

The value received from LTIP awards 
depends on assessment of performance 
over a three-year period against Group-
wide financial and non-financial measures. 
Delivery is in shares between the third and 
seventh year from grant, with each release 
subject to a further 12-month holding 
period. 

All-employee 
share plans

Provide an opportunity for all employees to acquire Barclays shares, in some locations on beneficial terms. Barclays operates all-
employee share plans in locations representing 99% of employees globally.

Role of the Remuneration Committee in wider workforce remuneration

The Committee considers the overarching objectives, principles and parameters of remuneration policy across the Group, ensuring a 
coherent approach in respect of all employees. In discharging this responsibility the Committee seeks to ensure the policy is fair and 
transparent, avoids complexity, and assesses – among other things – the impact of pay arrangements in supporting the Group’s culture, 
Values and strategy and on all elements of risk management. The Committee performs the following activities in relation to wider 
workforce remuneration: 

– Ensures alignment of remuneration with the remuneration philosophy, Fair Pay Agenda and Barclays' Purpose, Values, Mindset, 

conduct expectations and long-term success 

– Ensures alignment of wider workforce and Executive Director remuneration policies 

– Approves the bonus pool across the wider workforce and reviews wider workforce pay outcomes 

– Reviews the annual Group fixed pay budgets.

Performance management

Performance management plays a key role 
both in supporting colleagues to progress 
their careers and in making Barclays a 
consistently excellent organisation. 

Our performance management approach 
centres on continuous performance 
management principles.

This encourages people leaders to discuss 
performance throughout the year, 

including reviewing progress made against 
‘what’ has been achieved (performance 
versus individual objectives) and ‘how’ it 
has been achieved (behaviours in line with 
our Values and Mindset, in addition to our 
leadership behaviours for senior leaders). 
At year-end, colleagues are assessed 
separately on the ‘what’ and the ‘how' of 
their performance. 

This assessment is reflected in colleague 
performance ratings and bonus outcomes.

For 2023, our aspiration to be a 
consistently excellent organisation was 
reflected in performance management for 
senior colleagues – and will be embedded 
more deeply and widely during 2024.

Engaging with stakeholders on remuneration

We seek to consider the views of all of our stakeholders in remuneration decision-making, including colleagues, investors and regulators.  

Colleagues

Investors 

Other stakeholders

We engage with colleagues to understand their 
views through our Your View surveys, union and 
works council engagements, and townhalls. We  
also engage with colleagues through our 
Employee Resource Groups, webcasts, 
workshops and events. 

Our ongoing engagement with the union Unite 
in the UK covers a range of topics, such as fair 
pay and the increasing cost of living, and this is 
another opportunity for the views of colleagues 
to inform decision-making. For information on 
our 2024 pay deal with Unite see 'Salary budget 
for 2024', below.

We publish information to explain to colleagues 
how the Group’s performance and pay 
approach aligns to the Fair Pay Agenda, and to 
help them understand the employee benefits 
Barclays provides – so they can make the most 
of what is on offer. To communicate pay in a 
clear way, each colleague receives a 
Compensation Profile detailing their fixed pay 
and incentives for the previous year and their 
fixed pay for the following year.

We recognise that remuneration is an area of 
particular interest to some shareholders. We 
listen to their views and take these into account 
when setting remuneration or considering 
changes to remuneration policies. Accordingly, 
the Group Chair or Remuneration Committee 
Chair hold meetings each year with major 
shareholders and representative groups to 
understand their views, accompanied by senior 
Barclays employees. In 2023, we discussed our 
remuneration policies and our 2022 pay 
outcomes with representatives of some of our 
institutional shareholders and proxy voting 
agencies.

This kind of engagement helps inform the 
Committee's work and contributes directly to 
the decisions it makes in relation to Executive 
Directors' remuneration. For example, 
shareholder views were a key consideration in 
the Committee's decision to increase the 
weighting of the Climate & sustainability 
category from 10% to 15% for the 2024-2026 
LTIP cycle.

Each year, the Barclays Internal Audit or Chief 
Controls Office teams review our remuneration 
policies and how we've operated our 
remuneration processes, to provide assurance 
to the management team and the Committee 
that we are compliant with regulatory 
requirements. 

Whenever regulations on remuneration are 
changed, we review our remuneration policies 
and practices to ensure they are compliant – 
and make changes if necessary. 

In 2023 we continued to engage with our 
regulators to ensure we understand their 
perspectives, and to explain our performance, 
pay priorities and decision-making. We took 
their views into consideration when making our 
remuneration decisions for 2023, and continue 
to ensure we have ongoing regulatory dialogue 
on remuneration.

Fixed pay decisions for 2024

Living wage employer  

We continue to ensure that we at least 
meet the living wage benchmarks for each 
location, and are an accredited Living 
Wage employer in the UK.
Salary budget for 2024 

We targeted our salary increase budgets 
so there are higher increases for the most 
junior colleagues. In the UK, with the union 
Unite, we have agreed a salary increase 
budget of 5.55% for our junior employees 
and 3.75% for other union-recognised 
employees. For junior employees in India 
and the US salary increase budgets are 8% 
and 3.25% respectively.
The percentage Fixed Pay increases for 
the Executive Directors are below the 
average percentage increases for the 
wider workforce; the Group Chief 
Executive and Group Finance Director will 
each receive a 2.5% increase in Fixed Pay. 

Exceeding the living wage in key locations

We pay at least the living wage in all locations. Below are our minimum hourly rates 
from 1 March 2024 for the UK, USA and India, where 90% of employees are based.

£13.19UK

2023: £12.23

$22.50USA

2023: $22.50

₹150.00

India
2023: R143.00

Pay transparency

We have continued to simplify our pay 
approach for junior colleagues, making it 
easier for them to understand how their 
pay is set and managed.

Pay levels and annual salary increases for 
our most junior roles in Barclays UK and 
support functions in the UK are based on 
role type, and starting salaries are published. 

Annual bonus approaches for those 
populations have also been harmonised. 
Previously, bonus outcomes were fully 
discretionary for many of these roles. From 
2023, annual bonus outcomes are a set 
percentage of salary, differentiated by each 
employee's performance rating.

Incentive pool and annual bonus outcomes for 2023

Determining the Group incentive pool

Group incentive pool and Group Chief Executive bonus outcomes over the years

In determining the 2023 Group incentive pool, 
the Committee considered:

• The Group's financial and non-financial 

performance during 2023 (both absolute and 
relative)

• The performance of individual businesses 
within the Group and their contributions to 
our strategic targets and vision

• The Group’s capital position and current and 

future risks 

• The need to reward strong performers 
appropriately, as well as recognising 
colleagues who have exemplified the 
Barclays Values and Mindset

• Compensation market data and expected 

market trends, to maintain competitiveness 
where performance warrants. 

The Committee used its judgement to establish 
the right balance between annual bonus 
outcomes that reflect the performance of the 
Group and managing the Group's cost base, 
while supporting its ability to attract, retain and 
reward colleagues who will drive the delivery of 
the Group’s strategy and sustainable growth for 
shareholders in the future, in line with our 
remuneration philosophy.

On that basis, the Committee approved a Group 
incentive pool for 2023 performance of 
£1,745m (2022: £1,790m), down 3% compared 
to the final incentive pool for 2022, which itself 
incorporated a c.£500m reduction for risk and 
control issues that came to light during 2022. 
The risk and conduct adjustments to the 2023 
incentive pool are materially less than those for 
2022, so the incentive pool before risk 
adjustments each year fell by c.15% from 2023 
to 2022 – as seen in the chart on the right.
The Group incentive pool and Group 
Chief Executive bonus outcomes

The incentive approach for our Executive 
Directors is significantly more structured than 
for other employees, as required by institutional 
shareholders for directors of UK-listed 
companies. This more-structured approach, 
with a need for direct alignment to financial 
performance metrics, leads to greater year-on-
year volatility in incentive outcomes – both up 
and down – for the Executive Directors 
compared to other employees. 

For 2023, like every year, the Committee 
considered the Executive Director bonus 
outcomes in the context of the bonus 
outcomes for the wider workforce, ensuring 
appropriate alignment both this year and over a 
multi-year period. It also reviewed the historical 
outcomes for the Executive Directors in the 
context of performance each year and 
concluded they were appropriate in the context 
of the performance achieved. 

Consistent with our Fair Pay Agenda, incentive 
outcomes for junior employees are largely 
protected, so, in business areas where incentive 
spend was down year on year, more senior 
colleagues experienced greater reductions in 
annual bonus awards.

Annual percentage change in remuneration of Directors and 
employees

• The annual percentage change in fixed pay earned in 2023, compared to 2022, is 

3% for the Group Chief Executive and 9% for the median UK employee – 
reflecting the Fixed Pay and salary increases awarded in early 2023.

See page 223

Group Chief Executive pay ratio: 83:1

• Our Group Chief Executive median pay ratio for 2023 is down in comparison to 

2022 (101:1) . 

• This is due to a decrease in the CEO single total figure for remuneration from 

2022 to 2023 and an increase in median total pay of UK employees over the same 
period.

2023 pay outcomes

Implementation for 2024

Shareholding requirement

To further enhance the 
alignment of 
shareholders’ and 
Executive Directors’ 
interests in long-term 
value creation.

Risk and conduct 
adjustment – malus and 
clawback

Malus and clawback 
provisions discourage 
excessive risk-taking and 
inappropriate 
behaviours.

• Executive Directors are required to hold 
shares with a value equivalent to their 
maximum annual variable pay opportunity 
(233% of Fixed Pay for the Group Chief 
Executive and 224% of Fixed Pay for the 
Group Finance Director), to be built up within 
five years from their date of appointment. 

• Post-employment shareholding 

requirements apply for two years after 
stepping down as an Executive Director. The 
amount to be held is as described above, or if 
lower the actual number of shares held on 
the date the Executive Director steps down.

• Annual bonus and LTIP awards are subject to 

malus and clawback provisions.

• More detail is set out below.

Shareholding 
requirements remain 
unchanged

As at 31 December 2023: 
C.S. Venkatakrishnan’s 
shareholding was 227% of 
his year-end Fixed Pay 
(requirement to be met by 
31 October 2026) 

Anna Cross’s 
shareholding was 118% of 
her year-end Fixed Pay 
(requirement to be met by 
22 April 2027)

Annual bonus and LTIP 
awards granted in respect

Annual bonus and LTIP 
awards granted in respect 
of 2024 performance will 
be subject to malus and 
clawback provisions

Risk and conduct (including malus and clawback)

Risk and conduct are taken seriously at Barclays. The Committee 
ensures there are in-year adjustments, malus or clawback applied 
to individual remuneration where appropriate.

All Executive Director annual bonus and LTIP awards are subject 
to malus and clawback provisions. The purpose of these 
provisions is to discourage excessive risk-taking and inappropriate 
behaviours.

The malus provisions enable the Committee to reduce the 
amount of unvested bonus or LTIP (including to nil) prior to 
vesting in specified circumstances, including but not limited to: 

– The individual in question deliberately misleading Barclays, the 

market and/or shareholders in relation to the financial 
performance of the Barclays Group 

– The individual causing harm to Barclays’ reputation or where 

his/her actions have amounted to misconduct, incompetence 
or negligence

– A material restatement of the financial statements of the 

Barclays Group or any subsidiary, or the Group or any business 
unit suffering a material downturn in its financial performance 

– A material failure of risk management in the Barclays Group

– A significant deterioration in the financial health of the Barclays 

Group. 

The clawback provisions enable amounts to be recovered after 
they have vested, for a period in line with applicable regulations – 
currently seven years from grant (which can be extended to up to 
10 years in circumstances where a relevant investigation is 
ongoing at the end of the initial seven-year period), in 
circumstance where: 

– The individual in question’s actions or omissions have 
amounted to misbehaviour or material error, and/or

– Barclays or the relevant business unit has suffered a material 

failure of risk management.

In addition to individual adjustments, the Committee considers 
and makes collective adjustments to the incentive pool for risk 
and conduct events. The Committee also adjusts the incentive 
pool to take account of an assessment of future risks, including 
conduct, non-financial factors that can support the delivery of a 
strong risk management, control and conduct culture, and other 
factors including reputation and impact on customers, markets 
and other stakeholders. The Committee is supported in its 
consideration of this by the Board Risk Committee. For 2023, the 
total impact of risk and conduct-related collective adjustments is 
a reduction of c.£185m (2022: c.£500m).
Discretion

In addition to the various operational discretions the Committee 
can exercise in the performance of its duties (including those 
discretions set out in the Company’s share plan rules), the 
Committee reserves the right to make either minor or 
administrative amendments to the Directors' Remuneration 
Policy to benefit its operation or to make more material 
amendments in light of new laws, regulations and/or regulatory 
guidance. The Committee would only exercise this right if it 
believed it was in the best interests of the Company, and where it 
is not possible, practicable or proportionate to seek or await 
shareholder approval at the next AGM.

In relation to the Executive Directors' annual bonus, the 
Committee has discretion to determine the appropriate 
performance conditions applying each year – provided that 
financial factors will normally guide at least 60% of the bonus 
opportunity. 

Although the Committee takes a structured approach to 
considering the level of annual bonus outcome for the Executive 
Directors each year, any bonus award is discretionary and the 
Committee has discretion to award any amount from zero to the 
maximum value.

Remuneration report (continued)

In relation to the LTIP, the Committee again has discretion to 
determine the appropriate performance conditions – provided 
that financial measures will normally be at least 70% of the total 
opportunity. In exceptional circumstances the Committee has 
discretion to amend performance targets, measures or the 
number of shares under awards, if circumstances occur that 
cause the Committee to consider such adjustment to be 
reasonable. The Committee also has the discretion to reduce the 
vesting of any award, including to nil, if it deems the outcome 
inconsistent with the performance delivered.

For 2023, the Committee did not exercise discretion to adjust the 
variable pay outcomes as outlined on page 208. 
Performance measures and targets

Measures 

The performance measures and targets are set annually by the  
Committee to align with our strategic priorities, ensuring the 
measures support delivery of the Group’s strategy.

The Committee selects financial performance measures that are 
fundamental to delivery against the Group’s strategy and are 
considered to be the most important financial measures used by 
the Executive Directors and the Board to oversee the direction of 
the business. The non-financial performance measures are 
chosen to represent key indicators of the success of our strategy, 
and to provide a balanced view of our performance during the 
period, which are robustly monitored and reported on to the 
management team and the Board.
Targets

Targets for both the annual bonus and LTIP are calibrated to be 
stretching but achievable, and are aligned with creating value for 
shareholders and other stakeholders. 

In respect of the annual bonus, the financial measures and 
weightings are disclosed at the start of the relevant performance 
year. The Committee considers the specific annual bonus targets 
to be commercially sensitive, and that it would be detrimental to 
disclose the targets at the start of the relevant performance year. 
On that basis, the targets and performance against those targets 
are disclosed at the end of the relevant performance year, in that 
year’s Annual Report on Directors’ remuneration, provided that 
commercial sensitivity is no longer an issue at that time. 

In respect of the LTIP, the financial measures, weightings and 
targets are disclosed in the Remuneration report published 
immediately before the awards are granted – which is shortly after 
at the start of the relevant performance period.

The Committee selects non-financial performance measures 
that support the delivery of our strategy and reflect our priorities 
over the next year or over a multi-year period.

ESG and remuneration

The Committee reviews the Executive Directors' incentive 
measures each year to ensure they continue to support the 
delivery of our strategic priorities, including ESG priorities.

The Executive Directors' annual bonus and LTIP have included 
Climate & sustainability measures for over a decade. The 
Committee aligns these measures each year with the Group's 
evolving climate and sustainability ambitions, metrics and targets. 
Most of our climate-related measures and targets are longer 
term, including those relating to financing the transition and 
financed emissions, and progress towards these targets is 
expected to be variable and non-linear. This is reflected in a higher 
weighting of Climate & sustainability measures in the LTIP, 
compared to the annual bonus, as follows:

– For the 2024-2026 LTIP, 15% of the total opportunity will be 
determined based on performance measures relating to 
Climate & sustainability, measuring progress against each of 
the three pillars of our climate strategy – including our ambition 
to be a net zero bank by 2050 and our commitment to align our 
financing with the goals and timelines of the Paris Climate 
Agreement.

– For the 2024 annual bonus, 5% of the total opportunity will be 

determined based on Climate & sustainability measures.

A further 5% of each of the 2024 bonus and the 2024-2026 LTIP 
will be determined on Colleagues measures, including diversity, 
inclusion and engagement. Risk & operational excellence 
measures are weighted at 10% in the 2024 bonus and 5% in the 
2024-2026 LTIP, as the management of risk underpins delivery 
against our strategy and is a key part of the governance of the 
Group. Outcomes will be determined based on an assessment of 
performance against a range of measures of our risk culture, 
operational precision and controls.

In recent years, the weighting of the Climate & sustainability 
category in both the LTIP and annual bonus was equal, at 10%. 
As described earlier, for this year's forward-looking incentives the 
Committee increased the weighting to 15% in the 2024-2026 
LTIP and decreased it to 5% in the 2024 annual bonus. Given the 
higher maximum opportunity under the LTIP compared to  the 
annual bonus, these changes equate to an increase in the total 
value of remuneration that will be determined based on climate-
related measures.

Illustrative scenarios for Executive Directors' 
remuneration

The charts below show the potential value of the current 
Executive Directors’ 2024 total remuneration in four scenarios: 
‘Minimum’ (i.e. Fixed Pay, pension and benefits), ‘Mid-point’ (i.e. 
Fixed Pay, pension, benefits and 50% of the maximum variable pay 
that may be awarded), ‘Maximum’ (i.e. Fixed Pay, pension, benefits 
and the maximum variable pay that may be awarded) and 
‘Maximum with illustrative share price increase applied to 
LTIP’ (the Maximum scenario, assuming share price appreciation 
of 50% on the LTIP). 
Group Chief Executive

The value of benefits in these charts is based on an estimated 
annual value for regular contractual benefits provision during 
2024. Additional ad hoc benefits may arise but will always be 
provided in line with the Directors' Remuneration Policy. 

A significant proportion of the potential remuneration of the 
Executive Directors is performance-related, delivered in Barclays 
shares and subject to deferral, additional holding periods, malus 
and clawback. These charts assume a constant share price, other 
than for the share price appreciation applied to the LTIP value in 
the 'Maximum with illustrative share price increase' scenario.

Alignment with Provision 40 of the UK Corporate Governance Code  

Code requirements
Clarity – remuneration arrangements should 
be transparent and promote effective 
engagement with shareholders and the 
workforce

How the Committee has addressed the requirement

• A clear remuneration philosophy with aligned policies and practices for Executive Directors and 

the wider workforce

• Our Fair Pay Report, which sets out how pay fairness is central to what we stand for, is used to 

engage with our shareholders and our colleagues

• Regular engagement on remuneration with our largest institutional shareholders

Simplicity – remuneration structures should 
avoid complexity and their rationale and 
operation should be easy to understand

• Clear disclosure of rationale for and operation of each element of the Directors' Remuneration 

Policy

• Executive Directors incentivised via annual bonus with deferral and LTIP

• Prospective disclosure of bonus metrics and LTIP targets, and full retrospective disclosure of 

outcomes against financial and non-financial targets and criteria, with full supporting 
commentary

Risk – remuneration arrangements should 
ensure reputational and other risks from 
excessive rewards, and behavioural risks that 
can arise from target-based incentive plans, 
are identified and mitigated

• Assessment of 'What' and 'How' performance is achieved

• Ex-ante and ex-post risk factored into the assessment of business performance

• Significant deferral into shares, to align with shareholder experience

• Committee discretion to adjust all variable remuneration outcomes

• Malus and clawback provisions apply to all elements of variable remuneration

Predictability – the range of possible values of 
rewards to individual Directors and any other 
limits or discretions should be identified and 
explained at the time of approving the policy

Proportionality – the link between individual 
awards, the delivery of strategy and the long-
term performance of the company should be 
clear. Outcomes should not reward poor 
performance

• Maximum incentive outcomes set out in the Directors' Remuneration Policy

• Scenario charts illustrate potential payouts under each element of the Policy

• Key areas of Committee discretion clearly outlined in the Policy

• Annual bonus and LTIP measures reviewed each year to maintain alignment to strategic 

priorities and KPIs

• Very significant deferral into shares, to align with shareholder experience

• Committee discretion, malus and clawback provisions apply to all elements of variable 

remuneration, to ensure outcomes do not reward poor performance

Alignment to culture – incentive schemes 
should drive behaviours consistent with 
company Purpose, Values and strategy

• The Committee reviews all policies and practices, including incentive schemes, ensuring 

alignment to the Group's Purpose, Values, Mindset and conduct expectations

• A key aspect of remuneration philosophy is rewarding sustainable performance

• Executive Directors' bonus and LTIP based on a balanced scorecard of financial and non-
financial measures, with financial measures aligned to external financial targets and non-
financial measures aligned to supporting Customers & clients, Colleagues, and to the Group's 
Climate & sustainability ambitions 

• Commitment to pay fairness across the workforce

• Executive Director remuneration outcomes considered in the context of outcomes across the 

wider workforce

2 Anna Cross was appointed to the Board and as Group Finance Director on 23 April 2022. The remuneration shown for 2022 is in respect of her services as Group Finance Director during 

2022.

Additional information in respect of each element 
of pay for the Executive Directors (audited)
1) Fixed Pay

Fixed Pay is delivered 50% in cash, paid monthly, and 50% in shares, delivered quarterly. The shares are subject to a holding period, with 
restrictions lifting over five years (20% each year).

More information on the Committee's considerations in respect of the Executive Directors' Fixed Pay is set out on page 217.
2) Pension

Executive Directors are paid cash in lieu of pension contributions equal to 5% of their Fixed Pay (equivalent to 10% of the cash element 
of Fixed Pay). The pension cash allowance paid during 2023 was £142,958 for C.S. Venkatakrishnan and £89,375 for Anna Cross. No 
other benefits were received by Executive Directors from any Barclays' pension plan.
3) Taxable benefits

Taxable benefits include private medical cover, life assurance, income protection, tax advice and the use of a Company vehicle and 
driver when required for business purposes.

For C.S. Venkatakrishnan, the benefits figure also includes the cost to the Company of providing him with relocation support during 
2023. This is in line with the Directors' Remuneration Policy and includes immigration assistance, home search support in London, and 
temporary accommodation in London (which ended on 31 October 2023). Those costs came to c.£148,000, including the cost to 
Barclays of paying the income tax and social security resulting from the provision of that relocation support. As referenced in the 2021 
Remuneration report, temporary accommodation in London was provided to him for a period of up to two years, following his 
appointment in November 2021 as Group Chief Executive.

4) 2023 annual bonus

The bonus amounts included in the single total remuneration figures are the value awarded or scheduled to be awarded in Q1 following 
the financial year to which it relates. 

In determining the bonus in respect of 2023 performance, the Committee considered the performance achieved against the Financial 
(60% weighting) and Strategic non-financial (25% weighting) performance measures that had been set to reflect Group priorities for 
2023. Performance against each Executive Director's Personal objectives (15% weighting) for 2023 was assessed on an individual basis. 

The outcome for each of the Financial measures was determined on a straight-line basis, between the outcome for threshold 
performance – which was nil for the profit before tax measure or 20% for the cost: income ratio measure – and 100% for achievement 
of maximum performance. A summary of the assessment is provided in the following table.

Based on the assessment outlined above, the Committee determined an overall formulaic bonus outcome for C.S. Venkatakrishnan 
and Anna Cross that equates to £1,425,000, and £879,000 respectively. The Committee reflected on the appropriateness of these 
outcomes for the 2023 annual bonus, in the context of the performance achieved against the Financial measures, Strategic non-
financial measures and Personal objectives. The Committee considered the underlying financial health of the Group, which is strong 
and well-capitalised, and more holistically the performance and contribution of each Executive Director during 2023. The bonus 
outcomes were considered in the context of those for the wider workforce – ensuring appropriate alignment both this year and over a 
multi-year period – and also by comparing to historical outcomes for the Executive Directors in the context of performance each year. 
The Committee believes that the overall 2023 bonus outcomes above are aligned appropriately with stakeholder considerations and 
with the performance achieved. Based on this, the Committee concluded that no discretionary adjustment was warranted. 

In line with the Directors' Remuneration Policy, and due to the regulations prohibiting dividend equivalents being paid on unvested 
deferred share awards, the number of shares awarded to each Executive Director under the Share Value Plan (the Group's main 
employee share plan for granting deferred bonus shares to employees) will be calculated using the share price at the date of award, 
discounted to reflect the absence of dividends or dividend equivalents during the vesting period. The valuation will be aligned to IFRS 2, 
with the market expectations of dividends during the deferral period being assessed by an independent adviser.

The table below details how the 2023 annual bonus award for each Executive Director will be delivered, along with the face value of the 
2024-2026 LTIP award that will be granted alongside the deferred elements of the bonus. This shows the percentage that is in Barclays 
shares for the annual bonus, and also for variable pay overall (the annual bonus and LTIP combined). Of the annual bonus award for C.S. 
Venkatakrishnan, 86% will be delivered in Barclays shares, and 77% for Anna Cross. Including the 2024-2026 LTIP awards, a total of 96% 
of C.S. Venkatakrishnan’s 2023 variable pay will be in Barclays shares, and 94% for Anna Cross.

The deferred bonus shares in respect of the 2023 annual bonus awards will vest in two equal tranches on the first and second 
anniversaries of grant. All shares (both the upfront bonus shares and the deferred bonus shares) are also subject to a one-year holding 
period from the point of vesting. All of the 2023 variable pay is subject to clawback provisions, which allow the Committee to recover 
amounts that have been paid in certain circumstances, and the deferred elements are subject to malus provisions, which enable the 
Committee to delay or reduce the vesting of unvested amounts (including reducing to nil) in certain circumstances.

Further detail follows on the assessment of the Strategic non-financial measures, and performance against Personal objectives where 
applicable.

2025 power target

• Eight high-emitting sectors now covered by 2030 financed 
emissions reduction targets, including the three sectors for 
which new targets are being announced : Aviation, UK 
Commercial Real Estate and UK Agriculture 

• Future progress against these targets will be non-linear and 
may be volatile due to the many external dependencies and 
variables beyond Barclays’ control that may determine the 
pace of transition and impact our ability to achieve our 
targets

• Continued to reduce emissions in 2023, having achieved 
our 90% GHG market-based emissions reduction target 
for Scope 1 and Scope 2 in 2022

Ahead of track

• Continued to source 100% renewable electricity for our

• Maintained focus on improving energy efficiency and 

replacing fossil-fuel-powered infrastructure with lower-
emission alternatives 

• From 2023, new investment through LifeSkills is focused 
on targeted support for people in the most underserved 
communities and underrepresented groups

In addition to the personal objectives set for Anna Cross at the start of 2023, at times during the year she carried out some responsibilities (both 
internally and externally) that are usually performed by the Group Chief Executive, due to his illness.

The Committee recognised the high level of achievement during 2023 against these objectives, and also the additional responsibility 
taken on at times due to the Group Chief Executive's illness, as outlined in the table above. Based on Anna Cross's strong performance 
against both her individual and shared personal objectives, and her strong leadership through 2023, the Committee assessed that an 
outcome of 14% out of a maximum of 15% was appropriate. 
5) Vesting of the 2021-2023 LTIP cycle for the current Executive Directors

No LTIP awards were granted to C.S. Venkatakrishnan and Anna Cross in 2021 as they were not Executive Directors at that time.

Vesting of the 2021-2023 LTIP cycle for other participants 

Former Group Finance Director Tushar Morzaria is the only remaining participant in the 2021-2023 LTIP cycle, having been granted an 
award in March 2021 while he still served as an Executive Director. 

The Committee assessed performance against the performance conditions for that LTIP award, based on performance over the 
period from 1 January 2021 to 31 December 2023, with straight-line vesting applied between the threshold and maximum targets 
shown for the financial measures. The Committee determined that 53.2% of the award will vest, as detailed in the table that follows. 
Before finalising the vesting, the Committee considered whether this outcome was appropriate in the context of the performance 
achieved, and concluded that it was – and that no further discretionary adjustment was warranted.

The vesting portion of the award will be released in five equal annual tranches, starting from March 2024. After release, each tranche of 
shares is subject to an additional 12-month holding period.  

The value that Tushar Morzaria is expected to receive from the vesting of this award is £1,174,634, estimated (as this 2023 Annual 
Report will be finalised prior to the vesting date) using the Q4 2023 average share price of £1.4374 (which includes 18% share price 
depreciation since the date of grant). The performance achieved against the performance targets is shown in the table that follows.

assessed by the Committee to determine the percentage of the award that may vest between 0% and 20%. The 
measures are organised around three main categories and measures will likely include, but not be limited to, the 
following:  

Climate & sustainability (weighted 10%) – progress to be measured against four key objectives: progress towards 
our Sustainable and Transition Financing target; reduce our financed emissions; reduce our operational 
emissions; and support our communities

Customers & clients (weighted 5%) – drive world-class outcomes for customers and clients; Improve Net 
Promoter Scores; reduce Barclays UK customer complaints and improve resolution time; maintain client 
rankings and market share within CIB; and increase digital engagement

Colleagues (weighted 5%) – protect and strengthen our culture through our Purpose, Values and Mindset; 
Continue to improve diversity in leadership roles; improve inclusion indicators; maintain engagement at healthy 
levels; and maintain culture and conduct indicators

The Risk scorecard captures a range of risks and reflects the considerations within the incentive risk alignment 
framework shared with regulators. The current framework measures performance against three broad 
categories – Capital & liquidity, Control environment and Conduct – using a combination of quantitative and 
qualitative metrics. The framework may be updated from time to time in line with the Group’s risk strategy. 
Specific targets within each of the categories are deemed to be commercially sensitive. Retrospective narrative 
on performance will be disclosed in the 2025 Remuneration report, subject to commercial sensitivity no longer 
remaining

Annual Report 2023 217

Remuneration report (continued)

Executive Directors:
Statement of implementation of remuneration policy in 2024
An overview of how the Directors' Remuneration Policy will be implemented in 2024 is provided alongside the summary of the policy on 
page 201.
2024 Fixed Pay and market competitiveness of the Executive Directors’ total compensation opportunity

Pay benchmarking data is used as a reference point to ensure that the total compensation opportunity provided to the Executive 
Directors is appropriately positioned compared to other similar large and complex international banks.

Comparing the Executive Directors' pay solely with other UK-listed banks would not recognise the Group's global footprint and 
diversified universal banking model, which includes significant corporate banking, investment banking and global markets businesses. 
The international banking peer group used by the Committee when considering the Executive Directors' pay therefore includes other 
large universal banks from continental Europe, and the large US universal and investment banks. Around half of the peer group are US-
based, as these are among the most relevant comparators given their business mix and also form part of the peer group used internally 
when comparing the Group's performance. Barclays actively competes with those US-based peers for talent, which is reflected in 
several current and former Executive Directors having been recruited into Barclays from those firms. The Committee also recognises 
that some of those peers are larger than Barclays, and that market pay levels for executive directors of US companies are often higher 
than those of UK companies. To help maintain balance, the international banking peer group also includes the larger UK-listed banks 
most comparable to Barclays.

An annual review of the Executive Directors' Fixed Pay, in the same way and at the same time as for the wider workforce, is a feature of 
the Directors' Remuneration Policy approved by shareholders in 2023. In February 2024 the Committee reviewed the Fixed Pay for each 
Executive Director as part of the year-end pay review process for colleagues across the Group. The Committee considered the 
maximum total compensation opportunity of each Executive Director, driven by their respective levels of Fixed Pay, and noted that in 
each case the total compensation opportunity is materially less than the median of that offered for comparable roles in our 
international banking peer group. The Committee considered this relative market positioning in the context of the robust performance 
and significant personal contribution made by each of the Executive Directors, and determined that Fixed Pay would be increased by 
2.5% for both C.S. Venkatakrishnan and Anna Cross – to £2,947,000 and  £1,845,000 respectively, effective 1 March 2024. The 
Committee noted that these are lower percentage increases than the average fixed pay increase for the wider workforce, and in 
particular for UK employees within the scope of the 2024 UK pay deal with the union Unite – with a 5.55% budget for salary increases for 
junior UK employees and a 3.75% budget for other union-recognised employees. To align the Executive Directors' interests with those 
of shareholders, half of Fixed Pay for each Executive Director is delivered in shares, which are granted quarterly and released in 
instalments over five years. The other half of their Fixed Pay is delivered in cash, paid monthly via payroll in the same way as salary for 
other employees.

The following charts compare each Executive Director's maximum total compensation opportunity for 2024 against the equivalent 
opportunity across international banking peers. This shows that, even after these Fixed Pay increases, the maximum total 
compensation opportunity is significantly behind international banking peers, falling between the market lower quartile and median for 
C.S. Venkatakrishnan and slightly below lower quartile for Anna Cross. 

The charts also show a comparison of the maximum total compensation opportunity of each Executive Director with the equivalent 
roles at the companies that make up the FTSE 30 (i.e. the 30 largest FTSE 100 constituents by market capitalisation). This shows that 
the Executive Directors’ maximum total compensation opportunity is more competitive, but not inappropriate, compared to the FTSE 
30 group. The Committee noted that it would be unlikely for the Group to fill either of the Executive Director roles by recruiting from the 
other FTSE 30 companies, recognising the necessity for candidates for these roles to have the right breadth and depth of banking 
knowledge and experience – particularly given Barclays’ mix of businesses, as outlined above. However, this comparison is provided 
alongside the international banking peer group to provide additional UK context.

• Barclays and market benchmark data reflect maximum total compensation opportunity, excluding pensions and benefits.
• Benchmark data for the international banking peer group and FTSE 30 was provided by Willis Towers Watson, based on publicly disclosed data in respect of each company's 2022 or 

2022/23 financial years, incorporating assumptions where companies do not disclose a maximum total compensation opportunity.

• Barclays’ international banking peer group currently comprises the following international banks: Bank of America, BNP Paribas, Citigroup, Deutsche Bank, Goldman Sachs, HSBC 

Holdings, JPMorgan Chase & Co, Lloyds Banking Group, Morgan Stanley, Standard Chartered, and UBS Group.

2024 annual bonus performance measures

Performance measures with appropriately stretching targets were selected to cover a range of financial and non-financial goals that 
support the key strategic objectives of the Group.

For the 2024 annual bonus, slight amendments were made to the performance measures compared to the 2023 annual bonus:

–  Within the Financial measures, total operating expenses replaces cost: income ratio, reflecting the continued importance of cost 

discipline while providing a more focused and simpler measure of cost control within the year. 

–  Within the Strategic non-financial measures, the weightings for the Customers & clients and Colleagues categories are each reduced 

from 7.5% to 5%, and the weighting for the Climate & sustainability category is reduced from 10% to 5%. Those reductions 
accommodate the introduction of a Risk & operational excellence measure, weighted at 10% – reflecting the focus on risk, control 
and operational excellence.  

The other measures were largely unchanged. Performance measures and weightings are shown below:

Strategic non-financial measures 

A performance target range has been set for this financial measure, which will be disclosed in the next 
Remuneration report. Pay-out of this element will also depend on the CET1 ratio at the end of the 
performance year. In line with regulatory requirements, if the CET1 ratio is below the MDA hurdle at the 
end of the performance year, the Committee will consider what part if any of this element should pay 
out.

A performance target range has been set for this financial measure, which will be disclosed in the next 
Remuneration report. The measure is tied to a specific USD:GBP exchange rate to minimise the impact 
of FX volatility.

The evaluation will focus on a range of key metrics, with a detailed retrospective narrative on progress against each during the year. Performance 
against the measures will be assessed by the Committee to determine the percentage of the award that may vest between 0% and 25%. The 
measures are organised around four main categories and measures will likely include the following:

Climate & sustainability

Progress to be measured against four key objectives:

• Progress towards our Sustainable and Transition Financing target

• Reduce our financed emissions

• Reduce our operational emissions

• Support our communities

Customers & clients

•

Improve Net Promoter Scores

• Reduce Barclays UK customer complaints and improve resolution time

• Maintain rankings and market share within Barclays Investment Bank 

•

Note

1 Material items are defined as those large atypical one-offs that are called out in the financial reporting. As in previous years, the exclusion is not automatic, and the Committee will 

determine whether each item should be treated as material for these purposes at the time that outcomes are determined.

2024-2026 LTIP awards and performance measures

The Committee decided to grant awards under the 2024-2026 LTIP cycle to C.S. Venkatakrishnan and Anna Cross with face values at 
grant equal to 140% and 134% of Fixed Pay respectively – which will be based on Fixed Pay before applying the 1 March 2024 increases 
outlined earlier in this Remuneration report. Those maximum award multiples are in line with those for 2023. These share-based awards 
ensure alignment with future performance over the three-year assessment period, as well as share price alignment over the long 
release period (up to eight years from initial date of grant). 

For the 2024-2026 LTIP, changes were made to the financial and non-financial performance measures, compared to the 2023-2025 
LTIP cycle granted early in 2023. Within the Financial measures, the weighting of RoTE was increased slightly, from 25% to 30%, given 
that improving RoTE is a key part of the Group's priorities and revised targets, as set out in the 'Our strategy' section from page 11. This 
was accommodated via a small reduction to the weighting of relative total shareholder return from 25% to 20%. The RoTE measure is 
based on RoTE performance achieved in 2026, aligned with the Group's revised targets. This is underpinned by a requirement based on 
average RoTE across the performance period, to ensure an appropriate level of RoTE is maintained throughout.  

Within the Strategic non-financial measures, the Climate & sustainability weighting is increased from 10% to 15%. To accommodate 
this, the weighting of the risk-related measure – which this year also incorporates assessment of operational excellence – is reduced 
from 10% to 5%. The other measures are largely unchanged. 

The Group's Climate & sustainability targets are longer term, through to 2050, and progress towards these targets is expected to be 
variable and non-linear – hence the increased weighting of Climate & sustainability in the 2024-2026 LTIP and reduced weighting in the 
2024 annual bonus.

in 2021. Jes Staley was ineligible for an annual bonus in respect of 2021 after he stepped down as Group Chief Executive. 

2 The 2020 and 2019 ratios reflect the disclosed 2020 and 2019 single total figures for remuneration for Jes Staley and have not been restated for the decision made by the Committee in 

2023 that Jes Staley's unvested bonus and LTIP awards should be forfeited, as outlined earlier in the report. 

The Directors' Remuneration Report regulations provide three options that companies may use to calculate total pay for the 
employees at the 25th percentile, median and 75th percentile. Option A was selected as this is the most robust methodology, 
calculating total pay for all employees on the same basis that the single total figure for remuneration is calculated for Executive 
Directors. Total pay for each employee includes earned fixed pay, which is made up of salary, any role-based pay and relevant 
allowances, annual incentives awarded for the 2023 calendar year, and an estimate of pension and benefits for 2023 (based on what 
new UK hires at each corporate grade currently receive). Other elements of pay such as overtime and shift allowances have been 
excluded. Calculations use full-time equivalent pay data taken from our HR systems for all UK employees, for each year using the 
employee population on 31 December 2023.
Total pay and fixed pay for the UK employees at the 25th percentile, median and 75th percentile are set out in the table below.

The Group Chief Executive pay ratios for 2023 are lower than those for 2022, primarily driven by the lower 2023 annual bonus for 
C.S. Venkatakrishnan as outlined in the 2023 annual bonus outcomes section of this Remuneration report. Higher-than-normal 
employee salary increases in early 2023 as part of that year’s UK pay deal, which were weighted towards more-junior employees, also 
contributed to the lower pay ratios for 2023. 

Barclays' remuneration philosophy is set out earlier in this report, and all remuneration decisions for the Executive Directors and the 
wider workforce are made within this framework. The Group Chief Executive pay ratios are the outcomes of all of these decisions, which 
are explained in more detail in the Committee Chair’s annual statement. To ensure Executive Director remuneration outcomes are 
commensurate with those of the wider workforce, each year, when considering whether a discretionary adjustment should be made to 
the Executive Directors’ incentive outcomes, the Committee specifically considers whether the bonus and LTIP outcomes for the 
Executive Directors appropriately reflect the Group’s performance and the remuneration outcomes for the wider workforce. 

It should be noted that the ratios for 2024 are expected to increase, all other things being equal, as it will be the first year in which 
C.S. Venkatakrishnan is a participant in the LTIP cycle due to vest and be included in the single total figure for remuneration. 
C.S. Venkatakrishnan’s single total remuneration figure for 2023 does not include any LTIP value as he was not an Executive Director at 
3
. 
the time of the relevant LTIP grant

Note:

3 The LTIP that would be included in the 2023 single total figure for remuneration is the 2021-2023 LTIP cycle, under which awards were granted in March 2021, with vesting based on 

performance over the performance period 2021 to 2023.

Remuneration report (continued)

Annual percentage change in remuneration of Directors and employees

The table below shows the percentage change in the Executive Directors’ Fixed Pay, benefits and bonus each year between 2019 and 
2023, compared with the percentage change in each of those components of pay for UK-based employees of Barclays Group and for 
employees of Barclays PLC, the Group’s parent company. 

For the Executive Directors, year-on-year percentage change figures are calculated using the single total figures for remuneration, 
annualised to a full-year equivalent where the individual served as an Executive Director for only part of the year.

1 C.S. Venkatakrishnan was appointed as Group Chief Executive with effect from 1 November 2021. His remuneration figures for 2021 are annualised to a full-year equivalent for the 

purpose of this comparison. The value of his benefits includes the cost to the Group of providing him with relocation support, including immigration assistance, home search support in 
London, and payments (which ended on 31 October 2023) for temporary accommodation in London. No percentage change figures can be calculated for 2020/21 as he did not receive 
any remuneration in respect of services provided as an Executive Director in 2020.

2 Anna Cross was appointed as Group Finance Director with effect from 23 April 2022. Her remuneration figures for 2022 are annualised to a full-year equivalent for the purpose of this 
comparison. No percentage change figures can be calculated for 2021/22 as she did not receive any remuneration in respect of services provided as an Executive Director in 2021.

3 The Barclays PLC comparison is included because this is a statutory requirement, though Barclays PLC employs only a very small number of Head Office employees (51 in 2023).
4 Jes Staley's bonus figures reflect the disclosed figures and have not been restated for the decision made by the Committee in 2023 that Jes Staley should be ineligible for 2021 bonus 

and should forfeit his unvested bonus awards, as outlined earlier in this Remuneration report. 

For C.S. Venkatakrishnan and Anna Cross, the 2022 to 2023 Fixed Pay changes reflect the 3.4% and 4.3% increases agreed respectively 
for each, effective 1 March 2023. The annual bonus outcome for C.S. Venkatakrishnan is down 27% and the outcome for Anna Cross is 
down 25% (on a full-time equivalent basis) – the 2023 annual bonus outcomes section of this Remuneration report provides more 
information. The reduction in the value of benefits for C.S. Venkatakrishnan in 2023 primarily reflects his temporary accommodation in 
London ending during the year and some relocation-related benefits costs in 2022 that were not repeated in 2023.  

For UK employees across the Group, the 9% increase in median fixed pay primarily reflects higher-than-normal salary increases in early 
2023 as part of that year's UK pay deal. The 5% decrease in median bonus in respect of 2023 performance reflects the change in pay 
structure during 2023 to simplify pay for junior employees in Barclays UK and support functions in the UK. For some employees, a 
portion of previous bonus opportunity was transferred into fixed pay – leading to lower 2023 bonus outcomes for those employees. 
The 11% increase in benefits is largely due to increased life assurance and private medical insurance costs. 

Barclays PLC only employs a very small number of Head Office employees (51 in 2023), and there is frequent movement of employees 
between Barclays PLC and other entities within the Barclays Group. For comparison purposes the Barclays PLC figures are therefore 
based only on the 40 individuals who were employed by Barclays PLC in both years.

1 In the year that a Non-Executive Director was appointed to or stepped down from the Barclays PLC Board, fees for that year are annualised to a full-year equivalent. Additional 

information has been provided in the notes that follow where 2022/2023 percentage changes in fees, which excludes benefits, were greater than 10%.

2 Fees for the Group Chairman and Non-Executive Director roles on the Board and Board Committees of Barclays PLC were increased by 5%, with effect from 1 January 2023. This 

excluded the Board Sustainability Committee, which was established on 23 March 2023.

3 Mohamed A. El-Erian joined the Board Nominations Committee with effect from 1 September 2022 and received pro-rata fees for that year. For 2023, the full-year fees were paid, 

therefore increasing the fees paid from 2022 to 2023. 

4 Dawn Fitzpatrick joined the Board Sustainability Committee with effect from 23 March 2023 and received pro-rata fees for that year, therefore increasing the fees paid from 2022 to 

2023.

5 Mary Francis was appointed the BBPLC Consumer Duty Champion with effect from 10 November 2022 and received pro-rata fees for that year. For 2023, full-year fees for that role 

were paid. She  also joined the Board Sustainability Committee with effect from 23 March 2023 and received pro-rata fees for that year, therefore increasing the fees paid from 2022 to 
2023.

6 The increase in fees paid from 2022 to 2023 for Diane Schueneman was primarily driven by an increase in fees for her role as Chair of Barclays Execution Services Limited and as a Non-

Executive Director of Barclays US LLC.

7 Julia Wilson joined the Board Nominations Committee and Board Risk Committee with effect from 1 September 2022 and received pro-rata fees for that year. For 2023, the full-year 
fees for that role were paid. She also joined the Board Sustainability Committee with effect from 23 March 2023, the Barclays Bank PLC Board with effect from 1 April 2023, and the 
Board Remuneration Committee with effect from 1 July 2023. She was appointed Chair of the Board Audit Committee with effect from 1 April 2023 and Chair of the Barclays Capital 
Securities Limited Board with effect from 24 April 2023, and received pro-rata fees for that year – therefore increasing the fees paid from 2022 to 2023.

A year-on-year comparison of Group compensation costs and of distributions to shareholders is shown below. The distributions shown 
relate to dividends paid and share buyback programmes completed during the year. The distributions for 2023 do not include the

Interests in Barclays PLC shares (audited)

The table below shows the number of shares owned beneficially by each person who served as a Director during 2023 (including any 
shares owned beneficially by their connected persons). For the Executive Directors, it shows the number of shares over which each 
holds awards that are subject to either deferral terms or to deferral terms plus performance measures, and the number of shares 
owned outright includes shares purchased by the Director as well as shares received in relation to remuneration. All Barclays 
employees, including the Executive Directors, are prohibited from investment activities that may create conflicts of interest, and in 
particular from using personal hedging strategies to undermine the risk alignment effects embedded in remuneration, or any other 
hedging in respect of Barclays securities. The numbers shown for shares that are subject to performance measures represent the 
maximum number of shares that may be released if those performance measures were to be satisfied in full.

The total share interests at 16 February 2024 were the same as shown below for all Directors in service as at 31 December 2023.

Executive Directors’ shareholdings and share interests (audited)

The charts below show the value of Barclays shares held as at 31 December 2023 by C.S. Venkatakrishnan and Anna Cross, in each case 
using the Q4 2023 average Barclays ordinary share price of £1.4374.  

For C.S. Venkatakrishnan, the shareholding requirement is 233% of year-end Fixed Pay and for Anna Cross it is 224% of year-end Fixed 
Pay. C.S. Venkatakrishnan and Anna Cross have five years from their respective dates of appointment as Executive Directors to meet 
this requirement. Barclays shares held beneficially by each Executive Director count towards the shareholding requirement, as well as 
unvested shares that are not subject to performance conditions (net of estimated tax and social security).

Unvested shares that are still subject to performance conditions do not count towards the shareholding requirements, but contribute 
to aligning the Executive Directors' interests with those of shareholders through share price exposure – and are therefore shown below 
after deduction of estimated income tax and social security withholding. For the unvested shares subject to performance conditions, 
the proportion that is ultimately released may range from 0% to 100% depending on the achievement of the performance measures 
for each award, and on continued employment in accordance with the relevant plan rules and the Directors' Remuneration Policy. 

Executive Directors are issued a shareholding statement twice yearly, informing them of the shareholding requirement and the level of 
shareholding they are required to meet and maintain. After an Executive Director has stepped down, the shareholding requirement is 
monitored and maintained through self-certification, to the extent it is not met via shares held within the Group’s employee share plans 
and nominee accounts.

Advisers to the Committee

The Committee appointed PricewaterhouseCoopers (PwC) as its independent adviser in October 2017. The Committee considered 
the advice provided by PwC to the Committee during the year and was satisfied that the advice is independent and objective. PwC is a 
signatory to the voluntary code of conduct in relation to executive remuneration consulting in the UK. PwC was paid £142,000 
(excluding VAT) in fees for its advice to the Committee in 2023 relating to the remuneration of the Directors (either exclusively or along 
with other employees within the Committee’s Terms of Reference). In addition to advising the Committee, PwC provided unrelated 
consulting advice to the Group in respect of strategic advice on business, regulation, risk and controls, operational models and cost, 
taxation, technology, pensions, HR and sustainability issues.

Throughout 2023, Willis Towers Watson (WTW) provided the Committee with market data on compensation, as context when 
considering incentive levels and remuneration packages. WTW was paid £78,500 (excluding VAT) in fees for these services. In addition 
to the services provided to the Committee, WTW also provides market data on compensation for other roles below Board level, 
pensions and benefits advice and brokerage services to the Barclays Group, and administration services to a number of the Group's 
pension funds.

In the course of its deliberations, the Committee also considered the views of the Group Chairman, the Group Chief Executive, the 
Group Human Resources Director and the Group Reward and Performance Director. The Group Finance Director and the Group Chief 
Risk Officer provided regular updates on Group and business financial performance and risk profiles respectively. The Head of 
Corporate Communications attended when requested, to advise on reward communications and disclosures. The Group General, 
Counsel or other representatives from the Legal function, and the Company Secretary advised on legal and governance-related 
matters. No Barclays employee or Director participated in decisions of the Committee relating to his or her own remuneration. No 
other advisers provided services to the Committee in the year.
Committee effectiveness in 2023

The results of the Committee effectiveness review for 2023 confirm the Committee is operating effectively. It is considered to be well 
constituted and chaired, providing an effective and appropriate level of constructive challenge and oversight of the areas within its 
remit, including in respect of areas of judgement and discretion. The review highlights that the Committee is considered to have the 
right level of skills and experience, and is of an appropriate size, having benefited from the addition of new members during the year. 
Feedback indicates that the Committee is considered to operate at the right level of debate, and confirms that the allocation of time 
between agenda items in Committee meetings is appropriate, with sufficient time for discussion and challenge. 

The Committee’s interaction with the Board, Board Committees and senior management is considered effective, noting the strong 
level of support provided to the Committee by senior management, and that sufficient time is allocated at Board meetings for the Chair 
to report to the Board on the work of the Committee. The Committee’s interaction with the BBPLC and BBUKPLC Board Remuneration 
Committees was also considered effective, and operates in line with regulatory requirements.

Climate and Sustainability Governance changes during 2023

During 2023 a number of changes were made to the governance of Climate and Sustainability related matters. In particular the Board 
Sustainability Committee and the Group Sustainability Committee (GSC) were established to provide oversight of climate matters and 
the Group's sustainability agenda. The GSC has incorporated the work of the Climate and Sustainable Finance Council and oversees the 
activity of the Financed Emissions Programme, one of the three pillars of our Climate Strategy. Further details on these Committees 
can be found below. For transaction-related oversight and approval, the Transaction Review Committee has absorbed the 
responsibilities of the Climate Transaction Review Committee and reflects the business-as-usual approach to reviewing transactions.

oversight of climate-related risks 
and opportunities

Barclays PLC Board 

The Board and, as appropriate, its 
Committees are responsible for the 
oversight of climate and sustainability 
matters, including climate-related risks 
and opportunities.

During 2023, the Board received six 
climate-related updates. These covered 
matters such as progress against our 
climate strategy, progress against targets 
and target setting, and stakeholder 
engagement. Outside of formal Board 
briefings, the Group Head of Public Policy 
and Corporate Responsibility also engaged 
with Board members on matters relating 
to the Group’s climate strategy. Please see 
the Key Board activities section on page 
153 for further detail about what the Board 
considered in relation to climate and 
sustainability matters in 2023.

The Board is supported in its work by its 
Committees, each of which has its own 
Committee terms of reference setting out 
its remit and decision-making powers. The 
Chairs of each of the Board Committees 
provide a report on the work of their 
Committee at every scheduled Board 
meeting. 
Board Sustainability Committee 
During 2023, the Board Sustainability

climate strategy and also received an 
update from the Head of Climate Risk. The 
Committee received a teach-in from the 
Risk function, providing an overview of how 
climate change was driving financial and 
operational risks, the materiality of their 
impact and how Barclays was managing 
them through the Climate Principal Risk 
Framework. The Committee also received 
three Climate risk dashboards during the 
year, updating the Committee with key 
Climate risk metrics. Please refer to page 
174 for further detail on the work of the 
Board Risk Committee.
Board Audit Committee 

The Board Audit Committee provides 
oversight of the climate and sustainability 
disclosures within the Group's narrative 
reporting, receiving input also from the 
Board Sustainability Committee on those

The performance measures for the 2024 
annual bonus and 2024-2026 Long Term 
Incentive Plan awards for the Executive 
Directors include a 'Climate and 
sustainability' category, focusing on 
climate-related measures reflecting our 
ambition to be a net zero bank by 2050, 
including our commitment to align our 
financing with the goals and timelines of 
the Paris Climate Agreement. The 
measures include progress towards our 
Sustainable and Transition Financing 
target, reducing financed emissions and

During 2023, the Board Sustainability 
Committee and Group Sustainability 
Committee, a sub-committee of the 
Group Executive Committee, each 
received a briefing on nature and 
biodiversity delivered by an external 
organisation. The sessions covered 
nature-related policy and regulatory

ESG Governance (continued)

Management's role in assessing 
and managing climate-related 
risks and opportunities 

Oversight and management of Barclays' 
climate strategy is increasingly embedded 
in business-as-usual management 
structures, including a number of 
executive committees. These committees 
are mandated and form part of Barclays’ 
formal governance architecture. They are 
convened to oversee a specific attribute of 
the Barclays control framework. Each 
committee is itself governed by Terms of 
Reference that lay out the duties, 
decision-making authority and escalation 
route of any material issues.

The executive management committees 
receive regular briefings on matters 
including climate change. Both risks and 
opportunities are considered by 
management. Climate-related risks are 
assessed and escalated as appropriate 
through the various risk forums. In 2023 
the Group Sustainability Committee was 
established as a dedicated forum to 
identify and discuss climate-related 
matters across the Group with a specific 
mandate to review and propose 
amendments to the Group Climate 
strategy prior to consideration by Group 
ExCo.
Group Executive Committee 
(Group ExCo)

Throughout 2023 Group ExCo has been 
provided with regular updates on our 
climate strategy, including progress on our 
commitments, stakeholder engagement 
and expectations, and target-setting.  

The Group Head of PPCR is a member of 
Group ExCo and is accountable for 
ensuring the Group’s societal purpose is 
present in strategic decision-making at the 
highest levels in the organisation. The 
Group Head of PPCR, and their team, 
regularly updates Group ExCo on a range 
of Public Policy and Corporate 
Responsibility matters, covering key 
government and regulatory policy, 
regulator engagement and ESG matters, 
including climate. In particular, the Group 
Head of PPCR provided updates on the 
Climate strategy including proposed 
amendments to the oil and gas policy and 
the establishment of new targets for 
aviation, agriculture and commercial real 
estate. Updates were also provided on a 
range of other matters, such as 
greenwashing, deforestation and 
biodiversity.

The Chief Risk Officer is a member of 
Group ExCo and is accountable for the 
approach to managing climate-related 

financial and operational risks to Barclays; 
this is implemented within the Group's
Enterprise Risk Management Framework 
(ERMF). 

During 2023, Group ExCo established the 
Group Sustainability Committee to advise 
and provide recommendations on a broad 
range of sustainability issues as further 
described in the Climate and Sustainability 
Governance section of this report. Group 
ExCo was presented with updates on the 
proposed policy for upstream oil & gas 
financing. 
Capturing the opportunity as we transition 
towards a low-carbon economy was 
identified as a key strategic growth pillar for 
Barclays in 2022 and informed the setting 
of a $1trn Sustainable and Transition 
Financing target by the end of 2030. In 
2023, a Group sustainable finance strategy 
was developed by the new CIB Global Head 
of Sustainable Finance and the BUK Head 
of Social Purpose & Sustainable Finance, 
setting out areas of strategic focus for the 
group in delivering the $1trn target. The 
strategy was presented to Group ExCo 
and Group Board. 
All submissions to the Barclays PLC Board 
on Climate Strategy and climate-related 
matters are reviewed either by Group 
ExCo or the relevant Group ExCo member 
in advance. 

Executive Remuneration

Annual bonus outcomes and Long 
Term Incentive Plan (LTIP) award 
outcomes for the Executive Directors 
of Barclays PLC are assessed against a 
framework of measures set by the 
Remuneration Committee at the start 
of the performance period for each 
award. A proportion of both annual 
bonus and LTIP is driven by non-
financial performance measures, 
including measures relating to climate 
and sustainability. 

The weighting of the Climate and 
sustainability category is 15% in the 
2024-2026 LTIP and 5% in the 2024 
annual bonus. The climate-related 
measures reflect our ambition to be a 
net zero bank by 2050, including our 
commitment to align our financing with 
the goals and timelines of the Paris 
Climate Agreement. The measures 
include progress towards our 
Sustainable and Transition Financing 
target, reducing financed emissions 
and operational emissions, and 
supporting our communities.
Further details can be found in our 
+
Remuneration report from page 191.

Group Sustainability Committee (GSC)

The Group Sustainability Committee 
(GSC), a sub-committee of Group ExCo, is 
chaired by the Group Head of PPCR with 
senior representation from the Group 
Head of Sustainability, Head of Sustainable 
Finance  for CIB and Head of Social 
Purpose and Sustainable Finance for 
Barclays UK, as well as members 
representing key functions across the 
Group.

The GSC is responsible for recommending 
the overall Group sustainability strategy for 
approval by Group ExCo, and ensuring 
alignment of business unit climate 
strategies to the overall strategy. The GSC 
is also responsible for determining, 
agreeing or recommending position 
statements, frameworks, targets, relevant 
disclosures and advocacy areas necessary 
to support strategy delivery and agreeing 
the strategic change priorities to support 
overall sustainability strategy.
Group Risk Committee (GRC)

The GRC is the designated forum to review 
and recommend, where necessary, 
submissions to the BRC. The GRC is the 
most senior risk executive body, and it 
monitors Principal Risks and key topics 
material to Barclays such as climate 
change. In 2023, in relation to climate, the 
GRC reviewed:

• key regulatory, global policy and 

geopolitical themes and management 
action proposed and taken

• physical and transition risk metrics, 

including portfolio alignment progress 
against net zero sector targets and 
mitigation plans

• the Climate Risk Framework and Climate 

Risk Appetite constraints

• scenario theme, severity and results of 
the climate stress test and internal 
stress test, including implications on 
stress loss limits

In relation to Principal Risks, the GRC 
undertakes the following: 

• review and monitor the risk profile of 
material nature for each Principal Risk

• approve for consideration by Barclays 
PLC Board and BBPLC Board Risk 
Committee the Risk Appetite 
Statement for each Principal Risk

• annually review and approve the 
Principal Risk Framework for 
consideration by the Barclays PLC Board 
and BBPLC Board Risk Committee. 

The GRC receives escalations from the 
Climate Risk Committee, noting none were 
received in 2023

forums and reports 

Business / Legal Entity committees / 
forums

Oversight and management of climate-
related risks and opportunities occur at a 
number of levels in the organisation and 
across business lines and legal entities.

Barclays operates through a combination 
of formal mandated committees and 
governance bodies/forums. The 

mandated committee structure operates 
on a legal entity basis and will oversee 
climate-related issues relevant to that 
entity.

These are supported by Subcommittees/
other governance bodies/forums which 
can operate on a legal entity basis or 
across the Group and oversee climate-
related issues, risks and opportunities 
within their remit and escalate material 
issues as appropriate. These committees 
and forums follow the established 
escalation process for climate-related 
items, bringing updates first to the relevant 
Group ExCo member, then the Group 
ExCo, and ultimately to the Board.
Operational Sustainability Steering 
Committee (OSSCo)

Barclays’ Operational Sustainability 
Steering Committee (OSSCo) is 
responsible for the development and 
implementation of the Group’s net zero 
operations strategy. 

OSSCo is chaired by the Barclays 
Execution Services (BX) Chief Operating 
Officer and comprises leadership from 
Corporate Real Estate Solutions (CRES) & 
Location Strategy, Barclays UK, 
Procurement and Sourcing, Group 
Technology Infrastructure Services (GTIS), 
Corporate Communications, Group 
Sustainability & ESG, and Legal. OSSCo 
reviews and approves environmental 
operational targets, reviews operational 
sustainability programmes and mitigates 
risks to the delivery of the net zero 
operations strategy. OSSCo also facilitates 
coordination and alignment across the 
functions responsible for implementing 
the net zero operations strategy. 

OSSCo provides updates to the GSC every 
quarter, which then reports to the Barclays 
PLC Board twice a year.
BBplc Transaction Review Committee 

The BBplc Transaction Review Committee 
(TRC) is convened for senior management 
to review all BBplc Transactions that 
contain material Reputation Risk and 
escalates directly to the Group Reputation 
Risk Committee. The TRC has 
responsibility to ensure alignment with 
local entity and regulatory expectations 
and requirements when making decisions 
that impact the various subsidiaries of 
BBplc, including Barclays Bank Ireland PLC 
('Barclays Europe') and the US 
Intermediate Holding Company. 
Transactions reviewed include 
transactions, relationships, agreements, 
strategies and other business activities.

Principal Investments Equity Committee 

The Principal Investments Equity 
Committee (the “Committee”) undertakes 
the senior approval responsibilities relating 
to the execution and management of all 
principal strategic equity and workout 
equity transactions managed on behalf of 
Barclays PLC and all other Barclays Group 
entities. The formation and authority of 
this Committee comes from the Group 
CEO, acting through the Group ExCo. The 
Committee consists of senior 
stakeholders who meet on a regular basis 
which, when considering the ‘Sustainable 
Impact Capital’ portfolio, includes the 
Global Head of Sustainable Finance and 
Group Head of Sustainability for CIB.
Financed Emissions Programme

The Group change programme on climate 
('the programme') is focused on driving the 
execution of one of the three pillars of our 
Climate Strategy, ‘Reducing our Financed 
Emissions’, within which Barclays is 
committed to aligning its financing with the 
goals and timelines of the Paris 
Agreement, consistent with scenarios 
limiting the increase in global 
temperatures to 1.5°C. The programme is 
set up in line with the Barclays Change 
Delivery Management standard, with 
established governance and regular 
reporting at the GSC. The overall 
Accountable Executive of the programme 
is the Group Head of Sustainability, also 
the chair of its governance body 
represented by key businesses and 
functions across the Group, such as 
Sustainability & ESG, Risk, Business 
(Corporate and Investment Bank and 
Barclays UK), Finance and Technology.

Key focus areas of the programme since 
its inception include setting targets for 
some of our highest emitting sectors, 
establishing Climate risk as a new Principal 
Risk (as part of the Enterprise Risk 
Management Framework), embedding 
required processes and frameworks within 
the business to implement and manage 
sector targets, evaluating absolute 
emissions across the in-scope balance 
sheet, and delivering to a technology 
roadmap to meet climate data 
requirements.

Managing impacts in lending and financing

Appropriate management of environmental and social impacts helps to 
ensure the longevity of our business and our ability to serve our clients. 
Enhanced Due Diligence

Monitoring

At Barclays, we recognise the importance 
of risk identification and management in 
the provision of financial services to our 
customers and clients.

Our assessment of environmental and 
social risks informs our wholesale credit 
risk management and helps safeguard our 
reputation. This supports the longevity of 
our business and also enhances our ability 
to serve our clients and support them in 
improving their own sustainability practices 
and disclosures.
Managing environmental and 
social risks

Environmental and social risks are 
governed and managed through our 
Enterprise Risk Management Framework 
(ERMF), setting our strategic approach for 
risk management by defining standards, 
objectives and responsibilities for all areas 
of Barclays. The ERMF is complemented 
by a number of other frameworks, policies 
and standards, all of which are aligned to 
individual Principal Risks. 

Our Climate Change Statement sets out 
our current restrictions on business 
appetite and includes restrictions in 
respect of certain sensitive energy 
subsectors (thermal coal mining, coal-fired 
power generation, mountain-top coal 
removal, upstream oil & gas and 
unconventional oil & gas including oil 
sands, Arctic oil & gas, hydraulic fracturing 
('fracking'), Amazon oil & gas, ultra-deep 
water and extra heavy oil), as well as 
referencing new enhanced due diligence  
requirements for biomass which will be 
introduced during 2024.   
We have also established positions on 
Forestry and Agricultural Commodities, 
World Heritage and Ramsar Wetlands and 
on the Defence and Security sector. In 
addition, we have developed internal 
standards for each of these which reflect 
these positions in more detail.

These standards, which sit under the 
management of Reputation risk in the 
ERMF, determine our approach to climate 
change and relevant sensitive sectors and 
are considered as part of our existing 
transaction origination, review and 
approval process.

Our standards currently include an 
enhanced due diligence approach for 
certain clients operating in the following 
energy sub-sectors covered by our 
Climate Change Statement: thermal coal 
mining, coal-fired power generation, 
mountain-top coal removal, oil sands, 
Arctic oil & gas and hydraulic fracturing 
('fracking') and clients in-scope of our 
Forestry and Agricultural Commodities, 
World Heritage Sites and Ramsar Wetlands 
and Defence and Security standards where 
a similar approach is taken. This approach 
will be extended to cover the additional 
sectors brought into scope of the updated 
Climate Change Statement.

All clients in-scope of the above 
mentioned  standards must be assessed 
annually via a detailed Sustainability 
enhanced due diligence questionnaire, 
which is used to evaluate their 
performance on a range of environmental 
and social issues and may be 
supplemented by a review of client 
policies / procedures, further client 
engagement and adverse media checks as 
appropriate. This annual review either 
generates an Environmental and Social 
Impact (ESI) risk rating (low, medium, high), 
or in the case of Defence and Security an 
assessment against risk appetite, which in 
turn determines whether further review 
and client engagement may be required 
throughout the year. 

High and certain medium ESI rated clients 
would require further risk assessment prior 
to execution of transactions with those 
clients.

We undertook 593 (2022:597) reviews in 
2023, being a combination of Sustainability 
annual due diligence reviews and individual 
transaction reviews. Environmental risk 
reviews are captured within the business-
as-usual credit process and are therefore 
no longer included within this number.

As part of our management of 
environmental and social risks, we may 
require further client engagement in 
relation to the specific environmental and 
social risks that we have identified as part 
of our enhanced due diligence process. 

We have used this engagement as an 
opportunity to gain a more detailed 
understanding of the risks and challenges 
that the client is facing and to better 
understand any climate transition plan that 
they may have.
Escalation and decision-making

Where client relationships or transactions 
are assessed as higher-risk (high or 
medium ESI rating) or outside appetite (in 
the case of Defence and Security) 
following a Sustainability enhanced due 
diligence review, they are then considered 
for escalation to the appropriate business 
unit review committee (e.g. BBplc 
Transaction Review Committee) for 
consideration and a decision on whether to 
proceed if transaction related. Business 
unit review committees comprise of 
Business management and 
representatives from the control 
functions, including Reputation risk.

Should the front office business team or 
the Sustainability and ESG team believe 
the issues are sufficiently material, these 
clients/relationships would be escalated to 
the Group Reputation Risk Committee 
(GRRC) for more senior consideration and 
decision.

GRRC includes representation from the 
Group Executive Committee. 

These Committees may make the 
following determinations:

• approve the transaction or relationship

• reject the transaction or relationship

• approve the transaction or relationship, 
subject to prescribed modifications

• escalate the review of the transaction or 
relationship to the Barclays Group CEO.

Equator Principles

For project-related finance, we conduct 
assessments for environmental and social 
risks in line with the Equator Principles and 
relevant International Finance Corporation 
(IFC) Performance Standards. Barclays was 
one of the four banks that contributed to 
developing the Principles ahead of their 
launch in 2003. During 2023, 4 
transactions (2022: 1 transaction) were 
reviewed for social and environmental risks 
under the scope of the Equator Principles.

ESG Governance (continued)

Supporting our supply chain
With nearly 9,0001 companies 
coming from 29 countries supplying 
us, our supply chain helps our 
businesses deliver for our 
customers, clients and colleagues.

Though our businesses are geographically 
2 
diverse, more than 92%
of our third-party 
spending is concentrated in the UK and the 
US with many of them having their own 
extensive supply chains.

Our supply base is diverse across scale, 
ownership type and structure from 
privately-held start-ups to publicly-listed 
multinational corporations. Over the past 
several years, Barclays has sought to 
reduce the size of its supply chain while at 
the same time creating opportunities for 
3
 which encompass micro, 
diverse suppliers
small or medium-sized enterprises and 
4
diverse-owned
 businesses.

Third party operational and 
reputational risk management

Barclays Directors, via management, must 
effectively manage, monitor and mitigate 
risks in our supply chain. We expect our 
Third Party Service Providers (TPSP) to 
make responsible decisions that, where 
relevant, take our stakeholders` needs into 
account in both the short and long term.

Barclays expects the TPSPs to comply with 
applicable laws, regulations and standards 
within the geographies in which they 
5
 to 
operate. Barclays` standard approach
new TPSP on-boarding and renewal begins 
by assessing the services that are being 
provided and ascertaining the level of risk. 
TPSPs that are assessed as being above a 
low risk of exposure from a business risk 
perspective (at the point of onboarding 
and on an ongoing basis) are subject to 

Barclays` Supplier Control obligations 
(SCOs). TPSPs to whom the SCOs apply 
become managed TPSPs and are subject 
to ongoing management and controls 
assurance during the term of service. Prior 
to contractual agreement and service go 
live, these TPSPs are required to complete 
a pre-contractual questionnaire which 
captures their adherence to the SCOs and 
Barclays` TPSP Code of Conduct (TPSP 
CoC). The TPSP CoC encourages our 
TPSPs to adopt our approach to doing 
business and details our expectations for 
matters including environmental 
management, human rights, diversity and 
inclusion and also for living the Barclays 
Values. 

Managed TPSPs are subject to controls 
assurance on an annual basis to assess 
whether the controls required of them 
under the SCOs are maintained and 
operating effectively. They are also asked 
to complete an annual self-certification 
against the individual topics contained 
within the TPSP CoC. Where TPSPs are 
unable to meet our expectations under the 
TPSP CoC and SCOs, the issue will be 
escalated and we will look for options to 
manage the risk, which may include 
additional oversight, heightened Barclays 
controls or electing not to do business with 
the TPSP. The TPSP CoC and SCOs are 
published on the Barclays public website 
for all new and existing suppliers to view 
and are refreshed periodically.
Notes

1 Includes non-addressable spend and One Time 

Vendors (OTV).
2 92% by invoice value
3 Spending between Barclays and diverse suppliers is 
considered first-tier spending. Spending between 
Barclays’ first-tier suppliers that can trace 
subcontracted spend with diverse suppliers on 
Barclays-specific work is considered second-tier direct 
spending.

4 For Barclays, diverse suppliers are defined as either size 

diverse (small and medium sized enterprises) or 
ownership diverse (majority owned, controlled and 
operated by protected class groups, such as women, 
ethnic minorities, LGBT+, persons with disabilities, 
military veterans and for-profit social enterprises)
5  We do have relationships with financial institutions and 
market counterparties which, because of the nature of 
the services being provided (such as international 
account holding services), are not subject to our usual 
TPSP on-boarding procedures and which are therefore 
not subject to the TPSP CoC.

+

Please see further details on our climate change initiatives 
in our supply chain within our Achieving net zero 
operations section from page 73 within the Climate and 
Sustainability report.

Payment on time

Prompt payment is critical to the cash flow 
of every business, and especially to smaller 
businesses within the supply chain as cash 
flow issues are a major contributor to 
business failure. We aim to pay our TPSPs 
within clearly defined terms, and to help 
ensure there is a proper process for 
dealing with any issues that may arise. We 

measure prompt payment globally by 
calculating the percentage of TPSP spend 
paid within 45 days following invoice date. 

The measurement applies against all 
invoices by value over a three-month 
rolling average period for all entities where 
invoices are managed centrally. At the end 
of 2023, we achieved 93% on-time 
payment to our TPSPs compared to 93% 
at the end of 2022, exceeding our public 
commitment to pay 85% of TPSPs on time 
(by invoice value).

The need to promptly pay our diverse 
TPSPs became even more important 
during the COVID-19 pandemic. Barclays 
established a process to expedite the 
payments for diverse TPSPs at this critical 
time. This process remained in place 
during 2023. 

Barclays is proud to be a signatory of the 
Prompt Payment Code in the UK and we 
also work closely with the Small Business 
Commissioner and other organisations, 
including Good Business Pays, to educate 
the public on late payments and the impact 
they can have on businesses and business 
owners, and to raise the social conscience 
of larger businesses who do not pay on 
time. 
Diversity, Equity and 
Inclusion in our supply chain

Barclays believes that diversity across our 
supply chain expands our ability to attract 
and harness innovative solutions in the 
market that complement our own 
capabilities, while simultaneously creating 
value for customers and clients, and 
economic opportunities for wider, under-
represented segments of society. This is 
why we launched our first Global Supplier 
Diversity (GSD) initiative, now celebrating 
10 years of impact since 2013. The GSD 
initiative aims to position Barclays as a 
leader in providing inclusive procurement 
opportunities and driving economic impact 
to diverse businesses – diverse in size, 
ownership make-up or mission.

As part of our GSD initiative in 2023, 8.5% 
1
of our global addressable spend
 was 
placed with small and medium-sized 
enterprises and diverse-owned 
businesses as measured by first- and 
second-tier direct spending. First-tier 
suppliers are contracted directly by 
Barclays and second-tier direct suppliers 
are subcontractors to first-tier suppliers 
on Barclays-specific work. Ownership-
diverse businesses are majority owned, 
controlled and operated by protected 
class groups, such as women, ethnic 
minorities, LGBT+, persons with 
disabilities, military veterans and for-profit 
social enterprises. In 2023, we added a new

diverse supplier category of mission-
diverse, also known as social enterprises. 
Though a small segment of our diverse 
supplier spend, we will recognise and 
account for spend with businesses that are 
driven primarily by a social mission where 
they do not already qualify as small or 
ownership-diverse.

In support of the GSD initiative, Barclays is 
a corporate member of, and plays an 
important role with, several of the most 
prominent domestic and international 
diverse supplier certification organisations 
including National Minority Supplier 
Development Council (nmsdc.org), 
Minority Supplier Development UK 
(msduk.org.uk), Women’s Business 
Enterprise National Council (wbenc.org), 
WeConnect International 
(weconnectinternational.org), National 
LGBTQ Chamber of Commerce 
(nglcc.org), OutBritain (outbritain.co.uk), 
National Veteran Owned Businesses 
Association (NaVoba.org) and Disability:IN 
(disabilityIn.org).

In 2021, we pledged to double our spend 
with Black and women-owned businesses 
by 2025, with 2020 as the baseline year, 
and to grow overall spend with SMEs and 
diverse-owned businesses to 10% of 
Barclays annual global addressable spend. 
As of 2023, we are tracking to plan to 
double spend with Black and women-
owned businesses by 2025 and to meet 
the overall 10% diverse supplier spend 
goal. 

As we institutionalise DEI across our supply 
chain, the aim is for service providers, 
which make up 70% of our addressable 
spend to have a diversity and inclusion 
policy or standard in place by 2025. We are 
continuing to engage and assess our 
suppliers and will report against our 
progress in the future.
Note

1 Addressable spend is defined as external costs incurred 
by Barclays in the normal course of business where 
Procurement has influence over where the spend is 
placed. It excludes costs such as regulatory fines or 
charges, exchange fees, taxation, employee expenses 
or litigation costs, property rent.

Modern slavery in our supply 
chain

Barclays is committed to trying to identify 
and seeking to address modern slavery 
risks in our supply chain.

Regardless of the industry or geography in 
which our Third Party Service Providers 
(TPSP) operate, we require them to 
comply with applicable laws and 
regulations. We describe our standard 
process of TPSP onboarding and renewal 
in the "Third Party operational and 
reputational risk management" section 
above. 

TPSPs that are assessed as being above a 
low risk of exposure from a business risk 
perspective become managed TPSPs and 
are requested to complete an annual self-
attestation against topics contained within 
our TPSP Code of Conduct (TPSP CoC).

The TPSP CoC identifies our expectations 
with regards to respecting human rights 
through areas such as occupational health 
and safety, freely chosen employment, 
avoidance of child labour and practices 
which could lead to exploitation of workers, 
freedom of religion and belief in the 
workplace, freedom of association and 
collective bargaining, zero tolerance for 
discrimination, harassment and abuse, 
accessible grievance and whistleblowing 
mechanisms. These expectations (which 
relate to human rights topics) are an 
important part of our efforts to meet our 
responsibility to respect human rights.

We continue to strengthen the way we 
identify and assess modern slavery and we 
describe the ways we aim to do this in our 
Modern Slavery Statement.

We are continuing to work with our TPSPs 
to support our ambition that those making 
1
 will have 
up 70% of our addressable spend
a modern slavery policy or standard in 
place by 2025.
Note

1 Addressable spend is defined as external costs incurred 
by Barclays in the normal course of business where 
Procurement has influence over where the spend is 
placed. It excludes costs such as regulatory fines or 
charges, exchange fees, taxation, employee expenses 
or litigation costs, property rent.

Human rights 

Barclays continues to take action to 
enhance and further embed our approach 
to respecting human rights.

During 2023 we worked towards two 
important milestones for our human 
rights work. 

We completed a saliency assessment of 
human rights risks in our Corporate and 
Investment Bank (CIB) financing portfolio to 
guide our next steps in enhancing the CIB 
approach to managing human rights risks.

Insights from the saliency assessment 
informed updates to Barclays' Statement 
on Human Rights, which we published 
alongside this Annual Report. The 
Statement seeks to reflect our evolving 
approach to human rights and align with the 
relevant normative frameworks, in particular 
the UN Guiding Principles on Business and 
Human Rights (UNGPs). 

The Statement reiterates our commitment 
to respecting human rights as defined in the 
International Bill of Human Rights and the 
International Labour Organization’s (ILO) 
Declaration on Fundamental Principles and 
Rights at Work (ILO Declaration). Our 
approach is guided by the UNGPs and the 
OECD Guidelines for Multinational 
Enterprises on Responsible Business 
Conduct. It also incorporates our Focus 
Areas for Progress, which set out our plans 
to enhance our approach to respecting 
human rights. 

In addition, during 2023 we continued our 
efforts to monitor issues and developments 
globally that may present new or elevated 
human rights risks and worked to evaluate 
our potential involvement and consider our 
responsibilities to seek to address, 
these risks. 

We also continued to embed human rights 
considerations into our position statements 
and related enhanced due diligence 
approach. For example, in our Forestry and 
Agricultural Commodities Statement we 
have introduced a requirement for in-scope 
clients to have a policy commitment to 
respect human rights across their 
operations and supply chain and the 
expectation that they undertake human 
rights due diligence across their operations 
and supply chain.

Notes:

Climate change presents a number of physical risks and its impacts are varied and 
multifaceted. For example, sea level rise and extreme weather can threaten the 
rights to housing, to adequate standard of living, to food and water; and predicted 
increases in disease impact right to health. The transition from fossil fuels to low 
carbon energy is not without its own risks and challenges, climate change 
mitigation activities can contribute to impacts such as job losses and energy 
scarcity for communities who depend on fossil fuels. The development of clean 
energy sources can also have human rights impacts including exploitative land 
and labour practices as well as impact vulnerable communities like Indigenous 
Peoples. 

International law guarantees the rights of Indigenous Peoples, including traditional 
lands, cultural preservation, livelihoods, knowledge,  security and their right to give 
or withhold their consent for any action that would affect their lands, territories or 
rights (Free Prior and Informed Consent (FPIC)).Indigenous Peoples' rights are 
increasingly being threatened, particularly in relation to the activities of certain 
sectors such as extractive, energy, and agriculture. The transition to renewable 
energy could exacerbate these impacts; recent research suggests that over half 
of energy transition metals and minerals projects are located on or near 
1
.
Indigenous Peoples' lands

Business practices such as community relocation and resettlements are not 
uncommon in certain sectors, such as mining and agriculture, and can impact a 
range of human rights, including the right to adequate housing, food, water, 
health, education, and decent work. Resistance and protest against resettlement 
or other potential infringements of land-related rights by human rights defenders 
and local communities could also expose people to risk of additional adverse 
impacts such as suppression of freedom of association, detention or even 
physical harm. 

An estimated 50 million people were living in situations of modern slavery on any 
2
given day in 2021, according to the latest Global Estimates of Modern Slavery
. 
Modern slavery violates all human rights relating to decent work. However, 
modern slavery can also impact a multitude of other rights, for example to health, 
family life, freedom of movement, and even freedom from torture, cruel, inhuman 
or degrading treatment. The impacts of modern slavery can be severe and lasting, 
and this issue is prevalent in all geographies and most sectors. 

Technologies associated with the Defence and Security sector are continuously 
developing. This includes advancements such as autonomous weapons and dual-
use technology which could be used in a multitude of applications including in 
weapons and surveillance technology. Weapons and dual use technologies, if 
misused, have the potential to cause some of the most severe human rights 
violations, in particular, in the context of repressive state action or conflict.

Barclays worked with Shift, a non-profit and 
leading centre of expertise on business and 
human rights, and gathered a range of 
perspectives through engagement with 
both internal and external stakeholders, to 
seek to understand the most salient human 
rights risks to people connected to the CIB 
financing portfolio. 

We recognise that engagement, including 
with credible proxies for affected 
stakeholders, is essential to developing our 
understanding of the actual and potential 
human rights risks and enhancing the 
robustness and legitimacy of the process. 

In our external engagement, we engaged 
with ten civil society organisations (CSOs), 
selected by reference to their previous 
contact with Barclays in relation to human 
rights issues, and/or their recognised 
expertise, in particular, on the intersection 
between financial institutions and human 
rights. Engagement took place through a 
series of focused discussions, mostly 
facilitated by Shift. 

Our internal engagement included a series 
of workshops with colleagues from a range 
of functions including Sustainability, Risk, 
Compliance, Legal and the business and 
across the US, UK and APAC, followed by  
deep dive interviews with some of these 
colleagues. 

The insights gathered during this proactive 
engagement, complemented by insights 
from previous relevant engagement with 
CSOs, as well as desk-based research by 
the Barclays Social Policy team and Shift, 
informed the identification of a long list of 
human rights impacts.

These impacts were then prioritised, 
through consideration of the relative 
severity of the impacts on people and their 
likelihood of occurrence, to produce a 
shortlist. This list and related analysis were 
presented to core stakeholders to review 
and test the application of the severity and 
likelihood criteria to finalise our five salient 
human rights issues, as set out in the table 
at right.

respect for human 
rights 

• Build capacity to 

support colleagues’ 
understanding of 
human rights risks 
and responsibilities

Saliency 
Assessments

Identify salient issues 
beyond CIB 

• Extend saliency 

assessment to other 
areas of the bank, 
looking to engage 
with internal and 
external stakeholders

Focus Areas for Progress

Policies   
and EDD

Just           
Transition

Remedy

Develop our approach to 
remedy

• Explore approach to 

remedy in engagement 
with clients 

Enhance sustainability 
policies and EDD to 
reflect salient issues for 
CIB

• Review existing 

sustainability policies 
and EDDs and work to 
integrate salient issues

opportunities

• Work to consider just 

transition in our 
Transition Plan and 
Client Transition 
Framework 

• Continue engagement 
to help shape the way 
just transition is defined 
and implemented in 
practice

Corporate culture

We aim to take steps to build capacity to 
support colleagues' understanding of 
human rights risks and responsibilities by 
providing tailored training and guidance. 
Saliency assessments 

Taking an approach based on a risk-to-
people lens, we prioritised CIB as an area 
for review. Our aim is to continue to 
identify the salient human rights impacts 
we may be connected to through our 
operations and value chain. We aim to 
initiate further saliency assessments, 
incorporating engagement with 
appropriate stakeholders.  

Policies and enhanced due 
diligence

Our aim is to enhance our existing position 
statements and associated enhanced due 
diligence processes to better reflect the 
salient human rights issues identified 
through our assessment of CIB. 
Additionally, in response to analysis of our 
exposure to salient issues through our CIB 
financing portfolio, we may consider the 
development of additional position 
statements. To build on our risk 
identification and assessment, we aim to 
develop a pilot for engaging with clients in 
response to the salient risks identified. 
Just transition

Barclays seeks to support a just transition 
which accounts for the potential social 
risks as well as opportunities of the energy 
transition and seeks effective dialogue 
with relevant stakeholders. 

We have taken steps to pilot the approach 
to just transition in our Client Transition 
Framework, and will consider the findings 
of the pilot in our engagement with clients. 
We also intend to include social 
considerations as we develop our 
transition plan.   

We believe that industry engagement is 
essential to advance our collective 
understanding and strategy to ensure a 
just transition. As such we intend to 
continue to work with peers and industry 
groups, and we have become founding 
members of the LSE Just Transition 
Finance Lab to help shape the way just 
transition is defined and implemented in 
the financial sector.
+

For more information on our approach to just 
transition, please see page 124.

Remedy

We recognise the importance of remedy in 
the context of human rights and aim to 
develop our understanding of good 
practice in this area. We will look to explore 
approaches to remedy through our 
engagement with our clients.

Supporting customers 
through Barclays UK

Barclays has a large retail presence 
in the UK, offering a wide range of 
products and services to c.20 million 
customers through Barclays UK.

We recognise that there is a heightened 
need to help customers who may be 
experiencing financial vulnerability due to 
the inflationary pressures on household 
budgets and increased interest rates. We 
are endeavouring to support customers 
during these challenging times, and during 
2023 have continued to focus on four key 
areas:

1.using data analytics to determine which 
customers are in need of support and 
the appropriate type of support; 

2.engaging those customers impacted to 
increase awareness of products, tools 
and support available; 

3.understanding customers’ needs and 

developing solutions to provide greater 
support; and 

4.ensuring colleagues have, and are aware 
of, the financial health tools to enable 
them to support customers. 

To better support financially vulnerable 
customers, we have enhanced our 
Barclays' tools, training, support and 
systems, continuing to improve our 
ongoing support when customers need us 
the most. 

In July 2023 Barclays implemented support 
measures following the introduction of the 
Mortgage Charter by HMT. These 
measures provided residential mortgage 
customers, who are up to date with their 
payments, with a range of support options 
which included:

• The ability to apply to extend the term of 
their mortgage to reduce their monthly 
payment amount .

• Apply to switch their mortgage from 

repayment to interest only for a period 
of 6 months to temporarily reduce their 
monthly payment amount.

Barclays continued a nationwide 
engagement campaign into 2023, 
providing practical support and guidance 
to the cost of living crisis. Launching at the 
end of 2022 and reaching across 254 local 
and national commercial radio stations; in 
print across 12 major national dailies and 
26 major regional titles. In Q1/Q2 2023, 
the campaign extended with additional AV 
campaign across TV, cinema and VOD 
reaching 99% of our core audience with 
practical support and guidance.  

We delivered content targeted to the 
needs of our most vulnerable audiences 
with content across video, social media 
and owned channels.

In the second half of the year, we launched 
new content marketing activity in 
collaboration with influencers to engage 
consumers around topics of everyday 
money management, travel and 
remortgaging. Guiding people on how to 
make money work better for them through 
the rising pressures of inflation, with this 
activity targeted at both low financial 
wellbeing and broader audiences. This was 
supported with marketing across our 
branches and locals that provided 
guidance on the benefits of the Barclays 
app to support with everyday money 
management and travel.

Provided ongoing Cost of living support by 
proactively contacting over 1.38m 
customers with proactive SMS offering a 
conversation to provide support and 
guidance on managing their finances and 
offering them help ranging from budgeting 
to direct financial support, where required 
guiding them towards dedicated functions 
such as Barclays Financial Assistance (BFA) 
or external agencies such as Step Change. 

Providing knowledge and expertise 
through our colleagues with the aim to 
offer our customers more tools and 
features to educate them on managing 
their money, including by giving them 
guidance on how to use our digital 
platforms via the Digital Eagles, or 
supporting them in their understanding of 
financial products, how to build financial 
plans, and save money through budgeting 
via our Barclays Money Mentors®. 

Our early intervention strategies assess all 
customers who hold a retail product to 
determine if we think they would benefit 
from our support. These customer 
engagement strategies are bank-initiated 
and largely focused around proactive 
communications, based on sets of 
customer behavioural triggers, whilst we 
also support customers who initiate 
contact with us. 

Our primary focus is to support customers 
whose account behaviours are showing 
signs of possible early financial difficulty, 
and look to help customers maintain or 
regain control of their finances.

Part 1 of the Annual Report

Access to banking

Customers are looking for more 
convenient, simpler ways to bank that fit 
their lives, including banking digitally: our 
mobile app has over 11.0 million active 
users. We are continuing to help deliver 
these solutions at pace.

Alongside our investment in technology 
enabling digital customers to access tools 
and products whenever they need them, 
we’re aiming to transform the role of 
physical locations across the UK to ensure 
non digitally engaged customers can still 
access banking. We are working with other 
banks, the Post Office and LINK, to keep 
Barclays at the heart of the community. 

We have launched our own initiatives, 
including a cashback without purchase 
service and Barclays Local - the largest 
network of alternative branch formats in 
the UK, with a presence in over 300 
locations. 

Alongside these changes, we are investing 
in multi-skilled training for our colleagues 
so they are better able to serve customers 
in ways that meet their needs today as well 
as breaking down internal barriers to 
enable quicker resolution of customer 
queries.

Economic crime and scams

We take our responsibility to protect our 
customers’ money very seriously and are 
proud to have one of the lowest scam rates 
and highest reimbursement rates in the 
industry. This is due to our continued 
investment in robust security systems and 
our established programme to educate 
customers and prevent them from falling 
victim to scams.

We have a dedicated Fraud and Scams hub 
on the Barclays website, which hosts a 
variety of content and resources to help 
the public learn how to keep themselves 
safe.

Additionally, for each of the 50 million+ 
payments our UK customers make every 
month, our fraud detection systems and 
machine learning models determine in less 
than a second if it is likely to be a fraudster 
rather than the customer, or if our 
customer appears at risk of being 
scammed. If the transaction seems risky, 
the customer is presented with additional 
checks prior to the payment being 
released.

ESG Governance (continued)

We continue to invest in security features 
that protect against fraud and scams, 
including ‘App ID’, which allows customers 
to verify they’re speaking to a Barclays 
colleague and not an impersonator.

We are also part of the ‘Do not originate’ 
scheme, created in partnership with the 
telecommunications industry, UK Finance 
and Ofcom, to prevent our most common 
inbound helpline phone numbers from 
being used in a scam.

We are proud signatories of the 
Contingent Reimbursement Model Code, 
providing measures to help prevent 
Authorised Push Payments scams taking 
place and building increased consumer 
protection standards for customers of 
signatory firms.

We are founding members of Stop Scams 
UK, a cross-industry group made up of 
banks, telecoms and tech firms that have 
come together to seek to put an end to 
scams by collaborating, sharing best 
practices and engaging with the 
government and regulators to make it 
harder for scammers to operate.

We have published a series of policy

Digital accessibility

We aim to ensure that our digital services 
are easy to see, hear, understand and use 
for all customers, including those with 
disabilities.

Collectively we seek to deliver digital 
services and workplace tools that promote 
disability inclusion and meet accessibility

Building financial wellbeing

As part of our aim to deliver a world-class 
money management experience and help 
money work for our customers, particularly 
through the cost of living crisis, we are 
delivering more tools and features to 
educate them on managing their money. 

We are providing knowledge and expertise 
through our colleagues, whether that be 
helping customers to use our digital 
platforms via the Digital Eagles, or 
supporting customers in their 
understanding of financial products, to 
build financial plans, and save money 
through budgeting via our Barclays Money 
Mentors®. The Barclays Money 
Management Hub gives us the ability to 
provide proactive money management 
information directly to customers, giving 
them a better grasp on their spending 
behaviours and steps they can take to 
improve their financial wellbeing and 
provide customers greater control over 
their finances.

We also have a range of early intervention 
strategies which aim to support customers 
whose account behaviours may be 
showing signs of lacking financial resilience.  
These strategies largely focus on pro-
active communication with the customer, 
based on sets of customer behavioural 
triggers, and look to support customers to 
help them maintain or regain control of 
their finances. Where customers engage 
with these contact strategies, our BFA 
colleagues provide broad money 
management advice and, where 
appropriate, may suggest a range of 
solutions to manage their financial 
situation. This suite of solutions includes 
forbearance and non-forbearance options.  
Gambling

Barclays understands that gambling and 
financial difficulty can often go hand in 
hand and that customers may sometimes 
find it hard to ask for help. We have 
dedicated training available for colleagues 
to help them understand and support 
customers impacted by problematic 
gambling. Our Specialist Colleagues are 
available to help customers in complex 
situations and sign post where needed to 
external support charities and 
organisations.

Domestic abuse

To support customers impacted by 
domestic abuse, we have partnered with 
Refuge, a national charity providing 
specialist support for women and their 
children experiencing domestic abuse. 

This enables us to direct those impacted 
by domestic abuse to expert advice and 
assist survivors with the opening of bank 
accounts and gaining access to banking 
services in situations where they may not 
have the requisite documentation. In 2023, 
the Barclays Refuge Partnership was 
recognised at the Business Charity Awards 
for Addressing Economic and Tech Abuse. 
We are a committed signatory to the 
revised UK Finance Domestic Abuse Code 
of Practice, which sets out how 
participating banks and building societies 
should support customers who are victims 
and survivors of economic or financial 
abuse.
Homelessness

We continue to support those with limited 
documentation such as homeless people 
to open a basic current account. Barclays 
has partnered with charities to help those 
most impacted by the current 
environment through dedicated financial 
inclusion support.
Bereavement

We continue to prioritise making this 
extremely difficult time in people’s lives a 
little easier. Our programme of work to 
enhance the customer experience across 
all of our channels, including physical 
locations and online remains front of mind. 
Highlights this year, include: delivery of an 
automated, online bereavement 
notification and document upload 
capability and a new email confirmation, 
providing real time acknowledgment of the 
bereavement notification. We’ve also 
made it easier for colleagues to help 
customers needing probate support with a 
referral to Co-op Legal Services, who we 
have a partnership with. Further 
enhancements are planned for 2024.

Authorised users

Since launching Authorised User in 2022, 
we’ve continued to give customers the 
ability to effectively manage their finances 
with support of other trusted persons. 

In October 2023, we’ve made this even 
easier by removing the monthly service fee 
for customers to add someone they trust 
to spend on their account.

Specialist support team

Basic current account

We have a dedicated specialist team who 
receive in-depth training on a wide variety 
of vulnerable scenarios. They are available 
to support colleagues and customers in 
complex and heightened vulnerable 
circumstances.
Accessibility & Vulnerability 
(A&V) Indicators Platform

Over 2023 we have enhanced our 
Accessibility & Vulnerability framework, 
giving colleagues within Barclays the ability 
to record disclosed customer vulnerability 
on our systems. This allows us to provide 
customers with the correct level of service 
based on their particular needs and/or 
adjustments. We have focused on 
improving the colleague journey to include 
support on soft skills, internal & external 
sign posting and escalations to specialist 
teams. This ensures colleagues have the 
best available support in the moment when 
dealing with customers in vulnerable 
circumstances.
Training for colleagues

Over 20,000 Barclays UK colleagues 
completed the mandatory Customers in 
Vulnerable Circumstances annual e-
learning modules. The training improves 
awareness and understanding of 
vulnerability for our frontline and head 
office colleagues. 

We also this year launched ‘Threat to Life’ 
training materials for our colleagues to 
help further support colleagues when 
liaising with customers who are suicidal. In 
addition we rolled out new induction 
training to equip new colleagues with how 
to identify and support customers who 
may be vulnerable or going through a life 
event.
Barclays UK Performance 
Framework 

Within Barclays UK, the Performance 
Framework is in place to ensure a 
sustainable commercial performance. The 
framework looks to mitigate the risks of 
inappropriate practices, such as ensuring  
there is no undue pressure on colleagues 
to sell products, which can result in mis-
selling.

Alongside the Performance Framework we 
have introduced Performance Standards 
to set clear expectations, identify 
development opportunities, and deliver 
sustainable performance for our 
customers and clients.

Since 2015, we have been offering our 
basic current account to individuals who 
may not be eligible for a standard account 
access to banking, including over the 
counter services, access to ATMs, and 
digital banking and free text alerts to 
manage finances. There were over 
650,000 Barclays basic current accounts 
open at the end of 2023. 

Access to a transactional bank account 
enables consumers to benefit from bill 
reductions through paying by direct debit 
and access to cheaper goods and services 
on the internet, to help them along their 
financial journey. If their circumstances 
change, customers on the basic current 
account are able to apply for a standard 
Barclays current account at any time. 
Periodically we also review accounts to 
upgrade customers from Basic Current 
Account to Barclays Bank Account where 
eligible.

Barclays mortgages and 
first-time buyers

2023 has been a year of change in the 
mortgages market. There were eight 
successive increases in the Bank of 
England Base Rate, which led to significant 
increases in the cost of borrowing for 
mortgage customers. Our commitment 
has remained to support customers 
through this period. In late 2022 we 
changed our policy for customers reaching 
the end of their fixed rate period, to allow 
them to rate switch earlier, helping over 
200,000 customers in 2023 secure a new 
product up to 180 days in advance when 
their existing rate is ending. The Mortgage 
Charter mandated participating banks to 
implement 180 day switching in June 2023, 
by which time we had already been live with 
the 180 day switching for over eight 
months.

Despite the challenges with the market in 
2023, we still helped almost 22,000 first-
time buyers get onto the property ladder. 
We have continued to support customers 
buying their first home with 95% loan-to-
value mortgages through the UK 
Government Mortgage Guarantee 
Scheme, and Barclays Family Springboard 
Mortgage. 

The Mortgage Guarantee Scheme offers 
95% LTV mortgages which are backed by 
a UK Government guarantee. Customers 
can apply for the scheme with a minimum 
deposit of 5% of the property purchase 
price, and it is available for first-time 
buyers and those looking to make their 
next move on the property ladder.
Financial inclusion in our US 
consumer business

The Community Reinvestment Act (CRA) 
is a US federal law designed to encourage 
financial institutions to help meet the 
needs of borrowers in all segments of their 
communities, including low and moderate-
income neighbourhoods. Barclays meets 
the CRA requirement by supporting and 
investing in local Community Development 
Financial Institutions (CDFIs), small-
medium businesses and non-profits.

The success of CDFIs, small-medium 
businesses and non-profits are key to a 
thriving community. Barclays has 
predefined goals with specific 
performance targets that we must meet 
each year in order to be considered in 
compliance with CRA guidelines. Barclays 
has met its CRA goals for 2023, evidencing 
that we are continuing to invest in the 
communities where we live, work and 
serve. 

Barclays Bank Delaware (BBDE) is 
committed to fair and equitable treatment 
of all prospective and existing customers 
without regard to race, sex, colour, 
national origin, religion, age, marital status, 
disability, sexual orientation, military 
status, gender identity, familial status, 
Limited English Proficiency, receipt of 
public assistance income, and good faith 
exercise of rights under the Consumer 
Credit Protection Act. 

We believe Barclays’ core Values of 
Respect, Integrity, Service, Excellence, and 
Stewardship reflect our commitment to 
fair lending and fair treatment principles 
and practices. We strive to develop long-
term relationships by providing products 
and services that meet prospective and 
existing customer needs, avoid causing 
prospective and existing customer 
detriment or harm, and place our 
prospective and existing customers' 
interests at the heart of our strategy, 
planning, and decision-making processes.

ESG Governance (continued)

The Barclays Way

The Barclays Way is our Code of Conduct. Together with more formal 
policies and practices, this provides a clear path towards achieving a 
positive and dynamic culture within the Group.

Our commitment to being a responsible 
business includes seeking to ensure that: 

• we conduct ourselves in line with The 

Barclays Way, our Code of Conduct, to 
create the best possible working 
environment for our colleagues

• we treat our customers fairly and the 
products and services we deliver are 
transparent and responsible

• we operate in line with relevant laws and 
regulations including those applicable to 
financial crime

• we safeguard the data that has been 

entrusted to us. 

Our Code of Conduct reflects the trust 
that millions of people place in us every 
day. We know that trust is earned by 
repeatedly doing the right thing. We 
believe the best way to build that trust is to 
invest in our culture and support our 
people in the choices they make every day, 
with guidance and policies that help them 
do this.

That starts with our Purpose, Values and 
Mindset, and is locked into our 
organisation through The Barclays Way, 
the touchstone for everyone in Barclays on 
the standard of conduct we expect, setting 
an unequivocal tone from the top about 
who we are and what we stand for. 

The Barclays Way was launched in 2013, 
replacing a number of existing codes of 
conduct with a single document. Endorsed 
by our Chairman, it governs our way of 
working across our business globally and 
constitutes a reference point covering all 
aspects of colleagues’ working 
relationships, specifically but not 
exclusively with other Barclays employees, 
customers and clients, governments, 
regulators, business partners, suppliers, 
competitors and the broader community. 

It is aligned to the Code of Professional 
Conduct, published by the Chartered 
Banker Professional Standards Board, 
which sets out the ethical and professional 
attitudes and behaviours expected of 
bankers. Barclays subscribes to this code 
and is committed to embedding its broad 
principles into our business. 

The Barclays Way includes information and 
guidance on how employees are expected 
to behave and take personal accountability 
for making decisions. We apply a range of 
criteria, over and above financial 
considerations, aimed at building a 
sustainable, strong and profitable business 
for the long term and adding value to our 
business relationships and the broader 
communities in which we live and work. We 
provide guidance across all key 
stakeholder groups, including servicing our 
customers and clients, promoting respect, 
diversity and performance in the workplace 
and maintaining strong governance, 
robust controls and strict ethical 
standards.  

The Barclays Way also includes advice and 
guidance on speaking up and raising 
concerns. It is important for the success of 
Barclays, and for the safety and wellbeing 
of our customers, clients and colleagues, 
that we encourage a culture that supports 
speaking up when things aren’t as they 
should be. All colleagues are required to 
undertake training on The Barclays Way.

We know that our success over the long 
term is based not just on how well we run 
the organisation commercially, but also on 
how well we manage it to protect the 
environment, support positive social 
progress and make responsible, well-
governed decisions. We are focused on 
the areas where we can have the greatest 
long-term impact: making growth ‘green’, 
sustainable and inclusive; managing the 
environmental and social impacts of our 
business; running a responsible business; 
and investing in our communities.

Whistleblowing

We support a culture 
where colleagues feel 
safe to speak up.
Barclays is committed to providing a 
respectful and inclusive environment to 
work in and colleagues are encouraged to 
speak up about actions and behaviours 
that have no place in the organisation. 83% 
of global respondents of the 2023 Your 
View survey said it was 'safe to speak up' at 
Barclays.

Colleagues are encouraged to speak up 
directly to their management, Compliance, 
HR or Legal. However, where they do not 
feel comfortable using these avenues, the 
Raising Concerns process is available.

The Raising Concerns team carefully 
assess concerns and refer them to the 
most appropriate team for review and, 
where appropriate, investigation. All 
concerns are taken seriously and managed 
sensitively and confidentially. Details about 
the Raising Concerns reporting channels 
are available both internally and externally.

One of the channels to which concerns 
may be referred is the whistleblowing 
programme. Information about the 
whistleblowing programme is provided to 
colleagues globally, including through 
annual mandatory training.

Whistleblowing relates to concerns which 
fall within the wider public interest. This 
may include a breach of our policies or 
procedures, breaches of law and regulation 
or other behaviour that harms or is likely to 
harm the reputation or financial wellbeing 
of the Group.

Concerns assessed by Raising Concerns 
as whistleblowing are directed to a 
dedicated impartial team within the 
Compliance function. All whistleblowing 
concerns are taken seriously, and controls 
are in place to protect the confidentiality 
and identity of whistleblowers.

Barclays has a zero-tolerance approach to 
retaliation against any whistleblower or any 
individual who has provided information as 
part of an investigation. Any act of 
retaliation by a colleague may result in 
disciplinary action, including dismissal.

In 2023, the whistleblowing team received 
a total of 67 whistleblowing concerns 
including 19 retaliation concerns.

25% of whistleblowing concerns closed in 
2023 were found to have some level of 
substantiation and other issues were 
identified in a further 38% of concerns.

Tax

Barclays supports a fair and transparent tax system.

“We received the PwC Building Public Trust 
Award 2023 for Tax Reporting in the FTSE 350 
(Multinationals) Group.”

Barclays takes a responsible approach to 
tax. We have strong governance and risk 
management over tax risk and are 
committed to transparency around tax. 

We know that it is important for our 
investors, customers and clients, 
regulators, tax authorities and other 
stakeholders to understand our approach 
to tax and our tax contribution in the 
countries in which we operate. 

In recognition of the clear explanations we 
provide of our tax affairs and our 
responsiveness to both stakeholder 
interest and the continually changing tax 
transparency landscape, we received the 
PwC Building Public Trust Award 2023 for 
Tax Reporting in the FTSE 350 
(Multinationals) Group. This award reflects 
the transparency of both our 2022 
Country Snapshot and the tax reporting in 
our 2022 Annual Report.

Tax contribution

We continue to make substantial tax 
contributions across the jurisdictions in 
which we operate, both in terms of taxes 
paid and taxes collected. Our total tax 
contribution for 2023 was £5,899m. This 
includes taxes paid of £2,505m which 
represent a cost to us, and taxes collected 
on behalf of governments of £3,394m.

Barclays was ranked as the sixth-largest 
UK taxpayer, in terms of taxes paid, in the 
most recent PwC Total Tax Contribution 
survey of the One Hundred Group (‘100 
Group’). The 100 Group represents 
members of the FTSE 100 along with 
several large UK private companies. Over 
the last decade we have paid over £14bn of 
taxes in the UK alone.

Approach to tax

Barclays’ Purpose is to deploy finance 
responsibly to support people and 
businesses, acting with empathy and 
integrity, championing innovation and 
sustainability, for the common good and 
the long term. Our approach to taxation, 
also known as our tax strategy, is aligned 
with this Purpose as well as our Values of 
Respect, Integrity, Service, Excellence and 
Stewardship. 
Our approach to tax has three core 
objectives:

• responsible approach to tax,

• effective interaction with tax authorities 

and

• transparency in relation to our tax 

affairs.

We manage our tax affairs in accordance 
with our Tax Principles, Tax Code of 
Conduct and HMRC’s Code of Practice on 
Taxation for Banks and aim to file our 
returns on time and pay the correct 
amount of tax. We make clear disclosures 
to tax authorities and we are committed to 
only dealing with customer and client 
assets that have been appropriately 
declared to the relevant tax authority.

We are also committed to being a leader in 
tax transparency. We have published 
details of the taxes we pay by country and 
our approach to tax since 2013, and have 
chosen to expand our external publications 
such as the Country Snapshot. 

Our Country Snapshot is publicly available, 
it sets out our approach to tax in detail, 
including our Tax Principles, and is 
reviewed and approved annually by the 
Barclays PLC Board.

Key highlights from our approach to 
tax include:

• we follow clear Tax Principles that we 
have published. These allow us to 
balance the needs of all our 
stakeholders and make clear that tax 
planning must support genuine 
commercial activity,

• as a result of this approach, transactions 
which artificially transfer profits into a 
low tax jurisdiction would not be 
consistent with our Tax Principles,

• we seek to comply with the spirit as well 

as the letter of the law and we take 
account of established practice in the 
territories in which we operate. We are 
transparent in both the disclosure of our 
tax affairs to tax authorities as well as 
our tax reporting to other stakeholders, 
and

• we aim to comply with all of our tax 

obligations in the territories in which we 
operate and where there is uncertainty 
we may seek external tax advice in order 
to help ensure our tax filings are 
appropriate.

Tax governance, control and 
risk management

As a Global Systemically Important Bank, 
our Group-wide risk and governance 
procedures are subject to continuous 
review and scrutiny. More details on our 
approach to tax governance, control and 
risk management can be found in our 
Country Snapshot, the key highlights of 
which include:

• our Board has ultimate responsibility for 

tax matters and the Board Audit 
Committee oversees our approach 
to tax,

• at Barclays, risks are identified and 
managed through our ERMF, which 
supports the business in its aim to 
embed effective risk management and a 
strong risk management culture. Under 
the ERMF all risks, including tax risk, are 
managed in accordance with a ‘three 
lines of defence’ model,

• as part of the ‘first line of defence’ the 

tax department identifies and manages 
tax risk by developing appropriate 
policies, standards and controls to apply 
across our organisation. Risk and 
Compliance comprise the ‘second line 
of defence’, and Barclays Internal Audit 
are the ‘third line of defence’, and these

related to tax:

engagement and managing stakeholder 
concerns related to tax can be found in our 
Country Snapshot, and key highlights

transparent in the disclosure of our tax 
affairs both to tax authorities and 
stakeholders more broadly,

• our dealings with tax authorities are 

handled proactively, constructively and 
transparently, in real-time where 
possible,

• we recognise that early resolution of our 
tax affairs is in everyone’s interest. We 
have ongoing engagement with tax 
authorities to discuss their inquiries and 
material issues in relation to our tax 
affairs, and we respond to feedback 
from tax authorities,

Financial crime

Barclays recognises that economic crimes have an adverse effect on 
individuals and communities wherever they occur. Endemic economic crime 
can threaten laws, democratic processes and basic human freedoms, 
impoverishing states and distorting free trade and competition.

Barclays recognises that financial crime 
has an adverse effect on individuals and 
communities wherever it occurs. Endemic 
financial crime can threaten laws, 
democratic processes, and basic human 
freedoms, impoverishing states and 
distorting free trade and competition.

Barclays is committed to conducting its 
global activities with integrity and 
respecting its regulatory, ethical, and social 
responsibilities to:

a. Protect employees, customers, and 

others with whom we do business, and

a. Support governments, regulators, and 

law enforcement in wider financial crime 
prevention.

Barclays does not tolerate any deliberate 
breach of financial crime laws and 
regulations that apply to our business and 
the transactions we undertake.

We have adopted a holistic approach to 
financial crime risk management and have 
one group-wide Financial Crime Policy. 
The Financial Crime Policy applies to all 
businesses, legal entities and employees. It 
is designed to ensure that Barclays has 
adequate systems, procedures, and 
controls in place to manage the risk of 
being used to facilitate financial crime and 
to manage the legal, regulatory, and 
reputational risks associated with financial 
crime. Employees are made aware that 
failure to comply with the Financial Crime 
Policy may give rise to disciplinary action, 
up to and including dismissal.

The Financial Crime Policy sets control 
obligations to manage four key risks: anti-
bribery & corruption (ABC); anti-money 
laundering & counter-terrorist financing 
(AML); anti-tax evasion facilitation (ATEF) 
and sanctions, including proliferation 
financing. This combined approach allows 
us to identify and manage relevant 
synergies and connections between these 
risks.

Anti-Bribery & Corruption

Anti-Tax Evasion Facilitation 

Bribery and corruption constitutes of:

a. improperly obtaining or retaining 

business; and/or

b. improperly securing a business or 

personal advantage; and/or

c. inducing another person to perform 

their role in breach of an expectation of 
good faith, impartiality or trust. 

Barclays and its employees are prohibited 
from engaging in or facilitating any form of 
bribery and corruption (giving and 
receiving, directly or indirectly). The 
Financial Crime Policy contains the 
minimum risk-based control requirements 
that all our businesses, legal entities and 
employees must follow. The Financial 
Crime Policy is designed to ensure that 
Barclays’ employees know how to identify 
and manage the legal, regulatory and 
reputational risks associated with all forms 
of bribery and corruption.
Anti-Money Laundering

Money laundering has been identified as 
major threats to the international financial 
services community and therefore to 
Barclays. The Barclays Financial Crime 
Policy includes the requirement for 
Barclays businesses and legal entities to 
have adequate systems, procedures, and 
controls in place to manage the risk of 
Barclays being used to facilitate money 
laundering. The requirements of UK 
legislation apply to Barclays globally. As a 
transatlantic bank, the Financial Crime 
Policy also takes into account EU and US 
anti-money laundering requirements, as 
well as guidance issued by bodies such as 
the Wolfsberg Group and the European 
Banking Authority. 

Tax evasion is a financial crime and a 
predicate offence to money laundering in 
the UK and many other countries in which 
we operate. Barclays takes a zero-
tolerance approach to deliberate 
facilitation of tax evasion in any country 
and has procedures in place to prevent it. 
We also expect the same from our 
employees and third parties providing 
services for or on our behalf. Barclays is 
committed to: 

a. dealing only with customers who have 
appropriately declared their assets to 
the relevant tax authorities; and

b. preventing tax evasion facilitation by our 
employees or third parties acting for or 
on our behalf.

Sanctions 

Sanctions are restrictions on activity with 
targeted countries, regions, governments, 
entities, individuals and industries that are 
imposed by bodies such as the European 
Union, the United Nations, groups of 
countries, or individual countries, such as 
the United Kingdom and the United States. 
In order to protect its reputation and other 
legitimate business interests, in certain 
circumstances Barclays sanctions risk 
appetite may be stricter than its legal 
obligations.

The Financial Crime Policy is designed to 
ensure that Barclays and its employees 
know how to identify and manage the risks 
associated with sanctions, including the 
risk that activity is undertaken through 
Barclays in breach of sanctions regulations.

Health and Safety

Barclays has a comprehensive Health and 
Safety Management System operating 
globally, which is independently certified to 
the international standard ISO45001 in the 
USA, UK, India, Singapore, Hong Kong and 
Japan.

Barclays has a suite of Health and Safety 
(H&S) policies and standards that combine 
together under a single high-level 
statement of commitment endorsed by 
the Group ExCo. H&S policies are owned 
by three risk Horizontals – Premises, 
People and Physical Security. Each 
Horizontal manages specific hazards 
through the Group policies and standards, 
with quantitative targets set through key 
indicators (KIs) and control environment 
characteristics (CECs). A program of 
internal control testing ensures that our 
KIs and CECs continue to perform 
satisfactorily, and that any opportunity for 
improvement identified can be acted upon. 
Performance is reported on at the Group 
Health & Safety Forum which oversees 
effective management of health and 
safety across Barclays. 

Barclays has in place global risk 
assessments which identify the hazards 
and control measures needed to reduce 
risks to as low as reasonably practicable, 
these are underpinned by local regulatory 
requirements and procedures. The global 
risk assessments are published on the H&S 
intranet site.

Barclays suppliers are subject to a supplier 
risk evaluation during onboarding, a 
minimum of annually thereafter and when 
they notify of a change in service delivery. 
In addition, they will complete an annual 
control obligation review.

The Barclays H&S team, who operate 
globally, provide support, competent 
advice and assurance where required. 

There is a programme of H&S assurance 
and technical risk assessments to ensure 
the hazard and risk controls remain 
relevant and to identify emerging themes 
and trends.

Onsite monitoring is undertaken across 
our portfolio by the Barclays H&S team, 
supported by the customer care leads for 
retail sites or by our building facilities 
management partners for corporate sites. 
Working with the Chief Security Office 
(CSO), there are processes and 
procedures in place to cover terrorism, 
disasters, fire and other emergency 
evacuations. These are tested on a 
programme schedule as required by the 
risk assessment or local regulatory 
requirements. 

Barclays has an incident reporting system 
to ensure incidents are recorded and 
investigated appropriately. Review of 
incident data is completed by each region 
to identify themes and trends, which are 
then reviewed at the Group H&S Forum 
and lessons learned shared. Incidents are 
reported and escalated as required by local 
regulatory statute and as per Barclays’ risk 
framework for risk issues and events.

Information and knowledge is available 
through our H&S safety intranet, which 
provides key information on the hazard 
register, risk assessments, training and 
templates (for personal emergency 
evacuation plans, Display Screen 
Equipment (DSE) assessments, manual 
handling, occupational stress 
assessments, lone working assessments 
etc). 

Barclays operates a reward and 
recognition scheme where colleagues are 
recognised for improving our risk controls 
and supporting our health and safety 
management system.

Managing data privacy, 
security and resilience

We have strict policies to protect privacy and keep data secure.
Data privacy

As we have transitioned to a more hybrid 
working model, we have educated 
colleagues on cybersecurity risks in order 
to help minimise the risk of data 
exploitation or leakage.
Data resilience 

Barclays' CSO operates key controls that 
mitigate cybersecurity-related risks. CSO 
focuses on understanding internal and 
external threats and delivering on our 
capabilities to counteract them. 

As part of our efforts to continuously 
review and improve our response and 
recovery plans in preparation for evolving 
threats, Barclays works with industry 
bodies to learn from risk events in other 
organisations. Our teams use intelligence 
to create plausible cybersecurity and data 
compromise scenarios which we simulate 
to help us focus on continuous 
improvement.

Most of the jurisdictions in which Barclays 
operates have privacy and data protection 
laws in effect. While these may vary in 
detail, generally they reflect internationally 
recognised privacy principles found in the 
UN’s Universal Declaration of Human 
Rights, the European Convention on 
Human Rights and the European Union’s 
Charter of Fundamental Rights. 

We strive to operate in accordance with 
these standards and recognise that 
respect for privacy rights is a key element 
of good corporate governance and social 
responsibility. We strive to be transparent 
about our use of personal information 
when delivering our products and services 
and acknowledge the responsibility we 
have for safeguarding privacy.    

As Barclays increasingly adopts digital 
solutions to deliver next-generation 
consumer financial services, we appreciate 
our clients, customers and others may 
wish to understand how this may impact 
the use of their personal information. A 
globally applicable Barclays Data Privacy 
Standard sets out what is expected of all 
Barclays businesses and functions when 
collecting, using and sharing personal 
information.  

To promote clear accountability, the 
Standard includes the requirement for 
each business to appoint an accountable 
executive who has ultimate responsibility 
for the processing of personal data within 
that business. An agreed assurance 
programme measures compliance with 
the Data Privacy Standard. Barclays 
colleagues must complete annual privacy 
training which is reviewed and refreshed 
each year, with additional tailored training 
provided as necessary. The Group Data 
Protection Officer (DPO) reports on data 
privacy issues to the highest level of 
management.

Through customer and employee privacy 
notices, we endeavour to explain clearly 
and openly how and why we use personal 
information and the legal grounds we rely 
on. When we receive complaints we seek 
to address them fairly. Several jurisdictions 
also provide individuals with specific rights, 
such as the right to have access to or 
request deletion of their personal 
information. 

Barclays provides a public mailbox and 
secure channels via its website to enable 
individuals to make their privacy requests 
and receive responses from a dedicated 
team.

Barclays requires its suppliers to comply 
with data protection and privacy laws, 
regulations and standards relevant to the 
jurisdictions in which they operate and 
relevant to any transferred personal data. 
Our requirements are set out and 
managed through the Barclays Supplier 
Control Obligations, available online, which 
look to provide assurance that all new and 
existing suppliers commit to ensuring 
personal data shared with them is 
safeguarded and respected throughout 
the supply chain. 
Data security

Barclays deploys automated controls to 
protect its sensitive information and the 
data that has been entrusted to us by 
customers and clients, in line with our 
standards, taking into account findings 
from internal and external reviews of our 
controls. As Barclays accelerates the 
migration of digital services to the cloud, 
we apply the same design principles that 
underpin our existing control environment. 
We have controls and monitoring in place 
designed to secure cloud-hosted data and 
maintain its integrity.

Barclays seeks to protect the security of 
data we share with third parties, including 
by conducting remote and on-site 
inspections with certain suppliers to review 
their controls against contractual 
obligations and industry standards. A Third 
Party Service Provider Framework is in 
place which sets out control requirements 
for business units to manage the 
operational, reputational, conduct and 
legal risks to Barclays through its supply 
chain.

Operational resilience

Chief Security Office 

Customers and clients have increased 
expectations for us to be ‘Always On’, and 
the interconnectivity of the financial sector 
means the stability and resilience of our 
systems, workforce and the continued 
provision of third-party services, all of 
which have a direct impact on the quality of 
our service. 

Barclays' CSO exists to keep the bank, its 
customers, clients, and colleagues safe 
and secure, and to maintain the resilience 
of our operations. CSO supports Barclays' 
business to operate in a protected and 
secure environment, and actively 
promotes the culture that security is 
everyone's responsibility.

Resilience and Security is a focus for the 
board. Barclays continues to invest in a 
multi-year resilience programme which is 
focused on our ability to recover from 
‘severe but plausible’ scenarios which 
could cause detriment to our customers 
and clients and the broader financial 
market. To enable this, we define Group-
wide business services and their 
interdependencies across the Group, 
including technology, third-party services 
and our workforce, and develop the 
recovery plans and business response 
plans for disruption events, such as cyber 
or data integrity disruptions. We review 
and validate these recovery plans through 
regular testing which supports our aim to 
reduce the volume and impact of 
operational incidents year on year. We also 
conduct regular assurance on third parties 
to assess their capability, as defined by our 
contractual Information & Cyber Security 
Supplier Control Obligations.

Resilience and security is the responsibility 
of everyone within the Group. All 
permanent employees are required to 
complete mandatory training on these 
topics at regular intervals across the year.
Please refer to pages 178 for details of Barclays PLC 
+
Board Risk Committee oversight relating to 
operational resilience.
Please refer to the 'Material existing and emerging 
risks' section in our Risk review on pages 266 to 267 
for further details on cyberattacks, data 
management and information protection.
Please refer to the 'Supervision and regulation' 
section in our Risk review on pages 370 for further 
details on our regulatory approach to managing such 
risks.

The Chief Security Officer for the Group 
heads Barclays' CSO and reports up 
through the Chief Operating Officer, who 
sits on the Group Executive Committee. 
The Group CISO reports directly to the 
Chief Security Officer and is supported by 
a team of CISOs for individual business 
units and jurisdictions, as well as other 
teams of cybersecurity experts and 
analysts. Barclays' Group Chief Security 
Officer combines 10 years of law 
enforcement experience with over 20 
years of experience serving in senior 
leadership roles managing security at 
global financial institutions. The Group 
CISO and supporting leadership team 
collectively have advanced degrees and 
senior level experience managing security 
risks in a variety of sectors, including those 
that represent critical national 
infrastructure, such as 
telecommunications and peer financial 
institutions. They are supported by 
analysts and subject matter experts in a 
variety of specialisations, such as 
intelligence, penetration testing, 
cyberforensic investigations, security 
engineering, and vulnerability 
management. 

CSO leadership manages Barclays’ 
cybersecurity activities and is accountable 
for the day-to-day monitoring of residual 
risk, identification of gaps, oversight of 
remedial actions and implementation of 
strategy. As described below, the Chief 
Security Officer and CISO for the Group 
provide updates to the Board and Board 
Risk Committee about cybersecurity risks 
facing the Group.

Within its oversight of Operational risk as a 
Principal Risk, the Board Risk Committee is 
responsible for oversight of risks arising 
from cybersecurity threats. As part of this 
oversight, the Board Risk Committee 
receives periodic updates from Barclays' 
Chief Security Officer or CISO for the 
Group on cybersecurity matters. In 2023, 
such updates addressed topics that 
included the shifting cybersecurity threat 
landscape, measurement of Barclays' risk 
and control posture, cybersecurity incident 
trends and Barclays' response, Barclays' 
ability to recover from a material 
cyberattack scenario, third party control 
and assurance monitoring, privileged 
access to Barclays' systems, regulatory 
developments, and Barclays' technology 
and resource investment strategy.

Barclays assesses its cybersecurity 
activities against the industry-recognised 
National Institute of Standards and 
Technology (NIST) security maturity 
framework, and we periodically engage 
external security consultants to conduct 
independent benchmarking assessments. 
In 2023, findings from such an assessment 
conducted in late 2022 were briefed to the 
Board and Board Risk Committee.

Barclays' CSO partners with third-party 
security providers throughout the Group's 
cybersecurity activities, including for cyber 
recovery, penetration testing, software 
vulnerability scanning, distributed denial of

ESG Governance (continued)

This is achieved through our own 
assurance capabilities and use of a third 
party assurance utility. Activity is 
structured on a risk-based approach that 
prioritises suppliers that underpin our most 
important business services.

Identified issues are managed formally, but 
we also engage proactively with third-party 
suppliers to help them strengthen their 
security and resilience posture. To 
recognise the changing risk presented by 
third-party suppliers, which are 
increasingly targeted by threat actors, we 
regularly alert third-party suppliers where 
we anticipate that they may be more 
vulnerable and should take preventative 
action.

Notwithstanding such third-party risk 
management efforts, Barclays does not 
have direct control over the cybersecurity 
of the systems of its third parties, limiting 
the Group’s ability to effectively protect 
and defend against certain threats.
Certifications

Barclays holds three ISO27001 
certifications (i.e., the international 
standard on how to manage information 
security), Cyber Essentials / Cyber 
Essentials Plus Certification, and has a UK 
certification for Digital Banking.

Under Barclays' Enterprise Risk 
Management Framework, there is an 
Information and Cyber Security Policy 
supported by ten Standards which define 
the minimum requirements for 
cybersecurity matters across the entire 
Barclays Group. These Standards cover 
the following topics: Cryptography, 
Network Security, Security Configuration, 
Data Loss Prevention, Vulnerability 
Management, Data Security, Incident 
Response & Threat Intelligence, Threat 
Management, Governance, and Identity & 
Access Management.

An important part of Barclays’ 
cybersecurity environment is its Joint 
Operations Centres (JOCs), which operate 
24x7x365 from three globally strategic 
locations, linking CSO’s security 
professionals and incident response 
managers with control functions and 
business unit representatives. The JOCs 
deliver security responsiveness by uniting 
core security functions and providing a 
central information and coordination point 
for security incident management.

To manage security risk related to our 
third-party suppliers, many of which 
perform critical services for Barclays and 
handle sensitive Barclays data, we have a 
set of contractual Information & Cyber 
Security Supplier Control Obligations that 
are based off of the requirements of our 
internal standards. We conduct assurance 
over our third and fourth parties against 
those obligations through a dedicated 
External Cyber Assurance & Monitoring 
team (ECAM) and a set of control 
indicators.

Reporting phishing 

CSO performs a number of key activities 
related to identifying, investigating, 
responding to and containing phishing / 
malicious email incidents. CSO has 
embedded an operational process that 
provides education and awareness 
content via email to colleagues who click a 
malicious link or attachment in a phishing 
email, with escalating training exercises 
and management interventions for 
repeated instances. To report suspected 
phishing to Barclays' JOC for further 
investigation, colleagues have a tool 
integrated into their email account, and 
colleagues receive feedback on whether 
the reported email was suspect or 
genuine. CSO also runs monthly phishing 
simulations to understand colleagues' 
susceptibility to real attacks, using the 
analysis to refine education and training.
Training

Barclays has adopted a 65-day window for 
mandatory training completion to allow 
colleagues sufficient time to complete 
training. The consequence of non-
completion is a breach which can lead to 
disciplinary action and impact 
compensation.

The 65-day window covers many different 
colleague situations, including new joiners, 
returners from sick leave or parental leave 
and internal movers. Some of these 
situations are required by law to have a 
reasonable adjustment time to enable the 
successful completion of training. This 
process is managed by Barclays HR and 
Compliance.

Risk review

The management of risk is a critical underpinning to 
the execution of Barclays’ strategy. The material risks 
and uncertainties the Group faces across its 
business and portfolios are key areas of 
management focus.

Risk management

Barclays’ risk 
management strategy

This section introduces the Group’s approach to managing and identifying 
risks, and for fostering a sound risk culture.
Enterprise Risk Management 
Framework (ERMF)

are needed, and high level governance 
arrangements

The ERMF outlines the highest level 
principles for risk management by setting 
out standards, objectives and key 
responsibilities of different groups of 
employees of the Group.

It is approved by the Barclays PLC Board 
on recommendation of the Group Board 
Risk Committee and the Group Chief Risk 
Officer.

The ERMF sets out:
▪ principal risks faced by the Group, which 

guide the organisation of risk 
management processes

▪

▪

▪

risk appetite requirements. This helps 
define the level of risk we are willing to 
undertake in our business

risk management and segregation of 
duties: The ERMF defines a Three Lines 
of Defence model

roles and responsibilities for key risk 
management and governance: The 
accountabilities of the Group CEO, 
Group CRO and other senior managers, 
as well as an overview of Barclays PLC 
committees.

The ERMF is complemented by frameworks, 
policies and standards which are mainly 
aligned to individual principal risks:
▪

frameworks cover high level principles 
guiding the management of principal 
risks, and set out details of which policies 

Board Committees

▪ policies set out the control objectives 

and  high level requirements to address 
the key principles articulated in their 
associated frameworks. Policies state 
‘what’ those within scope are required to 
do

▪ standards set out the detail of the 

control requirements to ensure the 
control objectives set by the policies are 
met. 

Segregation of duties – the ‘Three Lines 
of Defence’ model 

The ERMF sets out a clear lines of defence 
model. All colleagues are responsible for 
understanding and managing risks within 
the context of their individual roles and 
responsibilities, as set out below.
▪ The first line comprises all employees 

engaged in the revenue-generating and 
client-facing areas of the Group and all 
associated support functions, including 
Finance, Operations, Treasury and 
Human Resources. The first line is 
responsible for identifying and managing 
the risks in which they are engaged, 
operating within applicable limits, and 
escalating risk events or issues as 
appropriate. Employees in the first line 
have primary responsibility for their risks 
and their activities are subject to 
oversight from the relevant parts of the 
second and third lines.

▪ The second line is comprised of the Risk 
and Compliance functions. The role of 
the second line is to establish the limits, 
rules and constraints, and the 
frameworks, policies and standards 
under which all activities shall be 
performed, consistent with the risk 
appetite of the Group, and to oversee 
the performance of the Group against 
these limits, rules and constraints. 
Controls for first line activities will 
ordinarily be established by the control 
officers operating within the control 
framework of the firm. These will remain 
subject to oversight by the second line.

▪ The third line of defence is Internal 

Audit, who are responsible for providing 
independent assurance over the 
effectiveness of governance, risk 
management and controls over current, 
systemic and evolving risks.

▪ The Legal function provides support to 
all areas of the bank and is not formally 
part of any of the three lines of defence, 
The Legal function is responsible for 
proactively identifying, communicating 
and providing legal advice on applicable 
laws, rules and regulations. Except in 
relation to the legal advice it provides or 
procures, it is subject to second line 
oversight with respect to its own 
operational and compliance risks, as well 
as with respect to the legal risk to which 
the bank is exposed.

Risk management (continued)

Principal risks 

• The Barclays PLC Board Risk 

Barclays’ risk culture

Committee (BRC): the BRC monitors 
the Group’s risk profile against the 
agreed appetite. Where actual 
performance differs from expectations, 
the actions taken by management are 
reviewed to ascertain that the BRC is 
comfortable with them. The BRC also 
reviews certain key risk methodologies, 
the effectiveness of risk management, 
and the Group’s risk profile, including the 
material issues affecting each business 
portfolio and forward risk trends. The 
committee also commissions in-depth 
analysis of significant risk topics, which 
are presented by the Group CRO or 
senior risk managers.

• The Barclays PLC Board Audit 

Committee (BAC): the BAC receives 
regular reports on the effectiveness of 
internal control systems, quarterly 
reports on material control issues of 
significance, quarterly papers on 
accounting judgements (including 
impairment), and a quarterly review of 
the adequacy of impairment allowances.

• The Barclays PLC Board Remuneration 

Committee (RemCo): the RemCo 
receives proposals on ex-ante and ex-
post risk adjustments to variable 
remuneration based on risk 
management performance including 
events, issues and the wider risk profile. 
These inputs are considered in the 
setting of performance incentives.

The terms of reference and additional 
details on membership and activities for 
each of the principal Board committees 
are available from the corporate 
governance section of the Barclays 
website at: home.barclays/who-we-are/
our-governance/board-committees/

The GRC is the most senior executive 
body responsible for reviewing and 
monitoring the risk profile of the Group. 
This includes coverage of all principal risks, 
and any other material risks, to which the 
Group is exposed. The GRC reviews and 
recommends the proposed risk appetite 
and relative limits to the BRC. The 
committee covers all business units and 
legal entities of the Group and 
incorporates specific coverage of Barclays 
Bank Group.

Risk culture can be defined as the norms, 
attitudes and behaviours related to risk 
awareness, risk taking and risk 
management. This is reflected in how the 
Group identifies, escalates and manages 
risk matters.

Barclays is committed to maintaining a 
robust risk culture in which:

• management expect, model and reward 

the right behaviours from a risk and 
control perspective

• colleagues identify, manage and 

escalate risk and control matters, and 
meet their responsibilities around risk 
management. 

The Group CEO works with the Executive 
Management to embed a strong risk 
culture within the firm, with particular 
regard to the identification, escalation and 
management of risk matters, in 
accordance with the ERMF. This is 
supported by our Purpose, Values and 
Mindset, as well by as by setting a standard 
of consistent excellence. Specifically, all 
employees regardless of their positions, 
functions or locations must play their part 
in the Group’s risk management. 
Employees are required to be familiar with 
risk management policies which are 
relevant to their responsibilities, know how 
to escalate actual or potential risk issues, 
and have a role-appropriate level of 
awareness of the risk management 
process as defined by the ERMF.
Our Code of Conduct – the Barclays Way

Globally, all colleagues must attest to the 
‘Barclays Way’, our Code of Conduct, and 
comply with all frameworks, policies and 
standards applicable to their roles. The 
Code of Conduct outlines the Purpose, 
Values and Mindset which govern our 
‘Barclays Way’ of working across our 
business globally. It constitutes a 
reference point covering all aspects of 
colleagues’ working relationships, and 
provides guidance on working with other 
Barclays employees, customers and 
clients, governments and regulators, 
business partners, suppliers, competitors 
and the broader community. See 
home.barclays/sustainability/esg-
resource-hub/statements-and-policy-
positions/ for more details.

The ERMF identifies nine principal risks 
namely: credit risk, market risk, treasury 
and capital risk, climate risk, operational 
risk, model risk, compliance risk, reputation 
risk and legal risk. Note that "compliance 
risk" replaced "conduct risk" in 2023 with 
an expanded definition. See page 269 for 
more information.

Each of the principal risks is overseen by an 
accountable executive within the Group 
who is responsible for overseeing and/or 
assigning responsibilities for the 
framework, policies and standards that set 
out associated responsibilities and 
expectations and detail the related 
requirements around risk management. In 
addition, certain risks span across more 
than one principal risk.
Risk appetite 

Risk appetite is defined as the level of risk 
which the Group is prepared to accept in 
carrying out its activities. It provides a basis 
for ongoing dialogue between 
management and Board with respect to 
the Group’s current and evolving risk 
profile, allowing strategic and financial 
decisions to be made on an informed 
basis.

Risk appetite is approved by the Barclays 
PLC Board in aggregate and disseminated 
across legal entities and businesses, 
supported by limits to enable and control 
specific exposures and activities that have 
material concentration risk implications.
Risk committees

Barclays various risk committees consider 
risk matters relevant to their business, and 
escalate as required to the Group Risk 
Committee (GRC), whose Chair, in turn, 
escalates to the Barclays PLC Board Risk 
Committees and the Barclays PLC Board.

In addition to setting the risk appetite of 
the Group, the Board is responsible for 
approving the ERMF, and reviewing  
reputation risk matters. It receives regular 
information on the risk profile of the 
Group, and has ultimate responsibility for 
risk appetite and capital plans.

Further, there are two Board-level 
committees which oversee the application 
of the ERMF and implementation of key 
aspects, the Barclays PLC Board Risk 
Committee (BRC) and the Barclays PLC 
Board Audit Committee (BAC). 
Additionally, the Barclays PLC Board 
Remuneration Committee oversee pay 
practices focusing on aligning pay to 
sustainable performance.

Material existing and emerging risks

Material existing and emerging 
risks to the Group’s future 
performance

The Group has identified a broad range of 
risks to which its businesses are exposed. 
Material risks are those to which senior 
management pay particular attention and 
which could cause the delivery of the 
Group’s strategy, results of operations, 
financial condition and/or prospects to 
differ materially from expectations. 
Emerging risks are those which have 
unknown components, the impact of 
which could crystallise over a longer time 
period. In addition, certain other factors 
beyond the Group’s control, including 
escalation of global conflicts, acts of 
terrorism, natural disasters, pandemics 
and similar events, although not detailed 
below, could have a similar impact on the 
Group.
Material existing and emerging 
risks potentially impacting more 
than one principal risk
i) Business conditions, general economy 
and geopolitical issues 

The Group’s operations are subject to  
changes in global and local economic and 
market conditions, as well as geopolitical 
developments, which may have a material 
impact on the Group’s business, results of 
operations, financial condition and 
prospects.

A deterioration in global or local economic 
and market conditions may result in 
(among other things): (i) deteriorating 
business, consumer or investor 
confidence and lower levels of investment 
and productivity growth, which in turn may 
lead to lower customer and client activity, 
including lower demand for borrowing; (ii) 
higher default rates, delinquencies, write-
offs and impairment charges as borrowers 
struggle with their debt commitments; (iii) 
subdued asset prices, which may impact 
the value of collateral held by the Group 
and require the Group and its customers 
to post additional collateral in order to 
satisfy margin calls; (iv) mark-to-market 
losses in trading portfolios resulting from 
changes in factors such as credit ratings, 
share prices and solvency of 
counterparties; and (v) revisions to 
calculated ECLs leading to increases in 
impairment allowances. In addition, the 
Group’s ability to borrow from other 
financial institutions or raise funding from 
external investors may be affected by 
deteriorating economic conditions and 
market disruption. Geopolitical events can 
also cause financial instability and affect 
economic growth.

In particular:

• Global GDP growth in 2023 was severely 

hampered by inflationary pressures 
resulting from: (i) restricted labour 
markets, industrial disputes, and upward 
pressure on employment costs; (ii) high 
energy prices intensified by the conflicts 
in Ukraine and the Middle East; and (iii) 
resilient consumer spending, particularly 
on services, funded by drawing 
household savings. High inflation has led 
to the on-going 'cost of living' pressures 
in much of the world, including in the UK.

• In response to persistent inflation, 2023 
saw central banks continue to tighten 
monetary policy through raising interest 
rates and exercising quantitative 
tightening. While markets are 
forecasting that rates are at or near their 
cycle peak and inflation has begun to 
ease back (albeit remaining well above 
central banks' targets), economies in 
which the Group operates are vulnerable 
to recession risk in 2024. Such risk is 
heightened by the turbulent geopolitical 
outlook and volatile market conditions 
with these factors acting as a drag on 
potential global economic growth. 
Higher mortgage rates, rising taxes, 
elevated bond yields, depleted 
household savings, higher corporate 
insolvencies, and rising unemployment 
have potentially negative implications 
for the Group's performance, including 
increased impairment allowances. 

• The loss of ‘the presumption of 

compliance’ is widely reported to have 
raised costs for UK customers exporting 
to the European Union (EU) which, 
together with the risk of regulatory 
divergence between the UK and the EU, 
could adversely impact both the Group's 
EU and UK operations.

• Further, any trading disruption between 
the EU and the UK may have a significant 
impact on economic activity in the EU 
and the UK which, in turn, could have a 
material adverse effect on the Group’s 
business, results of operations, financial 
condition and prospects. 

• Unstable economic conditions could 

result in (among other things): 

– a deeper slowdown in the UK and/or 

one or more member states of the EU 
in which the Group operates, with 
lower growth, higher unemployment 
and a greater fall in property prices, 
which could lead to increased 
impairments in relation to a number of 
the Group’s portfolios (including, but 
not limited to, the UK mortgage 
portfolio, unsecured lending portfolio 

(including credit cards) and 
commercial real estate exposures).

– increased market volatility (in 

particular in currencies and interest 
rates), which could impact the 
Group’s trading book positions and 
affect the underlying value of assets in 
the banking book and securities held 
by the Group for liquidity purposes. In 
addition, depositor perceptions of 
banking fragility as seen in certain 
institutions in 2023 could increase the 
severity and velocity of deposit 
outflows, impacting the Group’s 
liquidity position;

– a credit rating downgrade for one or 
more members of the Group (either 
directly or indirectly as a result of a 
downgrade in the UK sovereign credit 
ratings), which could significantly 
increase the Group’s cost of funding 
and/or reduce its access to funding, 
widen credit spreads and have a 
material adverse impact on the 
Group’s interest margins and liquidity 
position and/or

– a market-wide widening of credit 

spreads or reduced investor appetite 
for the Group’s debt securities, which 
could negatively impact the Group’s 
cost of and/or access to funding.

• A significant proportion of the Group’s 

portfolio is located in the US, including a 
major credit card portfolio and a range 
of corporate and investment banking 
exposures. Political instability and/or 
increased polarisation ahead of the 
2024 elections together with the 
possibility of significant changes in US 
policy in certain sectors may negatively 
impact the Group’s associated 
portfolios. Stress in the US economy, 
weakening GDP and associated 
exchange rate fluctuations, heightened 
political and/or trade tensions (such as 
between the US and China), and 
increased unemployment could lead to 
higher levels of impairment, which may 
have a material adverse effect on the 
Group's results of operations and 
profitability.  

• An escalation in geopolitical tensions or 
increased use of protectionist measures 
(such as the US and China implementing 
reciprocal trade tariffs and/or outright 
export bans on specific products and/or 
in specific sectors) may have a material 
adverse effect on the Group’s business 
in the affected regions.

• In China, a significant global economy, 
the property market slump, shrinking 
exports, and weakened currency (and 
resulting capital outflows) have caused

Material existing and emerging risks (continued)

an economic slowdown, with deflation a 
real risk. The high levels of debt, 
particularly in the property sector, 
remain a concern given the high 
leverage multiples, despite government 
and regulatory action. Any property 
shock risks contaminating the financial 
sector and precipitating a wider banking 
crisis. A shift away from market-based 
reforms towards state led initiatives to 
stimulate the economy could damage 
private-sector confidence and 
economic growth. 

• High US interest rates and a potential 

global slow-down in demand for natural 
resources, means an economic 
deterioration in emerging markets still 
remains a risk. This could have a material 
adverse effect on the Group's results 
from operations if these stresses lead to 
higher impairment charges from a 
deterioration in sovereign or corporate 
creditworthiness.

• New strains of COVID-19 (or reduced 
vaccine efficacy) could impact the 
Group's ability to conduct business in 
the jurisdictions in which it operates 
through disruptions to: (i)) infrastructure 
and supply chains, (ii) business 
processes and technology services 
provided by third parties and (iii), the 
availability of staff due to illness. These 
interruptions to business may be 
detrimental to customers (who may 
seek reimbursement from the Group for 
costs and losses incurred as a result of 
such interruptions), and result in 
potential litigation costs (including 
regulatory fines, penalties and other 
sanctions), as well as reputational 
damage. It may also have the effect of 
increasing the likelihood and/or 
magnitude of other risks described 
herein (with consequential impairment 
charge volatility) or may pose other risks 
which are not presently known to the 
Group or not currently expected to be 
significant to the Group’s profitability, 
capital and liquidity.

Any and all such events mentioned above 
could have a material adverse effect on the 
Group’s business, results of operations, 
financial condition, prospects, liquidity, 
capital position and credit ratings (including 
potential credit rating agency changes of 
outlooks or ratings), as well as on the 
Group’s customers, employees and 
suppliers.
ii) The impact of interest rate changes on 
the Group’s profitability

Changes to interest rates are significant for 
the Group, especially given the uncertainty 
as to the size and frequency of such 

changes, particularly in the Group’s main 
markets of the UK, the US and the EU.

Interest rate rises result in higher funding 
costs either due to higher refinancing 
costs or due to deposit balance mix 
changes as customers prefer higher rate 
deposits. Interest rate rises however could  
positively impact the Group’s profitability 
as retail and corporate business net 
interest income increases due to margin 
decompression, as observed for the 
interest rate rises in 2023. However, 
increases in interest rates, if larger or more 
frequent than expected, could lead to 
generally weaker than expected growth, 
reduced business confidence and higher 
unemployment. This, combined with the 
impact interest rate rises may have on the 
affordability of loan arrangements for 
borrowers (especially when combined with 
inflationary pressures), could cause stress 
in the lending portfolio and underwriting 
activity of the Group. This could result in  
higher credit losses driving increased 
impairment charges which would most 
notably impact retail unsecured portfolios 
and wholesale non-investment grade 
lending and could have a material effect on 
the Group’s business, results of 
operations, financial condition and 
prospects.

Interest rate cuts may affect, and put 
pressure on, the Group’s net interest 
margins (the difference between its 
lending income and borrowing costs) and 
could adversely affect the profitability and 
prospects of the Group.

In addition, changes in interest rates could 
have an adverse impact on the value of the 
securities held in the Group’s liquid asset 
portfolio. Consequently, this could create 
more volatility than expected through the 
Group’s fair value through other 
comprehensive income (FVOCI) reserve 
and could adversely affect the profitability 
and prospects of the Group.
iii) Competition in the banking and 
financial services industry

The Group operates in a highly 
competitive environment in which it must 
evolve and adapt to significant changes as 
a result of regulatory reform, technological 
advances, increased public scrutiny,  
prevailing market environment and 
changes to economic conditions. The 
Group expects that competition in the 
financial services industry will continue to 
be intense and may have a material 
adverse effect on the Group’s future 
business, results of operations, financial 
condition and prospects.

New competitors in the financial services 
industry continue to emerge. 

Technological advances and the growth of 
e-commerce have made it possible for 
non-banks to offer products and services 
that traditionally were banking products 
such as electronic securities trading, 
payments processing and online 
automated algorithmic-based investment 
advice. Furthermore, payments 
processing and other services could be 
significantly disrupted by technologies, 
such as blockchain (used in cryptocurrency 
systems) and 'buy now pay later' lending, 
both of which are currently subject to 
lower levels of regulatory oversight 
compared to many activities undertaken 
by banks. Furthermore, the introduction of 
central bank digital currencies could have 
significant impact on the banking system 
and the role of commercial banks by 
disrupting the current provision of banking 
products and services. This disruption 
could allow new competitors, some 
previously hindered by banking regulation 
(such as certain FinTechs), to provide 
customers with access to banking facilities 
and increase the disintermediation of 
banking services. 

New technologies and changing consumer 
behaviour have previously required, and 
could continue to require, the Group to 
incur additional costs to modify or adapt its 
products or make additional capital 
investments in its businesses to attract 
and retain clients and customers or to 
match products and services offered by its 
competitors, including technology 
companies.

Ongoing or increased competition and/or 
disintermediation of banking services may 
put pressure on the pricing of the Group’s 
products and services, which could reduce 
the Group’s revenues and profitability, or 
may cause the Group to lose market share, 
particularly with respect to traditional 
banking products such as deposits, bank 
accounts and mortgage lending. This 
competition may be on the basis of the 
quality and variety of products and services 
offered, transaction execution, innovation, 
reputation and/or price. These factors 
may be exacerbated by further industry 
wide initiatives to address access to 
banking. The failure of any of the Group’s 
businesses to meet the expectations of 
clients and customers, whether due to 
general market conditions, 
underperformance, a decision not to offer 
a particular product or service, branch 
closures, changes in client and customer 
expectations or other factors, could affect 
the Group’s ability to attract or retain 
clients and customers. Any such impact 
could, in turn, reduce the Group’s 
revenues.

iv) Regulatory change agenda and impact 
on business model

The Group’s businesses are subject to 
ongoing regulation and associated 
regulatory risks, including the effects of 
changes in the laws, regulations, policies, 
voluntary codes of practice and 
interpretations of the foregoing in the UK, 
the US, the EU and the other markets in 
which it operates. Many regulatory 
changes that are relevant to the Group’s 
business may have an effect beyond the 
country in which they are enacted, either 
because the Group’s regulators 
deliberately enact regulation with extra-
territorial effect or its global operations 
mean that the Group gives effect to local 
laws and regulations on a wider basis.

In recent years, regulators and 
governments have focused on reforming 
both the prudential regulation of the 
financial services industry and the ways in 
which the business of financial services is 
conducted. Measures taken include 
enhanced capital, liquidity and funding 
requirements, the structural separation or 
prohibition of certain activities by banks, 
changes in the operation of capital 
markets activities, the introduction of tax 
levies and transaction taxes, changes in 
compensation practices and more detailed 
requirements on how business is 
conducted and customers are treated. 
The governments and regulators in the 
UK, the US, the EU or elsewhere may 
intervene further in relation to areas of 
industry risk already identified, or in new 
areas, which could adversely affect the 
Group.

Current and anticipated areas of particular 
focus for the Group’s regulators, where 
regulatory changes could have a material 
effect on the Group’s business, financial 
condition, results of operations, prospects, 
capital position, and reputation, include, 
but are not limited to:

• the increasing focus by regulators, 

international bodies, organisations and 
unions on how institutions conduct 
business, particularly with regard to the 
delivery of fair outcomes for customers, 
promoting effective competition in the 
interests of consumers and ensuring the 
orderly and transparent operation of 
global financial markets, including the 
new Consumer Duty in the UK and 
measures resulting from ongoing 
thematic reviews into the workings of 
the retail, small and medium enterprises 
and wholesale banking sectors and the 
provision of financial advice to 
consumers;

• the implementation of any conduct 

• the incorporation of climate change 

measures as a result of regulators’ focus 
on organisational culture, employee 
behaviour and whistleblowing;

• the demise of certain benchmark 

interest rates and the transition to new 
risk-free reference rates (as discussed 
further under ‘v) Impact of benchmark 
interest rate reforms on the Group’ 
below); 

• reviews of regulatory frameworks 

applicable to the wholesale financial 
markets, including reforms and other 
changes to conduct of business, listing, 
securitisation and derivatives related 
requirements;

• the focus globally on technology 

adoption and digital delivery, including 
the use of artificial intelligence (AI), 
digital assets and digital money 
(including central bank digital 
currencies), financial technology risks, 
payments and related infrastructure, 
operational resilience, and 
cybersecurity. This also includes the 
introduction of new and/or enhanced 
regulatory standards in these areas, 
underpinned by customer protection 
principles; 

• increasing regulatory expectations of 
firms around governance and risk 
management frameworks, particularly 
for the management of climate change 
and other ESG risks, enhanced ESG 
disclosure and reporting obligations, and 
proposals for a new regulatory 
framework on diversity and inclusion in 
the UK;

• the continued evolution of the UK’s 

regulatory framework following the UK's 
withdrawal from the EU, particularly 
following the introduction of the 
Financial Services and Markets Act 2023 
(FSMA 2023) which provides for the 
revocation of retained EU law relating to 
financial services and the UK financial 
services regulatory reform agenda 
announced in December 2022, and 
similarly regarding the access of UK and 
other non-EU financial institutions to EU 
markets;

• the implementation of the reforms to 
the Basel III package, which includes 
changes to the RWA approaches to 
credit risk, market risk, counterparty risk, 
operational risk, and credit valuation 
adjustments and the application of RWA 
floors and the leverage ratio;

• the implementation of more stringent 

capital, liquidity and funding 
requirements;

within the global prudential framework, 
including the transition risks resulting 
from a shift to a low-carbon economy 
and its financial effects;

• the increased regulatory focus in the UK 

on the introduction of potential 
measures designed to maximise access 
to cash for consumers (including 
retention of specific branches) and, 
separately, regulatory scrutiny of the 
reasons for refusing to open or 
decisions to close customer bank 
accounts;

• proposed reforms to the UK ring-

fencing regime, which requires the 
separation of core banking operations 
for retail and small and medium 
enterprise depositors from other 
wholesale and investment banking 
operations;

• the reform of corporate criminal liability 
in the Economic Crime and Corporate 
Transparency Act 2023, which includes 
a failure to prevent fraud offence;

• requirements to detail management 
accountability within the Group (for 
example, the requirements of the Senior 
Managers and Certification Regime in 
the UK and similar regimes elsewhere 
that are either in effect or under 
consideration/implementation), as well 
as requirements relating to executive 
remuneration;

• changes in national or supra-national 
requirements regarding the ability to 
offshore or outsource the provision of 
services and resources or transfer 
material risk or data to companies 
located in other countries, which could 
impact the Group’s ability to implement 
globally consistent and efficient 
operating models; 

• financial crime, fraud and market abuse 
standards and increasing expectations 
for related control frameworks, to 
ensure firms are adapting to new threats 
and are protecting customers from 
cyber-enabled crime and in the UK, 
reforms relating to authorised push 
payment fraud reimbursements;

• the application and enforcement of 

economic sanctions including those with 
extra-territorial effect and those arising 
from geopolitical tensions;

• requirements flowing from 

arrangements for the resolution 
strategy of the Group and its individual 
operating entities that may have 
different effects in different countries;

and regulations applicable to, the Group, refer to the 
Supervision and regulation section on page 363.

v) Impact of benchmark interest rate 
reforms on the Group

Global regulators have driven international 
efforts to reform benchmarks and indices, 
used to determine the amounts payable 
under a wide range of transactions to 
increase reliability and robustness. These 
reforms have resulted in significant 
changes to the methodology and 
operation of certain benchmarks and 
indices, the adoption of alternative risk-
free reference rates (RFRs), the 
discontinuation of certain benchmarks, 
and the introduction of implementing 
legislation and regulations. Specifically, 
certain London Interbank Offered Rate 
(LIBOR) tenors either ceased at the end of 
2021 or became permanently 
unrepresentative, with synthetic 3-month 
GBP LIBOR ceasing to be published at the 
end March 2024 and synthetic 1-, 3- and 
6-month USD LIBOR settings intended to 
cease being published at the end of 
September 2024. Notwithstanding these 
developments, given the unpredictable 
consequences of benchmark reform, any 
of these developments could have an 
adverse impact on market participants, 
including the Group, in respect of any 
financial instruments linked to, or 
referencing, any of these benchmarks. 

Uncertainty associated with such potential 
changes, including the availability and/or 
suitability of alternative RFRs, the 
participation of customers and third party 
market participants in the transition 
process, challenges with respect to 
required documentation changes, and the 
impact of legislation to deal with certain 
legacy contracts that cannot convert into 
or add fall-back RFRs before cessation of 
the benchmark they reference, may 
adversely affect a broad range of 
transactions (including any securities, 
loans and derivatives which use an 
affected benchmark to determine an 
amount payable which are included in the 
Group’s financial assets and liabilities) that 
use these benchmarks and indices, and 
present a number of risks for the Group, 
including but not limited to:  

• Compliance risk: in undertaking actions 
to transition away from using certain 
benchmarks to new alternative RFRs, 
the Group faces conduct risks. These 
may lead to customer complaints, 
regulatory sanctions or reputational 
impact if the Group is considered to be 
(among other things): (i) undertaking 
market activities that are manipulative 
or create a false or misleading 
impression; (ii) misusing sensitive 
information or not identifying or 
appropriately managing and mitigating 
conflicts of interest; (iii) providing 
customers with inadequate advice, 
misleading information, unsuitable 
products or unacceptable service; (iv) 
not taking a consistent approach to 
remediation for customers in similar 
circumstances; (v) unduly delaying the 
communication and migration activities 
in relation to client exposures, leaving 
them insufficient time to prepare; or (vi) 
colluding or inappropriately sharing 
information with competitors.

• Litigation risk: members of the Group 

may face legal proceedings, regulatory 
investigations and/or other actions or 
proceedings regarding (among other 
things): (i) the conduct risks identified 
above, (ii) the interpretation and 
enforceability of provisions in contracts 
and securities linked to a relevant 
benchmark, and (iii) the Group’s 
preparation and readiness for the 
replacement of benchmarks which have 
ceased or will shortly cease to be 
published with alternative RFRs.

• Financial risk: the valuation of certain of 

the Group’s financial assets and liabilities 
may change. Moreover, transitioning to 
alternative RFRs may impact the ability 
of members of the Group to calculate 
and model amounts receivable by them 
on certain financial assets and determine 
the amounts payable on certain financial 
liabilities (such as debt securities issued 
by them) because certain alternative 
RFRs (such as the Sterling Overnight 
Index Average (SONIA) and the Secured 
Overnight Financing Rate (SOFR)) are 
look-back rates, which means that the 
amount of interest payable is only known 
after the period has finished because it is 
calculated by reference to observed 
historical rates. In contrast, forward-
looking term rates (such as LIBOR) allow 
borrowers to calculate at the start of any 
interest period exactly how much is 
payable at the end of such interest 
period. This may have a material adverse 
effect on the Group’s cash flows.

• Pricing risk: changes to existing 

benchmarks and indices, 
discontinuation of any benchmarks or 
index and transition to alternative RFRs 
may impact the pricing mechanisms 
used by the Group on certain 
transactions.

• Operational risk: changes to existing  

benchmarks and indices, the 
discontinuation of any benchmark or 
index and transition to alternative RFRs 
may require changes to the Group’s IT 
systems, trade reporting infrastructure, 
operational processes, and controls. In 
addition, if any benchmark or index is no 
longer available to calculate amounts 
payable, the Group may incur expenses 
in amending documentation for new and 
existing transactions and/or effecting 
the transition from the original 
benchmark or index to a new one.

• Accounting risk: an inability to apply 

hedge accounting in accordance with 
IAS 39 could lead to increased volatility 
in the Group’s financial results and 
performance. 

Any of these factors may have a material 
adverse effect on the Group’s business, 
results of operations, financial condition, 
prospects and reputation.

vi) Change delivery and execution risks

The Group constantly adapts and 
transforms the way it conducts business in 
response to changing customer behaviour 
and needs, technological developments, 
regulatory expectations, increased 
competition and cost management 
initiatives. Accordingly, effective 
management of transformation projects is 
required to successfully deliver the 
Group's strategic priorities, involving 
delivering both on externally driven 
programmes, as well as key business 
initiatives to deliver revenue growth, 
product enhancement and operational 
efficiency outcomes. The magnitude, 
complexity and, at times, concurrent 
demands of the projects required to meet 
these priorities can result in heightened 
execution risk. 

The ability to execute the Group’s strategy 
may be limited by operational capacity and 
the increasing complexity of the regulatory 
environment in which the Group operates. 
In addition, whilst the Group continues to 
pursue cost management initiatives, they 
may not be as effective as expected and 
cost saving targets may not be met.

The failure to successfully deliver or 
achieve any of the expected benefits of 
these strategic initiatives and/or the failure 
to meet customer and stakeholder 
expectations could have a material 
adverse effect on the Group’s business, 
results of operations, financial condition, 
customer outcomes, prospects and 
reputation.
vii) Holding company structure of 
Barclays PLC and its dependency on 
distributions from its subsidiaries 

Barclays PLC is a holding company and its 
principal sources of income are, and are 
expected to continue to be, distributions 
(in the form of dividends and interest 
payments) from operating subsidiaries 
which also hold the principal assets of the 
Group. As a separate legal entity, Barclays 
PLC relies on such distributions in order to 
be able to meet its obligations as they fall 
due (including its payment obligations with 
respect to its debt securities) and to 
create distributable reserves for capital 
distributions (such as dividends to ordinary 
shareholders and share buybacks).

The ability of Barclays PLC’s subsidiaries to 
pay dividends and interest and Barclays 
PLC’s ability to receive such distributions 
from its investments in its subsidiaries and 
other entities will be subject not only to the 
financial performance of such subsidiaries 
and entities and prevailing macroeconomic 
conditions but also to applicable local laws, 
capital regulations (including internal MREL 
requirements) and other restrictions 
(including restrictions imposed by 
governments and/or regulators, which 
limit management’s flexibility in managing 
the business and taking action in relation 
to capital distributions and capital 
allocation). These laws and restrictions 
could limit the payment of dividends and 
distributions to Barclays PLC by its 
subsidiaries and any other entities in which 
it holds an investment from time to time, 
which could restrict Barclays PLC’s ability 
to meet its obligations and/or to make 
capital distributions (such as dividends to 
ordinary shareholders and share 
buybacks).
viii) Application of resolution measures 
and stabilisation powers under the UK 
Banking Act

Under the UK Banking Act 2009, as 
amended (Banking Act), substantial 
powers are granted to the Bank of England 
(or, in certain circumstances, HM 
Treasury), in consultation with the PRA, the 
FCA and HM Treasury, as appropriate, as 
part of the UK's special resolution regime 
(SRR). These powers enable the relevant 
UK resolution authority to implement 
resolution measures and stabilisation 
options with respect to a UK bank or 
investment firm and certain of its affiliates 
(currently including Barclays PLC) (each, a 
relevant entity) in circumstances in which 
the relevant UK resolution authority is 
satisfied that the resolution conditions are 
met.

The SRR consists of five stabilisation 
options: (i) private sector transfer of all or 
part of the business or shares of the 
relevant entity; (ii) transfer of all or part of 
the business of the relevant entity to a 
‘bridge bank’ established by the Bank of 
England; (iii) transfer to an asset 
management vehicle wholly or partly 
owned by the Bank of England; (iv) the 
cancellation, transfer or dilution of the 
relevant entities’ equity (including Barclays 
PLC’s ordinary share capital) and write-
down or conversion of the relevant entity’s 
capital instruments and liabilities (the bail-
in tool); and (v) temporary public ownership 
(i.e. nationalisation).

In addition, the relevant UK resolution 
authority may, in certain circumstances, in 
accordance with the Banking Act require 
the permanent write-down or conversion 
into equity of any outstanding Tier 1 capital 
instruments, Tier 2 capital instruments and 
internal MREL prior to, or together with, 
the exercise of any stabilisation option. 
Any such action could result in the dilution, 
transfer or cancellation of Barclays PLC’s 
ordinary share capital, restrict Barclays 
PLC’s ability to meet its obligations and/or 
to pay dividends to ordinary shareholders.

Shareholders should assume that, in a 
resolution situation, public financial 
support will only be available to a relevant 
entity as a last resort after the relevant UK 
resolution authorities have assessed and 
used, to the maximum extent practicable, 
the resolution tools, including the bail-in 
tool (the Bank of England’s preferred 
approach for the resolution of the Group is 
a bail-in strategy with a single point of 
entry at Barclays PLC). The exercise of any 
of such powers under the Banking Act or 
any suggestion of any such exercise could 
materially adversely affect the value of 
Barclays PLC ordinary shares and could 
lead to shareholders losing some or all of 
their investment.

The ‘no creditor worse off’ safeguard 
within the Banking Act requires that no 
shareholder or creditor must be left worse 
off from the use of resolution powers than 
they would have been if the relevant entity 
entered insolvent liquidation. Whilst 
shareholders may be entitled to 
compensation where there is determined 
to have been a shortfall following a 
valuation, there can be no assurance that 
shareholders would recover any such 
compensation promptly or that such 
compensation will be equivalent to the full 
losses incurred in resolution.

i) Climate risk

Climate risk is the impact on Financial 
(Credit, Market, Treasury & Capital) and 
Operational Risks arising from climate 
change through physical risks and risks 
associated with transitioning to a lower 
carbon economy.

The effects of climate change may be 
highly significant in their breadth and 
magnitude and could affect a large number 
of firms operating in different sectors and 
geographies, leading to potential 
downstream effects to the financial 
system.

Annual Report 2023 263

Material existing and emerging risks (continued)

There is potential direct impact on banks 
and other financial institutions through 
their operations, as well as indirectly 
through customers and clients. Given this 
context and to support the Group’s 
ambition to be a net zero bank by 2050, 
Climate Risk is a Principal Risk under 
Barclays’ ERMF.

Scientific research suggests that physical 
risks arising due to climate change such as 
acute events (e.g. cyclone, hurricanes and 
floods) and chronic events (longer term 
shifts in climate patterns) may occur in 
increasing frequency and severity, 
Potential tipping points can cause 
unprecedented damage to particular 
geographies. Some regions are expected 
to be more severely affected than others if 
they are more exposed and/or more 
vulnerable to certain events.

The potential impact of physical risk 
events on the economy may include lower 
GDP growth, higher unemployment, 
shortage of raw materials and products 
due to supply chain disruptions and 
significant changes in asset prices. These 
factors could subsequently impact 
business model and profitability of Barclays 
and its clients. Damage to the properties 
and operations of the Group's clients could 
decrease their production capacity, 
increase operating costs, affect insurability 
and decrease value of those properties.  
This in turn would lead to a decline in the 
creditworthiness of clients, which may 
result in higher defaults, delinquencies, 
write-offs and impairment charges in the 
Group's portfolios. Physical hazards may 
also impact the creditworthiness of the 
sovereigns of countries in which they 
occur. The deterioration in the credit 
ratings of sovereign bonds could affect 
their access to capital and their eligibility 
for inclusion in banks' liquidity buffers. 
These hazards may also impact the value 
of investments which the Group holds.

A transition to a low-carbon economy 
requires policy and regulatory changes, 
new national or regional commitments, 
new technological innovations and 
changes to supply and demand systems 
within industries. The transition to a low-
carbon economy may also trigger changes 
in consumer behaviour and market 
sentiment. These changes may result in 
increased costs and reduced demand for 
the products and services of a company 
including early retirement and impairment 
of assets, or decreased revenue and 
profitability. 

The Group's clients that are more 
susceptible and exposed to these changes 
may face financial difficulties which in turn 
may impact their creditworthiness. In 
addition, impacts to the creditworthiness 
of the Group's clients, customers and 
counterparties (particularly in high carbon 
sectors), can also arise a result of climate-
related legal actions or investigations, 
where outcomes of such actions have 
material financial impacts. This in turn can 
increase credit risk within group portfolios 
(for further details on credit risk, refer to ii) 
Credit Risk on page 263). Both transition 
and physical risk drivers may lead to 
increased price volatility and repricing of 
market instruments, which in turn may 
impact the value of market instruments 
held by the Group.

The Group's own premises may also suffer 
physical damage due to weather events 
leading to increased costs for the Group. 
As the economy transitions to a lower 
carbon economy, financial institutions also 
face significant and rapid developments in 
stakeholder expectations, policy, law and 
regulation, which could impact lending 
activities and the risks associated with 
lending portfolios as well as asset values. 
Failure to adequately embed climate risk 
management into the risk framework may 
have a material and adverse impact on the 
Barclays' brand, competitiveness, 
profitability, capital requirements, cost of 
funding, financial condition and ability to 
expand its business.

In March 2020, the Group announced its 
ambition to become a net zero bank by 
2050 and its commitment to align all of its 
financing activities with the goals and 
timelines of the Paris Agreement. In order 
to reach these ambitions and targets, and 
any other climate-related ambitions or 
targets the Group may commit to in 
future, the Group will continue to 
incorporate climate considerations into its 
strategy, business model, the products 
and services it provides to customers and 
its financial and non-financial risk 
management processes. These include 
processes to measure and manage the 
various financial and non-financial risks the 
Group faces as a result of climate change. 

The Group also needs to ensure that its 
strategy and business model adapt to 
changing national and international 
standards, industry and scientific 
practices, regulatory requirements and 
market expectations regarding climate 
change, which remain under continuous 
development. 

There remains a possibility that these 
standards, practices, requirements and 
expectations could change in a manner 
that substantially increases the cost or 
effort for the Group to achieve such 
ambitions and targets. In addition, the 
Group’s ambitions and targets may prove 
more challenging to achieve due to 
changing circumstances and external 
factors which are beyond the Group’s 
control, including geopolitical issues, 
energy security, energy poverty and other 
considerations such as a just transition to a 
low-carbon economy. This may be 
exacerbated if the Group chooses or is 
required to accelerate its climate-related 
ambitions or targets as a result of (among 
other things) international regulatory 
developments or stakeholder 
expectations in the UK, the US, the EU or 
other markets.

Achieving Barclays’ climate-related 
ambitions and targets will also depend on a 
number of factors outside the Group’s 
control, including reliable forecasts of 
hazards from the physical climate models 
and availability of data/models to 
measure/assess climate impact on clients. 
The pathway to net zero is uncertain, 
complex and dependent on progress in 
various areas such as advances in low-
carbon technologies, collective action by 
clients to meet their own net zero goals, 
and supportive public policies in markets 
where Barclays operates. If there is a lack 
of progress in the aforementioned areas, 
Barclays may fail to achieve its climate-
related ambitions and targets, and this 
could have a material adverse effect on 
Barclays’ business, operations, financial 
condition, prospects and reputation.

For further details on the potential legal risk from 
failing to achieve our climate-related ambitions and 
targets, refer to page 270.

ii) Credit risk

Credit risk is the risk of loss to the Group 
from the failure of clients, customers or 
counterparties, including sovereigns, to 
fully honour their obligations to members 
of the Group, including the whole and 
timely payment of principal, interest, 
collateral, and other receivables. Credit risk 
is impacted by a number of factors outside 
the Group’s control, including wider 
economic conditions.

a) Impairment

Impairment is calculated in line with the 
requirements of IFRS9. Loss allowances, 
based on ECLs, are measured on a 
forward-looking basis using a broad range 
of financial metrics and application of 
complex judgements. Accordingly, 
impairment charges are potentially volatile 
and may not successfully predict actual 
credit losses, particularly under stressed 
conditions. Failure by the Group to 
accurately estimate credit losses through 
ECLs could have a material adverse effect 
on the Group's business, results of 
operations, financial condition, and 
prospects. 
+

For further details, refer to Note 8.

b) Specific portfolios, sectors and 
concentrations

The Group is subject to risks arising from 
changes in credit quality and recovery rates 
for loans and advances due from borrowers 
and counterparties. Additionally, the Group 
is subject to a concentration of those risks 
where it has significant exposures to 
borrowers and counterparties in specific 
sectors, or to particular types of borrowers 
and counterparties. Any deterioration in 
the credit quality of such borrowers and 
counterparties could lead to lower 
recoverability from loans and advances, 
and higher impairment charges. 
Accordingly, any of the following areas of 
uncertainty could have a material adverse 
impact on the Group's business, results of 
operations,  financial condition, and 
prospects:

• Consumer affordability: this remains a 

key area of focus, particularly in 
unsecured lending, as cost of living 
pressures persist. Macroeconomic 
factors, such as unemployment, high 
interest rates or broader inflationary 
pressures, which impact a customer’s 
ability to service debt payments, could 
lead to increased arrears in both 
unsecured and secured products.

• UK Retail, Hospitality and Leisure: 

despite holding up reasonably well during 
most of 2023, continuing cost of living 
pressures, falling consumer confidence, 
or other macroeconomic factors 
adversely affecting consumers could 
trigger a contraction in demand which, 
together with rising business costs and, 
for UK retail, a structural shift to online 
shopping, would add pressure to sectors 
heavily reliant on consumer discretionary 
spending during 2024. This represents a 
potential risk in the Group’s UK 
corporate portfolio as a higher 
probability of default exists for retailers, 

hospitality providers and their landlords 
while these pressures remain.

• Real Estate: UK property represents a 

significant portion of the Group's overall 
retail and corporate credit exposure, and 
the Group remains at risk of increased 
impairment from a material fall in 
property prices. During 2023 rising 
mortgage interest rates and increasing 
economic concerns have reduced both 
housing market activity and customer 
borrowing capacity, resulting in modest 
house price declines year on year. These 
challenging market conditions are likely 
to continue in 2024 as the effect of 
higher interest rates continues to feed 
through to disposable incomes, 
especially in London and the South East 
of the UK where the Group has a high 
exposure. Additionally, as mortgages roll 
off existing rates onto new higher rates, 
there is a risk of increased borrower 
defaults. This could put further 
downward pressure on property prices 
and, in turn, impact the Group’s 
impairment and capital position. 
Furthermore, certain segments of the 
housing market could be subject to 
specific valuation impacts (for example, 
certain properties within the Group's 
residential loan portfolio may be subject 
to remediation activities relating to fire 
safety standards). The Group’s 
corporate exposure is conservatively 
positioned with low LTVs but remains 
vulnerable to a deteriorating economic 
environment, and moderate stress has 
been experienced in the Group's 
(predominantly) US office commercial 
real estate exposure during 2023. As 
structural shifts in working patterns, such 
as the normalisation of ‘hybrid’ working, 
mature, the Group remains exposed to 
further stress. Landlords serving 
business tenants whose income is based 
on discretionary consumer spending are 
also at risk from reduced rent collection.

• Leveraged Finance Underwriting:the 

Group takes on non-investment grade 
underwriting exposures, including single 
name risk, particularly in the US and the 
UK. The subdued investor appetite in the 
underwriting market during 2023 
exposed the Group to extended 
underwriting periods and negative 
movements in marks, which could 
deteriorate further and result in losses 
for the Group (and higher capital 
charges) if market conditions remain 
challenging during 2024 and exposures 
remain on book for further extended 
periods.

• Oil & Gas sector: high market energy 

prices during 2023 have helped restore 
balance sheet strength to companies 
operating in this sector. However, in the 
longer term, costs associated with the 
transition towards renewable sources of 
energy may place greater financial 
demands on oil and gas companies. 

• Air Travel: the sector returned to profit in 
2023 as lower margin (tourist) demand 
for air travel recovered to pre-pandemic 
levels. That said, there remains a 
heightened risk to the revenue streams 
of the Group’s clients and, 
consequentially, their ability to service 
debt obligation. These risks stem from 
the structural decline in higher margin 
business travel, consolidation within the 
European airline market, reputational 
damage and/or costs associated with 
the emerging ‘fake parts’ scandal, volatile 
oil prices, increasingly extreme weather 
patterns and concerns about the impact 
of air travel on climate change.

• Information Technology sector: while 
dominated by well-known US firms, 
many companies struggle to monetise 
their product offerings and face 
increasing reputational risk particularly as 
regulatory scrutiny increases. Given the 
nature of their activities, the Group’s 
clients in this sector face heightened risk 
from data security breaches and 
ransomware and/or cyber attacks as well 
as from the malicious use of Artificial 
Intelligence, all of which could negatively 
impact their ability to service debt 
obligations.

The Group also has large individual 
exposures to single name counterparties 
(such as brokers, central clearing houses, 
dealers, banks, mutual and hedge funds, 
and other institutional clients) in both its 
lending and trading activities, including 
derivative trades. The default of one such 
counterparty could cause contagion across 
clients involved in similar activities and/or 
adversely impact asset values should 
margin calls necessitate rapid asset 
disposals by that counterparty to raise 
liquidity. In addition, where such 
counterparty risk has been mitigated by 
taking collateral, credit risk may remain high 
if the collateral held cannot be monetised 
or has to be liquidated at prices which are 
insufficient to recover the full amount of 
the loan or derivative exposure. 

Any such defaults could have a material 
adverse effect on the Group’s results due 
to, for example, increased credit losses and 
higher impairment charges.

counterparties (particularly in high carbon 
sectors), can also arise out of climate-
related legal actions or investigations 
commenced against the Group's clients, 
customers and counterparties (particularly 
in high carbon sectors), where outcomes 
of such actions have material financial 
impacts, which can in turn increase credit 
risk within Group portfolios.
+

For further details on the Group’s approach to credit 
risk, refer to the credit risk management and credit risk 
performance sections.

iii) Market risk

Market risk is the risk of loss arising from 
potential adverse changes in the value of 
the Group’s assets and liabilities from 
fluctuation in market variables including, 
but not limited to, interest rates, foreign 
exchange rates, equity prices, commodity 
prices, credit spreads, implied volatilities 
and asset correlations.

Economic and financial market 
uncertainties remain elevated, driven by 
elevated inflation and tightening monetary 
policy, both of which are exacerbated by  
geopolitical conflicts and idiosyncratic 
market events. A disruptive adjustment to 
higher or lower interest rate levels and 
deteriorating trade and geopolitical 
tensions could heighten market risks for 
the Group’s portfolios.

In addition, the Group’s trading business 
could be vulnerable were there to be 
prolonged period of elevated asset price 
volatility, particularly if it adversely affects 
market liquidity. Such a scenario could 
impact the Group’s ability to execute client 
trades and may also result in lower client 
flow-driven income and/or market-based 
losses on its existing portfolio of assets. 
These can include higher hedging costs 
from rebalancing risks that need to be 
managed dynamically as market levels and 
their associated volatilities change.

Changes in market conditions could have a 
material adverse effect on the Group’s 
business, results of operations, financial 
condition and prospects.
+

For further details on the Group’s approach to 
market risk, refer to the market risk management and 
market risk performance sections.

iv) Treasury and capital risk

There are three primary types of treasury 
and capital risk faced by the Group:
a) Liquidity risk

Liquidity risk is the risk that the Group is 
unable to meet its contractual or 
contingent obligations or that it does not 
have the appropriate amount, tenor and 
composition of funding and liquidity to 
support its assets. This could cause the 
Group to fail to meet regulatory and/or 
internal liquidity requirements, make 

repayments of principal or interest  as they 
fall due or to support day-to-day business 
activities. Key liquidity risks that the Group 
faces include:

• Stability of the Group’s deposit funding 
profile: deposits which are payable on 
demand or at short notice could be 
adversely affected by the Group failing 
to preserve the current level of 
customer and investor confidence or as 
a result of competition in the banking 
industry.

• Ongoing access to wholesale funding: 

the Group regularly accesses the money 
and capital markets to provide short-
term and long-term unsecured and 
secured funding to support its 
operations. A loss of counterparty 
confidence, or adverse market 
conditions (such as the recent rises in 
interest rates) could lead to a reduction 
in the tenor, or an increase in the costs, 
of the Group’s unsecured and secured 
wholesale funding or affect the Group’s 
access to such funding.

• Impacts of market volatility: adverse 
market conditions, with increased 
volatility in asset prices could: (i) 
negatively impact the Group’s liquidity 
position through increased derivative 
margin requirements and/or wider 
haircuts when monetising liquidity pool 
securities; and (ii) make it more difficult 
for the Group to execute secured 
financing transactions.

• Intraday liquidity usage: increased 

collateral requirements for payments 
and securities settlement systems could 
negatively impact the Group’s liquidity 
position, as cash and liquid assets 
required for intraday purposes are 
unavailable to meet other outflows.

• Off-balance sheet commitments: 

deterioration in economic and market 
conditions could cause customers to 
draw on off-balance sheet 
commitments provided to them, for 
example revolving credit facilities, 
negatively affecting the Group’s liquidity 
position.

• Credit rating changes and impact on 

funding costs: any reductions in a credit 
rating (in particular, any downgrade 
below investment grade) may affect the 
Group’s access to money or capital 
markets and/or the terms on which the 
Group is able to obtain market funding 
(for example, this could lead to 
increased costs of funding and wider 
credit spreads, the triggering of 
additional collateral or other 
requirements in derivative contracts and 
other secured funding arrangements, or 

limits on the range of counterparties 
who are willing to enter into transactions 
with the Group).

b) Capital risk

Capital risk is the risk that the Group has an 
insufficient level or composition of capital 
to support its normal business activities 
and to meet its regulatory capital 
requirements under normal operating 
environments and stressed conditions 
(both actual and as defined for internal 
planning or regulatory stress testing 
purposes). This also includes the risk from 
the Group’s pension plans. Key capital risks 
that the Group faces include:

• Failure to meet prudential capital 

requirements: this could lead to the 
Group being unable to support some or 
all of its business activities, a failure to 
pass regulatory stress tests, increased 
cost of funding due to deterioration in 
investor appetite or credit ratings and 
restrictions on distributions (including in 
respect of its shares and/or additional 
tier 1 instruments), leading to an inability 
to comply with the Group's distribution 
policy and/or the need to take additional 
measures to strengthen the Group’s 
capital or leverage position.

• Adverse changes in FX rates impacting 
capital ratios: the Group has capital 
resources, risk weighted assets and 
leverage exposures denominated in 
foreign currencies. Changes in foreign 
currency exchange rates may adversely 
impact the sterling equivalent value of 
these items. As a result, the Group’s 
regulatory capital ratios are sensitive to 
foreign currency movements. Failure to 
appropriately manage the Group’s 
balance sheet to take account of foreign 
currency movements could result in an 
adverse impact on the Group’s 
regulatory capital and leverage ratios.

• Adverse movements in the pension 

fund: adverse movements in pension 
assets and liabilities for defined benefit 
pension schemes could result in deficits 
on a technical provision and/or IAS 19 
accounting basis. This could lead to the 
Group making substantial additional 
contributions to its pension plans and/or 
a deterioration in its capital position. The 
market value of pension fund assets 
might decline or investment returns 
might reduce. Under IAS 19, the 
liabilities discount rate is derived from 
the yields of high-quality corporate 
bonds. Therefore, the valuation of the 
Group’s defined benefits schemes 
would be adversely affected by a 
prolonged fall in the discount rate due to 
a persistent low interest rate and/or

credit spread environment. Inflation is 
another significant risk driver to the 
pension fund as the liabilities are 
adversely impacted by an increase in 
long-term inflation expectations.

c) Interest rate risk in the banking book

Interest rate risk in the banking book is the 
risk that the Group is exposed to capital or 
income volatility because of a mismatch 
between the interest rate exposures of its 
(non-traded) assets and liabilities. The 
Group’s hedging programmes for interest 
rate risk in the banking book rely on 
behavioural assumptions and, as a result, 
the effectiveness of the hedging strategy 
cannot be guaranteed. A potential 
mismatch in the balance or duration of the 
hedging assumptions could lead to 
earnings deterioration if there are interest 
rate movements which are not adequately 
hedged. A decline in interest rates may 
also compress net interest margin on retail 
and corporate portfolios. In addition, the 
Group’s liquid asset portfolio is exposed to 
potential capital and/or income volatility 
due to movements in market rates and 
prices which may have a material adverse 
effect on the capital position of the Group.
+ For further details on the Group’s approach to 
treasury and capital risk, refer to the treasury and 
capital risk management and treasury and capital risk 
performance sections.

v) Operational risk

Operational risk is the risk of loss to the 
Group from inadequate or failed processes 
or systems, human factors or due to 
external events where the root cause is 
not due to credit or market risks. Examples 
include:
a) Operational resilience

The Group functions in a highly 
competitive market, with customers and 
clients that expect consistent and smooth 
business processes. The loss of or 
disruption to business processing is a 
material inherent risk within the Group and 
across the financial services industry, 
whether arising through failures in the 
Group’s technology systems, cyber and/or 
data integrity disruptions, unavailability of a 
Group site, closure of real estate services 
provided through its retail branch network, 
or unavailability of personnel or services 
supplied by third parties, and there are 
particular challenges with recovering from 
a major cyberattack. Failure to build 
resilience and recovery capabilities into 
business processes, or into the services on 
which the Group’s business processes 
depend, may result in significant customer 
detriment, costs to reimburse losses 
incurred by the Group’s customers and 
clients, and reputational damage.
b) Cyberattacks

Cyberattacks continue to be a global 
threat inherent across all industries, with 
the number and severity of attacks 
continuing to rise. The financial sector 
remains a primary target for 
cybercriminals, hostile nation states, 
opportunists and hacktivists. The Group, 
like other financial institutions, experiences 
numerous attempts to compromise its 
cybersecurity protections. In 2023, 
cybersecurity incidents experienced by 
Barclays included distributed denial of 
service (DDoS), phishing, credential 
stuffing, and exploitation of software 
vulnerabilities.

The Group cannot provide absolute 
security against cyberattacks. Malicious 
actors, who are increasingly sophisticated 
in their methods, tactics, techniques and 
procedures, seek to steal money, gain 
unauthorised access to, destroy or 
manipulate data, and disrupt operations. 
Further, some of their attacks may not be 
recognised or discovered until launched or 
after initial entry into the environment, 
such as novel or zero-day attacks that are 
launched before patches are available and 
defences can be readied. Other attacks 
may take advantage of the window during 
which patching or the deployment of other 
defences is underway, but not yet 
complete. Malicious actors are also 
increasingly developing methods to avoid 
prevention, detection and alerting 
capabilities, including employing counter-
forensic tactics making response activities 
more difficult. Cyberattacks can originate 
from a wide variety of sources and target 
the Group in numerous ways, including 
attacks on networks, systems, applications 
or devices used by the Group or parties 
such as service providers and other 
suppliers, counterparties, employees, 
contractors, customers or clients, 
presenting the Group with a vast and 
complex defence perimeter. Moreover, 
the Group does not have direct control 
over the cybersecurity of the systems of 
its clients, customers, counterparties and 
third-party service providers and suppliers, 
limiting the Group’s ability to effectively 
protect and defend against certain threats  
Some of the Group’s third-party service 
providers and suppliers have experienced 
successful attempts to compromise their 
cybersecurity. These have included 
ransomware attacks that have disrupted 
the service providers’ or suppliers’ 
operations and, in some cases, have had 
impacts on the Group's operations. Such 
cyberattacks are likely to continue.

A failure in the Group’s adherence to its 
cybersecurity policies, procedures or 
controls, employee malfeasance, and 

human, governance or technological error 
could also compromise the Group’s ability 
to successfully prevent and defend against 
cyberattacks. Furthermore, certain legacy 
technologies that are at or approaching 
end-of-life may not be able to maintain 
acceptable levels of security. The Group 
has experienced cybersecurity incidents 
and near-misses in the past, and it is 
inevitable that additional incidents will 
occur in the future. Cybersecurity risks are 
expected to increase, due to factors such 
as the increasing demand across the 
industry and customer expectations for 
continued expansion of services delivered 
over the Internet; increasing reliance on 
Internet-based products, applications and 
data storage; the onset of AI, which may be 
used to facilitate increasingly sophisticated 
attacks; and changes in ways of working by 
the Group’s employees, contractors, and 
third party service providers and suppliers 
and their subcontractors as a long-term 
consequence of the COVID-19 pandemic. 
Bad actors have taken advantage of 
remote working practices and modified 
customer behaviours, exploiting the 
situation in novel ways that may elude 
defences. Additionally, geopolitical turmoil 
may serve to increase the risk of a 
cyberattack that could impact Barclays 
directly, or indirectly through its critical 
suppliers or national infrastructure. In 
recent years, the Group has faced a 
heightened risk of cyberattack as a result 
of the conflicts in Eastern Europe and the 
Middle East.

Common types of cyberattacks include 
deployment of malware to obtain covert 
access to systems and data; ransomware 
attacks that render systems and data 
unavailable through encryption and 
attempts to leverage business interruption 
or stolen data for extortion; novel or zero-
day exploits; denial of service and 
distributed denial of service attacks; 
infiltration via business email compromise; 
social engineering, including phishing, 
vishing and smishing; automated attacks 
using botnets; third-party customer, 
vendor, service provider and supplier 
account takeover; malicious activity 
facilitated by an insider; and credential 
validation or stuffing attacks using login 
and password pairs from unrelated 
breaches. A successful cyberattack of any 
type has the potential to cause serious 
harm to the Group or its clients and 
customers, including exposure to potential 
contractual liability, claims, litigation, 
regulatory or other government action, 
loss of existing or potential customers, 
damage to the Group’s brand and 
reputation, and other financial loss. The

impact of a successful cyberattack is also 
likely to include operational consequences 
(such as unavailability of services, 
networks, systems, devices or data), 
remediation of which could come at 
significant cost.

Regulators worldwide continue to 
recognise cybersecurity as a systemic risk 
to the financial sector and have highlighted 
the need for financial institutions to 
improve their monitoring and control of, 
and resilience to, cyberattacks. A 
successful cyberattack may, therefore, 
result in significant regulatory fines on the 
Group. In addition, any new regulatory 
measures introduced to mitigate these 
risks are likely to result in increased 
technology and compliance costs for the 
Group.
+ For further details on the Group’s approach to 

cyberattacks, see the operational risk performance 
section. For further details on cybersecurity regulation 
applicable to the Group, refer to the Supervision and 
regulation section.

c) New and emergent technology 

Technology is fundamental to the Group’s 
business and the financial services 
industry. Technological advancements 
present opportunities to develop new and 
innovative ways of doing business across 
the Group, with new solutions being 
developed both in-house and in 
association with third party companies. For 
example, payment services and securities, 
futures and options trading are 
increasingly occurring electronically, both 
on the Group’s own systems and through 
other alternative systems, and becoming 
automated. Whilst increased use of 
electronic payment and trading systems 
and direct electronic access to trading 
markets could significantly reduce the 
Group’s cost base, it may, conversely, 
reduce the commissions, fees and margins 
made by the Group on these transactions 
which could have a material adverse effect 
on the Group’s business, results of 
operations, financial condition and 
prospects. The rapid development in AI is 
another area the Group is monitoring 
closely. This includes the identification of 
potential use cases for responsible 
adoption of AI in the Group's own 
operations as well as managing the threats 
third party usage of AI may pose, including 
with respect to cybersecurity and fraud. 

Introducing new forms of technology, 
however, has the potential to increase 
inherent risk. Failure to evaluate, actively 
manage and closely monitor risk during all 
phases of business development and 
implementation could introduce new 
vulnerabilities and security flaws and have a 
material adverse effect on the Group’s 

business, results of operations, financial 
condition and prospects.
d) External fraud

The nature of fraud is wide-ranging and 
continues to evolve, as criminals seek 
opportunities to target the Group’s 
business activities and exploit changes in 
customer behaviour and product and 
channel use (such as the increased use of 
digital products and enhanced online 
services) or exploit new products. Fraud 
attacks can be very sophisticated and are 
often orchestrated by organised crime 
groups who use various techniques to 
target customers and clients directly to 
obtain confidential or personal information 
that can be used to commit fraud. The UK 
market has also seen significant growth in 
‘scams’ where the Group takes increased 
levels of liability as part of a voluntary code 
to provide additional safeguards to 
customers and clients who are tricked into 
making payments to fraudsters. The 
impact from fraud can lead to customer 
detriment, financial losses (including the 
reimbursement of losses incurred by 
customers), loss of business, missed 
business opportunities and reputational 
damage, all of which could have a material 
adverse impact on the Group’s business, 
results of operations, financial condition 
and prospects.
e) Data management and information 
protection

The Group holds and processes large 
volumes of data, including personal 
information, financial data and other 
confidential information, and the Group’s 
businesses are subject to complex and 
evolving laws and regulations governing 
the privacy and protection of data, 
including Regulation (EU) 2016/679 (the 
General Data Protection Regulation as it 
applies in the EU and the UK). This data 
could relate to: (i) the Group’s clients, 
customers,  prospective clients and 
customers and their employees; (ii) clients 
and customers of the Group’s clients and 
customers and their employees;(iii) the 
Group’s suppliers, counterparties and 
other external parties, and their 
employees; and (iv) the Group’s 
employees and prospective employees. 

The international nature of both the 
Group’s business and its IT infrastructure 
also means that data and personal 
information may be available in countries 
other than those from where the 
information originated. Accordingly, the 
Group must ensure that its collection, use, 
transfer and storage of data, including 
personal information, complies with all 
applicable laws and regulations in all 

relevant jurisdictions, which could: (i) 
increase the Group’s compliance and 
operating costs; (ii) impact the 
development of new products or services 
or the offering of existing products or 
services; (iii) affect how products and 
services are offered to clients and 
customers; (iv) demand significant 
oversight by the Group’s management; 
and (v) require the Group to review some 
elements of the structure of its 
businesses, operations and systems in less 
efficient ways. Concerns regarding the 
effectiveness of the Group’s measures to 
safeguard data, including personal 
information, or even the perception that 
those measures are inadequate, could 
expose the Group to the risk of loss or 
unavailability of data or data integrity 
issues and/or cause the Group to lose 
existing or potential clients and customers, 
and thereby reduce the Group’s revenues. 
Furthermore, any failure or perceived 
failure by the Group to comply with 
applicable privacy or data protection laws 
and regulations may subject it to potential 
contractual liability, claims, litigation, 
regulatory or other government action 
(including significant regulatory fines) and 
require changes to certain operations or 
practices which could also inhibit the 
Group’s development or marketing of 
certain products or services, or increase 
the costs of offering them to customers. 
Any of these events could damage the 
Group’s reputation, subject the Group to 
material fines or other monetary penalties, 
make the Group liable for the payment of 
compensatory damages, divert 
management's time and attention, lead to 
enhanced regulatory oversight and 
otherwise materially adversely affect its 
business, results of operations, financial 
condition and prospects. 
+

For further details on data protection regulation 
applicable to the Group, refer to the supervision and 
regulation section.
f) Algorithmic trading

In some areas of the investment banking 
business, trading algorithms are used to 
price and risk manage client and principal 
transactions. An algorithmic error could 
result in erroneous or duplicated 
transactions, a system outage, or impact 
the Group’s pricing abilities, which could 
have a material adverse effect on the 
Group’s business, results of operations, 
financial condition, prospects and 
reputation.
g) Processing errors

The Group’s businesses are highly 
dependent on its ability to process and 
monitor, on a daily basis, a very large 
number of transactions, many of which are

Material existing and emerging risks (continued)

highly complex and occur at high volumes 
and frequencies, across numerous and 
diverse markets in many currencies. As the 
Group’s customer base and geographical 
reach expand and the volume, speed, 
frequency and complexity of transactions, 
especially electronic transactions (as well 
as the requirements to report such 
transactions on a real-time basis to clients, 
regulators and exchanges) increase, 
developing, maintaining and upgrading 
operational systems and infrastructure 
becomes more challenging. The risk of 
systems or human error in connection with 
such transactions increases with these 
developments, as well as the potential 
consequences of such errors due to the 
speed and volume of transactions involved 
and the potential difficulty associated with 
discovering errors quickly enough to limit 
the resulting consequences. Furthermore, 
events that are wholly or partially beyond 
the Group’s control, such as a spike in 
transaction volume, could adversely affect 
the Group’s ability to process transactions 
or provide banking and payment services.

Processing errors could result in the 
Group, among other things: (i) failing to 
provide information, services and liquidity 
to clients and counterparties in a timely 
manner; (ii) failing to settle and/or confirm 
transactions; (iii) causing funds transfers, 
capital markets trades and/or other 
transactions to be executed erroneously, 
illegally or with unintended consequences; 
and (iv) adversely affecting financial, 
trading or currency markets. Any of these 
events could materially disadvantage the 
Group’s customers, clients and 
counterparties (including them suffering 
financial loss) and/or result in a loss of 
confidence in the Group which, in turn, 
could have a material adverse effect on the 
Group’s business, results of operations, 
financial condition and prospects. Any of 
these events could also lead to breaches 
of laws, rules or regulations and, hence, 
regulatory enforcement actions, which 
could result in significant financial loss, 
imposition of additional capital 
requirements, enhanced regulatory 
supervision and reputational damage.
h) Supplier exposure

The Group depends on suppliers for the 
provision of many of its services and the 
development of technology. Whilst the 
Group depends on suppliers, it remains 
fully accountable to its customers and 
clients for risks arising from the actions of 
suppliers and may not be able to recover 
from its suppliers any amounts paid to 
customers and clients for losses suffered 
by them. The dependency on suppliers and 
sub-contracting of outsourced services 

introduces concentration risk where the 
failure of specific suppliers could have an 
impact on the Group’s ability to continue 
to provide material services to its 
customers. 

Failure to adequately manage supplier risk 
could have a material adverse effect on the 
Group’s business, results of operations, 
financial condition and prospects.
i) Estimates and judgements relating to 
critical accounting policies and 
regulatory disclosures

The preparation of financial statements 
requires the application of accounting 
policies and judgements to be made in 
accordance with IFRS. Regulatory returns 
and capital disclosures are prepared in 
accordance with the relevant capital 
reporting requirements and also require 
assumptions and estimates to be made. 
The key areas involving a higher degree of 
judgement or complexity, or areas where 
assumptions are significant to the 
consolidated and individual financial 
statements and regulatory returns and 
disclosures, include credit impairment 
provisions, taxes, fair value of financial 
instruments, goodwill and intangible 
assets, pensions and post-retirement 
benefits, the calculation of RWAs and 
capital, and provisions including conduct 
and legal, competition and regulatory 
matters (please refer to the notes to the 
audited financial statements for further 
details). There is a risk that if the 
judgement exercised, or the estimates or 
assumptions used, subsequently turn out 
to be incorrect or are altered as a result of 
subsequent feedback from the Group's 
regulators, this could result in material 
losses to the Group, beyond what was 
anticipated or provided for, including as a 
result of changes to treatments in 
regulatory returns and capital disclosures. 
If capital requirements are not met as the 
result of changes in interpretation, 
compliance with the Group's distribution 
policy could be impacted and/or additional 
measures may be required to strengthen 
the Group's capital or leverage position, 
which may also lead to the Group's inability 
to achieve stated targets. Further 
development of accounting standards and 
regulatory interpretations could also 
materially impact the Group’s results of 
operations, financial condition and 
prospects.

j) Tax risk

The Group is required to comply with the 
domestic and international tax laws and 
practice of all countries in which it has 
business operations. There is a risk that 
the Group could suffer losses due to 
additional tax charges, other financial costs 
or reputational damage as a result of failing 
to comply with such laws and practice 
(including where the Group’s interpretation 
of such laws differs from the interpretation 
of tax authorities), or by failing to manage 
its tax affairs in an appropriate manner, 
with much of this risk attributable to the 
international structure of the Group. In 
addition, the introduction of new 
international tax regimes, increasing tax 
authority focus on reporting and disclosure 
requirements around the world as well as 
the digitisation of the administration of tax 
have the potential to increase the Group’s 
tax compliance obligations further.

In 2023, the UK Government enacted 
legislation on the OECD Inclusive 
Framework on Base Erosion and Profit 
Shifting Pillar Two Framework introducing 
a global minimum tax rate of 15%. 

The UK’s Pillar Two rules apply for 
accounting periods beginning on or after 
31 December 2023 which will increase the 
Group's tax compliance obligations. In the 
USA, the corporate alternative minimum 
tax on adjusted financial statements 
income introduced by the Inflation 
Reduction Act became effective on 1 
January 2023. These new tax regimes 
require systems and process changes that 
introduce potential additional operational 
risks. 
k) Ability to hire and retain appropriately 
qualified employees

As a regulated financial institution, the 
Group requires diversified and specialist 
skilled colleagues. The Group’s ability to 
attract, develop and retain a diverse mix of 
talent is key to the delivery of its core 
business activity and strategy. This is 
impacted by a range of external and 
internal factors, such as macroeconomic 
factors, labour and immigration policy in 
the jurisdictions in which the Group 
operates, industry-wide headcount 
reductions in particular sectors, regulatory 
limits on compensation for senior 
executives and the potential effects on 
employee engagement and wellbeing from 
long-term periods of working remotely. 
Failure to attract or prevent the departure 
of appropriately qualified and skilled 
employees could have a material adverse 
effect on the Group’s business, results of 
operations, financial condition and 
prospects. Additionally, this may result in

disruption to service which could in turn 
lead to customer detriment and 
reputational damage.
+ For further details on the Group’s approach 
to operational risk, refer to the operational 
risk management and operational risk 
performance sections.

vi) Model risk

Model risk is the potential for adverse 
consequences from decisions based on 
incorrect or misused model outputs and 
reports. The Group relies on models to 
support a broad range of business and risk 
management activities, including informing 
business decisions and strategies, 
measuring and limiting risk, valuing 
exposures (including the calculation of 
impairment), conducting stress testing, 
calculating RWAs and assessing capital 
adequacy, supporting new business 
acceptance, risk and reward evaluation, 
managing client assets, and meeting 
reporting requirements.

Models are, by their nature, imperfect 
representations of reality and have some 
degree of uncertainty because they rely on 
assumptions and inputs, and so are subject 
to intrinsic uncertainty, errors and 
inappropriate use affecting the accuracy of 
their outputs. This may be exacerbated 
when dealing with unprecedented 
scenarios, as was the case during the 
COVID-19 pandemic, due to the lack of 
reliable historical reference points and 
data. For instance, the quality of the data 
used in models across the Group has a 
material impact on the accuracy and 
completeness of its risk and financial 
metrics. Model uncertainty, errors and 
inappropriate use may result in (among 
other things) the Group making 
inappropriate business decisions and/or 
inaccuracies or errors in the Group’s risk 
management and regulatory reporting 
processes. This could result in significant 
financial loss, imposition of additional 
capital requirements, enhanced regulatory 
supervision and reputational damage, all of 
which could have a material adverse effect 
on the Group’s business, results of 
operations, financial condition and 
prospects.
+ For further details on the Group’s approach 
to model risk, refer to the model risk 
management and model risk performance 
sections.

vii) Compliance risk

Compliance risk is the risk of poor 
outcomes for, or harm to, customers, 
clients and markets, arising from the 
delivery of the Group's products and 
services (conduct risk) and the risk to 
Barclays, its clients, customers or markets 
from a failure to comply with the laws, rules 
and regulations (LRR) applicable to the 

firm. This risk could manifest itself in a 
variety of ways, including:
a) Market conduct

The Group’s businesses are exposed to 
risk from potential non-compliance with its 
policies and standards (which incorporates 
regulatory requirements set by law and our 
regulators) and instances of wilful and 
negligent misconduct by employees, all of 
which could result in potential customer 
and client detriment, enforcement action 
(including regulatory fines and/or 
sanctions), increased operation and 
compliance costs, redress or remediation 
or reputational damage which in turn could 
have a material adverse effect on the 
Group’s business, financial condition and 
prospects. Examples of employee 
misconduct which could have a material 
adverse effect on the Group’s business 
include: (i) improperly selling or marketing 
the Group’s products and services; (ii) 
engaging in insider trading, market 
manipulation or unauthorised trading; or 
(iii) misappropriating confidential or 
proprietary information belonging to the 
Group, its customers or third parties. 

These risks may be exacerbated in 
circumstances where the Group is unable to 
rely on physical oversight and supervision of 
employees, noting the move to a hybrid 
working model for many colleagues. 
b) Customer protection

The Group must ensure that its customers, 
particularly those that are vulnerable, are 
able to make well-informed decisions on 
how best to use the Group’s financial 
services and understand the protection 
available to them if something goes wrong. 
Poor customer outcomes can result from 
the failure to: (i) communicate fairly and 
clearly with customers; (ii) provide services in 
a timely and fair manner; (iii) handle and 
protect customer data appropriately; and 
(iv) undertake appropriate activity to address 
customer detriment, including the 
adherence to regulatory and legal 
requirements on complaint handling. The 
Group is at risk of financial loss and 
reputational damage as a result also a risk of 
regulatory censure or enforcement action. 

In July 2023, the FCA’s new Consumer 
Duty came into force for new and existing 
products or services that are open to sale 
or renewal. It will apply to closed products 
and services from 31 July 2024. The duty 
sets higher expectations for the standard 
of care that firms provide to retail 
customers and impacts all aspects of 
Barclays’ retail businesses, including every 
retail customer journey, product and 
service as well as our relationships with 
partners, suppliers and third parties. This 

has resulted in significant implementation 
costs and there will also be higher ongoing 
costs for the industry as a result of 
extensive monitoring and evidential 
requirements.
c) Product design and review risk 

Products and services must meet the needs 
of clients, customers, markets and the 
Group throughout their life cycle, However, 
there is a risk that the design and review of 
the Group’s products and services fail to 
reasonably consider and address potential 
or actual negative outcomes for customers, 
which may result in customer detriment, 
enforcement action (including regulatory 
fines and/or sanctions), redress and 
remediation and reputational damage. Both 
the design and review of products and 
services are a key area of focus for 
regulators and the Group. 
d) Financial crime

The Group may be adversely affected if it 
fails to effectively mitigate the risk that third 
parties or its employees facilitate, or that its 
products and services are used to facilitate, 
financial crime (money laundering, terrorist 
financing, breaches of economic and 
financial sanctions, bribery and corruption, 
and the facilitation of tax evasion). UK and 
US regulations covering financial institutions 
continue to focus on combating financial 
crime. Failure to comply may lead to 
enforcement or other action by the Group’s 
regulators, including severe penalties, which 
may have a material adverse effect on the 
Group’s business, financial condition, 
prospects and reputation.
e) Conflicts of interest

Identifying and managing conflicts of 
interest is fundamental to the conduct of 
the Group's business, relationships with 
customers and clients, and the markets in 
which the Group operates. Understanding 
the Conflicts of Interest that impact or 
potentially impact the Group enables them 
to be identified, managed and mitigated 
appropriately. Even if there is no evidence of 
improper actions, a conflict of interest can 
create an appearance of impropriety that 
undermines confidence in the Group and its 
employees. If the Group does not identify 
and manage conflicts of interest (business 
or personal) appropriately, it could have an  
adverse effect on the Group’s business, 
customers and the markets within which it 
operates. 
f) Regulatory focus on culture and 
accountability

Regulators around the world continue to 
emphasise the importance of culture and 
personal accountability and enforce the 
adoption of adequate internal reporting and 
whistleblowing procedures to help to

promote appropriate conduct and drive 
positive outcomes for customers, 
colleagues, clients and markets. The 
requirements and expectations of the UK 
Senior Managers Regime, Certification 
Regime and Conduct Rules reinforce 
additional accountabilities for individuals 
across the Group, with an increased focus 
on governance and rigour, with similar 
requirements also introduced in other 
jurisdictions globally. Failure to meet these 
requirements and expectations may lead to 
regulatory sanctions, both for the individuals 
and the Group.
g) Laws, rules and regulations

Barclays is subject to range of laws, rules 
and regulations across the world. A failure 
to comply with these may have an adverse 
effect on the Barclays Bank Group’s 
business, customers and the markets 
within which it operates and could result in 
reputational damage, penalties, damages 
or fines.
+ For further details on the Group’s approach to 
compliance risk, refer to the compliance risk 
management and compliance risk performance 
sections.

viii) Reputation risk

Reputation risk is the risk that an action, 
transaction, investment, event, decision or 
business relationship will reduce trust in 
the Group’s integrity and/or competence.

Any material lapse in standards of integrity, 
compliance, customer service or operating 
efficiency may represent a potential 
reputation risk. Stakeholder expectations 
constantly evolve, and so reputation risk is 
dynamic and varies between geographical 
regions, groups and individuals. A risk 
arising in one business area can have an 
adverse effect upon the Group’s overall 
reputation and any one transaction, 
investment or event (in the perception of 
key stakeholders) can reduce trust in the 
Group’s integrity and competence. The 
Group’s association with sensitive topics 
and sectors has been, and in some 
instances continues to be, an area of 
concern for stakeholders, including: (i) the 
financing of, and investments in, 
businesses which operate in sectors that 
are sensitive because of their relative 
carbon intensity or local environmental 
impact; (ii) potential association with 
human rights violations (including 
combating modern slavery) in the Group’s 
operations or supply chain and by clients 
and customers; and (iii) the financing of 
businesses which manufacture and export 
military and riot control goods and 
services. 

Reputation risk could also arise from 
negative public opinion about the actual, or 
perceived, manner in which the Group 
(including its employees, clients and other 
associations) conducts its business 
activities, or the Group’s financial 
performance, as well as actual or perceived 
practices in banking and the financial 
services industry generally. 
Modern technologies, in particular, online 
social media channels and other broadcast 
tools that facilitate communication with 
large audiences in short time frames and 
with minimal costs, may significantly 
enhance and accelerate the distribution 
and effect of damaging information and 
allegations. Negative public opinion may 
adversely affect the Group’s ability to 
retain and attract customers, in particular, 
corporate and retail depositors, and to 
retain and motivate staff, and could have a 
material adverse effect on the Group’s 
business, results of operations, financial 
condition and prospects. Claims of 
potential greenwashing arising from 
sustainability-related statements made by 
Barclays may also give rise to reputation 
risk.
In addition to the above, reputation risk has 
the potential to arise from operational 
issues or conduct matters which cause 
detriment to customers, clients, market 
integrity, effective competition or the 
Group (refer to ‘v) Operational risk’ above).
+ For further details on the Group’s approach 
to reputation risk, refer to the reputation 
risk management and reputation risk 
performance sections.

ix) Legal risk and legal, competition and 
regulatory matters

The Group conducts activities in a highly 
regulated global market which exposes it 
and its employees to legal risk arising from: 
(i) the multitude of laws, rules and 
regulations that apply to the businesses it 
operates, which are highly dynamic, may 
vary between jurisdictions and/or conflict, 
and may be unclear in their application to 
particular circumstances especially in new 
and emerging areas; and (ii) the diversified 
and evolving nature of the Group’s 
businesses and business practices. In each 
case, this exposes the Group and its 
employees to the risk of loss or the 
imposition of penalties, damages or fines 
from the failure of members of the Group 
to meet applicable laws, rules, regulations 
or contractual requirements or to assert or 
defend their intellectual property rights. 
Legal risk may arise in relation to any 
number of the material existing and 
emerging risks identified above.

A breach of applicable laws, rules and/or 
regulations by the Group or its employees 
could result in criminal prosecution, 
regulatory censure, potentially significant 
fines and other sanctions in the 
jurisdictions in which the Group operates. 
Where clients, customers or other third 
parties are harmed by the Group’s 
conduct, this may also give rise to civil legal 
proceedings, including class actions. Other 
legal disputes may also arise between the 
Group and third parties relating to matters 
such as breaches or enforcement of legal 
rights or obligations arising under 
contracts, statutes or common law. 
Adverse findings in any such matters may 
result in the Group being liable to third 
parties or may result in the Group’s rights 
not being enforced or not being enforced 
in the manner intended or desired by the 
Group.
Details of legal, competition and regulatory 
matters to which the Group is currently 
exposed are set out in Note 25. In addition 
to matters specifically described in Note 
25, the Group is engaged in various other 
legal proceedings which arise in the 
ordinary course of business. 

The Group is also subject to requests for 
information, investigations and other 
reviews (including skilled person reviews) 
by regulators, governmental and other 
public bodies. These may be in connection 
with business activities in which the Group 
is, or has been, engaged, or areas of 
particular regulatory focus, such as 
financial crime, money laundering or 
terrorist financing. The Group may also 
(from time to time) be subject to claims 
and/or legal proceedings and other 
investigations relating to financial and non-
financial disclosures made by members of 
the Group (including, but not limited to, 
regulatory capital and liquidity reporting 
and ESG disclosures). Additionally, due to 
the increasing number of new climate and 
sustainability-related laws and regulations, 
growing demand from investors and 
customers for sustainable products and 
services, and regulatory and NGO scrutiny, 
financial institutions, including the Group, 
may through their business activities face 
increasing litigation, conduct, enforcement 
and contract liability risks related to climate 
change, environmental degradation and 
other social, governance and 
sustainability-related issues, including 
greenwashing risk.

Material existing and emerging risks (continued)

This may include laws and regulatory 
processes and policies seeking to restrict 
or prohibit doing certain business with 
entities identified as "boycotting" or 
"discriminating" against particular 
industries or considering ESG factors in 
their investment processes, including to 
protect the energy and other high carbon 
sectors from any risks of divestment or 
challenges in accessing finance. 
Furthermore, there is a risk that 
shareholders, campaign groups, 
customers and other interest groups could 
seek to take legal action (including under 
"soft law" mechanisms) against the Group 
for financing or contributing to climate 
change and environmental degradation or 
because the Group's response to climate 
change or other ESG factors is perceived 
to be ineffective, insufficient or 
inappropriate.

The outcome of legal, competition and 
regulatory matters, both those to which 
the Group is currently exposed and any 
others which may arise in the future, is 
difficult to predict (and any provision made 
in the Group’s financial statements relating 
to those matters may not be sufficient to 
cover actual losses). 

 In connection with such matters, the 
Group may incur significant expense, 
regardless of the ultimate outcome, and 
any such matters could expose the Group 
to any of the following outcomes: 
substantial monetary damages, 
settlements and/or fines; remediation of 
affected customers and clients; other 
penalties and injunctive relief; additional 
litigation; criminal prosecution; the loss of 
any existing agreed protection from 
prosecution; regulatory restrictions on the 
Group’s business operations including the 
withdrawal of authorisations; increased 
regulatory compliance requirements or 
changes to laws or regulations; suspension 
of operations; public reprimands or 
censure; loss of significant assets or 
business; a negative effect on the Group’s 
reputation; loss of confidence by investors, 
counterparties, clients and/or customers; 
risk of credit rating agency downgrades; 
potential negative impact on the availability 
and/or cost of funding and liquidity; and/or 
dismissal or resignation of key individuals. 
In light of the uncertainties involved in 
legal, competition and regulatory matters, 
there can be no assurance that the 
outcome of a particular matter or matters 
(including formerly active matters or those 
arising after the date of this Annual Report) 
will not have a material adverse effect on 
the Group’s business, results of 
operations, financial condition and 
prospects.

Principal risk management

Climate risk management

Climate risk is the impact on Financial 
(Credit, Market, Treasury & Capital) and 
Operational Risks arising from climate 
change through physical risks and risks 
associated with transitioning to a lower 
carbon economy.

• Physical risks: Result from a changing 

climate and can be event-driven (acute 
risks), including increased frequency 
and/or severity of extreme weather 
events such as cyclones, hurricanes and 
flooding. Physical risks can also be driven 
by longer term shifts in climate patterns 
(chronic risks) arising from sustained 
higher temperatures that may cause 
rises in sea levels, rising mean 
temperatures and more frequent/
severe weather events.

• Transition risks: The transition to a lower 

carbon economy is likely to involve 
significant and rapid policy, regulatory 
and legal changes, as evolving 
technology and markets adapt to a 
changing climate and associated 
impacts.
Overview

The Group has developed a Climate Risk 
Framework (CRF) for financial and 
operational risks stemming from climate 
change. This enables Barclays to foster a 
systematic and consistent approach for 
managing climate risk across the firm. The 
key principle underpinning this framework 
is that climate risk is recognised as a driver 
of other existing financial (Credit, Market, 
Treasury and Capital) and non financial 
(including Operational and Reputational) 
risks, and not treated as a standalone risk 
type. The CRF is supported by policies, 
standards and other relevant documents 
which contain control objectives that must 
be met.
The CRF:
• Defines climate risk

• Establishes principles for the 

The Climate Risk Policy sets objectives for 
the management of climate risks and 
establishes key principles for quantifying 
and reporting, including escalations 
required to senior stakeholders up to and 
including the Board Risk Committee (BRC). 
The Framework and Policy are applicable 
for Barclays' business activities, with a 
focus on lending, advisory, sales and 
trading, capital markets and investments.

Climate risk may also drive non-financial 
risks such as reputational risk, which 
continue to be managed under the 
respective risk frameworks.

To support the embedment of the 
Principal Risk, in 2023 the Group delivered 
the following with three overarching 
objectives:

1. Enhance and improve risk appetite and 
associated controls for climate risk

2. Develop a plan for refining modelling and 
scenario analysis capabilities

3. Expand BlueTrack™, which now covers 
nine segments comprising of Energy, 
Power, Cement, Steel, Automotive 
Manufacturing, UK Housing, Commercial 
Real Estate, Agriculture and Aviation
Organisation, roles and responsibilities

The Group Head of Climate Risk is the 
Principal Risk owner accountable for the 
management and oversight of the climate 
risk profile. The Group Head of Climate 
Risk reports directly to Group CRO.

On behalf of the Board, the BRC reviews 
and approves the Group's approach to 
managing climate risk. 

The Group Risk Committee (GRC) is the 
most senior executive body responsible for 
reviewing and challenging risk practices for 
climate.

To support the oversight of Barclays' 
climate risk profile, a Climate Risk 
Committee (CRC) has been established as a 
sub-committee of the GRC. The Group 
Head of Climate risk is the Chair of the CRC. 
Any material issues are escalated by the 
CRC to the GRC, and the GRC 
subsequently escalates to the BRC as 
appropriate.

A Climate Risk control environment has 
been established in alignment with the 
Barclays' Control Framework. A Climate Risk 
Control Forum (CRCF) was established in 
2022 to oversee implementation and 
operation of the Barclays Control 
Framework, including reviewing risk events, 
policy and issues management. Climate risk 
assurance groups were also established and 
are responsible for performing climate risk 
specific reviews to support the embedding 
of the Climate Risk Framework and Policy.

Entity Heads of Climate Risk have been 
appointed across key Barclays legal entities, 
namely Barclays Bank UK (BBUK) PLC, 
Barclays Bank (BB) PLC, Barclays Bank 
Ireland (BBI) PLC, and the US Intermediate 
Holding Company (US IHC). 

Broader sustainability matters and 
reputation risk associated with climate 
change are coordinated by the Group 
Sustainability and ESG Team, led by the 
Group Head of Sustainability.

Principal risk management (continued)

Risk appetite

Barclays' approach to setting climate risk appetite is aligned with its ambition to be a net zero bank by 2050 and reducing financed 
emissions in line with its disclosed sector targets. In accordance with the risk appetite policy and tolerance standards, Barclays has 
established a climate risk appetite at the Group level, comprising of qualitative risk appetite statements and quantitative constraints. 
This is reviewed and revised (where applicable) annually and formally approved by the Board.

In 2023, Barclays has enhanced its approach for the quantification of climate risk appetite by implementing additional limits and 
controls, including around the expected financed emissions target (BlueTrack) pathways. The progress against these targets is 
monitored on a regular basis whilst acknowledging the challenges and external dependencies to reduce financed emissions. The Group 
continues to regularly review its risk appetite and enhance risk metrics including expansion of risk limits for priority sectors. 

Risk identification

Physical and transition risk drivers can lead to adverse financial impacts through various transmission channels. Transmission channels 
are causal chains that explain how climate risk drivers impact firms such as Barclays either directly through their own operations and 
infrastructure or indirectly through their financing and investment activities as described earlier in the "Climate-related Risks" section on 
page 67. The diagram below illustrates these dynamics.

The potential impact of physical risk events at the macro level may include lower GDP growth, higher unemployment and significant 
changes in the availability and prices of products or commodities. At the micro level, damage to properties and operations of Barclays's 
clients could lead to increasing costs and possible decline in revenues, which in turn might impact their ability to repay the loans. Thus 
through these transmission channels, risks for Barclays may materialise in its traditional risk categories such as credit risk, market risk, 
treasury and capital risk, operational risk and reputational risk. The impact of climate risk drivers may be significant and widespread, 
affecting companies, households and the general economy leading to potential financial system contagion.

Barclays' work on assessing climate-related risks have been focused on the short (0-1 year) and medium term (1-5 years) horizons, in 
line with our financial planning cycle. The feedback effects of climate risk drivers through macro and micro transmissions channels are 
observed in Barclays' portfolio through traditional risk categories such as credit risk, market risk, treasury and capital risk, operational risk 
(including legal risk) and reputational risk. Examples of these feedback effects are set out in the table below.
Principal risk
Credit risk

Example effects of climate risk drivers

Increase in credit risk due to reduction in borrowers' ability to repay and service debt if the borrower is affected by 
physical risk events that severely damages its infrastructure and operations. Borrowers that are subjected to higher 
carbon taxes, penalties or fines for not adequately addressing their impact on climate (i.e. exposed to higher litigation 
and reputational damages) or do not successfully transition to a lower carbon economy might see deterioration in their 
credit ratings. In some instances, this could lead to borrowers going into default and impact banks' ability to recover loan 
value.

Market risk

Treasury & capital risk

Operational risk

Reputation risk

Uncertainty about timing, severity and frequency of extreme physical climate events may lead to higher volatility in 
financial markets. Equity prices of corporates operating in carbon intensive sectors may decrease due to reduced 
demand for products or services. Reduction in financial asset values can potentially lead to abrupt price adjustments, 
resulting in market risk losses where climate risk is not priced into the asset value.

Severe physical events could trigger a sharp increase in demand for liquidity for financial firms, corporates and 
households. Reduction in banks' access to stable sources of funding or withdrawal of deposits due to climate risk drivers 
may negatively impact banks' liquidity positions. Deterioration of clients' risk profile due to climate risk drivers may also 
lead to higher capital requirements.

Acute physical risk events may cause damage to banks' essential infrastructure and disrupt operations leading to higher 
operational risks. Banks rely on a complex network of supplier and service providers. Climate change can disrupt supply 
chains by affecting the availability of goods and services leading to delays or interruptions in critical operations. 
Increasingly stringent climate and sustainability-related laws and regulations and the pace at which the regulations are 
implemented means that banks, through their business activities, may face increasing litigation and other claims if they 
are perceived to have contributed to or failed to prevent climate change or environmental damage, including by 
financing client activities. 

Banks may face reputational risks related to climate change in various ways, as the public and stakeholders increasingly 
expect banks to demonstrate their commitment to environmental sustainability. Banks that are perceived as not 
adequately addressing climate risks may face reputational damage. Additionally, banks can be accused of greenwashing 
if the information disclosed is misleading or if they are not able to meet their climate goals.

Barclays has developed an internal climate 
risk identification process to identify and 
assess the potential impact of climate risk 
as a driver of other principal risks. Drivers 
of climate risk are identified and collated 
through quarterly horizon scanning 
exercises, following which information is 
disseminated to relevant principal risk 
teams. Following review by principal risk 
teams, the relevant information feeds into 
the Climate Risk Register. The Climate Risk 
Register is maintained as per the ERMF and 
is integrated into the Group Risk Register. 

The Group Risk Register contains all 
material risks that may impact forward-
looking business plans across key legal 
entities (Barclays PLC, BBUK PLC, BBI PLC) 
and business units (BUK and BI). 
Quantitative (typically based on stress 
testing) or qualitative assessments are 
performed to quantify the impact of 
material risks on capital or liquidity 
positions of legal entities/business units. 
Following this assessment, each material 
risk is mapped to key drivers along with the 
risk ratings (which are derived based on 
magnitude of impact and materiality 
thresholds). The Group Risk Register is 
refreshed on at least an annual basis and is 
subsequently used to support strategic 
planning, scenario design, sensitivity 
analysis and capital adequacy 
assessments.

Barclays has also developed processes to 
identify sectors, sovereigns and US States 
which other Principal Risks must prioritise 
for assessment of climate risks. Within 
these processes, the Group analyses and 
assesses the sensitivity and vulnerability of 
different industry sectors and geographies 
(including sovereigns and US states) to 
various physical and transition risk drivers 
and categorise them into different risk 
buckets. Following this assessment, the 
industry sectors and geographies that are 
highly exposed to climate risks are deemed 
to be of elevated risk. These assessments  
are regularly reviewed and benchmarked 
against external studies and research and 
incorporate inputs from the subject matter 
experts.

The outcomes of the above mentioned 
processes namely the Climate Risk 
Register, elevated sector and geography 
(including sovereigns and US states) 
assessments and underlying exposures, 
form the basis of Barclays' approach and 
priorities for further granular assessment.  
Details on exposures to elevated sectors 
are on pages 284 to 287.

In the UK Mortgages portfolio, segments 
that are vulnerable to subsidence and 
flood risk have been identified. Additionally, 
Energy Performance Certificate (EPC) 
ratings have been identified for portfolios 
that are particularly vulnerable to transition 

risk. Methodology and breakdown of 
subsidence risk and flood risk bands in the 
portfolio is available on page 288.

Additionally, through individual client 
assessments and scenario analysis 
exercises, Barclays identifies portfolios 
that are more vulnerable to climate-
related risks.
Risk assessment

The emissions resulting from the activities 
of customers and clients to whom 
financing is provided is measured using 
Barclays' bespoke tool BlueTrack™. 
Currently, BlueTrack™ covers nine 
segments comprising of Energy, Power, 
Cement, Steel, Automotive 
Manufacturing, UK Housing, Commercial 
Real Estate, Agriculture and Aviation. 
Details on the BlueTrack™ methodology 
and targets are on pages 86 to 99.

Furthermore, Barclays has developed the 
Client Transition Framework (CTF) to 
evaluate clients' progress as they 
transition to a low-carbon business model. 
Using BlueTrack™ data and public 
disclosures, the framework evaluates both 
qualitative and quantitative components 
to assess transition trajectories against 
Barclays’ targets and benchmarks. This 
allows the Group to prioritise engagement 
with clients based on their CTF scores. 
Details on the CTF methodology are on 
page 90.

Principal risk management (continued)

During 2023, Barclays conducted industry-
specific deep dives to identify risk factors 
and characteristics for those sectors. For 
example, the power sector review 
incorporated analysis of carbon intensity, 
transition plans and the results of a 
bespoke power utilities scenario analysis 
(such as the effect of carbon pricing on 
client financial performance).

Furthermore, Barclays has industry-
specific risk management processes 
where appropriate. Granular asset-level 
assessment is performed in the oil and gas 
portfolio, prioritising the assessment of 
clients that are non-investment grade and 
operating in the upstream and midstream 
sub-sectors. Taking into account factors 
such as breakeven costs, geological 
concerns, infrastructure constraints and 
regulatory/geopolitical uncertainty, 
Barclays has subsequently classified 
clients and their assets into tiers from 1 to 
3, with tier 3 considered the riskiest. Asset 
tiering and assessment for these clients 
are reviewed at least annually.

For Credit Risk, Barclays continues to 
embed climate risk assessment into credit 
assessment, annual review and transaction 
approval processes to ensure that 
climate-related risks are considered for 
Wholesale Credit and Retail customers in 
elevated risk sectors.

At a client level, the Climate Lens 
questionnaire is used to evaluate physical, 
transition and environmental risks 
associated with firms operating in elevated 
risk sectors. Each question is rated as Low, 
Moderate or High based on the client’s 
exposure and vulnerability to various 
climate and environmental risk factors. 
Climate Lens is currently being re-
developed with the aim of making it more 
quantitative and improving its integration 
within the credit processes.

For Market Risk, the impact of climate 
change is measured by applying stress 
scenarios that stress the core risks 
susceptible to climate change over long 
and short-term horizons to individual risk 
factors. This process is conducted every 
quarter. The pattern of stress losses 
arising from the stress scenario is used to 
estimate and set ongoing limits, consistent 
with the Board-approved maximum stress 
loss capacity for Market risk, under which 
Barclays monitors and controls Market risk 
arising from climate change.

For Treasury and Capital Risk, Barclays’ 
conducts Group-wide climate stress tests 
to understand and assess the potential 
impact on Barclays' capital position. 
Climate risk considerations have also been 
incorporated into the Internal Capital 
Adequacy Assessment Process (ICAAP). 
For Liquidity Risk, Barclays identifies and 
assesses potential vulnerabilities of certain 
industries and asset classes that may 
deteriorate under a climate stress 
scenario, and subsequently impact funding 
and liquidity ratios. Climate risk 
considerations have also been 
incorporated into the Internal Liquidity 
Adequacy Assessment Process (ILAAP). 
For Pension Risk, key risk indicators based 
on the impact of physical and transition risk 
drivers on the pension fund have been 
defined. These are reviewed and 
monitored on a quarterly basis.

For operational risk, climate-related risks 
continue to be assessed as part of existing 
business-as-usual operational risk 
processes. This includes working with 
Premises and Operational Recovery 
Planning teams to evaluate and respond to 
climate-related impacts and regulatory 
requirements Climate factors have been 
integrated into Structured Scenario 
Assessments, which capture extreme but 
plausible operational tail risks. As part of 
the assessment in 2023, climate risk has 
been included in the building destruction 
scenario (physical risks) and 
greenwashing-related scenarios 
(transition risks).

For reputational risk, the primary 
responsibility for identifying and managing 
reputation risk and adherence sits with the 
front line business and support functions 
where the risk arises. The Enhanced Due 
Diligence process and other relevant 
processes in these business units facilitate 
the assessment of climate-related 
reputational risk - details on this are on 
page 236, while details on oversight and 
management are embedded with the 
Barclays governance framework on pages 
231 to 232.

Across Barclays' portfolios, scenario 
analysis continues to form a key part of the 
Group’s approach to assessing and 
quantifying the impact of climate change. 
Details on the progress and outcomes of 
our scenario analysis and stress testing 
exercises are available on pages 131 to 
136.

Risk monitoring  and reporting

In addition to the climate risk appetite, 
Barclays has integrated climate risk 
considerations into policies, standards and 
lending guidelines. Consistent with our net 
zero ambition and taking into account 
considerations of all relevant business 
factors, policies have been introduced to 
progressively curtail or prohibit financing of 
certain activities in sensitive sectors, 
including upstream oil and gas, thermal 
coal mining and coal-fired power 
generation, Arctic oil and gas, oil sands, 
hydraulic fracturing (fracking), Amazon oil 
and gas, extra heavy oil and ultra-deep 
water. These policies are reviewed 
regularly and updated with respect to 
external developments. Details on 
restrictive policies are on page 100.

Mandate and scale (M&S) exposure 
controls translate risk appetite into a 
detailed series of limits to control day-to-
day risk taking. Barclays has implemented 
climate-aware limits and controls for 
priority sectors, including based on, 
BlueTrack™ measures of emissions 
intensity and the Client Transition 
Framework. For the UK retail portfolio, 
physical and transition risk mandates are in 
place for the UK Mortgages and Business 
Banking Agriculture portfolios.

Quantitative and qualitative information 
are presented and reviewed at the CRC. A 
Group-level climate risk dashboard is 
presented to BRC on a quarterly basis, 
which is used to inform progress against 
sector targets, current exposure to 
portfolios with high physical and transition 
risks, concentrations and climate risk 
trends. The climate dashboard periodically  
includes outputs and learnings from 
internal stress test and regulatory 
exercises and external developments 
based on horizon scanning.

Legal entity specific climate risk 
dashboards for monitoring and reviewing 
climate-sensitive exposures have been 
developed and presented to appropriate 
committees. Where Climate Risk limits are 
subject to ongoing monitoring, they will be 
reported at the appropriate Principal Risk 
Committees and CRC.

Barclays continues to enhance and 
sophisticate our risk management 
capabilities with our increased knowledge 
and ability to quantify and manage climate-
related risks.

Nature Risk Assessment

In 2022-23, Barclays participated in a 
TNFD pilot with UNEP FI, alongside 
other financial institutions, focused on 
UK and European agriculture and 
fisheries, which in the Barclays 
context means agriculture and food 
sectors. As part of the pilot 
programme, we worked with an 
external expert to test the draft TNFD 
framework, including the proposed 
risk assessment process (LEAP FI), on 
our agriculture and food portfolio in 
Europe, with a focus on UK farming.

As reported last year, this involved 
assessing our clients’ locations in 
terms of production and sales and 
applying a number of different 2030 
scenarios to the portfolio. During 
2023, we used the results of the pilot 
to inform the management of nature-
related risks identified during the 
assessment. For example, the results 
informed the development of new 
questions for the Client Transition 
Tool (CTT) for UK farmers, which are 
due to be incorporated in 2024. This 
will help identify clients that may need 
support in managing their nature-
related risks alongside 
decarbonisation actions, and to 
inform our client engagement 
proposition. See page 94 for more 
details on our work with the UK 
farming sector.

Further, in recognition of nature-
related impacts identified in the 
agricultural value chain, we updated 
our Forestry and Agricultural 
Commodities Statement, which 
included strengthening our existing 
restrictions and introducing additional 
new restrictions on clients operating 
in agricultural commodity sectors 
exposed to significant deforestation 
risk. See page 100 for details.

Credit risk management 
(audited)

The risk of loss to the Group from the 
failure of clients, customers or 
counterparties, including sovereigns, to 
fully honour their obligations to the Group, 
including the whole and timely payment of 
principal, interest, collateral and other 
receivables.
Overview

The credit risk that the Group faces arises 
from wholesale and retail loans and 
advances together with the counterparty 

credit risk arising from derivative contracts 
with clients; trading activities, including: 

• debt securities, settlement balances 
with market counterparties, fair value 
through other comprehensive income 
(FVOCI) assets and reverse repurchase 
loans.

Credit risk management objectives are to:

• maintain a framework of controls to 

oversee credit risk

• identify, assess and measure credit risk 
clearly and accurately across the Group 
and within each separate business, from 
the level of individual facilities up to the 
total portfolio

• control and plan credit risk taking in line 
with external stakeholder expectations, 
including risk return objectives, and 
avoiding undesirable concentrations

• monitor credit risk and adherence to 

agreed controls.

Organisation, roles and responsibilities

The first line of defence has primary 
responsibility for managing credit risk 
within the risk appetite and limits set by the 
Risk function, supported by a defined set 
of policies, standards and controls. In the 
entities, business risk committees 
(attended by the first line) monitor and 
review the credit risk profile of each 
business unit where the most material 
issues are escalated to the Retail Credit 
Risk Management Committee, Wholesale 
Credit Risk Management Committee and 
Group Risk Committee.

Wholesale and retail portfolios are 
managed separately to reflect the differing 
nature of the assets; wholesale balances 
tend to be larger and are managed on an 
individual basis, while retail balances are 
greater in number but lesser in value and 
are, therefore, managed in aggregated 
segments.

The responsibilities of the credit risk 
management teams in the businesses, the 
sanctioning team and other shared 
services include: sanctioning new credit 
agreements (principally wholesale); setting 
strategies for approval of transactions 
(principally retail); setting risk appetite; 
monitoring risk against limits and other 
parameters; maintaining robust 
processes, data gathering, quality, storage 
and reporting methods for effective credit 
risk management; performing effective 
turnaround and workout scenarios for 
wholesale portfolios via dedicated 
restructuring and recoveries teams; 
maintaining robust collections and 
recovery processes/units for retail 
portfolios; and review and validation of 
credit risk measurement models. 

The credit risk management teams in each 
legal entity are accountable to the relevant 
Legal Entity CRO, who reports to the 
Group CRO.

For wholesale portfolios, credit risk 
managers are organised in sanctioning 
teams by geography, industry and/or 
product. In wholesale portfolios, credit risk 
approval is undertaken by experienced 
credit risk professionals operating within a 
clearly defined delegated authority 
framework, with only the most senior 
credit officers assigned the higher levels of 
delegated authority. The largest credit 
exposures, which are outside the Risk 
Sanctioning Unit or Risk Distribution 
Committee authority, require the support 
of a legal entity Senior Credit Officer. For 
exposures in excess of the legal entity 
Senior Credit Officer’s authority, approval 
by Group Senior Credit Officer/Board Risk 
Committee is also required. The Group 
Credit Risk Committee, attended by legal 
entity Senior Credit Officers, provides a 
formal mechanism for the Group Senior 
Credit Officer to exercise the highest level 
of credit authority over the most material 
Group single name exposures. 
Credit risk mitigation

The Group employs a range of techniques 
and strategies to actively mitigate credit 
risks. These can broadly be divided into 
three types:

• netting and set-off

• collateral

• risk transfer.
Netting and set-off

Credit risk exposures can be reduced by 
applying netting and set-off. For derivative 
transactions, the Group’s normal practice 
is, on a legal entity basis, to enter into 
standard master agreements with 
counterparties (e.g. ISDAs). These master 
agreements typically allow for netting of 
credit risk exposure to a counterparty 
resulting from derivative transactions 
against the obligations to the counterparty 
in the event of default, and so produce a 
lower net credit exposure. These 
agreements may also reduce settlement 
exposure (e.g. for foreign exchange 
transactions) by allowing payments on the 
same day in the same currency to be set-
off against one another.

Principal risk management (continued)

Collateral

The Group has the ability to call on 
collateral in the event of default of the 
counterparty, comprising:

• home loans: a fixed charge over 

residential property in the form of 
houses, flats and other dwellings

• wholesale lending: a fixed charge over 

commercial property and other physical 
assets, in various forms

• other retail lending: includes charges 

over other physical assets; second lien 
charges over residential property; and 
finance lease receivables

• derivatives: the Group also often seeks 
to enter into a margin agreement (e.g. 
Credit Support Annex) with 
counterparties with which the Group has 
master netting agreements in place. 
These annexes to master agreements 
provide a mechanism for further 
reducing credit risk, whereby collateral 
(margin) is posted on a regular basis 
(typically daily) to collateralise the mark 
to market exposure of a derivative 
portfolio measured on a net basis

• reverse repurchase agreements: 

collateral typically comprises highly liquid 
securities which have been legally 
transferred to the Group subject to an 
agreement to return them for a fixed 
price

• financial guarantees and similar off-
balance sheet commitments: cash 
collateral may be held against these 
arrangements.

Risk transfer

A range of instruments including 
guarantees, credit insurance, credit 
derivatives and securitisation can be used 
to transfer credit risk from one 
counterparty to another. These mitigate 
credit risk in three main ways:

• if the risk is transferred to a 
counterparty which is more 
creditworthy than the original 
counterparty, then overall credit risk is 
reduced

• where recourse to the first counterparty 

remains, both counterparties must 
default before a loss materialises. This is 
less likely than the default of either 
counterparty individually so credit risk is 
reduced.

• first loss exposures across pools of 

• model maintenance: monitoring of 

credit risk can be hedged via synthetic 
securitisation structures, typically via 
CLN (credit lending notes) issuance. As 
these are fully funded upfront they 
provide for a direct reduction in credit 
risk exposure on referenced pools.
+ Detailed policies are in place to appropriately 

recognise and record credit risk mitigation. For more 
information, refer to pages 131 to 134 of the Barclays 
PLC Pillar 3 Report 2023 (unaudited).

Governance and oversight of ECLs under 
IFRS 9

The Group’s organisational structure and 
internal governance processes oversee 
the estimation of ECL across several 
areas, including: i) setting requirements in 
policy, including key assumptions and the 
application of key judgements; ii) the 
design and execution of models; and iii) 
review of ECL results.

i) Impairment policy requirements are set 
and reviewed regularly, at a minimum 
annually, to maintain adherence to 
accounting standards. Key judgements 
inherent in policy, including the estimated 
life of revolving credit facilities and the 
quantitative criteria for assessing the 
significant increase in credit risk (SICR), are 
separately supported by analytical study. In 
particular, the quantitative thresholds used 
for assessing SICR are subject to a number 
of internal validation criteria, particularly in 
retail portfolios where thresholds decrease 
as the origination Probability of Default 
(PD) of each facility increases. Key policy 
requirements are also aligned to the 
Group’s credit risk management strategy 
and practices, for example, wholesale 
customers that are risk managed on an 
individual basis are assessed for ECL on an 
individual basis upon entering Stage 3; 
furthermore, key internal risk management 
indicators of high risk are used to set SICR 
policy, for example, retail customers 
identified as high risk account 
management are automatically deemed to 
have met the SICR criteria.

ii) ECL is estimated in line with internal 
policy requirements using models which 
are validated by a qualified independent 
party to the model development area, the 
Independent Validation Unit (IVU), before 
first use and on a regular basis, at a 
minimum every three years. Each model is 
designated an owner who is responsible 
for:

model performance including 
backtesting by comparing predicted 
ECL versus flow into stage 3 and 
coverage ratios; proposing material 
changes for independent IVU approval; 
and recalibrating model parameters on 
more timely data 

• proposing post-model adjustments 

(PMA) to address model weaknesses or 
to account for situations where known 
or expected risk factors and information 
have not been considered in the 
modelling process. All PMAs relating to 
model deficiencies, regardless of value 
are approved by IVU for a set time 
period. PMAs representing Expert 
Judgement are validated by Risk, as the 
second line of defence and approved for 
a set time period. The most material 
PMAs are also approved by the CRO.

Models must also assess ECL across a 
range of future economic conditions. 
These economic scenarios are generated 
via an independent model and ultimately 
set by the Senior Scenario Review 
Committee. Economic scenarios are 
regenerated at a minimum twice annually 
but more frequently if deemed 
appropriate, and also to align with the 
Group’s medium term planning exercise. 
Each model used in the estimation of ECL, 
including key inputs, are governed by a 
series of internal controls, which include 
the validation of completeness and 
accuracy of data in golden source 
systems, documented data 
transformations and documented lineage 
of data transfers between systems.

iii) The Group Impairment Committee, 
formed of members from both Finance 
and Risk and attended by both the Group 
Finance Director and the Group CRO, is 
responsible for overseeing impairment 
policy and practice across the Group and 
will approve impairment results. Reported 
results and key messages are 
communicated to the BAC, which has an 
oversight role and provides challenge of 
key assumptions, including the basis of the 
scenarios adopted. Impairment results are 
then factored into management decision 
making, including but not limited to, 
business planning, risk appetite setting and 
portfolio management.

Principal risk management (continued)

Market risk management 
(audited)

The risk of loss arising from potential 
adverse changes in the value of the 
Group’s assets and liabilities from 
fluctuation in market variables including, 
but not limited to, interest rates, foreign 
exchange, equity prices, commodity 
prices, credit spreads, implied volatilities 
and asset correlations.
Overview

Market risk arises primarily as a result of 
client facilitation in wholesale markets, 
involving market-making activities, risk 
management solutions and execution of 
syndications. Upon execution of a trade 
with a client, the Group will look to hedge 
against the risk of the trade moving in an 
adverse direction. Mismatches between 
client transactions and hedges result in 
market risk due to changes in asset prices, 
volatility or correlations. 
Organisation, roles and responsibilities 

Market risk in the businesses resides 
primarily in Barclays International and 
Treasury. These businesses have the 
mandate to assume market risk. The front 
office and Treasury trading desks are 
responsible for managing market risk on a 
day-to-day basis, where they are required 
to understand and adhere to all limits 
applicable to their businesses. The Market 
Risk team supports the trading desks with 
the day-to-day limit management of 
market risk exposures through 
governance processes which are outlined 
in supporting market risk policies and 
standards.

Market risk oversight and challenge is 
provided by business committees and 
Group committees, including the Market 
Risk Committee (MRC).

The objectives of market risk management 
are to: 

• identify, understand and control market 

risk by robust measurement, limit 
setting, reporting and oversight

• facilitate business growth within a 
controlled and transparent risk 
management framework

• control market risk in the businesses 
according to the allocated appetite.

To meet the above objectives, a 
governance structure is in place to 
manage these risks consistent with the 
ERMF. 

The BRC recommends market risk 
appetite to the Board for their approval. 
The Market Risk Principal Risk Lead (PR 
Lead) is responsible for the Market Risk 
Control Framework and, under delegated 
authority from the Group CRO, agrees 
with the business CROs a limit framework 
within the context of the approved market 
risk appetite.

The Market Risk Committee (MRC) reviews 
and makes recommendations concerning 
the group-wide market risk profile. This 
includes overseeing the operation of the 
Market Risk Framework and associated 
policies and standards, monitoring market 
and regulatory changes, and reviewing limit 
utilisation levels. The committee is chaired 
by the PR Lead and attendees include the 
business heads of market risk and business 
aligned market risk managers.

In addition to MRC, the Corporate and 
Investment Bank Risk Committee (‘CIBRC’) 
is the main forum in which market risk 
exposures are discussed and reviewed 
with senior business heads. The 
Committee is chaired by the CRO of 
Barclays International and meets weekly, 
covering current market events, notable 
market risk exposures, and key risk topics. 
New business initiatives are generally 
socialised at CIBRC before any changes to 
risk appetite or associated limits are 
considered in other governance 
committees.

The head of each business is accountable 
for all market risks associated with its 
activities, while the head of the market risk 
team covering each business is 
responsible for implementing the risk 
control framework for market risk.

For more information on market risk 
management, refer to the Barclays PLC 
Pillar 3 Report 2023 (unaudited).
Management value at risk (VaR)

VaR is an estimate of the potential loss 
arising from unfavourable market 
movements if the current positions were 
to be held unchanged for one business 
day. For internal market risk management 
purposes, a historical simulation 
methodology with a one-year equally 
weighted historical period, at the 95% 
confidence level is used for all trading 
books and some banking books.

Limits are applied at the total level as well 
as by risk factor type, which are then 
cascaded down to particular trading desks 
and businesses by the market risk 
management function.
+ See the market risk performance section for a 

review of management VaR.

Treasury and capital risk 
management

This comprises:

Liquidity risk: The risk that the Group is 
unable to meet its contractual or 
contingent obligations or that it does not 
have the appropriate amount, tenor and 
composition of funding and liquidity to 
support its assets.

Capital risk: The risk that the Group has an 
insufficient level or composition of capital 
to support its normal business activities 
and to meet its regulatory capital 
requirements under normal operating 
environments and stressed conditions 
(both actual and as defined for internal 
planning or regulatory testing purposes). 
This also includes the risk from the Group’s 
pension plans.

Interest rate risk in the banking book: The 
risk that the Group is exposed to capital or 
income volatility because of a mismatch 
between the interest rate exposures of its 
(non-traded) assets and liabilities.

The Treasury function manages treasury 
and capital risk exposure on a day-to-day 
basis with the Group Treasury Committee 
acting as the principal management body. 
The Treasury and Capital Risk function is 
responsible for oversight and provides 
insight into key capital, liquidity, interest 
rate risk in the banking book (IRRBB) and 
pension risk management activities.
Liquidity risk management 
(audited)

Overview

The efficient management of liquidity is 
essential to the Group in order to retain 
the confidence of the financial markets 
and maintain the sustainability of the 
business. Treasury and Capital Risk have 
created a framework to manage all liquidity 
risk exposures under both normal and 
stressed conditions. The framework is 
designed to maintain liquidity resources 
that are sufficient in amount, quality and 
funding tenor profile to remain within the 
liquidity risk appetite as expressed by the 
Barclays PLC Board. The liquidity risk 
appetite is monitored against both internal 
and regulatory liquidity metrics.

Principal risk management (continued)

Organisation, roles and responsibilities

Treasury has the primary responsibility for 
managing liquidity risk within the set risk 
appetite. Both Risk and Treasury 
contribute to the production of the 
Internal Liquidity Adequacy Assessment 
Process (ILAAP). The Treasury and Capital 
Risk function is responsible for the 
management and governance of the 
liquidity risk mandate, as defined by the 
Board. 

The framework established by Treasury 
and Capital Risk is designed to deliver the 
appropriate term and structure of funding, 
consistent with the liquidity risk appetite 
set by the Board. The framework 
incorporates a range of ongoing business 
management tools to monitor, limit and 
stress test the Group’s balance sheet, 
contingent liabilities and the recovery plan. 
Limit setting and transfer pricing are tools 
designed to control the level of liquidity risk 
taken and drive the appropriate mix of 
funds. Adherence to limits reduces the 
likelihood that a liquidity stress event could 
lead to an inability to meet Group’s 
obligations as they fall due.

The Board approves the Group funding 
plan, internal stress tests, regulatory stress 
test results, recovery plan and liquidity risk 
appetite. The Group Treasury Committee 
is responsible for monitoring and 
managing liquidity risk in line with the 
Group’s funding management objectives, 
funding plan and risk appetite. The 
Treasury and Capital Risk Committee 
monitors and reviews the liquidity risk 
profile and control environment, providing 
second line oversight of the management 
of liquidity risk. The BRC reviews the risk 
profile, and reviews liquidity risk appetite at 
least annually and the impact of stress 
scenarios on the Group funding plan/
forecast in order to agree the Group’s 
projected funding abilities.
Capital risk management 
(audited)
Overview

Capital risk is managed through ongoing 
monitoring and management of the capital 
and leverage position, regular stress 
testing and a robust capital governance 
framework. The objectives of the 
framework are to maintain adequate 
capital for the Group and legal entities to 
withstand the impact of the risks that may 
arise under normal and stressed 
conditions, and maintain adequate capital 
to cover current and forecast business 
needs and associated risks to provide a 
viable and sustainable business offering.

The Group  aims to prudently manage its 
overall leverage position (including risk of 
excessive leverage) by utilising plausible 
stress scenarios, reviewing and deploying 
management actions in response to 
deteriorating economic and commercial 
positions.  In order to manage contingent 
leverage risk, the Group considers the 
context from which the business 
consumption arises, the impact of client 
utilisation on leverage and the available 
actions to manage.
Organisation, roles and responsibilities

Treasury has the primary responsibility for 
managing and monitoring capital 
adequacy. The Treasury and Capital Risk 
function provides oversight of capital risk. 
Production of the Barclays PLC Internal 
Capital Adequacy Assessment Process 
(ICAAP) is the responsibility of Treasury.

Capital risk management is underpinned by 
a control framework and policy. The capital 
management strategy, outlined in the 
Group and legal entity capital plans, is 
developed in alignment with the control 
framework and policy for capital risk, and is 
implemented consistently in order to 
deliver on the Group’s objectives.

The Board approves the Group capital 
plan, internal stress tests and results of 
regulatory stress tests, and the Group 
recovery plan. The Group Treasury 
Committee is responsible for monitoring 
and managing capital risk in line with the 
Group’s capital management objectives, 
capital plan and risk frameworks. The 
Treasury and Capital Risk Committee 
monitors and reviews the capital risk profile 
and control environment, providing 
second line oversight of the management 
of capital risk. The BRC reviews the risk 
profile, and reviews risk appetite at least 
annually and the impact of stress scenarios 
on the Group capital plan/forecast in order 
to agree the Group’s projected capital 
adequacy. 

Local management assures compliance 
with an entity’s minimum regulatory capital 
requirements by reporting to local Asset 
and Liability Committees (ALCOs) with 
oversight by the Group Treasury 
Committee, as required. In 2023, Barclays 
complied with all regulatory minimum 
capital requirements. Contingent leverage 
risk is managed by; i) setting 
comprehensive leverage (and RWA) 
targets for each business as part of the 
Treasury capital management process, 
taking into account adherence to early 
warning indicators and maintain a healthy 
leverage ratio, and; ii) Monitoring execution 
of actions taken to course-correct as 
necessary.

The Group maintains a number of defined 
benefit pension schemes for past and 
current employees. The ability of schemes 
to meet pension payments is achieved 
with investments and contributions.

Pension risk arises because the market 
value of pension fund assets might decline; 
investment returns might reduce; or the 
estimated value of pension liabilities might 
increase. The Group monitors the pension 
risks arising from its defined benefit 
pension schemes and works with the 
relevant pension fund’s trustees to 
address shortfalls. In these circumstances, 
the Group could be required or might 
choose to make extra contributions to the 
pension fund. The Group’s main defined 
benefit scheme was closed to new 
entrants in 2012. 
Interest rate risk in the banking 
book management (IRRBB)
Overview

Interest rate risk in the banking book is 
driven by customer deposit taking and 
lending activities, investments in the liquid 
asset portfolio and funding activities. As 
per the Group’s policy to remain within the 
defined risk appetite, hedging strategies 
are executed to mitigate the various IRRBB 
risks that result from these activities. 
However, the Group remains susceptible 
to interest rate risk and other non-traded 
market risks from the following key 
sources: 

• Interest rate and repricing risk: the risk 
that net interest income could be 
adversely impacted by a change in 
interest rates, differences in the timing 
of interest rate changes between assets 
and liabilities, and other constraints on 
interest rate changes as per product 
terms and conditions.

• Customer behavioural risk: the risk that 
net interest income could be adversely 
impacted by the discretion that 
customers and counterparties may have 
in respect of being able to vary from 
their contractual obligations with 
Barclays. This risk is often referred to by 
industry regulators as ‘embedded option 
risk’.

• Investment risks in the liquid asset 

portfolio: the risk that the fair value of 
assets held in the liquid asset portfolio 
and associated risk management 
portfolios could be adversely impacted 
by market volatility, creating volatility in 
capital directly.

Principal risk management (continued)

Organisation, roles and responsibilities

The entity ALCOs and/or treasury 
committees, together with the Group 
Treasury Committee, are responsible for 
monitoring and managing IRRBB risk in line 
with the Group’s management objectives 
and risk frameworks. The GRC and 
Treasury and Capital Risk Committee 
monitors and reviews the IRRBB risk profile 
and control environment, providing 
second line oversight of the management 
of IRRBB. The BRC reviews the interest 
rate risk profile, including review of the risk 
appetite at least annually and the impact of 
stress scenarios on the interest rate risk of 
the Group’s banking books.

In addition, the Group’s IRRBB policy sets 
out the processes and key controls 
required to identify all IRRBB risks arising 
from banking book operations, to monitor 
the risk exposures via a set of metrics with 
a frequency in line with the risk 
management horizon, and to manage 
these risks within agreed risk appetite and 
limits.
Model risk management

The potential for adverse consequences 
from decisions based on incorrect or 
misused model outputs and reports.
Overview

The Bank uses models to support a broad 
range of activities, including informing 
business decisions and strategies, 
measuring and limiting risk, valuing 
exposures, conducting stress testing, 
assessing capital adequacy, managing 
client assets, and meeting reporting 
requirements.
Organisation, roles and responsibilities

The Barclays Group has a dedicated Model 
Risk Management (‘MRM’) function that 
consists of six teams: 

(i) Independent Validation Unit (‘IVU’), 
responsible for model validation and 
approval; 

(ii) Group Model Risk Governance, 
responsible for model risk governance, 
controls and reporting, as well as providing 
oversight for compliance of the Model 
Owner community with the Model Risk 
Framework; 

(iii) Framework team, responsible for the 
Model Risk Policy and associated 
standards;

(iv) Infrastructure Delivery and Oversight, 
responsible for the delivery of model 
inventory including associated data quality 
& reporting and oversight of Quantitative 
Processes; 

(v) COO, responsible for strategy, 
communications and business 
management; and 

(vi) Model Risk Measurement and 
Quantification (‘MRMQ’), responsible for 
the design of the framework and 
methodology to measure and, where 
possible, quantify model risk. It is also 
responsible for the strategic Validation 
Centre of Excellence (‘VCoE’), which is an 
independent quality assurance function 
within MRM with the mandate to review 
and challenge validation outcomes. VCoE 
is aligned to the Group Model Risk 
Governance team.

The Group Model Risk Committee is 
MRM’s primary risk committee and a 
subcommittee of the Group Risk 
Committee. It is convened with senior 
executives in the first and second line of 
defence to oversee the model risk profile 
and risk appetite.

The Model Risk Framework is defined and 
implemented through Model Risk Policy 
and Standards that prescribe the Barclays 
Group-wide, end-to-end requirements for 
the identification, measurement and 
management of model risk, covering 
model documentation, development, 
testing, monitoring, annual review, 
independent validation and approval, 
change and reporting processes.

The function reports to the Barclays Group 
CRO and operates a global framework. 
Implementation of best practice standards 
is a central objective of the Barclays Group.

The key model risk management activities 
include:

• Correctly identifying models across all 

relevant areas of the Bank and recording 
models in the Barclays Group Models 
Database (‘GMD’), the Barclays Group-
wide model inventory.

• Enforcing that every model has a model 
owner who is accountable for the model. 
The model owner must sign off models 
prior to submission to the Independent 
Validation Unit (IVU) for validation and 
ensure that the model presented to IVU 
is and remains fit for purpose.

• Overseeing that every model is subject 
to validation and approval by IVU, prior 
to use and on a continual basis. 

• Defining the model risk appetite in terms 
of risk tolerance, and qualitative metrics 
which are used to track and report on 
model risk.

Operational risk management

The risk of loss to the Group from 
inadequate or failed processes or systems, 
human factors or due to external events 
(for example, fraud) where the root cause 
is not due to credit or market risks.
Overview

The management of operational risk has 
three key objectives:

• deliver and oversee an operational risk 
capability owned and used by business 
leaders to enable sound risk decisions 
over the long term

• provide the frameworks, policies and 
standards to enable management to 
meet their risk management 
responsibilities while the second line of 
defence provides robust, independent, 
and effective oversight and challenge

• deliver a consistent and aggregated 

measurement of operational risk that 
will provide clear and relevant insights, 
so that the right management actions 
can be taken to keep the operational risk 
profile consistent with the Group’s 
strategy, the stated risk appetite and 
stakeholder needs.

The Group operates within a system of 
internal controls that enables business to 
be transacted and risk taken without 
exposing it to unacceptable potential 
losses or reputational damages.
Organisation, roles and responsibilities

The prime responsibility for the 
management of operational risk and the 
compliance with control requirements 
rests within the business and functional 
units where the risk arises. The operational 
risk profile and control environment is 
reviewed by management through 
business risk committees and control 
committees. Operational risk issues 
escalated from these meetings are 
considered through the second line of 
defence review meetings. Depending on 
their nature, the outputs of these 
meetings are presented to the Operational 
Risk Profile Forum, the Operational Risk 
Committee, the BRC or the BAC. In 
addition, specific reports are prepared by 
Operational Risk on a regular basis for the 
GRC and the BRC.

Principal risk management (continued)

Legal entities, businesses and functions 
are required to report their operational 
risks on both a regular and an event-driven 
basis. The reports include a profile of the 
material risks that may threaten the 
achievement of their objectives and the 
effectiveness of key controls, operational 
risk events and a review of scenarios.

The Group Head of Operational Risk is 
responsible for establishing, owning and 
maintaining an appropriate group-wide 
Operational Risk Framework and for 
overseeing the portfolio of operational risk 
across the Group.

The Operational Risk function acts in a 
second line of defence capacity, and is 
responsible for defining and overseeing 
the implementation of the framework and 
monitoring the Group’s operational risk 
profile, including risk-based review  and 
challenge. The Operational Risk function 
alerts management when risk levels 
exceed acceptable tolerance in order to 
drive timely decision- making and actions 
by the first line of defence. 
Operational risk categories

Operational risks are grouped into risk 
categories to support effective risk 
management, measurement and 
reporting. These comprise: Data 
Management Risk; Financial Reporting 
Risk; Fraud Risk; Information Security Risk; 
Operational Recovery Planning Risk; 
Payments Process Risk; People Risk; 
Premises Risk; Physical Security Risk; 
Change Delivery Management Risk; 
Supplier Risk; Tax Risk; Technology Risk; 
and Transaction Operations Risk.

In addition to the above, operational risk 
encompasses risks associated with 
compliance with Group Resolution 
Planning Prudential regulatory 
requirements. 
+ For definitions of the Group’s Operational Risk 
Categories and connected risks, refer to the 
management of operational risk section in the Barclays 
PLC Pillar 3 Report 2023.

Compliance Risk management

The risk of poor outcomes for, or harm to, 
customers, clients and markets, arising 
from the delivery of the Group’s products 
and services (conduct risk), and the risk to 
Barclays, its clients, customers or markets 
from a failure to comply with the laws, rules 
and regulations (LRR) applicable to the 
firm.
Overview

Compliance risk incorporates market 
integrity, customer protection, financial 
crime, product design and review, and the 
newly created laws, rules and regulation 
risks. Barclays has no appetite to operate 
its business other than in full accordance 
with all applicable laws, rules and 
regulations, in order to deliver good 
outcomes for / avoid harm to customers, 
clients and markets. Barclays will act in 
good faith; seeking to avoid causing 
foreseeable harm and to enable and 
support customers to pursue their 
financial objectives.
Organisation, roles and responsibilities

The Compliance Risk Management 
Framework (CRMF) outlines how the 
Group manages and measures its conduct 
risk profile. The Group Chief Compliance 
Officer is accountable for developing, 
maintaining and overseeing the CRMF. 
This includes defining and owning the 
relevant compliance risk policies which 
detail the control objectives, principles and 
other core requirements for the activities 
of the Group. It is the responsibility of the 
first line of defence to establish conduct 
related controls to manage its 
performance and assess conformance to 
these policies and controls. The 
responsibility for LRR risk management 
sits across various functions and business 
units, including Legal, Chief Controls 
Office, Risk and Compliance.   

Senior managers are accountable within 
their areas of responsibility for owning and 
managing compliance risk in accordance 
with the CRMF, as defined within their 
regulatory Statement of Responsibilities, 
and a dedicated team has been 
established in Compliance to oversee LRR 
risk management. 

Compliance as an independent second line 
function oversees that compliance risks 
are effectively identified, managed, 
monitored and escalated, and has a key 
role in helping Barclays achieve the right 
conduct outcomes and evolve a 
compliance-focused culture. 

The governance of Compliance risk within 
the Group is fulfilled through management 
committees and forums operated by the 
first and second lines of defence with clear 
escalation and reporting lines to the Board. 
The Barclays Group and Barclays Bank 
Group Risk Committee and the Barclays 
Bank UK Group Risk Committee are the 
primary second line governance 
committees for the oversight of the 
Compliance Risk Profile. The risk 
committees’ responsibilities include the 
identification and discussion of any 
emerging compliance risk exposures in the 
Barclays Group and Barclays Bank Group. A 
new sub-committee of the Group Risk 
Committee was established in August 
2023 to provide oversight on LRR risk. This 
committee is chaired by the Group Chief 
Compliance Officer. 
Compliance Risk

By effectively managing Compliance risks, 
we can continue to strengthen the culture 
of Barclays.
Culture and conduct 

We believe the stronger our culture, the 
better the choices our people will make; 
and the stronger our business will be for all 
our stakeholders. While our culture helps 
us reduce the impact of poor conduct on 
our customers, we also do not intend to 
repeat the errors of the past.

Our most senior leaders spend significant 
time setting the right tone at Barclays and 
our Purpose and Values are now deeply 
embedded in their messages. The Barclays 
Way sets out the standards and behaviour 
all employees must demonstrate and 
guides the execution of our business. We 
also strengthen our culture with clear and 
effective controls. We continue investing 
to enhance our controls to support our 
commitment to conducting all activities 
with integrity. 
+

For details of the Board's role in embedding our 
Culture, Purpose, Values and Mindset, please refer to

The Barclays Mindset

Our Mindset acts as an operating manual 
for how to get things done at Barclays. It 
focuses on three key elements that are 
core to our success – Empower, Challenge 
and Drive. Our research shows that when 
we demonstrate behaviours aligned to 
these three elements, outcomes are 
better, colleagues are more engaged and 
they are more likely to stay longer to build 
their career at Barclays.
+

For further details, see page 27 in the Strategic 
Report for more information on the Barclays 
Mindset.

Managing Compliance risks
See page 179 in the Directors' report in
+
addition to pages 269 and 361 in the risk review 
section for more information on how the 
Group defines, manages and mitigates 
Compliance risks.

Product design and review risk

It is important that the design of our 
products and services meets the needs of 
clients, customers and markets as well as 
being aligned with Barclays' policies. We do 
this by operating two processes, which 
together form our product design and 
review risk framework.

We have a process that supports the 
Group in the approval and implementation 
of New and Amended Products and 
Approval process (known as the NAPA 
Process, set out in the Barclays NAPA 
Policy and Standards).

 This process outlines the requirements 
and risk assessment standards that must 
be met to help ensure that new and 
amended products and services are 
appropriately designed prior to their 
launch.

In addition we have a complementary 
process that reviews the existing portfolio 
of products and services throughout their 
lifecycle (known as the Product Review 
Process, set out in the Barclays Product 
Review Policy and Standard). This process 
considers information about the 
performance and operation of the product 
or service through a conduct lens. 

Wherever a product or service is found to 
be outside appetite, the product or service 
owner must seek to ensure actions are 
taken to address it. These actions are 
validated by functional areas, including 
Legal and Compliance.

Areas of Barclays that undertake 
Investment activity also operate additional 
product governance processes and 
controls, reflecting the higher risk of these 
more complex products and the 
importance of products and services 
meeting the needs of our Clients.
+ The BPLC, BBPLC and BBUKPLC Board Risk 

Committees review, on behalf of their respective 
Boards, the management of Compliance risk and the 
Compliance risk profile for their respective entities. 

Please refer to the report of the BPLC Board Risk 
Committee on pages 174 and 179 and the reports of 
the BBPLC and BBUKPLC Board Risk Committees 
within the BBPLC and BBUKPLC 2023 Annual Reports 
available at home.barclays/investor-relations/reports-
and-events/annual-reports/ for more information. 

Customer communications

It is important that our engagement with 
our customers is open and honest and that 
we treat them fairly to avoid foreseeable 
harm and to make sure they are not 
exploited or misled. Barclays continues to 
take steps to ensure that our customers’ 
needs and priorities are understood before 
making recommendations and that the 
communications we provide allow 
informed decisions to be made. We work 
to achieve this through a number of 
controls which focus on ensuring our 
customers receive clear information in 
order to understand the risks and benefits 
of the products we offer. For example:

• communications are sufficient, targeted 

and distributed to recipients whom 
Barclays knows or reasonably believes 
may stand to benefit from the 
communication, and are communicated 
in a manner and style that will be 
understood by the average recipient (or 
likely recipient),

• communications are withdrawn from 
further circulation when they are no 
longer accurate or fit for purpose, and

• customers do not receive inadequate 

advice, misleading information, 
unsuitable products or unacceptable 
service.

Our processes include a review of relevant 
communications which are supported by 
the Compliance and Legal functions to 
help ensure we meet both internal 
customer engagement standards and we 
are compliant with external regulations. 
Furthermore annual mandatory training is 
completed by marketing colleagues. The 
training covers key customer and brand 
standards along with the role and key 
policies set by external regulators e.g. 
regulatory requirements may require 
communications to be provided that are 
accessible to customers, or provide 
customers with the option to 'opt out'.
Remediation and redress

Barclays recognises that customer 
detriment may occur as a result of our 
error, actions or inactions, and that we 
must undertake appropriate activity 
designed to ensure our customers are put 
back in the position they would have been 
in had the issue not occurred.
Remediation can be proactive, where we 
have identified the issue ourselves (for 
example through identifying a pattern in 
customer complaints), or reactive, where 
identified by a third party such as a 
regulator of Barclays.

Where it is appropriate, Barclays works to 
ensure the operation of consistent 
principles for remediation which includes 
timely notification to the relevant 
regulatory bodies.
Reputation Risk management

The risk that an action, transaction, 
investment, event, decision, or business 
relationship will reduce trust in the Group’s 
integrity and/or competence.
Overview

A reduction of trust in the Group’s integrity 
and competence may reduce the 
attractiveness of the Group to 
stakeholders and could lead to negative 
publicity, loss of revenue, regulatory or 
legislative action, loss of existing and 
potential client business, reduced 
workforce morale and difficulties in 
recruiting talent. Ultimately it may destroy 
shareholder value.

Legal Risk management 

Organisation, roles and responsibilities

The risk of loss or imposition of penalties, 
damages or fines from the failure of the 
firm  to meet applicable laws, rules, 
regulations or  contractual requirements 
or assert or defend its intellectual property 
rights.
Overview 

The multitude of laws and regulations 
across the globe are highly dynamic and 
their application to particular 
circumstances is often unclear. This 
results in a high level of inherent legal risk 
which the Group seeks to mitigate through 
the operation of a Group-wide legal risk 
management framework. This seeks to 
mitigate legal risk, including through the 
implementation of Group-wide legal risk 
policies requiring engagement of legal 
professionals in situations that have the 
potential for legal risk, identification and 
management of legal risks by those 
professionals, and escalation of legal risk 
as necessary. Legal Risk is also mitigated 
by the complementary requirements of 
the compliance risk management 
framework, including the responsibility of 
legal professionals to proactively identify, 
communicate and provide legal advice on 
applicable laws, rules and regulations. 
Notwithstanding these mitigating actions, 
the Group operates with a level of residual 
legal risk, for which the Group has limited 
tolerance.

Barclays PLC Board is the most senior 
body responsible for reviewing and 
monitoring the effectiveness of the 
Group’s management of reputation risk.
The Group Chief Compliance Officer is 
accountable for developing a Reputation 
Risk Management Framework (RRMF), and 
the Head of Public Policy and Corporate 
Responsibility is responsible for the 
publication of appropriate Reputation Risk 
policies and associated standards, 
including tolerances against which data is 
monitored, reported on and escalated, as 
required. The RRMF sets out what is 
required to manage reputation risk across 
the Group.

The primary responsibility for identifying 
and managing reputation risk and 
adherence to the control requirements 
sits with the business and support 
functions where the risk arises.

Barclays Bank Group and Barclays Bank UK 
Group are required to operate within 
established reputation risk appetite, and 
their component businesses prepare 
reports highlighting their most significant 
current and potential reputation risks and 
issues and how they are being managed. 
These reports are a key internal source of 
information for the quarterly reputation 
risk reports which are prepared for 
Barclays Group ExCo and reviewed by the 
Group Board twice-yearly.

The Group Reputation Risk Committee is a 
sub-committee of the Group Executive 
Committee, authorised to manage 
material reputation risks and issues as they 
are brought to the attention of the 
committee via relevant reputation risk 
assessment and escalation processes.

The Group's businesses and functions 
have responsibility for identifying and 
escalating to the Legal Function legal risk in 
their areas, as well as responsibility for 
adherence to control requirements.

The Legal Function organisation and 
coverage model aligns legal expertise to 
businesses, functions, products, activities 
and geographic locations so that the 
Group receives legal advice and support 
from appropriate legal professionals, 
working in partnership proactively to 
identify, manage and escalate legal risks as 
necessary. 

The senior management of the Legal 
Function oversees, challenges and 
monitors the legal risk profile and 
effectiveness of the legal risk control 
environment across the Group. The Legal 
Function provides support to all areas of 
the bank and is not formally part of any of 
the three lines of defence. Except in 
relation to the legal advice it provides or 
procures, the Legal Function is subject to 
oversight from the second line of defence 
with respect to its own operational and 
compliance risks, as well as with respect to 
the legal risk to which the bank is exposed.

The Group General Counsel is responsible 
for developing and maintaining a Group-
wide legal risk management framework. 
This includes defining the relevant legal risk 
policies, producing the Group-wide risk 
appetite statement for legal risk, and 
oversight of the implementation of controls 
to manage and escalate legal risk.
The legal risk profile and control 
environment is reviewed by management 
through business risk committees and 
control committees. The Group Risk 
Committee is the most senior executive 
body responsible for reviewing and 
monitoring the effectiveness of risk 
management across the Group. Escalation 
paths from this committee exist to the 
Barclays PLC Board Risk Committee.

Risk performance - Climate risk

Climate risk performance

Carbon-related assets

According to TCFD, certain industry segments are more likely to be financially impacted than others due to their exposure to certain 
transition and physical risks around greenhouse gas (GHG) emissions, energy, or water dependencies associated with their operations 
and products. These non-financial industries are grouped into four key areas: Energy; Transportation; Materials and Buildings; and 
Agriculture, Food, and Forest Products. Barclays’ exposures to the industries within these groups are reported as carbon-related assets 
and can be found in the table on the following page.
Elevated risk sectors 

Based on portfolio level assessments (including for industry sectors) on climate risk, Barclays identifies and categorises sectors with 
heightened risk to climate change as elevated sectors. However, in each sector there are a range of vulnerabilities, meaning not all of 
our clients in these sectors have high emissions, and accordingly should not be interpreted as an indicator of relative carbon intensity. 
Residential Real Estate exposures are also included in this table. Barclays recognises Residential Real Estate portfolio as elevated risk, 
therefore on that basis they have been included in the table. The sectors highlighted blue in the table represent the sectors considered 
as elevated at the Group level.

Policy pressure to cut emissions to meet emission requirements, requiring high levels of capital investment and R&D 
expenditure. Phase out of fossil fuel vehicles and introduction of low emission zones in city centres. 

Being one of the hard to abate sectors, policy pressure to cut emissions requires high levels of capital investment and R&D 
expenditure. 

Reduction in demand of thermal coal, as utilities transition away from fossil fuel. More stringent air emissions regulation, 
resulting in higher levels of capital investment. 

Technological advances in low-carbon and sustainable alternatives along with  new and more stringent environmental 
regulations, including carbon tax. The increasing efforts to eliminate single-use plastics and improve recycling to prevent 
marine pollution could also impact demand for products used in plastic manufacture. 

Rising costs as a result of tighter environmental regulations and increasing water stress, vulnerable to litigation cases and 
reputational damage.

Policy pressure to cut emissions, exposure to carbon taxes and overall increasing environmental regulation of operations 
and restrictions on access to new resources. Over time, falling demand for fossil fuels. 

Policy pressure to cut emissions and move to renewable sources of energy, leading to increased capital expenditure costs, 
plus potential exposure to carbon taxes. 

Evolving taxation on emissions may impact production methods, supply chain and farm viability. Reduced demand for meat 
and dairy as a consequence of shifts in consumer behaviour. Volatile weather conditions and extreme weather events may 
impact farm credit quality 

Residential Real Estate

Evolving minimum energy efficiency requirements and increasing physical risks from flood, subsidence and coastal erosion 
have the potential to impact house prices and homeowner affordability. 

Shipping

Steel

Road Haulage

More stringent carbon tax regulations and policy pressure to cut emissions and adopt low-emission fuels, requiring higher 
levels of R&D expenditure and capital investment. 

Being an energy-intensive sector, the sector is exposed to the policy pressure to cut emissions and evolving air pollution 
regulation .

Credit exposure to nature priority sectors

For the first time we disclose credit exposure to sectors defined by TNFD in its Additional Guidance for Financial Institutions as “Nature 
priority sectors” which we note is a core TNFD metric for banks under the TNFD disclosure framework published in September 2023. As 
part of our efforts to calculate and disclose this metric, we have mapped the industry codes provided by TNFD to Barclays  Industry 
classifications.  The monitoring and reporting of our exposures to these TNFD identified nature priority sectors will continue to evolve in 
line with approaches taken to nature-related risk management and as the list of priority sectors set out in the TNFD Guidance for 
Financial Institutions is updated and as such, are subject to change in future.  Nature-related risks within a sector may vary substantially 
according to company and project.

2 The TNFD highlights real estate development as a high-priority sector for nature. Barclays has £29,919m (2022: £32,597m)  of Loans & Advances and Loan Commitments to Real 
Estate Management and Development, of which the majority is from real estate investment activity. As a result, this has been excluded from the Priority sector assets for Nature.
3 Loans & advances includes debt securities at amortised cost amounting to £56,789m (2022: £45,487m) of which nature priority sector assets are £2,906m (2022: £3,482m). These 
nature priority sector assets comprises £2,643m (2022: £3,406m) in Material & Buildings, £238m (2022: £74m) in Transport and storage and £25m (2022: £2m) in Energy and water.

Financing 

To facilitate greater understanding and transparency of our capital markets financing, we disclose the total capital raised for clients 
across all sectors using data sourced from Dealogic. We have provided the  breakdown of our 2022 and 2023 financing below. We have 
constructed this table based on the mapping of issuers’ industry assignment in Dealogic data and Barclays’ internal industry taxonomy 
called Barclays Industry Classification (BIC). Financing volumes are reported on a manager-proceeds basis including bonds, equities, 
loans and securitised bonds and no modifications have been made by Barclays. This data represents a third party view of our financing 
and is subject to Dealogic’s league table methodology, which pro-rates volume across lead-managers. We are presenting the data in 
this format to support transparency and comparability but it should be noted that this data is subject to further analysis and 
methodological enhancements, before it is included in BlueTrack™.

Risk performance - Climate risk (continued)

Subsidence: Total Volume of stock (as % of total UK 
Mortgages portfolio) per risk band

Flood: Total Volume of stock (as % of total UK Mortgages 
portfolio) per risk band

Flooding in the UK is forecast to increase over time, with the 
potential for this increase to accelerate if greenhouse gas 
emissions are not reduced. The increased risk of flooding has the 
potential to impact the valuation of properties directly, as well as 
indirectly where a particular area becomes high risk and property 
demand falls. Remediation costs, high insurance premiums or 
potential lack of insurance coverage have the potential to impact 
affordability. 

Barclays works with a third-party climate data provider to support 
climate risk data enhancements within the UK Mortgages 
portfolio. This has enabled Barclays to move from postcode level 
to property level flood data granularity. Flood Risk bands are based 
on average annual loss,  generated using flood hazard frequency 
and flood depth from tidal, surface, pluvial and fluvial flooding and 
accounting for the mitigating impact of flood defences where 
these are present. Properties in the Moderate and High Risk bands 
are expected to face above average insurance costs given their 
elevated exposure to flood risk. Those within the Very High band 
are considered likely to be eligible for Flood Re (a subsidised flood 
insurance scheme).

Subsidence is driven by the interplay of precipitation, temperature 
and soil type factors, which result in volumetric changes to the 
soil. Increased volatility in weather conditions, as a result of 
climate change, contributes to the acceleration of subsidence 
impacts. Some areas, particularly those with high concentrations 
of clay soil (i.e. London), are more susceptible to subsidence. This 
shrink-swell impact can cause localised property level impacts, 
resulting in impacts to the valuation of a property, or impacts to 
affordability through remediation costs and high insurance 
premiums. 

Barclays works with a third-party climate data provider to support 
climate risk data enhancements within the UK Mortgages 
portfolio. This includes the ability to map subsidence risk at a 
property level granularity. The subsidence risk scoring is based on 
soil properties, in particular the extent to which the soil will shrink 
under hot and dry weather conditions, as well as the predicted 
temperature and probability of extreme rainfall. These variables 
are combined with subsidence claims per postcode to generate a 
pseudo-quantitative score, where a property in class 9 is around 
nine times as likely as a property in class 1 to make a subsidence 
claim. A small proportion of the UK Mortgage portfolio is not 
mapped to a subsidence risk score (c.5.2%). This is due either to a 
lack of data coverage (i.e. the property is not covered by 
underlying maps), or a lack of certainty in address matching.

Flood: Very High & High Flood Risk Exposure per region (as % of Total Regional Exposure)

The map below represents the proportion of properties within the UK Mortgages portfolio at High and Very High risk of flood per region 
as a percentage of the total regional exposure (excluding Kensington Mortgage Company originated properties). The flood metrics are 
presented on present day risk levels and are based on average annual loss, generated using flood hazard frequency and flood depth 
from tidal, surface, pluvial and fluvial flooding and accounting for the mitigating impact of flood defences where these are present. The 
mapping covers c.95% of the UK Mortgages portfolio on a total exposure basis - the remaining c.5% of properties are not currently 
mapped to flood risk ratings on a property level basis as a result of a lack of data coverage (i.e. the property is not covered by underlying 
maps), or a lack of certainty in address matching.

Business Banking - Dairy & Cattle Exposure

The transition risk in the Business Banking portfolio is assessed via the percentage Dairy & Cattle lending of the Business Banking 
Agriculture portfolio. Given methane’s global warming potential the Dairy & Cattle sector is a significant contributor to the UK’s 
emissions footprint and is therefore susceptible to the transition risks of climate change, namely consumer preference changes and 
potential emissions taxation. 

Barclays utilises exposure data to identify what proportion of the Business Banking  Agriculture portfolio consists of lending to Dairy 
& Cattle clients.

EPC: Total Volume of stock (as % of total UK Mortgages portfolio) per EPC rating

The transition risk in the UK Mortgages portfolio is assessed via the distribution of EPC ratings across the portfolio. One of the levers to 
decarbonise the UK housing stock for the UK Government is to tighten energy efficiency requirements. It is anticipated that any 
tightening of minimum energy efficiency standards (MEES) will focus initially on buy-to-let properties. Buy-to-Let properties which are 
privately rented are currently required to have a minimum EPC rating of E. The transition risk identified has the potential to impact the 
valuation of properties directly, alongside impacting affordability as properties which fall under MEES may no longer be able to be rented 
out or the landlord may need to pay for retrofitting to be brought up to standard.

EPC ratings range from A (most efficient) to G (least efficient). EPC ratings are used as the basis for assessing expected energy costs 
but do not give a precise picture of emission intensity. The UK Mortgages portfolio is mapped to the Government EPC Register. 
Properties may not feature on the Government EPC Register as some properties may have never been required to have an EPC rating  
(not been sold or rented out since 2007), their EPC rating may have expired (EPC ratings are valid for 10 years) or the property may be in 
Scotland or Northern Ireland (which use separate databases). Whilst Barclays’ proportion of ‘missing EPC ratings’ has declined year on 
year, the issue of missing EPC ratings is prevalent across the industry.

Credit risk: summary of contents

Credit risk represents a significant risk and mainly arises 
from exposure to loans and advances together with the 
counterparty credit risk arising from derivative contracts 
entered into with clients.
This section outlines the expected credit loss allowances, 
the movements in allowances during the period, material 
management adjustments to model output and 
measurement uncertainty and sensitivity analysis.

The Group reviews and monitors risk concentrations in a 
variety of ways. This section outlines performance against 
key concentration risks.

Credit risk monitors exposure performance across a range 
of significant portfolios.

The Group monitors exposures to assets where there is a 
heightened likelihood of default and assets where an actual 
default has occurred. From time to time, suspension of 
certain aspects of client credit agreements are agreed, 
generally during temporary periods of financial difficulties 
where the Group is confident that the client will be able to 
remedy the suspension. This section outlines the current 
exposure to assets with this treatment.

Credit quality

Charge

All disclosures in this section are unaudited 
unless otherwise stated.
Overview

Credit risk represents a significant risk to 
the Group and mainly arises from exposure 
to loans and advances together with the 
counterparty credit risk arising from 
derivative contracts entered with clients.

Credit risk disclosures exclude other 
financial assets not subject to credit risk, 
mainly equity securities. For off-balance 
sheet exposures certain contingent 
liabilities not subject to credit risk such as 
performance guarantees are excluded.
Task force on Disclosure about Expected 
Credit Losses (DECL)

Credit risk disclosures have been enhanced 
to include DECL III recommendations for 
minimum product grouping and 
geographical breakdown for this period and 
prior period comparatives have been 
aligned.
Summary of performance in the 
period

Gross exposure

Gross loans and advances at amortised 
cost to customers and banks have 
remained broadly stable at £405bn, which 
includes increase in debt securities driven 
by Treasury investments and strategic 
acquisitions in Home Finance. This is offset 
by a reduction due to the German 
consumer finance business classified as 
assets held for sale and foreign exchange 
movements in Corporate & Investment 
Bank (CIB) and US Cards portfolio.
Maximum exposure

The Group’s net exposure to credit risk is 
broadly stable at £1,030bn (2022: 
£1,033bn). Overall, the extent to which the 
mitigation is held against its total exposure 
has decreased to 42% (2022: 44%) 
primarily due to decrease in derivative 
financial instruments (£46bn) and reverse 
repurchase agreements (£14bn), both of 
which are highly secured instruments.

Delinquencies are broadly stable across the 
group with an increase observed in US 
cards, which was anticipated. A range of 
activities are in place to protect our existing 
defensive positioning against current 
macroeconomic headwinds.

Credit impairment charges were £1,881m 
(2022: £1,220m), reflecting an increase in 
delinquencies in US cards, which was 
anticipated, and led to higher coverage in 
CC&P.
Management Adjustments

Economic uncertainty adjustments have 
decreased to £198m (2022: £317m). The 
reduction is informed by the rebuild of 
certain impairment models which better 
capture the macroeconomic outlook. 
Furthermore, adjustments have been 
reassessed to capture affordability 
headwinds in UK retail lending. 
+ Refer  to  the  Management  adjustment  to  models 
for  impairment  section  on  page  307  for  further 
details.

Climate

Barclays has performed a credit risk 
assessment of physical and transition risk 
due to climate change. This was delivered 
through a combination of a scenario 
approach and targeted reviews on specific 
portfolios identified as more susceptible to 
climate risk. The analysis did not result in a 
separately identifiable impairment charge 
for year end 2023 reporting.
+ Further detail can be found in the Financial  

statements section in Note 8 Credit impairment 
charges/(releases). Description of terminology can 
be found in the glossary, available at 
home.barclays/annualreport.

Refer to credit risk management section  for the 
details of governance, policies and procedures.

+

Corporate loans portfolio benefited from 
high-quality exposure and credit 
protection.
+

Further analysis on the credit quality of assets is 
presented in the approach to management and 
representation of credit quality section.

Stage Decomposition

A net decrease of £3.2bn is observed in 
Stage 2 gross exposure driven by an 
improved GDP forecast and higher 
repayments in Corporate loans partially 
offset by an increase in retail lending 
following resumption of more regular spend 
activity and higher interest rates. 

Stage 3 balances have increased to £7.2bn 
(2022: £7.1bn) driven by higher 
delinquencies in US cards partially offset by 
repayments in Business Banking.
+ Refer to pages 305 to 306 for further details.

Scenario

Economic uncertainty continues, linked to 
higher interest rates and ongoing 
inflationary pressures in major economies. 
For Q423, macroeconomic scenarios have 
been refreshed and are designed around a 
broad range of economic outcomes. The 
Downside 2 (DS2) scenario has been 
aligned to Barclays 2023 Internal Stress 
Test (IST23) which is less severe in terms of 
GDP deterioration, resulting in increased 
DS2 weights. 
ECL

Impairment allowances on loans and 
advances at amortised cost including off-
balance sheet has increased to £6,252m 
(2022:£6,175m) predominantly driven by 
increase in US cards partially offset by a 
reduction due to the German consumer 
finance business classified as assets held 
for sale. On-balance sheet coverage has 
remained strong and stable at 1.4%.

Risk performance - Credit risk (continued)

Maximum exposure and effects of netting, collateral and risk transfer

The following tables present a reconciliation between the Group's maximum exposure and its net exposure to credit risk, reflecting the 
financial effects of risk mitigation reducing the Group's exposure.

The Group mitigates the credit risk to which it is exposed through netting and set-off, collateral and risk transfer. Further detail on the 
Group’s policies to each of these forms of credit enhancement is presented on pages 131 to 134 of the Barclays PLC Pillar 3 Report 
2023 (unaudited).
Collateral obtained

Where collateral has been obtained in the event of default, the Group does not, ordinarily, use such assets for its own operations and 
they are usually sold on a timely basis. The carrying value of assets held by the Group as at 31 December 2023, as a result of the 
enforcement of collateral, was £6m (2022: £31m).

Off-balance sheet exposures are shown gross of provisions of £504m (2022: £583m). See Note 24 for further details. In addition to the 
above, the Group holds forward starting reverse repos with notional contract amounts of £54.3bn (2022: £48.4bn). These balances are  
fully collateralised. Corporate loans at amortised cost  include £5.3bn (2022: £8bn) of BBLS, CBILS and CLBILS supported by UK 
government guarantees of £5.1bn (2022: £7.6bn), which are included within the Risk transfer column in the table. For further 
information on credit risk mitigation techniques, refer to the Credit risk management section. Loan commitments reported also include 
exposures relating to financial assets classified as assets held for sale.

Risk performance - Credit risk (continued)

Expected Credit Losses

Loans and advances at amortised cost by geography

Total loans and advances at amortised cost in the credit risk performance section includes loans and advances at amortised cost to 
banks and loans and advances at amortised cost to customers.

The table below presents a product and geographical breakdown by stages of loans and advances at amortised cost. Also included are 
stage  allocation  of  debt  securities  and  off-balance  sheet  loan  commitments  and  financial  guarantee  contracts  by  gross  exposure, 
impairment allowance and coverage ratio as at 31 December 2023.

Impairment allowance under IFRS 9 considers both the drawn and the undrawn counterparty exposure. For retail portfolios, the total 
impairment allowance is allocated to gross loans and advances to the extent allowance does not exceed the drawn exposure and any 
excess is reported on the liabilities side of the balance sheet as a provision. For corporate portfolios, impairment allowance on undrawn 
exposure is reported on the liability side of the balance sheet as a provision.

Risk performance - Credit risk (continued)

Movement in gross exposures and impairment allowance including provisions for loan commitments and 
financial guarantees

The following tables present a reconciliation of the opening to the closing balance of the exposure and impairment allowance. 

Transfers between stages in the tables have been reflected as if they had taken place at the beginning of the year. 'Net drawdowns, 
repayments,  net-remeasurement  and  movements  due  to  exposure  and  risk  parameter  changes'  includes  additional  drawdowns  and 
partial repayments from existing facilities. Additionally, the below tables do not include other financial assets subject to impairment such 
as debt securities at amortised cost, cash collateral and settlement balances, financial assets at fair value through other comprehensive 
income and other assets. 

The movements are measured over a 12-month period.

1 Business activity in the year reported within Retail mortgages includes an acquisition of Kensington Mortgage Company in UK Mortgages of £2.4bn.
2 The £531m of disposals reported within Retail mortgages relate to transfer of facilities to a non-consolidated special purpose vehicle for the purpose of securitisation. The £186m  of 
disposals reported within Retail credit cards include debt sales undertaken during the year. The £134m of disposals reported within Retail other include £64m part sale of Wealth 
portfolio in Italy and £70m of debt sales undertaken during the year.

3 Refinements to models used for calculation reported within Retail credit cards include a £88m movement in UK Cards, £43m movement in US Cards and £(111)m movement in the 

German consumer finance business. These reflect model enhancements  made during the year. Barclays continually reviews the output of models to determine accuracy of the ECL 
calculation including review of model monitoring, external benchmarking and experience of model operation over an extended period of time. This helps to ensure that the models used 
continue to reflect the  risks inherent across the businesses.

4 Transfers to assets held for sale reported within Retail credit cards and Retail other relate to the German consumer finance business.

1 Refinements to models used for calculation reported within Corporate loans include a £93m movement in Corporate and Investment Bank and £20m movement in Barclaycard 

Payments. These reflect model enhancements made during the year. Barclays continually reviews the output of models to determine accuracy of the ECL calculation including review  of 
model monitoring, external benchmarking and experience of model operation over an extended period of time. This helps to ensure that the models used continue to reflect the risks 
inherent across the businesses.

2 'Net drawdowns, repayments, net re-measurement and movements due to exposure and risk parameter changes' reported within Corporate loans also include assets of £0.8bn 

derecognised due to payment received on defaulted loans from government guarantees issued under government’s Bounce Back Loans Scheme.

3 The £608m of disposals reported within Corporate loans relate to debt sales undertaken during the year. 
4 In 2023, gross write-offs amounted to £1,168m (2022: £1,620m) and post write-off recoveries amounted to £44m (2022: £64m). Net write-offs represent gross write-offs less post 

write-off recoveries and amounted to £1,124m (2022: £1,556m).

5 Recoveries and reimbursements include £29m for reimbursements expected to be received under the arrangement where Group has entered into financial guarantee contracts  which  

provide credit protection over certain assets with third parties and  cash recoveries of previously written off amounts of £44m.

1 Refinements to model  used for calculation reported within Corporate loans include a £(0.5)bn movement in Business Banking. These reflect model enhancements made during the 
year. Barclays continually review the output of models to determine  accuracy of the ECL calculation including review of model monitoring, external benchmarking and experience of 
model operation over an extended period of time. This ensures that the models used continue to reflect the risks inherent across the businesses. 

2 'Net drawdowns, repayments, net re-measurement and movements due to exposure and risk parameter changes' reported within  Corporate loans also include assets of £1.3bn   

derecognised due to payment received on defaulted loans from government guarantees issued under government’s Bounce Back Loans Scheme.

3 The £80m of disposals reported within Corporate loans relate to debt sales undertaken during the year. 
4 In 2022, gross write-offs amounted to £1,620m. In Q422, £329m of balances with de minimis recovery expectations were written-off in line with policy in UK Cards and Unsecured 

Loans. Post write-off recoveries amounted to £64m. Net write-offs represent gross write-offs less post write-off recoveries and amounted to £1,556m.

5 Recoveries and reimbursements include £199m for reimbursements expected to be received under the arrangement where Group has entered into financial  guarantees contracts   

which provide credit protection over certain assets with third parties and cash recoveries of previously written off amounts of £64m.

Risk performance - Credit risk (continued)

Stage 2 decomposition

Stage  2  exposures  are  predominantly  identified  using  quantitative  tests  where  the  lifetime  PD  has  deteriorated  more  than  a  pre-
determined  amount  since  origination  during  the  year.  This  is  augmented  by  inclusion  of  accounts  meeting  the  designated  high  risk 
criteria (including watchlist) for the portfolio under the qualitative test.

A small number of other accounts (1.5% of impairment allowance and 2.2% of gross exposure) are included in Stage 2. These accounts 
are not otherwise identified by the quantitative or qualitative tests but are more than 30 days past due. The percentage triggered by 
these backstop criteria is a measure of the effectiveness of the Stage 2 criteria in identifying deterioration prior to delinquency. These 
balances include items in the Corporate and Investment Bank for reasons such as outstanding interest and fees rather than principal 
balances.

Stage 3 decomposition

Stage 3 is comprised of exposures that are considered to be credit impaired. An asset is considered credit impaired when one or more 
events occur that have a detrimental impact on the estimated future cash flows of the financial asset. This comprises assets defined as 
defaulted and other individually assessed exposures where imminent default or actual loss is identified.

1 Positive values reflect an increase in impairment allowance and negative values reflect a reduction in the impairment allowance.
2 Includes £5.2bn (2022: £4.8bn) of modelled ECL, £0.4bn (2022: £0.4bn) of individually assessed impairments and £0.3bn (2022: £0.5bn) ECL from non-modelled exposures and debt 

securities.

3 Total impairment allowance consists of ECL stock on drawn and undrawn exposure. 

Economic uncertainty adjustments

Models have been developed with data from non-inflationary periods establishing a relationship between input variables and customer 
delinquency based on past behaviour. As such there is a risk that the modelled output fails to capture the appropriate response to 
changes in macroeconomic variables including higher interest rates and continuing inflationary stress with modelled impairment 
provisions impacted by uncertainty.

This uncertainty continues to be captured in two ways. Firstly, customer uncertainty: the identification of customers and clients who 
may be more vulnerable to economic instability; and secondly, model uncertainty: to capture the impact from model limitations and 
sensitivities to specific macroeconomic parameters which are applied at a portfolio level.

Economic uncertainty adjustments have decreased from last year following the re-build of UK cards and certain CIB impairment models 
which better capture the macroeconomic outlook. Furthermore, adjustments have been reassessed to capture affordability headwinds 
in UK retail lending.
The balance as at 31 December 2023 is £198m (2022: £317m) and includes:

Customer and client uncertainty provisions of £166m (2022: £423m):
 UK retail lending includes adjustments applied to customers considered most vulnerable to affordability pressures.
• Retail mortgages (UK) £25m (2022: £4m): The increase primarily reflects the risk of borrowers refinancing onto higher rates in the 

medium term.

• Retail credit cards (UK) £45m (2022: £93m): The reduction reflects the re-build of UK cards impairment models which better 

capture sensitivity to movements in interest rates and inflation.

• Retail other (UK) £9m (2022: £23m): The reduction reflects customer resilience to affordability headwinds.
Corporate loans £87m (2022: £301m): This includes an adjustment of £71m in UK to reflect possible cross default risk on Barclays’ 
lending in respect of clients who have taken bounce back loans and £16m in Rest of the World (ROW) to provide for downside 
uncertainties on European Corporates reflecting recent changes in the macroeconomic outlook.

The reduction of £(214)m in UK and ROW is informed by retirement of an adjustment for high risk sectors following a granular credit risk 
assessment, and re-build of certain CIB impairment models which more appropriately capture downside risk.

Model uncertainty provisions of £32m (2022: £(106)m):
Retail mortgages (UK) £32m (2022: nil ): This includes an adjustment to correct for higher recovery expectations impacted by model 
oversensitivity to certain macroeconomic variables. 
Corporate loans £nil (2022: £(106)m): The adjustment held in the previous year to correct for model oversensitivity has been retired 
following the re-build of certain CIB impairment models which more appropriately capture the macroeconomic outlook.
Other adjustments

Other adjustments are operational in nature and are expected to remain in place until they can be reflected in the underlying models. 
These adjustments result from data limitations and model performance related issues identified through model monitoring and other 
established governance processes.
Other adjustments of £179m (2022: £208m) includes:

Adjustments for definition of default (DOD) under the Capital Requirements Regulation and model monitoring in Retail mortgages, 
Retail other and Corporate loans.
Retail mortgages (UK) £121m (2022: £85m): The increase reflects re-sizing of an adjustment for DOD and an ECL provision for 
Kensington Mortgages which was acquired during the year.
Retail credit cards:
• UK £(9)m (2022: £32m): The reduction is informed by retirement of operational adjustments following the re-build of UK cards 

impairment models.

• ROW £8m (2022: £55m): The reduction is informed by retirement of an adjustment in US cards for high-risk account management 

(HRAM) accounts following model remediation during the year.

Retail other:
• UK £62m (2022: £80m): The underlying adjustments were re-sized and remain broadly in line with the previous year.
• ROW £(6)m (2022: £19m): The reduction is informed by the German consumer finance business classified as assets held for sale.
Corporate loans:
• UK £10m (2022: £166m): The reduction is informed by retirement of model monitoring adjustments in CIB following the re-build of 
certain impairment models. Further, operational adjustments have been introduced during the year to remediate conservative 
modelled recovery expectations in the ESHLA portfolio.

• ROW £(4)m (2022: £(229)m): The previously held adjustments linked to model monitoring and ECL sensitivity to the macroeconomic 

variable for Federal Tax Receipts have been retired following the re-build of certain CIB impairment models.

Risk performance - Credit risk (continued)

Climate Risk ECL assessment

Barclays performed a credit risk assessment of physical and transition risk due to climate change. This was delivered through a 
combination of a scenario approach and targeted reviews on specific portfolios identified as more susceptible to climate risk. The 
analysis did not result in a separately identifiable impairment charge for year end 2023 reporting.
Scenario Approach: The climate stress test macroeconomic scenario was used in lieu of the production Downside 2 scenario to 
determine impact on the weighted average ECL output. The output of this analysis was not significant to warrant an additional climate-
related impairment charge.
Specific Approach: The approach reviewed portfolios previously identified from both internal and external stress tests as more 
susceptible to climate risks. In particular, the UK Mortgage portfolio was reviewed to determine the impact of a plausible change in 
regulation requiring landlords to upgrade properties to minimum EPC rating of C in the buy-to-let portfolio. In addition, within the 
Wholesale portfolio, certain elevated risk sectors (predominantly Oil & Gas, Automotive and Power sectors) were subject to a review 
that considered probability of default impact at a counterparty level determined by individual susceptibility to transition climate risks. 
The output of this review did not provide variances in ECL deemed sufficiently certain to warrant raising an additional climate-related 
charge in 2023. 

Barclays  acknowledges  that  impairment  could  increase  over  time  as  risks  become  more  tangible  and  impact  consumers  and  clients 
through physical risks or via impacts from the transition to a low carbon economy. Therefore, Barclays continues to review credit risk 
outputs  to  determine  if  any  additional  physical  or  transition  climate  risks  are  identified  that  are  not  sufficiently  captured  via  model 
output.

Refer to the Barclays resilience to climate scenarios on page 132 for further details.

Measurement uncertainty and sensitivity analysis

The measurement of modelled ECL involves complexity and judgement, including estimation of probabilities of default (PD), loss given 
default (LGD), a range of unbiased future economic scenarios, estimation of expected lives, estimation of exposures at default (EAD) 
and assessing significant increases in credit risk. The Group uses a five-scenario model to calculate ECL. An external consensus 
forecast is assembled from key sources, including HM Treasury (short and medium term forecasts) and  Bloomberg (based on median 
of economic forecasts) which forms the Baseline scenario. In addition, two adverse scenarios (Downside 1 and Downside 2) and two 
favourable scenarios (Upside 1 and Upside 2) are derived, with associated probability weightings. The adverse scenarios are calibrated 
to a broadly similar severity to the Group's internal stress tests and stress scenarios provided by regulators whilst also considering IFRS 
9 specific sensitivities and non-linearity. The favourable scenarios are designed to reflect plausible upside risks to the Baseline scenario 
which are broadly consistent with the economic narrative approved by the Senior Scenario Review Committee. All scenarios are 
regenerated at a minimum semi-annually. The scenarios include key economic variables, (including GDP, unemployment, House Price 
Index (HPI) and base rates in both the UK and US markets), and expanded variables using statistical models based on historical 
correlations. The upside and downside shocks are designed to evolve over a five-year stress horizon, with all five scenarios converging 
to a steady state after approximately seven years.

Scenarios used to calculate the Group’s ECL charge were refreshed in Q423 with the Baseline scenario reflecting the latest consensus 
macroeconomic forecasts available at the time of the scenario refresh. In the Baseline scenario, whilst UK and US economies avoid a 
recession, GDP growth remains weak in the coming quarters and beyond as restrictive monetary policies, which impact economies with 
a lag, continue to restrain growth. Having peaked in 2022, consumer price inflation in key regions continues to ease over 2023 and 2024. 
The UK and US unemployment rates rise to 4.8% and 4.4% respectively over 2024 and then stabilise. With the significant decline in 
inflationary pressures, major central banks refrain from further interest rate increases. UK house prices continue to decline in 2024 
before stabilising and resuming the upward trend from 2025. The housing market in the US remains more resilient, with house prices 
continuing to grow.

In the Downside 2 scenario, inflationary pressures are assumed to intensify again, mainly driven by strong wage growth. Central banks 
raise rates further, with the UK bank rate and the US federal fund rate each reaching 8.5% in Q324. High interest rates suddenly bring 
stress into the financial and non-financial system, causing joblessness to spike and triggering a housing markets crisis and central banks 
are forced cut interest rates aggressively. Falling demand reduces UK and US GDP and headline inflation drops to close to zero. In the 
Upside 2 scenario, tighter and more productive labour markets help to accelerate economic growth whilst keeping inflationary 
pressures under control. With inflation quickly returning to target, central banks lower interest rates, further stimulating aggregate 
demand and GDP growth.

The methodology for estimating scenario probability weights involves simulating a range of future paths for UK and US GDP using 
historical data with the five scenarios mapped against the distribution of these future paths. The median is centred around the Baseline 
with scenarios further from the Baseline attracting a lower weighting before the five weights are normalised to total 100%. The same 
scenarios used in the estimation of expected credit losses are also used to inform Barclays' internal planning. The impacts across the 
portfolios are different because of the sensitivities of each of the portfolios to specific macroeconomic variables, for example, 
mortgages are highly sensitive to house prices, credit cards and unsecured consumer loans are highly sensitive to unemployment. The 
increases in the Downside scenario weightings reflected a reduction in GDP stress severity in the Downside scenarios which brought 
the GDP of these scenarios closer to the Baseline. The increases in the Upside scenario weightings were driven by the improvement in 
actual GDP and the Baseline scenario, bringing the Baseline scenario closer to the Upside scenarios. For further details see page 314. 

The economic uncertainty adjustments of £0.2bn (2022: £0.3bn) have been applied as overlays to the modelled ECL output. These 
adjustments consist of a customer and client uncertainty provision of £0.2bn (2022: £0.4bn) which has been applied to customers and 
clients considered most vulnerable to affordability pressures, and a model uncertainty adjustment of £0.0bn (2022: £(0.1)bn). For 
further details see pages 307 to 309.

The tables below show the key macroeconomic variables used in the five scenarios (5 year annual paths), the probability weights applied 
to each scenario and the macroeconomic variables by scenario using ‘specific bases’ i.e. the most extreme position of each variable in 
the context of the scenario, for example, the highest unemployment for downside scenarios and the lowest unemployment for upside 
scenarios. 5-year average tables and movement over time graphs provide additional transparency. Annual paths show quarterly 
averages for the year (unemployment and base rate) or change in the year (GDP and HPI).

1 Model exposures are allocated to a stage based on an individual scenario rather than a probability-weighted approach, as required for Barclays reported impairment allowances. As a result, it is not 

possible to back solve the final reported weighted ECL from individual scenarios given balances may be assigned to a different stage dependent on the scenario.

2 Model exposures and ECL reported within Retail credit cards and Retail other excludes the German consumer finance business which has now been classified as assets held for sale.
3 Model exposures allocated to Stage 3 does not change in any of the scenarios as the transition criteria relies only on an observable evidence of default as at 31 December 2023 and not on 

macroeconomic scenario.

4 Material corporate loan defaults are individually assessed across different recovery strategies. As a result, ECL of £401m is reported as an individually assessed impairment in the reconciliation table.

The use of five scenarios with associated weighting results in a total weighted ECL uplift from the Baseline ECL of 1.5%.
Retail mortgages: Total weighted ECL of £383m represents a 4.6% increase over the Baseline ECL (£366m) with coverage ratios 
remaining steady across the Upside scenarios, Baseline and Downside 1 scenario. Under the Downside 2 scenario, total ECL increases 
to  £538m driven by a significant fall in UK HPI.
Retail credit cards: Total weighted ECL of £3,561m is broadly aligned to the Baseline ECL (£3,542m). Total ECL increases to £3,893m 
under the Downside 2 scenario, driven by an increase in UK and US unemployment rate.
Retail other: Total weighted ECL of £212m is aligned to the Baseline ECL (£211m). Total ECL increases to £233m under the Downside 
2 scenario, largely driven by an increase in UK unemployment rate.
Corporate loans: Total weighted ECL of £1,015m represents a 3.8% increase over the Baseline ECL (£978m). Total  ECL increases to 
£1,438m under the Downside 2 scenario, driven by a decrease in UK and US GDP.

1 Model exposures are allocated to a stage based on an individual scenario rather than a probability-weighted approach, as required for Barclays reported impairment allowances. As a result, it is not 

possible to back solve the final reported weighted ECL from individual scenarios given balances may be assigned to a different stage dependent on the scenario.

2 Model exposures allocated to Stage 3 does not change in any of the scenarios as the transition criteria relies only on an observable evidence of default as at 31 December 2022 and not on 

macroeconomic scenario.

3 Material corporate loan defaults are individually assessed across different recovery strategies. As a result, ECL of £434m is reported as an individually assessed impairment in the reconciliation table.

Annual Report 2023 320

Risk performance - Credit risk (continued)

Analysis of the concentration of credit risk

A concentration of credit risk exists when a number of counterparties are located in a common geographical region or are engaged in 
similar activities and have similar economic characteristics that would cause their ability to meet contractual obligations to be similarly 
affected by changes in economic or other conditions. The Group implements limits on concentrations in order to mitigate the risk. 

The table below presents an industry credit risk concentration analysis of loans and advances at amortised cost net of impairment 
allowance including breakdown by geographical location of the counterparty or customers, impairment stage, maturity and an indicator 
of inclusion in carbon-related sectors. A further table is included with geography, impairment stage and maturity allocation of debt 
securities at amortised cost, off- balance sheet commitments and financial guarantees and contingent liabilities at amortised cost.

Further detail on the Group policies with regard to managing concentration risk is presented in the Barclays PLC Pillar 3 Report 2023 
(unaudited).

The approach to management and representation of credit quality

Asset credit quality

The credit quality distribution is based on the IFRS 9 12-month probability of default (PD) at the reporting date to ensure comparability 
with other ECL disclosures in the Expected Credit Losses section.

The following internal measures are used to determine credit quality for loans:

PD Range %

Internal Default 
Grade  Band

0.00 to < 0.15

0.15 to < 0.25

0.25 to < 0.50

0.50 to < 0.75

For retail clients, a range of analytical tools is used to derive the probability of default of clients at inception and on an ongoing basis.

For loans that are not past due, these descriptions can be summarised as follows:
Strong: there is a very high likelihood of the asset being recovered in full.
Satisfactory: while there is a high likelihood that the asset will be recovered and therefore, of no cause for concern to the Group, the 
asset may not be collateralised, or may relate to unsecured retail facilities. At the lower end of this grade there are customers that are 
being more carefully monitored, for example, corporate customers which are indicating some evidence of deterioration, home loans 
with a high loan to value, and unsecured retail loans operating outside normal product guidelines.
Higher risk: there is concern over the obligor’s ability to make payments when due. However, these have not yet converted to actual 
delinquency. There may also be doubts over the value of collateral or security provided. However, the borrower or counterparty is 
continuing to make payments when due and is expected to settle all outstanding amounts of principal and interest.

Loans that are past due are monitored closely, with impairment allowances raised as appropriate and in line with the Group’s 
impairment policies. 
Debt securities

For assets held at fair value, the carrying value on the balance sheet will include, among other things, the credit risk of the issuer. Most 
listed and some unlisted securities are rated by external rating agencies. The Group mainly uses external credit ratings provided by 
Standard & Poor’s, Fitch or Moody’s. Where such ratings are not available or are not current, the Group will use its own internal ratings 
for the securities.

Risk performance - Credit risk (continued)

Credit exposures by internal PD grade

The below tables represent credit risk profiles by PD grade for loans and advances at amortised cost, contingent liabilities and loan 
commitments.

Stage 1 higher risk assets, presented gross of associated collateral held, are of weaker credit quality but have not significantly 
deteriorated since origination. 

IFRS 9 Stage 1 and Stage 2 classification is not dependent solely on the absolute probability of default but on elements that determine a 
Significant Increase in Credit Risk, including relative movement in probability of default since initial recognition. There is therefore no 
direct relationship between credit quality and IFRS 9 stage classification.

New home loans bookings in 2023 decreased 25% to £22.7bn (2022: 30.3bn) and the 90 day arrears rate increased to 0.2% (2022: 
0.1%), mainly driven by economic conditions that resulted in general mortgage market suppression, including higher mortgage 
payments as rates continued to rise and increased cost of living factors in line with inflation in 2023.
Head Office: Italian home loans and advances at amortised cost reduced to £3.6bn (2022: £4.5bn) and continue to run-off since new 
bookings ceased in 2016. The portfolio is secured on residential property with an average balance weighted mark to market LTV of 
55.6% (2022: 58.8%). 90-day arrears increased to 2.4% (2022: 1.2%) due to deterioration caused by affordability stress related to rising 
inflation and interest rates. The gross charge-off rate was broadly stable at 0.7% (2022: 0.6%).

UK cards: 30 day and 90 day arrears rates remained stable at 0.9% (2022: 0.9%) and 0.2% (2022: 0.2%) respectively. Total exposure 
increased from £9.9bn to £10.4bn due to growth in spend and promotional balances.  Both the gross and net write off rates decreased 
by 2.3% driven by the impact of a strategy change in 2022 to align the point of charge off and write off in that year and lower charge off 
rates in 2023.
UK personal loans: 30 and 90 day arrears rates have remained broadly stable at 1.5% (2022: 1.4%) and 0.6%  (2022: 0.6%) respectively. 
Both the gross and net write off rates decreased by 2.8%, driven by the impact of a strategy change in 2022 to align the point of charge 
off and write off in that year and by the impact of large bulk sales in 2022 which reduced the flow to write off in 2023. 
Barclays Partner Finance: 30 and 90 day arrears rates increased marginally to 0.6% (2022: 0.5%) and 0.3% (2022: 0.2%) respectively as 
the weighting of lower risk customers with larger balances reduced. Total exposure fell to £2.3bn (2022: £2.6bn) due to a strategic 
decision to reduce the number of active partner businesses. Annualised gross and net write off rates remained stable.
US cards: 30 and 90 day arrears rates increased to 2.9% (2022: 2.2%) and 1.5% (2022: 1.2%) respectively due to an anticipated	higher 
flow into and through delinquency, as rates returned to pre-pandemic levels. Write off rates remained broadly stable at 2.3%.
German consumer finance business: Gross exposure decreased 4% following business reprioritisation and discontinuation of Open 
Market loans originations. 30 and 90 day arrears rates remained stable and write-off rates increased due to the impact of accepting 
higher loan amount applications during 2022, which has since been discontinued.

Retail balances on forbearance reflected increases in UK Home Finance and US cards.

Wholesale balances subject to forbearance increased to £2.7bn (2022: £2.5bn) with increases in exposure in Corporate Bank and 
Investment Bank of £107m and £155m respectively. Impairment allowances increased to £210m (2022: £192m) with a range of new 
cases, partially offset by write offs. Barclays International accounted for 68% of wholesale forbearance with corporate cases 
representing 87% of these balances.
Notes

1 Following a review of forbearance programmes across Barclays UK in 2023 which resulted in the identification of a segment of written off balances inflating the forbearance stock, UK 

cards 2022 balances have been updated to reflect a decrease of £74m with a corresponding decrease in ECL of  £2m.

2 Following a review of forbearance programmes across Barclays UK in 2023 which resulted in 'Breathing Space', a 1–2-month cessation of interest and customer contact to allow 

businesses to talk to all creditors now being included within Business Banking for the first time, UK Business Banking 2022 balances have been updated to reflect an increase of £222m 
with a corresponding increase in ECL of £11m.

1 Following a review of forbearance programmes across Barclays UK in 2023 which resulted in the identification of a segment of written off balances inflating the forbearance stock, UK 

cards 2022 balances have been updated to reflect a decrease of £74m with a corresponding decrease in ECL of  £2m.

UK home loans: Forbearance balances rose to £366m (2022: £263m) due to an increase in less-than-interest-only payment 
arrangements and concessionary interest rates given to support customers facing rising mortgage interest rates and increased 
affordability stress.
UK cards: Balances on forbearance decreased to £215m (2022: £265m) due to increased outflow, against a stable forbearance inflow 
across 2023.
UK personal loans: Balances on forbearance programmes decreased to £46m (2022: £59m), as inflow steadily reduced across 2023, 
flattening in Q423, and outflow remained stable.
Barclays Partner Finance: Balances on forbearance remained stable and aligned to the total delinquent stock.
US cards: Forbearance balances increased to £290m (2022: £206m) reflecting an increase in new enrolments in 2023 in line with 
increased delinquency trends as more customers required assistance. 
German consumer finance business: Forbearance balances decreased to £32m (2022: £40m) due to lower customer demand and 
increased operational focus on early delinquency stages.

Derivative asset exposures would be £230bn (2022: £273bn) lower than reported under IFRS if netting were permitted for assets and 
liabilities with the same counterparty or for which the Group holds cash collateral. Similarly, derivative liabilities would be £(223)bn (2022: 
£(264)bn) lower reflecting counterparty netting and collateral placed. In addition, non-cash collateral of £10bn (2022: £11bn) was held in 
respect of derivative assets. The Group received collateral from clients in support of over the counter derivative transactions. These 
transactions are generally undertaken under International Swaps and Derivative Association (ISDA) agreements governed by either UK 
or New York law.

Summary of contents

Outlines key measures used to summarise the market risk 
profile of the bank such as value at risk (VaR).

The Group discloses details on management measures of 
market risk. Total management VaR includes all trading 
positions and is presented on a diversified basis by risk 
factor. 
This section also outlines the macroeconomic conditions 
modelled as part of the Group’s risk management 
framework.

Summary of performance in the 
period

Traded market risk review

Review of management measures

Average management VaR increased 17% 
to £42m (2022: £36m) and the range 
narrowed. The increase was driven by the 
impact of funded, fair value leverage loan 
exposure in Investment Banking since Q4 
2022, partially offset by lower market 
volatility and credit spread levels in 2023 as 
geopolitical tensions eased, relative to 
2022, inflation declined and the pace of 
interest rate rises moderated. 
Management VaR declined in 2023 from a 
high of £73m in November 2022, driven by 
a reduction in the size of the funded, fair 
value leverage loan exposure in 
Investment Banking. 

The following disclosures provide details 
on management measures of market risk. 
Refer to the market risk management 
section of the Barclays PLC Pillar 3 Report 
2023 (unaudited) for more detail on 
management measures and the 
differences when compared to regulatory 
measures.

The table below shows the total 
management VaR on a diversified basis by 
risk factor. Total management VaR 
includes all trading positions in CIB and 
Treasury and it is calculated with a one-day 
holding period, measured to a confidence 
level of 95%.

Limits are applied against each risk factor 
VaR as well as total management VaR, 
which are then cascaded further by risk 
managers to each business.

All disclosures in this section are unaudited 
unless otherwise stated.

Overview

This section contains key statistics 
describing the market risk profile of the 
Group. The market risk management 
section provides a description of 
management VaR.
Measures of market risk in the 
Group and accounting measures

Traded market risk measures such as VaR 
and balance sheet exposure measures 
have fundamental differences:

• balance sheet measures show accruals-
based balances or marked to market 
values as at the reporting date;

• VaR measures also take account of 

current marked to market values, but in 
addition hedging effects between 
positions are considered;

• market risk measures are expressed in 
terms of changes in value or volatilities 
as opposed to static values.

For these reasons, it is not possible to 
present direct reconciliations of traded 
market risk and accounting measures.

1 Diversification effects recognise that forecast losses from different assets or businesses are unlikely to occur concurrently, hence the expected aggregate loss is lower than the sum of 

the expected losses from each area. Historical correlations between losses are taken into account in making these assessments. The high and low VaR figures reported for each 
category did not necessarily occur on the same day as the high and low VaR reported as a whole. Consequently, a diversification effect balance for the high and low VaR figures would not 
be meaningful and is therefore omitted from the above table.

Overview

The Group Liquidity Risk is managed within 
Treasury and Capital Risk framework and 
is designed to maintain liquidity resources 
that are sufficient in amount and quality, 
and a funding profile that is appropriate to 
meet the Group’s Liquidity Risk Appetite 
and PRA Regulatory requirements. The 
liquidity risk framework is delivered via a 
combination of policy formation, review 
and governance, analysis, stress testing, 
limit setting and monitoring.

This section provides an analysis of the 
Group’s: (i) summary of performance, (ii) 
liquidity risk stress testing, iii) liquidity 
regulation, iv) liquidity pool, (v) funding 
structure and funding relationships, (vi) 
credit ratings, and (vii) contractual 
maturity of financial assets and liabilities.  

For further detail on liquidity risk 
governance and framework, refer to

3 Report 2023 (unaudited).
Key metrics

1
Liquidity Coverage  Ratio

161% 

2
Net Stable Funding Ratio

138%

1 LCR represents average  of the last 12 spot month end 

ratios.

2 NSFR represents average of the last four spot quarter 

end ratios.

The liquidity pool at £298bn (December 
2022: £318bn) reflects the Group’s 
prudent approach to liquidity 
management. The Average Liquidity 
Coverage Ratio (LCR) remained well above 
the 100% regulatory requirement at 161% 
(December 2022: 156%), equivalent to a 
surplus of 118bn (December 2022: 
£114bn).

The decrease in the liquidity pool over the 
year was driven by a decrease in wholesale 
funding, a slight reduction in net deposits 
where a decrease in  Barclays UK deposits 
is largely offset by a growth in Corporate 
Bank deposits, and changes in business 
funding consumption. A decrease in net 
stress outflows led by an increase in the 
proportion of corporate deposits treated 
as operational led to an increase in the 
LCR ratio. The Net Stable Funding Ratio 
(average of last four quarter ends) was 
138%, which represents a surplus of 
£167bn above the 100% regulatory 
requirement.

During the year, the Group issued £14.1bn 
of minimum requirement for own funds 
and eligible liabilities (MREL) instruments in 
a range of tenors and currencies.

Barclays Bank PLC continued to issue in 
the shorter-term and medium-term 
markets and Barclays Bank UK PLC 
continued to issue in the shorter-term 
markets and maintain active secured 
funding programmes. This funding 
capacity enables the respective entities to 
maintain their stable and diversified 
funding bases.

The Group’s reliance on short-term 
wholesale funding, as measured by the 
proportion of wholesale funding maturing 
in less than one year decreased year-on-
year to 33% (December 2022: 39%).

Barclays’ Liquidity Risk is managed within 
the Principal Risk: Treasury and Capital 
Risk Framework.  Under this framework, 
the Group has established a liquidity risk 
appetite together with the appropriate 
limits for the management of the liquidity 
risk. This is the level of liquidity risk the 
Group chooses to take in pursuit of its 
business objectives and in meeting its 
regulatory obligations. The Group sets its 
internal liquidity risk appetite based on 
internal liquidity risk stress tests and, 
external regulatory requirements namely 
the Liquidity Coverage Ratio (LCR) and 
Net Stable Funding Ratio (NSFR).
Internal Liquidity Stress Tests (ILST 
formally known as LRA) 

The Internal Liquidity Risk Stress Test  
measures the potential contractual and 
contingent stress outflows under a range 
of internally defined stress scenarios, 
which are then used to determine the size 
of the liquidity pool that is immediately 
available to meet anticipated outflows 
should a stress occur.

As part of the ILST, the Group runs four  
liquidity stress scenarios, aligned to the 
PRA’s prescribed stresses:

• 90 days market-wide stress event

• 30 days Barclays-specific stress event

• 30 days combined market-wide and 

Barclays-specific stress event

• 12 months market wide stress

As at 31 December 2023, the Group held eligible liquid assets well in excess of 100% of net stress outflows of the 30 days combined 
scenario, which has the highest net outflows of the three short-term liquidity stress scenarios and the 12 month market-wide scenario.
Liquidity regulation

Barclays Group monitors its position against both the LCR and NSFR according to the PRA regulatory requirements which include 
certain Basel III standards that were retained in the UK regulatory framework from 1 January 2022 as part of the UK's withdrawal from 
the EU.  The LCR requirement takes into account the relative stability of different sources of funding and potential incremental funding 
requirements in a stress. The LCR is designed to promote short-term resilience of a bank's liquidity risk profile by holding sufficient High 
Quality Liquid Assets (HQLA) to survive an acute stress scenario lasting for 30 days. The NSFR has been developed to promote a 
sustainable and stable structure of assets and liabilities.

Net Stable Funding Ratio (NSFR)

The external NSFR metric requires banks to maintain a stable funding profile taking into account both on and certain off balance sheet 
exposures over a medium to long term period. The ratio is defined as the Available Stable Funding (capital and certain liabilities which are 
defined as stable sources of funding) relative to the Required Stable Funding (a measure of assets on the balance sheet and certain off 
balance sheet exposures which may require longer term funding). The NSFR was 138% at December 2023 ( December 2022: 137%) 
(average of last four quarter ends) equivalent to a surplus of £167bn (2022: £155bn) above the regulatory requirement and 
demonstrates Barclays’ stable balance sheet funding profile.

As part of the liquidity risk appetite, Barclays establishes minimum LCR, NSFR and internal liquidity stress test limits. The Group plans to 
maintain its surplus to the internal and regulatory requirements at an efficient level. Risks to market funding conditions, the Group’s 
liquidity position and funding profile are assessed continuously, and actions are taken to manage the size of the liquidity pool and the 
funding profile as appropriate.
Liquidity pool 

The Group liquidity pool as at 31 December 2023 was £298bn (2022: £318bn). In 2023, the month-end liquidity pool ranged from 
£298bn to £342bn (2022: £309bn to £359bn), and the month-end average balance was £328bn (2022: £331bn). The liquidity pool is 
held unencumbered and is intended to offset stress outflows. It comprises the following cash and unencumbered assets.

The composition of the liquidity pool is subject to limits set by the Board and the independent liquidity risk, credit risk and market risk 
functions. In addition, the investment of the liquidity pool is monitored for concentration risk by issuer, currency and asset type. Given 
the returns generated by these highly liquid assets, the risk and reward profile is continuously managed.

As at 31 December 2023, 59% (2022: 60%) of the liquidity pool was located in Barclays Bank PLC, 22% (2022: 25%) in Barclays Bank UK 
PLC and 11% (2022: 9%) in Barclays Bank Ireland PLC. The residual portion of the liquidity pool is held outside of these entities, 
predominantly in the US subsidiaries, to meet entity-specific stress outflows and local regulatory requirements. To the extent the use 
of this portion of the liquidity pool is restricted due to local regulatory requirements, it is assumed to be unavailable to the rest of the 
Group in calculating the LCR.
Contingent liquidity

In addition to the Group liquidity pool, the Group has access to other unencumbered assets which provide a source of contingent 
liquidity. While these are not relied on in the Group’s ILST, a portion of these assets may be monetised in a stress to generate liquidity 
through their use as collateral for secured funding or through outright sale.

In a Barclays-specific, market-wide or combined liquidity stress, liquidity available via market sources could be severely disrupted. In 
circumstances where market liquidity is unavailable or available only at significantly elevated prices, the Group could generate liquidity 
via central bank facilities. To this end, as at 31 December 2023, the Group had £72.5bn (December 2022: £83.3bn) of assets positioned 
at various central banks.  

For more detail on the Group’s other unencumbered assets, see pages 197 to 201 of the Barclays PLC Pillar 3 Report 2023 (unaudited).
Funding structure and funding relationships

The basis for sound liquidity risk management is a funding structure that reduces the probability of a liquidity stress leading to an inability 
to meet funding obligations as they fall due. The Group’s overall funding strategy is to develop a diversified funding base (geographically, 
by type and by counterparty) and maintain access to a variety of alternative funding sources, to provide protection against unexpected 
fluctuations, while minimising the cost of funding.

Within this, the Group aims to align the sources and uses of funding. As such, retail and corporate loans and advances are largely funded 
by deposits in the relevant entities, with the surplus primarily funding the liquidity pool. The majority of reverse repurchase agreements 
are matched by repurchase agreements. Derivative liabilities and assets are largely matched. A substantial proportion of balance sheet 
derivative positions qualify for counterparty netting and the remaining portions are largely offset when netted against cash collateral 
received and paid. Wholesale debt and equity is used to fund residual assets.

These funding relationships are summarised below:

1 The loan: deposit ratio is calculated as loans  and advances at amortised cost  and debt securities  at amortised cost  divided by deposits at amortised cost.

As at 31 December 2023, £224bn (2022: £224bn) of total customer deposits were insured through the UK Financial Services 
Compensation Scheme (FSCS) and other similar schemes. In addition to these customer deposits £5.6bn (2022: £5.7bn) of other 
liabilities are insured by other governments.

Contractually current accounts are repayable on demand and savings accounts at short notice. In practice, their observed maturity is 
typically longer than their contractual maturity. Similarly, repayment profiles of certain types of assets e.g. mortgages, overdrafts and 
credit card lending, differ from their contractual profiles. The Group therefore assesses the behavioural maturity of both customer 
assets and liabilities to identify structural balance sheet funding gaps. In doing so, it applies quantitative modelling and qualitative 
assessments which take into account historical experience, current customer composition, and macroeconomic projections.

The Group’s broad base of customers, numerically and by depositor type, helps protect against unexpected fluctuations in balances 
and hence provides a stable funding base for the Group’s operations and liquidity needs.
Wholesale funding

Barclays Bank Group and Barclays Bank UK Group maintain access to a variety of sources of wholesale funds in major currencies, 
including those available from term investors across a variety of distribution channels and geographies, short-term funding markets and 
repo markets. 

Barclays Bank Group has direct access to US, European and Asian capital markets through its global investment banking operations and 
to long-term investors through its clients worldwide. Key sources of wholesale funding include money markets, certificates of deposit, 
commercial paper, medium term issuances (including structured notes) and securitisations.

Key sources of wholesale funding for Barclays Bank UK Group include money markets, certificates of deposit, commercial paper, 
covered bonds and other securitisations.

The Group expects to continue issuing public wholesale debt from Barclays PLC (the Parent company), in order to maintain compliance 
with indicative MREL requirements and maintain a stable and diverse funding base by type, currency and market. During the year, the 
Group issued £14.1bn of MREL instruments from Barclays PLC  in a range of different currencies and tenors.

Barclays Bank PLC continued to issue in the shorter-term markets and maintain active medium-term notes programmes. Barclays 
Bank UK PLC continued to issue in the shorter-term markets and maintain active secured funding programmes. This funding capacity 
enables the respective entities to maintain their stable and diversified funding bases. 

As at 31 December 2023, the Group’s total wholesale funding outstanding (excluding repurchase agreements) was £176.8bn (2022: 
£184.0bn), of which £19.0bn (2022: £19.2bn) was secured funding and £157.8bn (2022: £164.8bn) unsecured funding. Unsecured 
funding includes £69.2bn (2022: £59.7bn) of privately placed senior unsecured notes issued through a variety of distribution channels 
including intermediaries and private banks.

Wholesale funding of £58.6bn (2022: £72.5bn) matures in less than one year, representing 33% (December 2022: 39%) of total 
2
. Although not a requirement, the 
wholesale funding outstanding. This includes £18.7bn (2022: £15.0bn) related to term funding
liquidity pool exceeded the wholesale funding maturing in less than one year by £239bn (2022: £246bn).

Barclays Bank Group and Barclays Bank UK Group also support various central bank monetary initiatives, such as the Bank of England’s 
Term Funding Scheme with additional incentives for SMEs (TFSME), and the European Central Bank’s Targeted Long-Term Refinancing 
Operations (TLTRO). These are reported under ‘repurchase agreements and other similar secured borrowing’ on the balance sheet.

In 2023, Barclays repaid £0.9bn of its TLTRO drawings, reducing its outstanding balance to £0.5bn as at 31 December 2023. In addition, 
the total outstanding principal amount of TFSME remained at £21.9bn at year end.

To manage cross currency refinancing risk, the Group manages to currency mismatch limits, which limit risk at specific maturities.

Credit ratings

In addition to monitoring and managing key metrics related to the financial strength of the Group, Barclays also solicits independent 
credit ratings from Standard & Poor’s Global (S&P), Moody’s, Fitch, and Rating and Investment Information (R&I). These ratings assess 
the creditworthiness of the Group, its subsidiaries and its branches, and are based on reviews of a broad range of business and financial 
attributes including capital strength, profitability, funding, liquidity, asset quality, strategy and governance.

In March 2023, Moody’s upgraded Barclays PLC’s long-term rating by one notch to Baa1 and reverted the outlook to stable, reflecting 
Moody's expectation that the Group’s earnings will be higher, more diversified and more sustainable than before, while asset risk will 
remain broadly stable and capital and liquidity will remain strong. This followed the review for upgrade that had been placed on Barclays 
PLC in December 2022. Moody’s also revised Barclays Bank PLC’s outlook to stable from negative, reflecting Moody’s expectation that 
the Bank’s capital and liquidity will remain strong and whilst profitability will reduce from the exceptional levels of the last couple of years 
for capital markets and investment banking, it will remain sound due to improving income from other businesses and lower litigation and 
conduct costs. 

In May 2023, S&P upgraded all Barclays rated entities by one notch and reverted the outlooks to stable, reflecting S&P’s view that 
Barclays PLC's diversified international banking franchise has performed well against a difficult economic and financial backdrop and 
S&P's expectation that Barclays PLC will generate solid earnings over the next 12-24 months, even as interest rates approach their 
peak. This action upgraded Barclays PLC’s long-term rating to BBB+ and Barclays Bank PLC and Barclays Bank UK PLC’s long-term 
ratings to A+. 

In July 2023, Fitch affirmed all ratings for Barclays PLC, Barclays Bank PLC and Barclays Bank UK PLC. 

Barclays also solicits issuer ratings from R&I and the ratings of A for Barclays PLC and A+ for Barclays Bank PLC were affirmed in 
November 2023 with stable outlooks.

A credit rating downgrade could result in outflows to meet collateral requirements on existing contracts. Outflows related to credit 
rating downgrades are included in the ILST stress scenarios and a portion of the liquidity pool is held against this risk. Credit ratings 
downgrades could also result in reduced funding capacity and increased funding costs.

The contractual collateral requirement following one- and two-notch long-term and associated short-term downgrades across all 
credit rating agencies, would result in outflows of £1bn and £2bn respectively, and are provided for in determining an appropriate 
liquidity pool size given the Group’s liquidity risk appetite. These numbers do not assume any management or restructuring actions that 
could be taken to reduce posting requirements. These outflows do not include the potential liquidity impact from loss of unsecured 
funding, such as from money market funds, or loss of secured funding capacity. However, unsecured and secured funding stresses are 
included in the ILST stress scenarios and a portion of the liquidity pool is held against these risks.

Contractual maturity of financial assets and liabilities 

The table below provides detail on the contractual maturity of all financial instruments and other assets and liabilities. Derivatives (other 
than those designated in a hedging relationship) and trading portfolio assets and liabilities are included in the ‘not more than one month' 
column at their fair value. Liquidity risk on these items is not managed on the basis of contractual maturity since they are not held for 
settlement according to such maturity and will frequently be settled before contractual maturity at fair value. Derivatives designated in a 
hedging relationship are included according to their contractual maturity.

Expected maturity date may differ from the contractual dates, to account for:

• trading portfolio assets and liabilities and derivative financial instruments, which may not be held to maturity as part of the Group’s trading 

strategies

• corporate and retail deposits, reported under deposits at amortised cost, are repayable on demand or at short notice on a contractual basis. 
In practice, their behavioural maturity is typically longer than their contractual maturity, and therefore these deposits provide stable funding 
for the Group’s operations and liquidity needs because of the broad base of customers, both numerically and by depositor type

• loans to corporate and retail customers, which are included within loans and advances at amortised cost and financial assets at fair value, may 

be repaid earlier in line with terms and conditions of the contract

• debt securities in issue, subordinated liabilities, and financial liabilities designated at fair value, may include early redemption features.

Contractual maturity of financial liabilities on an undiscounted basis 

The table below presents the cash flows payable by the Group under financial liabilities by remaining contractual maturities at the 
balance sheet date. The amounts disclosed in the table are the contractual undiscounted cash flows of all financial liabilities (i.e. nominal 
values).

The balances in the below table do not agree directly to the balances in the consolidated balance sheet as the table incorporates all 
cash flows, on an undiscounted basis, related to both principal as well as those associated with all future coupon payments.

Derivative financial instruments held for trading and trading portfolio liabilities are included in the 'not more than one month' column at 
their fair value.

Risk performance - Treasury and Capital risk (continued)

Capital risk

All disclosures in this section are unaudited 
unless otherwise stated.
Overview 

The CET1 ratio, among other metrics, is a 
measure of the capital strength and 
resilience of Barclays. Maintenance of our 
capital resources is vital in order to meet 
the overall regulatory capital requirement, 
to withstand the impact of the risks that 
may arise under normal and stressed 
conditions, and maintain adequate capital 
to cover current and forecast business 
needs and associated risks to provide a 
viable and sustainable business offering.

This section provides an overview of the 
Group’s: (i) CET1 capital, leverage and own 
funds and eligible liabilities requirements; 
(ii) capital resources; (iii) risk weighted 
assets (RWAs); (iv) leverage ratios and 
exposures; and (v) own funds and eligible 
liabilities.

More details on monitoring and managing 
capital risk may be found in the risk 
management sections of the Barclays PLC 
Pillar 3 Report 2023 (unaudited).

Summary of performance in the 
period

The Group continues to be in excess of 
overall capital, leverage and MREL 
regulatory requirements.

     The CET1 ratio decreased to 13.8% 
(December 2022: 13.9%) as RWAs 
increased by £6.2bn to £342.7bn 
partially offset by an increase in CET1 
capital of £0.4bn to £47.3bn
▪ c.125bps increase from 2023 

attributable profit, including the c.25bps 
negative impact of structural cost 
actions, of which c.10bps are offset in 
other capital movements

▪ c.70bps decrease driven by returns to 
shareholders including the 8p per share 
total dividend and £1.25bn of share 
buybacks announced with FY22 and 
H123 results

▪ c.10bps decrease from other capital 
movements, including the impact of 
regulatory change on 1 January 2023 
relating to IFRS 9 transitional relief, the 
impact of the KMC acquisition, and 
movements in other regulatory capital 
deductions

▪ c.50bps decrease as a result of a 

£13.2bn increase in RWAs excluding the 
impact of foreign exchange 
movements, primarily driven by higher 
CIB and CC&P RWAs 

▪ An £8.2bn decrease in RWAs as a result 
of foreign exchange movements was 
offset by a £1.1bn decrease in CET1 
capital due to a decrease in the currency 
translation reserve 

The UK leverage ratio decreased to 5.2% 
(December 2022: 5.3%) primarily due to a 
£38.3bn increase in leverage exposure to 
£1,168.3bn, largely driven by an increase in 
trading portfolio assets within Global 
Markets

Minimum capital requirements

The Group’s Overall Capital Requirement 
for CET1 increased to 12.0%, following the 
latest PRA Individual Capital Requirement 
(ICR) notice and comprises a 4.5% Pillar 1 
minimum, a 2.5% Capital Conservation 
Buffer (CCB), a 1.5% Global Systemically 
Important Institution (G-SII) buffer, a 2.6% 
Pillar 2A requirement and a 0.9% 
Countercyclical Capital Buffer (CCyB).

The Group’s CCyB is based on the buffer 
rate applicable for each jurisdiction in which 
the Group has exposures. Following the 
Financial Policy Committee (FPC) 
announcement on 5 July 2022, the UK 
CCyB increased from 1% to 2% with effect 
from 5 July 2023. The buffer rates set by 
other national authorities for non-UK 
exposures are not currently material.

The Group’s updated Pillar 2A requirement 
increased by 25bps to 4.6% of which at 
least 56.25% needs to be met with CET1 
capital, equating to 2.6% of RWAs. The 
Pillar 2A requirement, based on a point in 
time assessment, has been set as a 
proportion of RWAs and is subject to at 
least annual review.

The Group’s CET1 target ratio of 13-14% 
takes into account headroom above 
requirements which includes a confidential 
institution-specific PRA buffer. The Group 
remains above its minimum capital 
regulatory requirements including the PRA 
buffer. 
Minimum leverage requirements

The Group is subject to a UK leverage ratio 
requirement of 4.1% as at 31 December 
2023. This comprises the 3.25% minimum 
requirement, a G-SII additional leverage 
ratio buffer (G-SII ALRB) of 0.53% and a 
countercyclical leverage ratio buffer 
(CCLB) of 0.3%. 

The Group is also required to disclose an 
average UK leverage ratio which is based 
on capital on the last day of each month in 
the quarter and an exposure measure for 
each day in the quarter. 
Minimum requirements for own 
funds and eligible liabilities

The Group is required to meet the higher 
of: (i) two times the sum of 8% Pillar 1 and 
4.6% Pillar 2A equating to 25.2% of RWAs; 
and (ii) 6.75% of leverage exposures. In 
addition, the higher of regulatory capital 
and leverage buffers apply. CET1 capital 
cannot be counted towards both MREL 
and the buffers, meaning that the buffers, 
including the above mentioned 
confidential institution-specific PRA buffer, 
will effectively be applied above MREL 
requirements.

1 CET1, T1 and T2 capital, and RWAs are calculated applying the transitional arrangements of the CRR as amended by CRR II. This includes IFRS 9 transitional arrangements and the 

grandfathering of CRR II non-compliant capital instruments. 

2 The fully loaded CET1 ratio, as is relevant for assessing against the conversion trigger in Barclays PLC AT1 securities, was 13.7%, with £47.0bn of CET1 capital and £342.7bn of RWAs 

calculated without applying the transitional arrangements of the CRR as amended by CRR II.

3 As at 31 December 2023, the Group's MREL requirement, excluding the PRA buffer, was to hold £103.0bn of own funds and eligible liabilities equating to 30.1% of RWAs. The Group 

remains above its MREL regulatory requirement including the PRA buffer.

CET1 capital increased £0.4bn to £47.3bn (December 2022: £46.9bn).

£5.3bn of capital generated from profit, including the impacts of structural cost actions, was partially offset by distributions of £3.5bn 

comprising:

• £1.25bn of share buybacks announced with FY22 and H123 results

• £1.2bn of ordinary share dividend paid and foreseen reflecting £0.4bn interim dividend paid and a £0.8bn accrual towards the FY23 

dividend

• £1.0bn of equity coupons paid and foreseen

Other significant movements in the period were: 

• £1.1bn decrease in the currency translation reserve driven by the strengthening of GBP against USD

• £0.4bn decrease in IFRS 9 transitional relief primarily due to the relief applied to the pre-2020 impairment charge reducing to 0% in 

2023 from 25% in 2022 and the relief applied to the post-2020 impairment charge reducing to 50% in 2023 from 75% in 2022

• £0.2bn increase in PVA, which includes an increase for price uncertainty within corporate loans, including the leveraged finance loan 

portfolio

• £0.4bn increase primarily driven by intangible impairment structural cost actions. The impact of this was capital neutral with the 

offsetting decrease within attributable profit.

1 Foreign exchange movements does not include impact of  foreign exchange for modelled market risk or operational risk.

Overall RWAs increased £6.2bn to £342.7bn (December 2022: £336.5bn).

Credit risk RWAs decreased £2.2bn:

• A £1.3bn decrease in book size within CIB and mortgages within Barclays UK, partially offset by higher credit card balances within 

CC&P

• A £1.5bn increase in book quality RWAs primarily driven by changes in risk parameters and HPI refresh within Barclays

     UK

• A £2.6bn decrease in model updates primarily driven by capital LGD model update for the mortgage portfolio to reflect the significant 

decrease in repossession volume during and post the COVID pandemic

• A £5.2bn increase in methodology and policy primarily driven by the recalibration of the post model adjustment (PMA) introduced to 

address the IRB roadmap changes and a change in treatment of non-credit obligation exposures

• A £5.7bn decrease as a result of foreign exchange movements primarily due to the strengthening of GBP against USD 

Counterparty Credit risk RWAs increased £2.8bn: 

• A £2.1bn increase in book size primarily due to increased trading activity within CIB

• A £2.7bn increase in methodology and policy due to a recalibration of the PMA introduced to address the IRB roadmap changes and a 

change in treatment of certain securities financing transactions collateral

• A £1.9bn decrease as a result of foreign exchange movements primarily due to the strengthening of GBP against USD 

Market risk RWAs increased £3.9bn:

• A £3.3bn increase in book size primarily due to increased trading activity within CIB

• A £1.2bn increase in model updates to capture incremental risk arising from Stressed Value at Risk (SVaR), measured on a 10-day 

basis

Operational risk RWAs increase £1.7bn:

• A £1.7bn increase in book size primarily driven by the inclusion of higher 2023 CC&P and Barclays UK income compared to 2020

2  Fully loaded UK leverage ratio was 5.2%, with £60.2bn of T1 capital and £1,168.0bn of leverage exposure. Fully loaded average UK leverage ratio was 4.7% with £60.0bn of T1 capital and

3 Although the leverage ratio is expressed in terms of T1 capital, the leverage ratio buffers and 75% of the minimum requirement must be covered solely with CET1 capital. The CET1 

capital held against the 0.53% G-SII ALRB was £6.1bn and against the 0.3% CCLB was £3.5bn

The UK leverage ratio decreased to 5.2% (December 2022: 5.3%) primarily due to a £38.3bn increase in leverage exposure to 
£1,168.3bn, largely driven by an increase in trading portfolio assets within Global Markets.

Risk performance - Treasury and Capital risk (continued)

Foreign exchange risk (audited)

The Group is exposed to two sources of foreign exchange risk.
a) Transactional foreign currency exposure

Transactional foreign currency exposures represent exposure on banking assets and liabilities, denominated in currencies other than 
the functional currency of the transacting entity.

The Group’s risk management policies are designed to prevent the holding of significant open positions in foreign currencies outside 
the trading portfolio managed by Barclays International which is monitored through VaR.

Banking book transactional foreign exchange risk outside of Barclays International is monitored on a daily basis by the market risk 
function and minimised by the businesses.
b) Translational foreign exchange exposure

The Group’s investments in overseas subsidiaries and branches create capital resources denominated in foreign currencies, principally 
USD and EUR. Changes in the GBP value of the net investments due to foreign currency movements are captured in the currency 
translation reserve, resulting in a movement in CET1 capital.

The Group’s strategy is to minimise the volatility of the capital ratios caused by foreign exchange movements, by matching the CET1 
capital movements to the revaluation of the Group’s foreign currency RWA exposures.

Economic hedges relate to exposures arising on foreign currency denominated preference share and AT1 instruments. These are 
accounted for at historical cost under IFRS and do not qualify as hedges for accounting purposes. The gain or loss arising from changes 
in the GBP value of these instruments is recognised on redemption in retained earnings.

During 2023, total structural currency exposure net of hedging instruments increased by £0.2bn to £15.4bn (2022: £15.2bn). Foreign 
currency net investments decreased by £0.8bn to £40.4bn (2022: £41.2bn) driven predominantly by a £0.9bn decrease in USD, offset 
by £0.1bn increase in EUR. The hedges (excluding economic hedges) associated with these investments increased by £0.1bn to 
£16.9bn (2022: £16.8bn).
Pension risk review

The UK Retirement Fund (UKRF) represents approximately 96% (2022: 96%) of the Group’s total retirement benefit obligations globally. 
As such this risk review section focuses exclusively on the UKRF. The UKRF is closed to new entrants and there is no new final salary 
benefit being accrued. Existing active members accrue a combination of a cash balance benefit and a defined contribution element. 
Pension risk arises as the market value of the pension fund assets may decline, investment returns may reduce or the estimated value 
of the pension liabilities may increase.

Refer to the Management of pension risk section in the Barclays PLC Pillar 3 Report 2023 (unaudited) for more information on how 
pension risk is managed.
Assets

The Trustee Board of the UKRF defines its overall long-term investment strategy with investments across a broad range of asset 
classes. This results in a diversified mix of return seeking assets as well as liability matching assets to better match future pension 
obligations. The two largest  risks within the asset portfolio are credit spread and growth assets. The split of scheme assets is shown 
within Note 32 to the financial statements. The fair value of the UKRF assets was £24.2bn as at 31 December 2023 (2022: £24.7bn).

Risk performance - Treasury and Capital risk (continued)

Liabilities

The UKRF retirement benefit obligations are a series of future cash flows with relatively long duration. On an IAS 19 basis these cash 
flows are sensitive to changes in the expected long-term price inflation rate (RPI) and the discount rate (GBP AA corporate bond yield):

• An increase in long-term expected inflation corresponds to an increase in liabilities;

• A decrease in the discount rate corresponds to an increase in liabilities.

Pension risk is generated through the Group’s defined benefit schemes and this risk is set to reduce over time as the main defined 
benefit scheme is closed to new entrants. The chart below outlines the shape of the UKRF’s liability cash flow profile as at 31 December 
2023 that takes account of the future inflation indexing of payments to beneficiaries. The majority of the cash flows (approximately 
96%) fall between 0 and 40 years, peaking between 11 and 20 years and reducing thereafter. The shape may vary depending on 
changes to inflation and longevity expectations and any members who elect to transfer out. Transfers out will bring forward the liability 
cash flows.

For more detail on the UKRF’s financial and demographic assumptions, see Note 32 to the financial statements.

The graph above shows the evolution of the UKRF’s net IAS 19 position over the last two years. During 2023 the decrease in the UKRF 
surplus was driven by assets underperforming the discount rate and lower corporate bond yields. 

Refer to Note 32 to the financial statements  for the sensitivity of the UKRF to changes in key assumptions.
Risk measurement

In line with Barclays’ risk management framework the assets and liabilities of the UKRF are modelled within a VaR framework to show the 
volatility of the pension position at a total portfolio level. This enables the risks, diversification and liability matching characteristics of the 
UKRF obligations and investments to be adequately captured. VaR is measured and monitored on a monthly basis. Risks are reviewed 
and reported regularly at  the Pensions Executive Board. The VaR model takes into account the valuation of the liabilities on an IAS 19 
basis (see Note 32 to the financial statements). The Trustee receives quarterly VaR measures on a funding basis.

The pension liability is also sensitive to post-retirement mortality assumptions which are reviewed regularly (See Note 32 to the 
financial statements). To mitigate part of this risk the UKRF has entered into longevity reinsurance contracts approximately three 
quarters of current pensioner liabilities.

In addition, the impact of pension risk to the Group is taken into account as part of the stress testing process. Stress testing is 
performed internally on at least an annual basis. The UKRF exposure is also included as part of regulatory stress tests. 

Barclays defined benefit pension schemes affects capital in two ways:

• An IAS 19 deficit is treated as a liability on the Group’s balance sheet. Movement in a deficit due to remeasurements, including 

actuarial losses, are recognised immediately through Other Comprehensive Income and as such reduces shareholders’ equity and 
CET1 capital. An IAS 19 surplus is treated as an asset on the balance sheet and increases shareholders’ equity; however, it is 
deducted for the purposes of determining CET1 capital.

• In the Group’s statutory balance sheet an IAS 19 surplus or deficit is partially offset by a deferred tax liability or asset respectively. 

These may or may not be recognised for calculating CET1 capital depending on the overall deferred tax position of the Group at the 
particular time.

Pension risk is taken into account in the Pillar 2A capital assessment undertaken by the PRA at least annually. The Pillar 2A requirement 
forms part of the overall capital requirement for the Group.

Net interest income sensitivity

The table below shows a sensitivity 
analysis on pre-tax net interest income for 
non-traded financial assets and liabilities, 
including the effect of any hedging. This 
analysis is not a forward guidance on NII 
and is intended as a quantification of risk 
exposure utilising the Net Interest Income 
(NII) metric as described on page 177 of

(unaudited), which includes 
documentation of the main model 
assumptions.

book

Key metrics

All disclosures in this section are unaudited 
unless otherwise stated.
Overview

The treasury and capital risk framework 
covers interest rate sensitive exposures 
held in the banking book, mostly relating to 
accrual accounted and FVOCI 
instruments. The potential volatility of net 
interest income is measured by an Annual 
Earnings at Risk (AEaR) metric which is 
monitored regularly and reported to senior 
management and the Barclays PLC Board 
Risk Committee as part of the limit 
monitoring framework.

For further detail on the interest rate risk in 
the banking book governance and 
framework refer to page 177 of the 
Barclays PLC Pillar 3 Report 2023 
(unaudited).

AEaR

Shock to forward interest rate curves.
Summary of performance in the 
period

NII sensitivity to interest rate shocks has 
decreased year on year due to changes in 
the customer banking book's composition. 
NII sensitivity asymmetry is due to the 
timing impact of customer rate changes 
following a rate shock and is also impacted 
by changes in  balance sheet composition.

The Group’s customer banking book hedging activity is risk reducing from an NII sensitivity perspective. The hedges  in place remove interest rate risk and smooth income over the medium 
term. The NII sensitivity for the Group at 31 December 2023 without hedging in place for +/-25bp rate shocks would be £184m/£(220)m respectively.

Movements in the FVOCI reserve impact CET1 capital. However, movements in the cash flow hedge reserve and pensions 
remeasurement reserve recognised in FVOCI do not affect CET1 capital.
Volatility of the FVOCI portfolio in the liquidity pool 

Changes in value of FVOCI exposures flow directly through capital via the FVOCI reserve. The volatility of the value of the FVOCI 
investments in the liquidity pool is captured and managed through a value measure rather than an earning measure, i.e. non-traded 
market risk VaR.

Although the underlying methodology to calculate the non-traded VaR is identical to the one used in traded management VaR, the two 
measures are not directly comparable. The non-traded VaR represents the volatility to capital driven by the FVOCI exposures. These 
exposures are in the banking book and do not meet the criteria for trading book treatment.

Risk performance - Operational risk

Summary of performance in the 
period

1
During 2023, total operational risk losses
reduced to £141m (2022: £161m) while 
the number of recorded events for 2023 
(2,914) remained broadly in line with the 
level for 2022 (2,964). The total 
operational risk losses for the year were 
mainly driven by events falling within the 
Execution, Delivery & Process 
Management and External Fraud 
categories, which tend to be high volume 
but low impact events.
Operational risk profile

Within operational risk, there are a large 
number of smaller value risk events. In 
2023, 83% (2022: 84%) of the Group’s 
reportable operational risk events by 
volume had a value of less than £50,000 
each. Cumulatively, events under this 
£50,000 threshold accounted for only 33% 
(2022: 32%) of the Group’s total net 
operational risk losses. A small proportion 
of operational risk events have a material 
impact on the financial results of the 
Group.

Operational risks are inherent in the 
Group’s business activities and it is not 
cost effective or possible to attempt to 
eliminate all operational risks. The 
Operational Risk Framework is therefore 
focused on identifying operational risks, 
assessing them and managing them within 
the Group’s approved risk appetite. 

The Operational Risk principal risk 
comprises the following risks: Change 
Delivery Management Risk; Data 
Management Risk; Financial Reporting 
Risk; Fraud Risk; Information Security Risk; 
Operational Recovery Planning Risk; 
Payments Process Risk; People Risk; 
Physical Security Risk; Premises Risk; Risk 
Reporting; Supplier Risk; Tax Risk; 
Technology Risk and Transaction 
Operations Risk. The operational risk 
profile is also informed by a number of 
connected risks: Cybersecurity, Data, and 
Resilience. These themes represent 
threats to the Group that extend across 
multiple risk types, and therefore require 
an integrated risk management approach.

For definitions of these risks refer to pages 
181 to 183 of the Barclays PLC Pillar 3 
Report 2023. To provide complete 
coverage of the potential adverse impacts 
on the Group arising from operational risk, 
the operational risk taxonomy extends 
beyond the risks listed above to cover 
operational risks associated with other 
principal risks too.

This section provides an analysis of the 
Group’s operational risk profile, including 
events above the Group’s reportable 
threshold, which have had a financial 
impact in 2023. The Group’s operational 
risk profile is informed by bottom-up risk 
assessments undertaken by each business 
unit and top-down qualitative review for 
each risk type. Fraud, Transaction 
Operations, Information Security and 
Technology continue to be highlighted as 
key operational risk exposures.

For information on compliance risk events, 
see the compliance risk section.

areas, having impact of > £10,000 and excludes events that are compliance or legal risk, aggregate and boundary 
events. A boundary event is an operational risk event that results in a credit risk impact. Due to the nature of risk 
events that keep evolving, prior year losses are updated.

• External Fraud remains the category with 
the highest frequency of events at 85% of 
total events in 2023 (2022: 86%). Impacts 
from events arising from External Fraud 
increased slightly in 2023 to £79m (2022: 
£76m) and accounted for 56% of total 
2023 losses (2022: 47%). In this category, 
high volume, low value events are driven 
by transactional fraud often related to 
debit and credit card usage. Note: total 
External Fraud losses in 2023 including 
those from events with impact <£10,000 
amounted to £183m (2022: £190m).

• Execution, Delivery and Process 

Management impacts decreased to £56m 
(2022: £83m) and accounted for 40% 
(2022: 52%) of total operational risk 
losses. The events in this category are 
typical of the banking industry as a whole 
where high volumes of transactions are 
processed on a daily basis, mapping mainly 
to Barclays Transaction Operations risk 
type. The overall frequency of events in 
this category remained stable at 14% of 
total events by volume (2022: 14%).

Investment continues to be made in 
improving the control environment across 
the Group. Specific areas of focus include 
new and enhanced fraud prevention 
systems and tools to combat the 
increasing level of fraud attempts being 
made whilst minimising disruption to 
genuine transactions. Fraud remains an 
industry wide threat and the Group 
continues to work closely with external 
partners on various prevention initiatives. 
Additionally, the Group continues to invest 
in its processing infrastructure to manage 
the risk of processing errors as well as 
ensuring scalability of operations.
Operational Resilience remains a key area 
of focus for the Group, having been 
reinforced in recent years due to potential 
operational disruption from the COVID-19 
pandemic.  The Group continues to 
strengthen its resilience approach across 
its most important business services to 
improve recoverability and assurance 
thereof by reviewing  scenarios based on 
current global climates.
Operational risk associated with 
cybersecurity remains a top focus for the 
Group. The sophistication of threat actors 
continues to grow as noted by multiple 
external risk events observed throughout 
the year. Ransomware attacks across the 
global Barclays supplier base were 
observed and we worked closely with the 
affected suppliers to manage potential 
impacts to the Group and its clients and 
customers. The Group’s cybersecurity 
events were managed within its risk 
tolerances, and cybersecurity incidents did 
not materially impact the Group's business 
strategy, results of operations, or financial 
condition. For further information, refer to the 
operational risk management section.

Model risk, Compliance risk, Reputation risk and Legal risk

All disclosures in this section are unaudited unless otherwise stated.
Compliance risk
Model risk

Barclays is committed to continuously 
improving model risk management and 
made a number of enhancements in 2023, 
including:

• Continued improvements to the 

transparency and oversight of model 
risk through further upgrades to model 
risk governance structure.

• Continued enhancements to model risk 

policy and standards to ensure 
comprehensiveness, consistency and 
cohesiveness of the model risk 
framework.

• Continued focus on improving the 
model risk control framework .

• Enhanced the Group Model Risk 

Appetite Statement, incorporating 
model quality and uncertainty around a 
model’s output.

• Continued strengthening of validation 
practices through expansion of model-
level validation procedures, use of an 
on-going validation training program 
and further embedment of a validation 
quality assurance process.

• Executed on hiring strategy by 

expanding the model risk team to 
support a wider range of model 
validation demand, newly emerging 
model risks, and an enhanced focus on 
regulatory models .

• Progressed model inception validation 

by bringing more models into 
compliance with the model risk 
management framework, including our 
first algorithmic trading models

Barclays is committed to continuing to 
drive the right culture throughout all levels 
of the organisation. The Group will 
continue to enhance effective 
management of Compliance risk and 
appropriately consider the relevant tools, 
governance and management information 
in decision-making processes. Focus on 
management of Compliance risk is 
ongoing and, alongside other relevant 
business and control management 
information, the Trading Entity Conduct 
Risk Dashboard is a key component of this.

The Group continues to review the role 
and impact of Compliance risk events and 
issues in remuneration decisions at both 
the individual and business level.

In 2023, the Group maintained focus on 
new and heightened inherent Compliance 
risks, including those relating to the cost of 
living crisis, the evolving threat landscape 
as related to financial crime, and 
challenges in ensuring customer and client 
data is handled appropriately. These risks 
continue to be monitored on an ongoing 
basis.

A key area of focus has been the 
implementation and embedment of the 
FCA’s new Consumer Duty, with rules for 
open products and services taking effect 
at the end July 2023.  

Businesses have continued to assess the 
potential customer, client and market 
impacts of strategic change. As part of the 
2023 medium-term planning process, 
material Compliance risks associated with 
strategic and financial plans were 
assessed.

Throughout 2023, Compliance risks were 
raised by each business area for 
consideration by relevant Board level 
committees. These committees reviewed 
the risks raised and whether 
management’s proposed actions were 
appropriate to mitigate the risks 
effectively.

During 2023, laws, rules and regulation risk 
(LRR risk) was created as a new risk under 
the Compliance Principal Risk. LRR is 
intended to mitigate the risk of failing to 
identify applicable LRRs, and ensure 
appropriate steps are in place to monitor 
and oversee LRRs. Work is underway to 
implement processes to support the 
management and oversight of LRR Risk.

The Group continued to incur costs in 
relation to litigation and conduct matters, 
refer to Note 25 Legal, competition and 
regulatory matters and Note 23 Provisions 
for further details. Costs include customer 
redress and remediation, as well as fines 
and settlements. Resolution of these 
matters remains a necessary and 
important part of delivering the Group’s 
strategy and an ongoing commitment to 
improve oversight of culture and conduct.

Trading Entity Conduct Risk Dashboards, 
setting out key indicators in relation to 
conduct and financial crime risk, are 
provided to the respective Board Risk 
Committees and senior management. 
These continue to be evolved and 
enhanced to allow effective oversight and 
decision-making. Work is ongoing to 
enhance the Compliance Risk Control 
Environment in a timely and effective 
manner to ensure the Group operates 
within Risk Appetite. The tolerance 
adherence is assessed by the business 
areas through key indicators  and reported 
to the relevant Trading Entity Board 
Committees as part of the Conduct Risk 
Dashboard governance process.

The Group remains focused on the 
continuous improvements being made to 
manage risk effectively with an emphasis 
on enhancing governance and 
management information to identify risk at 
earlier stages.

Risk performance - Model risk, Compliance risk, Reputation risk 
and Legal risk (continued)

Other improvements during 2023 included 
a review and update of the supporting legal 
risk policies, standards and mandatory 
training, reinforced by ongoing 
engagement with and education of the 
Group’s businesses and functions by Legal 
Function colleagues. Legal risk tolerances 
and legal risk appetite have also been 
reviewed.

Tolerances adherence is assessed 
through key indicators, which are also used 
to evaluate the legal risk profile and are 
reviewed, at least annually, through the 
relevant risk and control committees. 
Mandatory controls to manage legal risks 
are set out in the legal risk standards and 
are subject to ongoing monitoring. The 
implementation of changes to the 
compliance risk management framework 
referred to above (and described in more 
detail on page 361) also mitigate legal risk. 

Reputation risk

Barclays is committed to identifying 
reputation risks and issues as early as 
possible and managing them appropriately. 
At a Group level throughout 2023, 
reputation risks and issues were overseen 
by the Board which reviews the processes 
and policies which Barclays identifies and 
manages reputation risk. Within the 
Barclays Bank UK Group and the Barclays 
Bank Group reputation risks and issues 
were overseen by the respective risk and 
Board risk committees. The top live and 
emerging reputation risks and issues within 
the Barclays Bank UK Group and the 
Barclays Bank Group are included within an 
over-arching quarterly report at the 
respective Board level.

The Board reviewed risks escalated by the 
businesses and considered whether 
management’s proposed actions, for 
example attaching conditions to proposed 
client transactions or increased 
engagement with impacted stakeholders, 
were appropriate to mitigate the risks 
effectively. The Board also received regular 
updates with regard to key reputation risks 
and issues, including: Barclays' response to 
global conflicts; Barclays’ association with 
sensitive sectors; access to banking; 
lending practices and the resilience of key 
Barclays systems and processes.

The Group continued to incur costs in 
relation to litigation and conduct matters, 
refer to Note 25 Legal, competition and 
regulatory matters and Note 23 Provisions 
for further details. Costs include customer 
redress and remediation, as well as fines 
and settlements. Resolution of these 
matters remains an ongoing commitment 
to improve oversight of culture and 
conduct and management of reputation 
risks.

As part of Barclays 2023 Medium Term 
Planning process, material reputation risks 
associated with strategic and financial 
plans were also assessed.
Legal risk

The Group remains committed to 
continuous improvements in managing 
legal risk effectively. During 2023, the 
Group-wide legal risk management 
framework was updated to complement 
and accommodate the introduction of 
changes to the compliance risk 
management framework, which includes 
the responsibility of the Legal Function to 
proactively identify, communicate and 
provide legal advice on applicable laws, 
rules and regulations.

Supervision and regulation

Supervision of the Group

The Group’s operations, including its 
overseas branches, subsidiaries and 
associates, are subject to a large number 
of rules and regulations applicable to the 
conduct of banking and financial services 
business in each of the jurisdictions in 
which the Group operates. These apply to 
business operations, impact financial 
returns and include capital, leverage and 
liquidity requirements, authorisation, 
registration and reporting requirements, 
restrictions on certain activities, and 
conduct of business regulations, amongst 
other applicable regulatory requirements.

Regulatory developments in one or more 
jurisdictions may impact the Group 
globally. We focus particularly on UK, US 
and EU regulation in this Report due to the 
location of the Group’s principal areas of 
business. Regulations elsewhere may also 
have a significant impact on the Group due 
to the location of its branches, subsidiaries 
and, in some cases, clients. For more 
information on the risks related to the 
supervision and regulation of the Group, 
including regulatory change, see the 
material existing and emerging risk entitled 
‘Regulatory Change agenda and impact on 
Business Model’ in the Material existing and 
emerging risks section.
Supervision in the UK

In the UK, day-to-day regulation and 
supervision of the Group is divided 
between the Prudential Regulation 
Authority (PRA) (a division of the Bank of 
England (BoE)) and the Financial Conduct 
Authority (FCA). In addition, the Financial 
Policy Committee (FPC) of the BoE has 
influence on the prudential requirements 
that may be imposed on the banking 
system through its powers of direction and 
recommendation. Certain members of the 
Group are also subject to regulatory 
initiatives undertaken by the UK Payment 
Systems Regulator (PSR), as a participant 
in payment systems regulated by the PSR.

Barclays Bank PLC and Barclays Bank UK 
PLC are both authorised with permission 
to accept deposits, amongst other things, 
and are subject to prudential supervision 
by the PRA and to conduct regulation and 
supervision by the FCA. The Barclays Bank 
Group is subject to prudential supervision 
on a solo-consolidated basis and the 
Barclays Bank UK Group is subject to 
prudential supervision on a group sub-
consolidated basis and on an individual 
basis. The Group as a whole is also subject 
to prudential supervision by the PRA on a 
group consolidated basis. Barclays PLC 
has been approved by the PRA as a 
financial holding company. 

Barclays Capital Securities Limited (BCSL) 
is authorised and subject to prudential 
supervision by the PRA as a PRA-
designated investment firm and subject to 
conduct regulation and supervision by the 
FCA. Barclays Execution Services Limited 
is an appointed representative of Barclays 
Bank PLC, Barclays Bank UK PLC and 
Clydesdale Financial Services Limited. 

The PRA’s supervision of the Group is 
conducted through a variety of regulatory 
tools, including the collection of 
information by way of prudential returns or 
cross-firm reviews, reports obtained from 
skilled persons, information gathering, 
regular supervisory visits and regular 
meetings with the Group’s management 
and directors to discuss issues such as 
strategy, governance, financial resilience, 
operational resilience, risk management, 
and recovery and resolution.

Further, the BoE, as the UK resolution 
authority, informs prudential requirements 
and sets requirements for the Group 
relating to resolution preparedness. 

The FCA’s supervision of the UK firms in 
the Group is carried out through a 
combination of proactive engagement 
meetings, regular supervisory visits, 
information gathering and regular 
meetings with management and directors 
to discuss issues such as customer 
strategy, fair treatment of customers, and 
financial crime controls, as well as cross-
sectoral reviews which analyse the 
different areas of the market and the risks 
that may lie ahead.

The FCA and the PRA also apply the Senior 
Managers and Certification Regime (the 
SMCR) which imposes a regulatory 
approval, individual accountability and 
fitness and propriety framework in respect 
of senior individuals within relevant firms.

FCA supervision has focused on conduct 
risk and customer/client outcomes 
through implementation of the Consumer 
Duty (including product design and fair 
value), fraud and anti-money laundering 
controls, market operations, access to 
cash, fair treatment of vulnerable 
customers and payment account access 
and closures.

PRA supervision has focused on financial 
and operational resilience, controls, credit 
risk management, systems and controls, 
climate risk and resolvability, where 
resolvability is reviewed in conjunction with 
the Resolution Directorate (a division of 
the BoE).

Both the PRA and the FCA apply standards 
that generally either anticipate or go 
beyond requirements established by global 
or EU standards, whether in relation to 
capital, leverage and liquidity, resolvability 
and resolution or matters of conduct. The 
UK is in the process of reviewing and 
revising the EU legislation that was 
onshored into English law following the 
UK's departure from the EU. This process 
is ongoing, but based on current 
indications, potential areas of divergence 
in approach between the UK and the EU in 
existing areas of regulation appear 
moderate and are not expected to result in 
materially different standards of 
regulation. Divergence might become 
more marked in new areas of regulation, 
such as ESG and Digital. The Financial 
Services and Markets Act 2023 (FSMA 
2023) established a framework for the 
revocation of retained EU law relating to 
financial services, with HM Treasury 
intending to repeal retained EU legislative 
provisions subject to the transfer of its 
provisions to the UK regulators’ rules 
where appropriate. The Government is not 
expected to revoke retained EU law 
relating to financial services unless the 
FCA and/or PRA have drafted and 
consulted on rules in the relevant areas, 
where it is appropriate that the provisions 
are replaced.  However, HM Treasury may 
specify parts of retained EU law where the 
regulators are exempt from such 
requirements, for example where they are 
restating retained EU law revoked through 
FSMA 2023 in their rulebooks without 
material changes or where they are 
replacing revoked retained EU law with 
material changes but the only material 
effect is to reduce a regulatory burden. 
Where changes also have other material 
effects, which may include impacts on the 
regulators’ objectives, for example, the 
Government has indicated that it is 
appropriate to require the regulators to 
consult. The medium term outlook for the 
costs and impact of operating under the 
post-Brexit UK regime remains unclear as 
the regulatory landscape continues to 
develop. There is potential for an increase 
in regulatory implementation costs in the 
near term to adapt systems and controls. 
Supervision in the EU

The Group’s operations in Europe are 
authorised and regulated by a combination 
of its home regulators and host regulators 
in the European countries where the 
Group operates.

Supervision and regulation (continued)

Barclays Bank Ireland PLC is licensed as a 
credit institution by the Central Bank of 
Ireland (CBI) and is designated as a 
significant institution falling under direct 
supervision on a solo basis by the 
European Central Bank (ECB) for 
prudential purposes. Barclays Bank Ireland 
PLC’s EU branches are supervised by the 
ECB and are also subject to direct 
supervision for local conduct purposes by 
national supervisory authorities in the EU 
jurisdictions where they are established. 
Barclays Bank Ireland PLC is subject to the 
requirements set by the Single Resolution 
Board (SRB) as the resolution authority of 
Barclays Bank Ireland PLC.  Barclays Bank 
Ireland PLC is also subject to supervision 
by the CBI as home state or competent 
authority under various EU financial 
services directives and regulations.

The Group provides the majority of its 
cross-border banking and investment 
services to EEA clients via Barclays Bank 
Ireland PLC. Additionally, Barclays Bank 
PLC and BCSL are authorised in certain 
EEA Member States to enable them to 
continue to conduct a limited range of 
activities without a presence, including 
accessing EEA trading venues and 
interdealer trading. Barclays Bank PLC also 
has a branch in Paris (to facilitate access to 
Target 2), which is regulated by the ACPR.
Supervision in the US

Barclays PLC, Barclays Bank PLC and its 
New York branch, and Barclays Bank PLC’s 
US subsidiaries are subject to a 
comprehensive regulatory framework 
involving numerous statutes, rules and 
regulations in the US. For example, the 
Group’s US activities and operations are 
subject to supervision and regulation by 
the Board of Governors of the Federal 
Reserve System (FRB), as well as additional 
supervision, requirements and restrictions 
imposed by other federal and state 
regulators and self-regulatory 
organisations (SROs). In some cases, US 
requirements may impose restrictions on 
the Group’s global activities, in addition to 
its activities in the US.

Barclays PLC, Barclays Bank PLC, Barclays 
US Holdings Limited (BUSHL), Barclays US 
LLC (BUSL), and Barclays Group US Inc. 
(BGUS) are regulated as bank holding 
companies (BHCs) by the FRB. 

BUSL is the Group’s ultimate US holding 
company that holds substantially all of the 
Group’s US subsidiaries (including Barclays 
Capital Inc. (BCI) and Barclays Bank 
Delaware). BUSL is subject to 
requirements in respect of capital 
adequacy, capital planning and stress 
testing, risk management and governance, 

liquidity, leverage limits, large exposure 
limits, restrictions on activities and financial 
regulatory reporting. Barclays Bank PLC’s 
New York branch is also subject to 
enhanced prudential standards relating to, 
among other things, liquidity and risk 
management.

Barclays PLC, Barclays Bank PLC, BUSHL 
and BUSL have financial holding company 
(FHC) status under the Bank Holding 
Company Act of 1956. FHC status allows 
these entities to engage in a variety of 
financial and related activities, directly or 
through subsidiaries, including 
underwriting, dealing and market making in 
securities. Failure to maintain FHC status 
could result in increasingly stringent 
penalties and, ultimately, in the closure or 
cessation of certain operations in the US.

In addition to oversight by the FRB, 
Barclays Bank PLC’s New York branch and 
many of the Group’s subsidiaries are 
regulated by additional US authorities 
based on the location or activities of those 
entities. The New York branch of Barclays 
Bank PLC is subject to supervision and 
regulation by the New York State 
Department of Financial Services 
(NYSDFS). Barclays Bank Delaware, a 
Delaware chartered bank, is subject to 
supervision and regulation by the Delaware 
Office of the State Bank Commissioner, 
the Federal Deposit Insurance Corporation 
(FDIC), the FRB and the Consumer 
Financial Protection Bureau (CFPB). The 
deposits of Barclays Bank Delaware are 
insured by the FDIC, up to applicable limits. 
Barclays PLC, Barclays Bank PLC, BUSHL, 
BUSL, and BGUS are required to act as a 
source of strength for Barclays Bank 
Delaware. This could, among other things, 
require these entities to provide capital 
support to Barclays Bank Delaware if it fails 
to meet applicable regulatory capital 
requirements.

The Group’s US securities broker/dealer 
and investment banking operations are 
conducted primarily through BCI, and are 
also subject to ongoing supervision and 
regulation by the Securities and Exchange 
Commission (SEC), the Financial Industry 
Regulatory Authority (FINRA) and other 
government agencies and SROs under US 
federal and state securities laws. BCI is also 
registered as a Futures Commission 
Merchant with the Commodity Futures 
Trading Commission (CFTC), through 
which the Group conducts its US futures 
and options on futures business, including 
client clearing operations, which are 
subject to ongoing supervision and 
regulation by the CFTC, the National 
Futures Association and other SROs.

Under the US framework for regulating 
swaps and security-based swaps 
established under Title VII of the Dodd-
Frank Act, the CFTC has regulatory 
authority over swaps, the SEC has 
regulatory authority over security-based 
swaps, and the  CFTC and SEC  jointly 
regulate mixed swaps (as such terms are 
defined in the relevant legislation). 
Accordingly, the Group’s activities related 
to US swaps and security-based swaps are 
principally conducted by Barclays Bank 
PLC and are subject to ongoing 
supervision and regulation by the CFTC 
and the SEC, respectively. Barclays Bank 
PLC is provisionally registered as a swap 
dealer with the CFTC and conditionally 
registered as a security-based swap dealer 
with the SEC. Barclays Bank PLC is also 
subject to the FRB swaps rules with 
respect to margin and capital 
requirements. In addition, Barclays Bank 
Ireland PLC is provisionally registered as a 
swap dealer with the CFTC and is subject 
to the FRB swaps rules with respect to 
margin and capital.
Supervision in Asia Pacific

The Group’s operations in Asia Pacific are 
supervised and regulated by a broad range 
of national banking and financial services 
regulators.
Prudential regulation

Certain Basel III standards were 
implemented in EU law through the Capital 
Requirements Regulation (CRR) and the 
Capital Requirements Directive IV (CRD 
IV), as amended by CRR II and CRD V. 
These standards were retained in the UK 
regulatory framework via a series of 
onshoring instruments when the UK 
withdrew from the European Union. 
Beyond the minimum standards required 
by CRR, the PRA has expected the Group, 
in common with other major UK banks and 
building societies, to meet a 7% Common 
Equity Tier 1 (CET1) ratio at the level of the 
consolidated group since 1 January 2016. 
The 7% CET1 ratio is made up of a Pillar 1 
minimum capital requirement of 4.5% 
CET1 and a capital conservation buffer 
which must be met entirely with CET1 
capital. 

Global systemically important banks (G-
SIBs), such as the Barclays Group, are 
subject to a number of additional 
prudential requirements, including the 
requirement to hold additional loss-
absorbing capacity and additional capital 
buffers above the level required by Basel III 
standards.

Annual Report 2023 365

Supervision and regulation (continued)

The level of the G-SIB buffer is set by the 
Financial Stability Board (FSB) according to 
a bank’s systemic importance and can 
range from 1% to 3.5% of risk-weighted 
assets (RWAs). The G-SIB buffer must be 
met with CET1 capital. In November 2023, 
the FSB published an update to its list of G-
SIBs, maintaining the 1.5% G-SIB buffer 
that applies to the Group.

The Group is subject to a ‘combined buffer 
requirement’ consisting of (i) a capital 
conservation buffer of 2.5% of RWAs, and 
(ii) a countercyclical capital buffer (CCyB). 
The CCyB is based on rates determined by 
the regulatory authorities in each 
jurisdiction in which the Group maintains 
exposures. In the UK, the CCyB rate is set 
by the FPC and is currently 2%.

The PRA requires UK firms to hold 
additional capital to cover risks which the 
PRA assesses are not fully captured by the 
Pillar 1 capital requirement. The PRA sets 
this additional capital requirement (Pillar 
2A) at least annually, derived from each 
firm’s individual capital guidance. Under 
current PRA rules, the Pillar 2A 
requirement must be met with at least 
56.25% CET1 capital and no more than 
25% tier 2 capital. In addition, the capital 
that firms use to meet their minimum 
requirements (Pillar 1 and Pillar 2A) cannot 
be counted towards meeting the 
combined buffer requirement.

The PRA may also impose a confidential 
'PRA buffer' to cover risks over a forward 
looking planning horizon, including with 
regard to firm-specific stresses or 
management and governance 
weaknesses. The PRA buffer must be met 
separately to the combined buffer 
requirement, and must be met fully with 
CET1 capital.

As part of its approach to ring fencing, the 
FPC established a framework to apply a 
firm-specific systemic risk buffer (SRB). 
The purpose of the SRB was to increase 
the capacity of ring-fenced bodies, such as 
Barclays Bank UK PLC, to absorb stress. 
With the implementation of CRD V, the 
Other Systemically Important Institutions 
Buffer (O-SII buffer) replaced the SRB. The 
O-SII buffer can be set between 0% and 
3% and has to be met solely with CET1 
capital. The O-SII buffer rate applicable to 
Barclays Bank UK PLC is currently set by 
the PRA at 1%. 

Previously, total assets were used as the 
metric to determine O-SII buffer rates but 
the FPC announced in 2022 that this would 
change to the UK leverage exposure 
measure and that it would recalibrate the 
thresholds used to determine O-SII buffer 
rates to prevent an overall tightening or 
loosening of the framework relative to its 
pre-Covid level. The PRA’s 2023 review of 
the O-SII buffer was based on end-2022 
leverage exposure measures and 
maintained the O-SII buffer rate applicable 
to Barclays Bank UK PLC at 1% (applicable 
from January 2025). For future reviews, 
the average of firms’ quarter-end leverage 
exposure measure over the year will be 
used to determine O-SII buffer rates, 
rather than the year-end value. In addition, 
Barclays Bank Ireland PLC is identified as a 
O-SII by the CBI, which has imposed an O-
SII buffer on Barclays Bank Ireland PLC of 
1%.

On 30 November 2022, the PRA published 
a consultation paper concerning the 
implementation of the remaining Basel III 
standards, which include a revised 
standardised approach for credit risk, the 
elimination of modelled approaches for 
certain credit risk exposure categories, a 
new standardised approach for operational 
risk, a new market risk approach and the 
implementation of an output floor 
requiring reported RWAs calculated under 
standardised and modelled approaches to 
be a minimum of 72.5% of fully 
standardised calculations. In December 
2023 the PRA published its first collection 
of near-final policy proposals for 
implementing these measures, including 
those for market risk, operational risk and 
the Credit Valuation Adjustment (CVA) and 
counterparty credit risk. A further 
collection of policies, including those for 
credit risk and credit risk mitigation, are 
expected to be published by the PRA in Q2 
2024. The implementation date for these 
standards has been extended to 1 July 
2025. In June 2023, the EU reached a 
provisional agreement on the 
implementation of the remaining parts of 
the Basel III reforms. In December 2023, 
the preparatory bodies of the Council and 
Parliament endorsed this banking package. 
It consists of a legislative act to amend the 
Capital Requirements Directive (Directive 
2013/36/EU), and a legislative act to 
amend the Capital Requirements 
Regulation (Regulation No (EU)2013/575) 
(referred to as CRR III and CRD VI, 
respectively). The relevant measures are 
scheduled to apply from January 2025 and 
mid-2025 respectively.

In the US,  the Barclays Bank Group 
(including BUSL) is subject to prudential 
requirements for large domestic US 
banking organisations, foreign banking 
organisations and their intermediate 
holding companies (IHCs) set by the FRB 
and other US regulatory agencies. BUSL is 
a “Category III” IHC. BUSL (and Barclays 
Bank Delaware) is subject to reduced 
(calibrated at 85%) standardised liquidity 
requirements, including the liquidity 
coverage ratio and NSFR.

BUSL is also subject to the FRB’s rules 
regarding single counterparty credit limits 
(SCCL). The SCCL apply to the largest US 
BHCs and foreign banks’ (including the 
Group’s) US operations. The SCCL creates 
two separate limits for foreign banks, the 
first on combined US operations (CUSO) 
and the second on the US IHC (BUSL). The 
SCCL for BUSL, as a US BHC, requires that 
exposure to an unaffiliated counterparty of 
BUSL not exceed 25% of BUSL’s tier 1 
capital. With respect to the CUSO, the 
SCCL rule allows certification to the FRB 
that a foreign bank complies with 
comparable home country regulation.

Barclays Bank PLC has complied with the 
CUSO requirement since 1 January 2022, 
with the first certification applicable for its 
Q1 2022 results.  To date, Barclays Bank 
PLC has not relied on home country 
certification.

In July 2023, the FRB and other US 
regulatory agencies proposed changes to 
the regulatory capital rules applicable to US 
banks, BHCs and IHCs with total 
consolidated assets of $100 billion or more 
(Large Banking Organizations). These 
changes are intended to be broadly 
consistent with revisions to Basel III 
finalised by the Basel Committee on 
Banking Supervision in 2017. The US 
proposal would end the use of internal 
models for credit risk, credit valuation 
adjustments, and operational risk, create 
an expanded risk-based credit capital 
approach in addition to retaining a 
modified version of the current 
standardised approach, and make changes 
to the modelling requirements for market 
risk. A Large Banking Organization would 
be required to calculate its risk-based 
capital ratios under both the expanded 
risk-based approach and the current 
standardised approach and would use the 
lower of the two. All capital buffer 
requirements would apply regardless of 
whether the expanded risk-based 
approach or the existing standardised 
approach produces the lower ratio. The 
proposal was subject to a public comment 
period which ended on 16 January 2024, 
and would not be effective until 1 July

Supervision and regulation (continued)

2025. Certain aspects of the proposal 
would be subject to a three-year phase-in 
period. We are analysing the potential 
effects of the proposed changes, including 
the timing of implementation.
Stress testing

The Group and certain of its members are 
subject to supervisory stress testing 
exercises in a number of jurisdictions, 
designed to assess the resilience of banks 
to adverse economic or financial 
developments and ensure that they have 
robust, forward-looking capital planning 
processes that account for the risks 
associated with their business profile. 
Assessment by regulators is on both a 
quantitative and qualitative basis, the latter 
focusing on such elements as data 
provision and stress testing capability, 
including model risk management and 
internal management processes and 
controls.
Recovery and Resolution
Stabilisation and resolution framework

The current UK framework for recovery 
and resolution was established by the 
Banking Act 2009, as amended. The EU 
framework was established by the 2014 
Bank Recovery and Resolution Directive 
(BRRD), as amended by BRRD II.

The BoE, as the UK resolution authority, 
has the power to resolve a UK financial 
institution that is failing or likely to fail by 
exercising certain stabilisation tools, 
including (i) bail-in: the cancellation, 
transfer or dilution of a relevant entity’s 
equity and write-down or conversion of 
the claims of a relevant entity's unsecured 
creditors (including holders of capital 
instruments) and conversion of those 
claims into equity as necessary to restore 
solvency; (ii) the transfer of all or part of a 
relevant entity's business to a private 
sector purchaser; and (iii) the transfer of all 
or part of a relevant entity's business to a 
“bridge bank” controlled by the BoE. When 
exercising any of its stabilisation powers, 
the BoE must generally provide that 
shareholders bear first losses, followed by 
creditors in accordance with the priority of 
their claims in insolvency. 

In order to enable the exercise of its 
stabilisation powers, the BoE may impose 
a temporary stay on the rights of creditors 
to terminate, accelerate or close out 
contracts, or override events of default or 
termination rights that might otherwise be 
invoked as a result of a resolution action 
and modify contractual arrangements in 
certain circumstances (including a 
variation of the terms of any securities). 
HM Treasury may also amend the law for 
the purpose of enabling it to use its powers 

under this regime effectively, potentially 
with retrospective effect.

In addition and distinct from bail-in, the 
BoE has the power to permanently write-
down, or convert into equity, tier 1 capital 
instruments, tier 2 capital instruments and 
internal eligible liabilities at the point of 
non-viability of an institution pursuant to 
broader resolution powers under the 
Banking Act.

The BoE’s preferred approach for the 
resolution of the Group is a bail-in strategy 
with a single point of entry at Barclays PLC. 
Under such a strategy, Barclays PLC’s 
subsidiaries would remain operational while 
Barclays PLC’s capital instruments and 
eligible liabilities would be written down or 
converted to equity in order to recapitalise 
the Group and allow for the continued 
provision of services and operations 
throughout the resolution. The order in 
which the bail-in tool is applied reflects the 
hierarchy of capital instruments under 
applicable UK legislation and rules, and 
otherwise respecting the hierarchy of 
claims in an ordinary insolvency. 
Accordingly, the more subordinated the 
claim, the more likely losses will be suffered 
by owners of the claim.

The PRA has made rules that require 
authorised firms to draw up recovery plans 
and resolution packs. Recovery plans are 
designed to outline credible actions that 
authorised firms could implement in the 
event of severe stress in order to restore 
their business to a stable and sustainable 
condition. The submission of resolution 
packs was suspended by the PRA in 2018 
until further notice and replaced by annual 
resolution reporting. It continues to be 
suspended pending PRA assessment of 
areas of potential duplication between 
different reporting expectations. The 
Barclays Group, however, is required to 
provide the PRA with a recovery plan 
biennially, although the Group maintains 
and refreshes  this on an annual basis.

Removal of potential impediments to an 
orderly resolution of a banking group or 
one or more of its subsidiaries is 
considered as part of the BoE’s resolution 
planning for each firm, and the BoE can 
require firms to make significant changes 
in order to enhance their resolvability. 
Under the BOE’s Resolvability Assessment 
Framework (RAF) firms are required to 
have in place capabilities covering three 
resolvability outcomes: (i) adequate 
financial resources; (ii) being able to 
continue to do business through 
resolution and restructuring; and (iii) being 
able to communicate and co-ordinate 
within the firm and with authorities. 

Barclays Group’s second self-assessment 
report on resolvability under the RAF was 
submitted to the PRA/BoE in 2023 and 
public disclosures by both Barclays Group 
and the PRA/BoE on the most recent 
report are due in June 2024. Updated 
reports and disclosures are required every 
two years. The BoE’s assessment on the 
2021 report, published in June 2022, 
concluded that there were no 
shortcomings, deficiencies or substantive 
impediments identified in the Group’s 
resolution capabilities that could impede 
its ability to execute the preferred 
resolution strategy. In future, should any 
such issues be identified, the PRA/BoE 
could exercise its various powers to direct 
the Group to address the relevant issues.

While regulators in many jurisdictions have 
indicated a preference for single point of 
entry resolution for the Group, additional 
resolution or bankruptcy provisions may 
apply to certain non-UK Group entities or 
branches.

In the US, BUSL is subject to the Orderly 
Liquidation Authority established by Title II 
of the Dodd-Frank Act (DFA), a regime for 
the orderly liquidation of systemically 
important financial institutions by the 
FDIC, as an alternative to proceedings 
under the US Bankruptcy Code. In addition, 
the licensing authorities of Barclays Bank 
PLC New York branch and of Barclays Bank 
Delaware have the authority to take 
possession of the business and property 
of the applicable branch or entity they 
license and/or to revoke or suspend such 
licence.

In the US, Title I of the DFA, as amended, 
and the implementing regulations issued 
by the FRB and the FDIC require each bank 
holding company with assets of $250bn or 
more, including those within the Group, to 
prepare and submit a plan for the orderly 
resolution of subsidiaries and operations in 
the event of future material financial 
distress or failure. The Group submitted a 
“targeted plan” in December 2021. The 
agencies did not identify any shortcomings 
or deficiencies with the Group’s 2021 US 
Resolution Plan. In August 2023, the FRB 
and FDIC proposed new guidance for 
triennial full filers (such as the Group) that 
would affect the content required to be 
included in the US Resolution Plan. The 
proposal generally represents an 
expansion of the current 165(d) resolution 
planning guidance the Group is subject to 
as a “specified foreign banking 
organization.” The Group’s next 
submission of the US Resolution Plan in 
respect of its US operations will be a “full 
plan” due 31 March 2025, unless the FRB 
and FDIC provide a further extension.

Barclays PLC

Annual Report 2023 367

Supervision and regulation (continued)

Barclays Bank Ireland PLC is required by 
the ECB to submit a standalone BRRD 
compliant recovery plan on an annual 
basis. As a Significant Institution under 
direct ECB supervision, Barclays Bank 
Ireland PLC falls within the remit of the 
Single Resolution Board (SRB), as the 
resolution authority for the European 
Banking Union. Under the provisions of the 
BRRD and EU Single Resolution 
Mechanism Regulation (SRMR), the SRB is 
required to determine the optimal 
resolution strategy for Barclays Bank 
Ireland PLC and, also, to prepare a 
resolution plan for the bank. The SRB 
undertakes this work within the context of 
the BoE’s preferred resolution strategy of 
single point of entry with bail in at Barclays 
PLC. In order to carry out its mandate, the 
SRB collects detailed structural and other 
information from Barclays Bank Ireland 
PLC on a regular basis, as well as engaging 
with the bank to identify and address 
impediments to resolution. This work is 
done in coordination with the BoE, as the 
Group resolution authority. Barclays Bank 
Ireland PLC is required to meet the SRB’s 
requirements for resolution as set out in 
the SRB’s ‘Expectations for Banks’ 
document by 31 July 2024 (this deadline 
was extended by the SRB in October 2023 
from the original deadline of 31 December 
2023).

In April 2023, the EU Commission 
proposed certain reforms to strengthen 
the EU’s bank crisis management and 
deposit insurance (CMDI) framework, 
including extending depositor protection 
to public entities and client money 
deposited in certain types of client funds. 
The EU legislative process remains 
ongoing. Provisional agreement was 
reached in December 2023 between the 
Council and the European Parliament on 
the treatment of internal MREL in bank 
resolution groups, referred to as the ‘Daisy 
Chains’ proposal (a confined part of the 
CMDI proposals). This treatment is 
expected to apply from the second half of 
2024.
TLAC and MREL

The Group is under the supervision of the 
BoE, as the UK resolution authority, and is 
subject to a Minimum Requirement for 
Own Funds and Eligible Liabilities (MREL), 
which includes a component reflecting the 
FSB’s standards on total loss absorbency 
capacity (TLAC).

Since 1 January 2022, G-SIBs with 
resolution entities incorporated in the UK 
have been required to meet an MREL 
equivalent to the higher of: (i) two times 
the sum of their Pillar 1 and Pillar 2A 

requirements; or (ii) the higher of two 
times their leverage ratio requirement or 
6.75% of leverage exposures. Internal 
MREL for operating subsidiaries is subject 
to a scalar in the 75-90% range of the 
external requirement that would apply to 
the subsidiary if it were a resolution entity. 
The starting point for the scalar is 90% for 
ring-fenced bank sub-groups.

Barclays Bank Ireland PLC is subject to the 
SRB’s MREL policy, as issued in May 2023, 
in respect of the internal MREL that it will 
be required to issue to the Group. The 
SRB’s current calibration of internal MREL 
for non-resolution entities is expressed as 
two ratios that have to be met in parallel: 
(a) two times the sum of: (i) the firm’s Pillar 
1 requirement; and (ii) its Pillar 2 
requirement; and (b) two times the 
leverage ratio requirement. The SRB’s 
policy does not apply any scalar in respect 
of the internal MREL requirement. Under 
the SRB MREL policy, a bank specific 
adjustment can be applied by the SRB to 
MREL requirements. From 1 January 2024, 
a revised deduction regime will apply for 
the indirect subscription of instruments 
eligible for internal MREL to avoid the 
double-counting of MREL elements at the 
level of intermediate entities within a 
resolution group. 

In the US, the FRB’s TLAC rule includes 
provisions that require BUSL to have: (i) a 
specified outstanding amount of eligible 
long-term debt; (ii) a specified outstanding 
amount of TLAC (consisting of common 
and preferred equity regulatory capital plus 
eligible long-term debt); and (iii) a specified 
common equity buffer. In addition, the 
FRB’s TLAC rule prohibits BUSL, for so 
long as the Group’s overall resolution plan 
treats BUSL as a non-resolution entity, 
from issuing TLAC to entities other than 
those within the Group.
Bank Levy and FSCS

The BRRD established a requirement for 
EU member states to set up a pre-funded 
resolution financing arrangement with 
funding equal to 1% of covered deposits 
by 31 December 2024 to cover the costs 
of bank resolutions. The UK implemented 
this requirement by way of a tax on the 
balance sheets of banks known as the 
‘Bank Levy’, which remains in place.

In addition, the UK has a statutory 
compensation fund called the Financial 
Services Compensation Scheme (FSCS), 
which is funded by way of annual levies on 
most authorised financial services firms.
Structural reform

In the UK, the Financial Services (Banking 
Reform) Act 2013 put in place a framework 

for ring-fencing certain operations of large 
banks. Ring-fencing requires, among other 
things, the separation of the retail and 
smaller deposit-taking business activities 
of UK banks into a legally distinct, 
operationally separate and economically 
independent entity (a ‘ring-fenced bank’), 
which is not permitted to undertake a 
range of activities. In 2023, HM Treasury 
issued a public call for evidence on aligning 
the ring-fencing and resolution regimes, 
amongst other things, and a consultation 
on reforms to the ring-fencing regime, 
including amendments to the thresholds 
above which the regime applies, permitting 
ring-fenced banks to establish branches 
and subsidiaries outside the UK or the EEA 
and the introduction of a transitional 
period for compliance with the ring-
fencing regime following mergers or 
acquisitions. HM Treasury plans to 
introduce legislation to implement these 
reforms in early 2024. The PRA consulted 
on complementary reforms to HM 
Treasury's proposals in 2023 and, 
separately, conducted a review of its ring-
fencing rules in compliance with its 
statutory duty under FSMA to do so every 
five years. The PRA announced in early 
2024 that it intends to consult on targeted 
reforms to its ring-fencing rules as a result 
of its review, although the overall 
conclusion was that most of those rules 
are performing satisfactorily.

US regulation places further substantive 
limits on the activities that may be 
conducted by banks and holding 
companies, including foreign banking 
organisations such as the Group. The 
‘Volcker Rule’, which was part of the DFA 
and which came into effect in the US in 
2015, prohibits banking entities from 
undertaking certain proprietary trading 
activities and limits such entities’ ability to 
sponsor or invest in certain private equity 
funds and hedge funds (in each case 
broadly defined). As required by the rule, 
the Group has developed and 
implemented an extensive compliance and 
monitoring programme addressing 
proprietary trading and covered fund 
activities (both inside and outside of the 
US).
Market infrastructure regulation

In recent years, regulators as well as 
global-standard setting bodies such as the 
International Organization of Securities 
Commissions (IOSCO) have focused on 
improving transparency and reducing risk 
in markets, particularly risks related to 
over-the-counter (OTC) derivative 
transactions. This focus has resulted in a 
variety of new regulations across the G20 
countries and beyond that require or

encourage on-venue trading, clearing, 
posting of margin and disclosure of pre-
trade and post-trade information.

In particular, the Markets in Financial 
Instruments Directive and Markets in 
Financial Instruments Regulation 
(collectively referred to as MiFID II) have 
affected many of the markets in which the 
Group operates, the instruments in which 
it trades and the way it transacts with 
market counterparties and other 
customers. MiFID II is currently undergoing 
a review process in the EU as part of the 
EU’s ongoing focus on the development of 
a stronger Capital Markets Union. In the 
UK, FSMA 2023 introduced reforms to 
remove certain requirements which were 
previously applicable to trading in 
wholesale markets and to promote 
investment in line with the Wholesale 
Markets Review. Other changes proposed 
by the review are being progressed by way 
of amendments to regulatory rules and 
guidance. 
Regulation of benchmarks

The EU and UK Benchmarks Regulation 
apply to the administration, contribution 
and use of benchmarks within the EU and 
the UK, respectively. Financial institutions 
within the EU or the UK, as applicable, are 
prohibited from using benchmarks unless 
their administrators are authorised, 
registered or otherwise recognised in the 
EU or the UK, respectively. This prohibition 
does not currently apply in respect of third 
country benchmark administrators, as the 
prohibition on usage of such benchmarks 
will take effect from the end of 2025 (EU) 
and 2030 (UK). The FCA has also been 
working to phase out use of LIBOR, with all 
LIBOR panels now having ended. Synthetic 
versions of GBP and USD LIBOR have been 
made available only for a limited period of 
time for holders of legacy contracts. Global 
regulators in conjunction with the industry 
have developed and are continuing to 
develop alternative benchmarks and risk-
free rate fallback arrangements, including 
updates to existing, as well as new, 
applicable legislation.
Regulation of the derivatives market  
The European Market Infrastructure 
Regulation (EMIR) introduced 
requirements designed to improve 
transparency and reduce the risks 
associated with the derivatives market. 
EMIR has operational and financial impacts 
on the Group, including by imposing 
collateral requirements and a requirement 
to centrally clear certain OTC derivatives 
contracts on a broad range of market 
participants. Access to the clearing 
services of certain Central Counterparties 

(CCPs) used by Group entities is currently 
permitted under temporary equivalence 
and recognition regimes and decisions in 
the UK and EU. If not extended or made 
permanent, the EU’s equivalence decision 
for UK Central Counterparties (CCPs), and 
exemption for certain intragroup 
transactions from the EMIR derivatives 
clearing and margin obligations, both due 
to expire at the end of June 2025, could 
also have operational and financial impacts 
on the Group, as could the removal of 
temporary recognition of non-UK CCPs by 
the UK. The EU has introduced two 
legislative proposals to amend EMIR which 
introduce, inter alia, changes to the 
intragroup transactions exemption making 
it easier to rely on the exemption, as well as 
aiming to reduce the concentration of 
exposures to systemically important third-
country central counterparties (in 
particular, UK Central Counterparties). The 
legislative process is ongoing. 

US regulators have imposed similar rules 
as in the EU with respect to the mandatory 
on-venue trading and clearing of certain 
derivatives, and post-trade transparency, 
as well as in relation to the margining of 
OTC derivatives. In December 2017, the 
CFTC and the European Commission 
recognised the trading venues of each 
other’s jurisdiction to allow market 
participants to comply with mandatory on-
venue trading requirements while trading 
on certain venues recognised by the other 
jurisdiction. In December 2022, the CFTC 
extended temporary relief that would 
permit trading venues and market 
participants located in the UK to continue 
to rely on this mutual recognition 
framework following the withdrawal of the 
UK from the EU.

Certain participants in US swap markets 
are required to register with the CFTC as 
‘swap dealers’ or ‘major swap participants’ 
and/or, with the SEC as ‘security-based 
swap dealers’ or ‘major security-based 
swap participants’. Such registrants are 
subject to CFTC and/or SEC regulation 
and oversight. Barclays Bank PLC is 
provisionally registered with the CFTC as a 
swap dealer and conditionally registered 
with the SEC as a security-based swap 
dealer. In addition, Barclays Bank Ireland 
PLC is provisionally registered as a Swap 
Dealer with the CFTC.

Accordingly, Barclays Bank PLC and 
Barclays Bank Ireland PLC are both subject 
to CFTC rules on business conduct, 
record-keeping and reporting, and 
Barclays Bank PLC is subject to SEC rules 
on business conduct, record-keeping and 
reporting. However, since Barclays Bank 
PLC and Barclays Bank Ireland PLC are 

non-US swap dealers, they are only subject 
to certain of the CFTC’s requirements in 
respect of swap transactions with US 
persons and certain persons guaranteed 
by or affiliated with US persons. In addition, 
since Barclays Bank PLC is a non-US 
security-based swap dealer, it is only 
subject to certain of the SEC’s 
requirements in respect of security-based 
swap transactions with US persons or 
which are arranged, negotiated, or 
executed by US personnel. Additionally, 
Barclays Bank PLC and Barclays Bank 
Ireland PLC have elected to comply with 
certain CFTC/SEC requirements, as 
applicable, through ‘substituted 
compliance’ with EU/UK requirements 
pursuant to relevant determinations and 
related relief issued by the SEC and the 
CFTC, as applicable. 

Barclays Bank PLC and Barclays Bank 
Ireland PLC are subject to FRB rules on 
capital and margin. 

In 2022, the SEC proposed new rules that 
would require any person with a security-
based swap position (aggregated across all 
affiliated persons) that exceeds any of the 
thresholds specified by the SEC to 
promptly report certain information by the 
next business day, including the identity of 
the reporting person and the security-
based swap position, as well as the 
ownership of securities positions related 
to the security-based swap position. Such 
reports would be available publicly. If 
adopted as proposed, this rule could 
increase the burden and cost to Barclays 
Bank PLC of utilising security-based 
swaps.
Other regulatory developments in the 
US

In 2023, the SEC finalised amendments to 
shorten the standard settlement cycle for 
most broker-dealer transactions in 
securities from two business days after the 
trade (T+2) to one business day after the 
trade (T+1), which requires significant 
changes to BCI’s settlement procedures 
and practices, and  introduced new rules 
requiring market-wide improvements in 
the rate of same-day affirmations and on 
central matching service providers.

On 13 October 2023, the SEC adopted 
new rules to establish broad reporting 
requirements of the terms of securities 
loans to FINRA for public dissemination, 
and requiring FINRA to make publicly 
available certain information it receives 
regarding those lending transactions.

On 13 October 2023, the SEC adopted 
new rules requiring a wide range of firms to 
file monthly reports with the SEC for large 
short positions in equity securities on a

new Form SHO, and amendments to the 
National Market System plan governing 
the Consolidated Audit Trail, which adds an 
additional reporting requirement for CAT-
reporting firms relying on the bona fide 
market maker exception to Reg SHO’s 
locate requirement.

On 30 October 2023, the SEC issued 
exemptive relief, which exempts broker-
dealers from their review obligations 
concerning the issuer of an over-the-
counter security prior to publication or 
submission of a quotation in that security 
with respect to a fixed-income security to 
be sold in compliance with the safe harbor 
in Rule 144A under the Securities Act of 
1933.

On 13 December 2023, the SEC adopted 
rule amendments under the Exchange Act 
that, among other things, will mandate 
central clearing of certain US Treasury 
securities transactions and amend the 
broker-dealer customer protection rule as 
it applies to margin posted for transactions 
in US Treasury securities. These rule 
amendments could impose additional 
costs on the Group’s Treasury securities 
trading activity.

The SEC has also put forth a number of 
other recent proposals that, if adopted, 
could have a significant impact on the 
Group’s business and operations, including  
a series of market structure proposals 
which would have a significant impact on 
securities trading activity by BCI and other 
Group entities, as the SEC proposals would 
(a) impose a new SEC best execution 
obligation on securities broker-dealers, 
including BCI, (b) require that certain 
individual investor orders be exposed to 
auctions before they could be executed 
internally by certain trading centres, and (c) 
amend certain rules under Regulation NMS 
(National Market System) to adopt variable 
minimum pricing increments, reduce 
access fee caps for protected quotations, 
require that the amount of exchange fees 
and rebates be determinable at the time of 
execution, and update and expand to 
certain broker-dealers the disclosures 
required for order executions in NMS 
stocks, among other changes.
Other regulation
Consumer protection, culture, and 
diversity and inclusion

In July 2023, the FCA’s new Consumer 
Duty came into force for new and existing 
products or services that are open to sale 
or renewal. It will apply to closed products 
and services from 31 July 2024. The duty 
sets higher expectations for the standard 
of care that firms provide to retail 
customers and impacts all aspects of 

Barclays' retail businesses, including every 
retail customer journey, product and 
service as well as our relationships with 
partners, suppliers and third parties. This 
has resulted in significant implementation 
costs and there will also be higher ongoing 
costs for the industry as a result of 
extensive monitoring and evidential 
requirements. 

Our regulators have enhanced their focus 
on the promotion of cultural values as a 
key area for banks. The UK regulators have 
also begun focusing on diversity and 
inclusion in financial services firms, with the 
PRA and FCA having published a 
consultation on the introduction of a new 
regulatory framework on diversity and 
inclusion in September 2023. The UK 
regulators expect to publish final rules on 
this issue in 2024.

FSMA 2023 contains provisions mandating 
that the Payment Systems Regulator 
(PSR) require the reimbursement of 
authorised push payment scams by 
payment service providers, including 
Barclays. This reimbursement requirement 
will be split 50:50 between the sending and 
receiving firms. Changes to the rules of the 
Faster Payments Scheme and a new 
Specific Direction issued by the PSR to 
require reimbursement will take effect in 
October 2024. 
Data protection 

Most jurisdictions where the Group 
operates have adopted or are considering 
comprehensive laws concerning data 
protection and privacy. Regulations 
regarding data protection are increasing in 
number, as well as levels of enforcement, 
as manifested in increased amounts of 
fines and the severity of other penalties. 
We expect that personal privacy and data 
protection will continue to receive 
attention and focus from regulators, as 
well as public scrutiny and attention. 

The EU’s General Data Protection 
Regulation (GDPR) and the UK’s General 
Data Protection Regulation (UK GDPR) 
provide a framework of rights and duties 
designed to safeguard personal data and 
apply to the activities conducted from an 
establishment in the EU or the UK, 
respectively. The extraterritorial effect of 
the GDPR and the UK GDPR means 
entities established outside the EU or the 
UK may fall within the GDPR or the UK 
GDPR’s ambit when offering goods or 
services to EU/UK based customers or 
clients or conducting behavioural 
monitoring of individuals in the EU/UK. The 
Data Protection and Digital Information 
(No.2) Bill was introduced to the UK 
Parliament in March 2023, which if enacted 

will bring some divergence between the EU 
GDPR and UK GDPR. The UK government 
has indicated that it expects the Bill to 
become law in mid-2024, although there is 
still some uncertainty on timing and 
content.

The data regime in China is likely to 
continue to evolve, governing the 
collection, processing and cross-border 
transfers of China-based individuals' 
personal data and related restricted data 
(e.g., macro/derived characteristics data 
which, if tampered with, divulged or 
destroyed, may endanger China's 
economic operation, social stability, 
national security - among other things - 
having regard to the volume and 
granularity of the data). In India, the Digital 
Personal Data Protection Act, 2023, may 
be implemented in phases during 2024 and 
beyond. Except under certain exemptions, 
its scope would include the processing of 
personal data in India and would extend to 
the profiling of, and offering goods and 
services to, India-based individuals outside 
of India. As the global data protection 
regulatory landscape develops, non-
compliance with any such requirements 
and rules could lead to regulatory fines and 
other penalties.

In the US, Barclays Bank Delaware is 
subject to the US Federal Gramm-Leach-
Bliley Act (GLBA) and the California Privacy 
Rights Act of 2020, which amended the 
California Consumer Privacy Act of 2018 
and came into effect on 1 January 2023 
(CPRA). The GLBA limits the use and 
disclosure of non-public personal 
information to non-affiliated third parties, 
and requires financial institutions to 
provide written notice of their privacy 
policies and practices and implement 
certain information security policies and 
practices. Any violations of the GLBA could 
subject Barclays Bank Delaware to 
additional reporting requirements or 
regulatory investigation or audits by the 
financial regulators. More broadly, the 
Group's US operations are subject to the 
CPRA which applies to personal 
information that is not collected, 
processed, sold or disclosed subject to the 
GLBA. The CPRA requires applicable 
members of the Group to both provide 
California residents with additional 
disclosures regarding the collection, use 
and sharing of personal information and 
grant California residents access, deletion, 
correction and other rights, including the 
right to opt-out of certain sales or 
transfers of personal information and the 
right to limit the processing of sensitive 
personal information to certain purposes. 
Any violations of the CPRA may be subject

to enforcement by the California Privacy 
Protection Agency and the California 
Attorney General and the imposition of 
monetary penalties, as well as potential 
lawsuits arising from the private right of 
action provided to California residents in 
the case of certain data breaches. Bills 
proposed in the United States Congress 
and in the legislatures of various US states, 
if enacted, may have further impact on the 
data privacy practices of Barclays’ US 
operations. In addition, all 50 states have 
laws including obligations to provide 
notification of security breaches of 
computer databases that contain personal 
information to affected individuals, state 
officers and others.
Cybersecurity and operational resilience

Regulators globally continue to focus on 
cybersecurity risk management, 
organisational operational resilience and 
overall soundness across all financial 
services firms, with customer and market 
expectations of uninterrupted access to 
financial services remaining at an all-time 
high. 

The regulatory focus has been further 
heightened by the increasing number of 
high-profile ransomware and other supply 
chain attacks seen across the industry in 
recent years and the growing reliance of 
financial services on Cloud and other third 
party service providers. This is evidenced 
by the continuing introduction of new laws 
and regulatory frameworks directed at 
enhancing resilience of both firms and 
their critical third party providers. A new UK 
framework introduced in March 2021 
requires firms to be able to remain within 
impact tolerances set for their important 
business services, in severe but plausible 
disruption scenarios such as a cyber 
attack, by no later than 31 March 2025. 
FSMA 2023 introduced a new regime for 
designated critical third party providers, 
and in 2023 the FCA and PRA issued a 
consultation on proposed rules and 
guidance for supervising the resilience of 
critical third party providers. 

The EU’s Digital Operational Resilience Act 
(DORA) entered into force in January 2023 
and will apply in early 2025 (after a two-
year implementation period), introducing 
comprehensive and sector specific 
regulation on Information Communication 
Technologies (ICT) incident reporting, 
testing and third party risk management, 
and providing for direct oversight of critical 
third party providers servicing the EU 
financial services sector. The existing and 
anticipated requirements for increased 
controls will serve to improve industry 
standardisation and resilience capabilities, 

enhancing our ability to deliver services 
during periods of potential disruption. 
However, such measures are likely to 
result in increased technology and 
compliance costs for the Group.

In 2023, the SEC finalised disclosure rules 
regarding cybersecurity risk management, 
governance and incident reporting by US-
listed companies, including foreign private 
issuers such as Barclays PLC and Barclays 
Bank PLC. The new rules require foreign 
private issuers to annually disclose the 
policies and procedures relied upon to 
identify and manage cybersecurity risks, 
including risk management strategy and 
whether any risks from cybersecurity 
threats, including as a result of any 
previous cybersecurity incidents, have 
materially affected or are reasonably likely 
to materially affect the issuer, its business 
strategy, results of operations or financial 
condition. In addition, Barclays PLC and 
Barclays Bank PLC must annually describe 
Barclays’ board of directors’ oversight of 
risks from cybersecurity threats, the board 
committee responsible for the oversight 
of such risks, and the processes by which 
the board or such committee is informed 
thereof; and details of management’s 
expertise and role in assessing and 
managing material risks from 
cybersecurity threats. If Barclays PLC or 
Barclays Bank PLC are required or 
determine to disclose material 
cybersecurity incidents under home 
country or stock exchange rules, they are 
required to also furnish this information 
with the SEC on the SEC's website, in 
accordance with their obligations as 
foreign private issuers.

Similarly, NYDFS amended its 
cybersecurity regulation applying to the 
New York Branch of Barclays Bank PLC. 
The NYDFS's amended cybersecurity 
regulation contains significant updates, 
including enhanced notification 
requirements, cybersecurity governance 
obligations, and requirements applicable to 
cybersecurity policies and procedures 
(e.g., encryption and multi-factor 
authentication, business continuity and 
incident response plans, and vulnerability 
management).
Regulatory initiatives on ESG disclosure 

The EU Regulation on Sustainable Finance 
Disclosures Regulation (SFDR) and related 
Delegated Regulations require financial 
market participants (FMPs) to disclose how 
they integrate environmental, social and 
governance factors in their investment 
decisions for certain financial products and 
to publish principal adverse impact 
statements. The SFDR applies to entities 
established in the EU and in-scope 

products marketed in the EU, regardless of 
the location of the entity. The SFDR is 
currently under review by the Commission. 
In addition, the EU Taxonomy Regulation 
provides for a general framework for the 
development of an EU-wide classification 
system for environmentally sustainable 
economic activities. It sets mandatory  
entity-level disclosure requirements for 
companies which fall under the scope of 
the EU Accounting Directive, in relation to 
eligibility and alignment of their business 
activities with the EU Taxonomy 
Regulation. The EU Taxonomy Regulation 
also imposes product level disclosure 
obligations for FMPs on the extent to 
which their financial products are 
Taxonomy aligned or not. The taxonomy, 
and with it the Taxonomy Regulation, is 
under review to include further sectors 
and, for example, social elements. 

The EU Corporate Sustainability Reporting 
Directive will introduce sustainability 
related reporting obligations for various 
entities, including EU banks and certain 
non-EU companies and banks (by virtue of 
having EU listings or significant business in 
the EU), with reporting to commence on a 
phased basis from the financial year 2024.  
Related technical sustainability reporting 
standards have been developed by the 
European Financial Reporting Advisory 
Group.  

The second EU Capital Requirements 
Regulation established, for certain large 
financial institutions, a Pillar 3 disclosure 
framework for information on 
environmental, social and governance 
risks, including physical risks and transition 
risks. Amendments proposed by the CRR 
III and CRD VI banking package will extend 
the scope of these disclosures and the 
emphasis on ESG. The ECB has made, and 
continues to regard, the supervision of the 
approach of institutions to ESG risk a 
priority.

In December 2023, the European Council 
and Parliament institutions reached 
political agreement on the Directive on 
Corporate Sustainability Due Diligence, 
which will require EU firms, and certain 
non-EU firms, including financial 
institutions, to carry out due diligence with 
regard to their own operations and 
companies in their upstream value chain, in 
order to identify and prevent, bring to an 
end or mitigate the adverse impact of their 
activities on human rights and the 
environment. Firms will also be required to 
establish a climate change transition plan. 
These obligations are expected to come 
into force on a phased basis from the 
second half of 2027, at the earliest.

Supervision and regulation (continued)

In the UK, the FCA published final rules on 
the UK Sustainability Disclosure 
Requirements regime in November 2023 
which set out new requirements to 
prepare sustainability-related product and 
entity level disclosures for certain firms, as 
well as a new sustainable investment 
labelling regime and anti-greenwashing 
rule applicable to all authorised firms. 
Currently, the new anti-greenwashing rule 
(and associated guidance) is due to apply 
from 31 May 2024, whilst the rest of the 
changes will take effect on a phased basis, 
beginning in the second half of 2024.  The	
UK Government has expressed its 
intention to consider how best to 
incorporate the Taskforce on Nature-
related Financial Disclosures framework 
for nature-related risk management and 
disclosures into UK legislation and to 
consult on introducing Transition Plan 
Taskforce Disclosure Framework (TPT 
Framework) related requirements for the 
UK’s largest companies. The Government 
is also progressing plans to endorse UK 
Sustainability Disclosure Standards based 
on the International Sustainability 
Standards Board (ISSB) sustainability 
reporting standards (IFRS S1 on general 
requirements for sustainability disclosures 
and IFRS S2 on climate disclosures) for use 
in the UK by July 2024.  The FCA plans to 
consult in 2024 on incorporating 
provisions relating to the ISSB standards 
and TPT Framework into its Handbook. 
Additionally, TCFD-aligned reporting 
requirements apply to UK publicly quoted 
companies, large private companies and 
LLPs (in addition to existing TCFD-related 
reporting requirements under the Listing 
Rules).
In the UK, the UK Government has 
confirmed its intention to develop a UK 
Green Taxonomy, and the Green 
Technical Advisory Group continues to 
publish advice and reports on the 
development of a Green Taxonomy. 
Reporting against the Taxonomy will form 
part of the UK’s new Sustainability 
Disclosure Requirements (SDR). Certain 
companies will be required to disclose 
which portion of their activities are 
Taxonomy-aligned. The structure of the 
Taxonomy is expected to draw on the EU 
approach and has six environmental 
objectives (climate change mitigation, 
climate change adaptation, sustainable 
use and protection of water and marine 
resources, transition to a circular 
economy, pollution prevention and control 
and protection and restoration of 
biodiversity).

In March 2022, the SEC proposed climate 
related-disclosure requirements for US-
listed companies (which would include 
Barclays PLC and Barclays Bank PLC) that 
would, among other things, require 
disclosure of direct and indirect 
greenhouse gas emissions, with certain 
emissions disclosures subject to third-
party attestation requirements; climate-
related scenario analysis (if the issuer 
conducts scenario analysis), together with 
qualitative and quantitative information 
about the hypothetical future climate 
scenarios used in its analysis; climate 
transition plans or climate-related targets 
or goals, along with disclosure of progress 
against any such plans, targets or goals; 
climate-related risks over the short-, 
medium- and long-term; qualitative and 
quantitative information regarding 
climate-related risks and historical impacts 
in audited financial statements; corporate 
governance of climate-related risks; and 
climate-related risk-management 
processes. In addition, bills proposed or 
adopted by the legislatures of certain US 
states may impose additional or stricter 
climate related-disclosure requirements 
on businesses operating in such US states. 
For example, in October 2023, California 
adopted the Climate Corporate Data 
Accountability Act (SB-253) and the 
Greenhouse Gases: Climate-Related 
Financial Risk bill (SB-261) which are 
expected to apply commencing in 2026. 
Barclays is monitoring such legislative 
developments and their impact on 
Barclays’ US operations and reporting 
obligations.
Sanctions and financial crime

The UK Bribery Act 2010 introduced a new 
form of corporate criminal liability focused 
broadly on a company’s failure to prevent 
bribery on its behalf. The Criminal Finances 
Act 2017 introduced new corporate 
criminal offences of failing to prevent the 
facilitation of UK and overseas tax evasion. 
In 2023, the Economic Crime and 
Corporate Transparency Act 2023 
became law. This creates a new offence of 
failing to prevent a person associated with 
the Group from committing fraud for the 
benefit of the Group. These pieces of 
legislation have broad application and in 
certain circumstances may have 
extraterritorial impact on entities, persons 
or activities located outside the UK, 
including Barclays PLC’s subsidiaries 
outside the UK. 

The UK Bribery Act requires the Group to 
have adequate procedures to prevent 
bribery which, due to the extraterritorial 
nature of the Act, makes this both 
complex and costly. Additionally, the 
Criminal Finances Act requires the Group 
to have reasonable procedures in place to 
prevent the criminal facilitation of tax 
evasion by persons acting for, or on behalf 
of, the Group. The Economic Crime and 
Corporate Transparency Act similarly 
requires the Group to have reasonable 
procedures in place to prevent a person 
associated with the Group from 
committing fraud.

The Sanctions and Anti-Money Laundering 
Act 2018 (the Sanctions Act) became law 
in the UK in 2018. Following the UK’s 
withdrawal from the EU, the Sanctions Act 
allowed for the adoption of an 
autonomous UK sanctions regime which 
came into force in 2021, as well as a more 
flexible licensing regime post-Brexit. This 
regime applies within the UK and in relation 
to the conduct of all UK persons wherever 
they are in the world; it also applies to 
overseas branches of UK companies 
(including the Barclays Bank PLC New York 
branch).

Within the EU, there is a system of 
autonomous sanctions by which the 
European Council adopts a decision made 
by the EU’s Common Foreign and Security 
Policy. The measures stated in the Council 
decision are either implemented at the EU 
level, by way of Regulation, or at a national 
level in Member States. Regulations are 
binding and directly effective throughout 
the EU. Each measure will specify the 
territorial scope of the relevant sanctions 
but these can apply broadly within the 
territory of any EU Member States and to 
EU nationals wherever they are located as 
well as to third country branches of EU 
companies. The EU enforces its anti-
money laundering regime through the 
Fourth Anti-Money Laundering Directive 
(EU) 2015/849 and the Fifth Anti-Money 
Laundering Directive (EU) 2018/849 with 
further changes being proposed through 
the Sixth Anti-Money Laundering Directive 
and a package of further reforms currently 
under discussion.

Supervision and regulation (continued)

In the US, the Bank Secrecy Act, the USA 
PATRIOT Act 2001, the Anti-Money 
Laundering Act of 2020 and regulations 
thereunder contain numerous anti-money 
laundering and anti-terrorist financing 
requirements for financial institutions. In 
addition, the Group is subject to the US 
Foreign Corrupt Practices Act, which 
prohibits, among other things, corrupt 
payments to foreign government officials. 
It is also subject to various economic 
sanctions laws, regulations and executive 
orders administered by the US 
government, which prohibit or restrict 
some or all business activities and other 
dealings with or involving certain 
individuals, entities, groups, countries and 
territories.

In some cases, US state and federal 
regulations addressing sanctions, money 
laundering and other financial crimes may 
impact entities, persons or activities 
located or undertaken outside the US, 
including Barclays PLC and its subsidiaries. 
US government authorities have 
aggressively enforced these laws against 
financial institutions in recent years.

As a result of the conflict in Ukraine, there 
has been an increased regulatory focus on 
sanctions compliance in various 
jurisdictions, including the US, UK and EU. 

Failure of a financial institution to ensure 
compliance with such laws could have 
serious legal, financial and reputational 
consequences for the institution.

Key performance indicators

In assessing the financial performance of the Group, management uses a range of KPIs which focus on the Group’s financial strength, 
the delivery of sustainable returns and cost management. KPIs reflect the targets and ambitions followed during 2023. On 20 February 
2024, the Investor Update set out refreshed targets and ambitions which future progress will be measured against. Please see page 13 
of the strategic report for further detail, or home.barclays/who-we-are/our-strategy/
Non-IFRS performance measures

The Group’s management believes that the non-IFRS performance measures included in this document provide valuable information 
to the readers of the financial statements as they enable the reader to identify a more consistent basis for comparing the businesses’ 
performance between financial periods, and provide more detail concerning the elements of performance which the managers of these 
businesses are most directly able to influence or are relevant for an assessment of the Group.

They also reflect an important aspect of the way in which operating targets are defined and performance is monitored by management. 
However, any non-IFRS performance measures in this document are not a substitute for IFRS measures and readers should consider 
the IFRS measures as well. Refer to the non-IFRS performance measures section for further information and calculations of non-IFRS 
performance measures included throughout this section and the most directly comparable IFRS measures.

Definition
Common Equity Tier 1 (CET1) 
ratio

Capital requirements are part of the 
regulatory framework governing how banks 
and depository institutions are supervised. 
Capital ratios express a bank’s capital as a 
percentage of its Risk Weighted Assets 
(RWAs) as defined by the PRA.

CET1 ratio is a measure of capital as 
defined within the Definition of Capital 
section of the PRA's Prudential and 
Resolution Policy - Banking Index.

Return on average tangible 
shareholders’ equity (RoTE)

RoTE is calculated as Group attributable 
profit, as a proportion of average tangible 
shareholders’ equity

Why is it important and how the Group performed

The Group’s capital management objective is to maximise 
shareholder value by prudently managing the level and mix 
of its capital to: ensure the Group and all of its subsidiaries 
are appropriately capitalised relative to their regulatory 
minimum and stressed capital requirements, support the 
Group’s risk appetite, growth and strategic options, while 
seeking to maintain a robust credit proposition for the 
Group and its subsidiaries.

The CET1 ratio decreased to 13.8% (2022: 13.9%) as 
£4.3bn of attributable profit, including the negative impact 
of structural cost actions, was more than offset by returns 
to shareholders, impacts of regulatory change from 1 
January 2023, the impact of KMC acquisition and 
movements in other capital deductions, as well as an 
increase in RWAs excluding the impact of foreign exchange 
movements, primarily driven by higher CIB and CC&P RWAs.

An £8.2bn decrease in RWAs driven by  foreign exchange 
movements was offset by a £1.1bn decrease in CET1 
capital due to a decrease in the currency translation reserve 
within CET1.
Group target: a CET1 ratio in the range of 13-14%.

This measure indicates the return generated by the 
management of the business based on ordinary 
shareholders’ tangible equity. Achieving a target RoTE 
demonstrates the organisation’s ability to execute its 
strategy and align management’s interests with the 
shareholders’. RoTE lies at the heart of the Group’s capital 
allocation and performance management process. 

Statutory RoTE was 9.0%  (2022: 10.4%) including £0.9bn of 
structural cost actions in Q423. Excluding Q423 structural 
cost actions, RoTE was 10.6%.
Group target: RoTE of greater than 10%.

Total operating expenses

Cost: income ratio

Total operating expenses divided by total 
income.

Why is it important and how the Group performed

Barclays views total operating expenses as a key strategic 
area for banks; those who actively manage costs and 
control them effectively will gain a strong competitive 
advantage.

Group operating expenses increased to £16.9bn (2022: 
£16.7bn) reflecting £0.9bn of structural cost actions in 
Q423,bringing total structural cost actions for FY23 to 
£1.0bn (2022: £0.2bn), business growth and investments in 
resilience and controls partially offset by lower litigation and 
conduct charges. The prior year included £1.0bn of litigation 
and conduct charges related to the Over-issuance of 
Securities.

This is a measure management uses to assess the 
productivity of the business operations. Managing the cost 
base is a key execution priority for management and 
includes a review of all categories of discretionary spending 
and an analysis of how we can run the business to ensure 
that costs increase at a slower rate than income.

The Group cost: income ratio was 67% (2022: 67%). 
Excluding Q423 structural cost actions, Group cost: income 
ratio was 63%  driven by  increased income.
Group target: a cost: income ratio below 60%.

Annual Report 2023 377

Income statement commentary

2023 compared to 2022

Barclays delivered a profit before tax of £6,557m (2022: £7,012m), RoTE of 9.0% (2022: 10.4%) and EPS of 27.7p (2022: 30.8p).

Group income increased 2% to £25,378m primarily driven by the net benefit from the higher interest rate environment, including 
continued structural hedge income, and higher balances in US cards, partially offset by the non-repeat of the prior year income from 
hedging arrangements related to the Over-issuance of Securities and lower income in Global Markets and Investment Banking,

Group total operating expenses increased to £16,931m (2022: £16,730m).

Group operating expenses excluding litigation and conduct charges increased to £16,894m (2022: £15,133m) driven by:

1
  in Q423 supporting the Group’s structural transformation and updated strategic priorities, 
• £927m of structural cost actions

bringing total structural cost actions for FY23 to £1,046m (2022: £151m)

•

•

the impact of business growth and the Kensington Mortgage Company (KMC) acquisition in Barclays UK, as well as investments in 
resilience and controls;

the impact of inflation on the Group was more than offset by efficiency savings.

Litigation and conduct charges decreased to £37m (2022: £1,597m). Prior year charges included £966m of costs related to the Over-
issuance of Securities, £282m of customer remediation costs relating to legacy loan portfolios in CC&P and £165m related to the 
2
.
Devices Settlements

Credit impairment charges were £1,881m (2022: £1,220m), driven by higher delinquencies in US cards, which was anticipated and led to 
higher coverage ratios.  Total coverage ratio remains strong at 1.4% (December 2022: 1.4%).

The effective tax rate (ETR) was 18.8% (2022: 14.8%). The 2023 ETR includes tax relief on payments made under Additional Tier 1 
(AT1) instruments and on holdings of inflation-linked government bonds.

Attributable profit was £4,274m (2022: £5,023m).

Notes

1 To help drive future returns, Barclays has taken £0.9bn of structural cost actions in Q423. Structural cost actions include initiatives across people, property and infrastructure.
2 Refers to the settlements with the SEC and Commodity Futures Trading Commission (CFTC) in connection with their investigations of the use of unauthorised devices for business 

communications.

Balance sheet commentary

Total assets

Total assets decreased £36.2bn to £1,477.5bn. 

Cash and balances at central banks decreased by £31.7bn to £224.6bn  driven by lower customer deposits in Barclays UK reflecting the 
broader market trends.

Debt securities at amortised cost increased by £11.3bn to £56.7bn and Financial assets at fair value through other comprehensive 
income increased £6.8bn to £71.8bn driven by increased investment in debt securities in Barclays International.  

Loans and advances at amortised cost  to banks and customers decreased £10.5bn to £342.7bn driven by loan repayments across 
Barclays International and Barclays UK.

Trading portfolio assets increased £40.8bn to £174.6bn driven by an increase in debt and equity securities as we facilitate client demand  
in Barclays International.

Derivative financial instrument assets decreased £45.5bn to £256.8bn, driven by lower market volatility and a decrease in the forward 
interest rates. Cash collateral and settlement balances decreased by £3.7bn to £108.9bn.

Financial assets at fair value through the income statement decreased £6.9bn to £206.7bn driven by increased secured lending being 
more than offset by trade optimisations.
Total liabilities

Total liabilities decreased £38.8bn to £1,405.6bn.

Deposits  at amortised cost to banks and customers decreased £7.0bn to £538.8bn driven by a reduction in customer deposits 
reflecting broader market trends in Barclays UK, partially offset by an increase in short-term money market deposits and growth in 
customer deposits in Barclays International.

Repurchase agreements and other similar secured borrowing at amortised cost increased £14.5bn to £41.6bn driven by increased 
secured borrowing.

Debt securities in issue decreased £16.1bn to £96.8bn driven by maturities.

Derivative financial instrument liabilities decreased £39.6bn to £250.0bn driven by lower market volatility. Cash collateral and settlement 
balances decreased by £2.8bn to £94.1bn.

Trading portfolio liabilities decreased £14.3bn to £58.7bn driven by decreases in equity securities as clients repositioned their demand. 

Financial liabilities designated at fair value increased £25.9bn to £297.5bn driven by increased repurchase agreements and prime 
brokerage deposits.
Total shareholders’ equity

Total shareholders’ equity increased £2.6bn to £71.9bn.

Other equity instruments remained at £13.3bn as the issuance of three AT1 instruments (£1.50bn, $1.8bn and SGD400m) was offset 
by two redemptions (£1.3bn and $2.5bn).  AT1 securities are perpetual subordinated contingent convertible securities structured to 
qualify as AT1 instruments under prevailing capital rules applicable as at the relevant issue date.

Other reserves increased by £2.1bn, mainly due to an increase in the cash flow hedging reserve of £3.5bn to £3.7bn debit, as a result of 
fair value movements on interest rate swaps held for hedging purposes due to an decrease in major interest rate curves.  This was 
partially offset by an decrease in the currency translation reserve of £1.1bn to £3.7bn, driven by the appreciation of GBP against USD. 

Retained earnings increased £0.9bn to £53.7bn, mainly due to profits of £4.3bn, offset by share repurchases of £1.3bn and dividends of 
£1.2bn.

Tangible net asset value per share  increased to 331p (December 2022: 295p) including: EPS of 27.7p, positive cash flow hedge reserve 
movements of 22p, and 8p from the reduction in share count following share buybacks of £1.25bn completed in 2023. This was partially 
offset by an 8p reduction from dividends paid during 2023 and net negative other reserve movements.

Profit before tax increased 8% to £2,868m with a RoTE of 19.2% (2022: 18.7%).
Total income increased 5% to £7,587m. Net interest income  increased 9% to £6,431m with a net interest margin of 3.13% (2022: 
2.86%), as higher interest rates and associated structural hedge benefit outweighed mortgage margin pressure and adverse deposit 
dynamics reflecting wider market trends. Net fee, commission and other income decreased 15% to £1,156m including the impact of 
the transfer of WM&I to CC&P.

• Personal Banking income increased 4% to £4,729m, driven by higher interest rates, partially offset by mortgage margin compression 

and movements in deposit volumes and mix resulting from cost of living pressures and customers searching for yield.

• Barclaycard Consumer UK income decreased 12% to £964m as higher customer spend volumes were more than offset by lower 

interest earning lending balances following repayments and ongoing prudent risk management.

• Business Banking income increased 16% to £1,894m driven by higher interest rates, partially offset by lower government scheme 

lending as repayments continue and lower deposit volumes.

Total operating expenses increased 2% to £4,415m, including £168m impact from Q423 structural cost actions. Excluding the impact 
of Q423 structural cost actions, operating expenses decreased 2%, driven by the transfer of WM&I to CC&P partially offset by the 
impact of inflation and the acquisition of KMC. Ongoing efficiency savings continue to be reinvested, including in our transformation 
programme to support sustainable improvement to the cost: income ratio over the longer term.

Credit impairment charges increased to £304m (2022: £286m), consistent with low delinquencies in UK cards and a high quality 
mortgage lending portfolio. UK cards 30 and 90 day arrears remained low at 0.9% (Q422: 0.9%) and 0.2% (Q422: 0.2%) respectively. 
The UK cards total coverage ratio was 6.8% (December 2022: 7.6%).

Loans and advances to customers at amortised cost decreased by 1% to £202.8bn (December 2022: £205.1bn), primarily reflecting 
continued repayment of government scheme lending in Business Banking, subdued mortgage lending amid lower market demand, 
partially offset by the acquisition of KMC.

Customer deposits at amortised cost decreased 7% to £241.1bn (December 2022: £258.0bn). Primarily driven by reduced current 
account balances in Personal and Business Banking, reflecting broader market trends. The loan: deposit ratio increased to 92% 
(December 2022: 87%).

RWAs increased to £73.5bn (December 2022: £73.1bn), primarily due to the acquisition of KMC, broadly offset by reduction across 
lending portfolios.

Analysis of results by business (continued)

2023 compared to 2022 

Barclays International RoTE was 8.2% (2022: 10.2%) with a profit before tax of £4,607m (2022: £4,965m) including £306m (CIB: £188m, 
CC&P: £118m) of Q423 structural cost actions. CIB delivered a RoTE of 8.4% (2022: 10.2%) and CC&P 6.7% (2022: 10.0%)
• Total income was broadly flat at £17,918m, prior year included a £292m income impact from hedging arrangements related to the 

Over-issuance of securities

• Total operating expenses decreased 2% to £11,761m including £306m of structural cost actions in Q423. Prior year included £966m 

of litigation and conduct charges relating to the Over-issuance of securities

Excluding the impact of Q423 structural cost actions and the Over-issuance of Securities in the prior year1:

Total income increased to £17,918m (2022: £17,575m)

CIB income decreased 4% to £12,610m (2022: £13,076m)

2
. FICC income decreased 15% to 
• Global Markets income decreased 16% to £7,218m against a record prior year comparative

£4,845m, reflecting lower market volatility and client activity. Equities income decreased 17% to£2,373m, driven by a decline in 
derivatives income reflecting less volatile equity market conditions. 

•

3
. Advisory decreased 23% and 
Investment Banking fees decreased 12% to £1,960m due to the reduced fee pool across the industry
Debt capital markets decreased 10%, while Equity capital markets increased 32%

• Within Corporate, Transaction banking income increased 16% to £2,957m driven by improved deposit margins in the higher interest 
rate environment with stable deposit balances. Corporate lending income increased to £475m (2022: £231m loss) mainly driven by 
lower costs of hedging and lower fair value losses on leverage finance lending net of mark to market gains on related hedges.

CC&P income increased 18% to £5,308m.

•

International Cards and Consumer Bank income increased 23% to £3,569m reflecting higher cards balances and improved margins, 
including the Gap Inc. portfolio acquisition in Q222.

• Private Bank income increased 17% to £1,190m, due to the transfer of WM&I from Barclays UK, client balance growth and improved 

deposits margin in the higher rate environment.

• Payments income decreased 4% to £549m driven by margin compression.

Total operating expenses  increased 4%  to £11,455m
• CIB total operating expenses  increased   4% to £8,270m, reflecting investment in talent and technology, and the impact of inflation, 

4
partially offset by the non-repeat of prior year litigation and conduct charges mainly relating to Device Settlements
 and efficiency 
savings

• CC&P total operating expenses increased 4% to £3,185m, driven by higher investment spend to support growth, mainly in marketing 
and partnership costs, the transfer of WM&I from Barclays UK, and the impact of inflation, partially offset by the non-repeat of prior 
year litigation and conduct charges mainly relating to customer remediation costs and efficiency savings 

Credit impairment charges were £1,548m (2022: £933m).

• CIB credit impairment charges were £23m (2022: £119m), driven by single name charges, partially offset by the benefit of credit 

protection.

• CC&P credit impairment charges increased to £1,525m (2022: £814m), driven by higher delinquencies in US cards, which was 

anticipated and led to higher coverage ratios. 30 and 90 day arrears at 2.9% (Q422: 2.2%) and 1.5% (Q422: 1.2%) respectively. The 
US cards total coverage ratio was 10.2% (December 2022: 8.1%).

Loans and advances at amortised cost increased £4.6bn to £174.2bn driven by increased investment in debt securities in Treasury. In 
addition, there has been balance growth in CC&P which was offset by net loan repayments in CIB and transfer to held for sale of the 
German consumer finance business.

Trading portfolio assets increased £40.8bn to £174.6bn driven by an increase in debt and equity securities as we facilitate client demand 
in Global Markets.

Derivative assets and liabilities decreased £46.5bn and £39.1bn to £255.2bn and £249.8bn respectively reflecting lower market volatility 
and a decrease in the forward interest rates.

Financial assets at fair value through the income statement decreased £6.8bn to £203.7bn driven by increased secured lending which 
was more than offset by trade optimisations.

Deposits at amortised cost increased £10.1bn to £297.7bn driven by increased deposits in CIB.

RWAs increased to £259.1bn (December 2022: £254.8bn) driven by higher CC&P RWAs.

Non-IFRS performance measures

The Group’s management believes that the non-IFRS performance measures included in this document provide valuable information 
to the readers of the financial statements as they enable the reader to identify a more consistent basis for comparing the businesses’ 
performance between financial periods, and provide more detail concerning the elements of performance which the managers of these 
businesses are most directly able to influence or are relevant for an assessment of the Group.

They also reflect an important aspect of the way in which operating targets are defined and performance is monitored by management.

However, any non-IFRS performance measures in this document are not a substitute for IFRS measures and readers should consider 
the IFRS measures as well.

1 Other comprises net interest income from Markets within Barclays International and Head Office including hedge accounting.

The Barclays Group NIM has increased 44bps from 3.54% to 3.98% in 2023, driven by the higher interest rate environment and 
continued structural hedge income momentum across the Group as well as higher balances in CC&P including the Gap Inc. portfolio 
acquisition, partially offset by product dynamics in deposits and mortgages. 

The Group’s combined product and equity structural hedge notional as at 31 December 2023 was £246bn (December 2022: £263bn), 
with an average duration of close to 2.5 years. Gross structural hedge contributions of £3,623m (2022: £2,196m) and net structural 
hedge contributions of £(8,209)m (2022: £(1,544)m) are included in Group net interest income. Gross structural hedge contributions 
represent the absolute interest income earned from the fixed receipts on the swaps in the structural hedge, while the net structural 
hedge contributions represent the net interest earned on the difference between the structural hedge rate and prevailing floating rates.

Annual Report 2023 396

KPMG LLP’s independent auditor’s report 
to the members of Barclays PLC

1. Our opinion is unmodified

Basis for opinion  

In our opinion:

• the financial statements of Barclays PLC 
give a true and fair view of the state of 
the Group’s and of the Parent 
Company’s affairs as at 31 December 
2023, and of the Group’s and the Parent 
Company’s profit for the year then 
ended;

• the Group financial statements have 

been properly prepared in accordance 
with UK-adopted international 
accounting standards;

• the Parent Company financial 

statements have been properly 
prepared in accordance with UK-
adopted international accounting 
standards as applied in accordance with 
the provisions of the Companies Act 
2006;   

• the Group and Parent Company financial 

statements have been prepared in 
accordance with the requirements of 
the Companies Act 2006.

What our opinion covers

We have audited the Group and Parent 
Company financial statements of Barclays 
PLC for the year ended 31 December 
2023 (FY23) included in the Annual Report 
and Accounts, which comprise: 
Group (Barclays PLC and its subsidiaries)

• Consolidated income statement

• Consolidated statement of 
comprehensive income

• Consolidated balance sheet

• Consolidated statement of changes in 

equity

• Consolidated cash flow statement

• Notes 1 to 43 of the Consolidated 
Financial Statements, including the 
summary of material accounting policies

Parent Company (Barclays PLC)

• Statement of comprehensive income

• Balance sheet 

• Statement of changes in equity 

• Cash flow statement

• Note 42 to the Consolidated Financial 
Statements, including the summary of 
material accounting policies

We conducted our audit in accordance 
with International Standards on Auditing 
(UK) (“ISAs (UK)”) and applicable law.  Our 
responsibilities are described below.  We 
believe that the audit evidence we have 
obtained is a sufficient and appropriate 
basis for our opinion.  Our audit opinion 
and matters included in this report are 
consistent with those discussed and 
included in our reporting to the Board 
Audit Committee (“BAC”).

We have fulfilled our ethical responsibilities 
under, and we remain independent of the 
Group in accordance with, UK ethical 
requirements including the FRC Ethical 
Standard as applied to listed public interest 
entities. 
2. Overview of our audit

Factors driving our view of risks

Following our FY22 audit and considering 
developments affecting the Barclays PLC 
Group since then, we have updated our 
risk assessment. 

The macro-economic environment 
continues to drive our risk assessment as 
general economic uncertainty has led to 
sustained affordability pressures 
associated with rising inflation and interest 
rates. 

This economic uncertainty and change has 
brought both pressures and opportunities. 
The higher interest rate environment has 
provided an uplift to net interest income, 
and has driven increased competition for 
deposits. 

Lower market volatility and reduced client 
activity have created a challenging 
environment within the Corporate and 
Investment Bank, resulting in lower income 
for FY23.

As part of our risk assessment, we have 
maintained our focus on future economic 
assumptions used by the Group in its key 
estimates both at the year end and, where 
relevant, on a forward-looking basis.  

Our risk assessment also considered 
instances of non-compliance with laws and 
regulations (including open enforcement 
actions against the Group) and specifically 
those that could reasonably be expected 
to have a material effect on the financial 
statements. We considered 
management’s assessment of how these 
occurred and their assessment of whether 
the risk could be more pervasive.

Our use of specialists and innovation
Using the work of specialists and specific 
team members with expertise in a 
specialised area of accounting or 
auditing: We used our specialists and 
specific team members with expertise in a 
specialised area of accounting or auditing 
to assist us in various aspects of our audit. 
This included, for example:

• Credit risk modellers for our testing of 

the ECL models

• Economics specialists for our work 
related to the macro-economic 
variables and scenarios used in the 
determination of the ECL provisions

• Valuation specialists for our 

independent repricing of samples of 
financial instruments 

• Corporate finance valuation specialists 
for our work over the methodology 
underpinning, and certain of the 
assumptions used in, the impairment 
assessment of goodwill and intangibles 
and the carrying value of subsidiaries 

• Actuarial pensions specialists for our 
work on the valuation of the defined 
benefit obligation

• Tax specialists for our work over the tax 

charge, the effective tax rate and 
uncertain tax positions

• IT auditors for our testing of automated 

and general IT controls

Annual Report 2023 397

KPMG LLP’s independent auditor’s report 
to the members of Barclays PLC (continued)

Incorporating unpredictability into our 
audit: A requirement of the auditing 
standards is that we undertake procedures 
which are deliberately unexpected and 
could not have reasonably been predicted 
by Barclays’ management.  As an example, 
we update our criteria for selecting journals 
with a higher risk of management override 
each year so that the selection criteria do 
not become predictable. Outside of 
journals, for a selection of fair value 
financial instruments, we performed intra-
month independent re-pricing to 
incorporate an element of unpredictability 
in our audit procedures.
Innovation in the audit: Our audit is 
committed to driving innovation and the 
increased use of technology. In 2023 we 
have continued to deploy a large number 
of data and analytics tools across our audit.  
We have also continued to innovate our 
audit of valuation of financial instruments, 
by using the Digital Media Analytics tool to 
gather market news and data for key 
principal investments and leveraged 
finance exposures for consideration as 
part of our risk assessment procedures.
Board Audit Committee (“BAC”) 
interaction

During the year, the BAC met 11 times. 
KPMG are invited to attend all BAC 
meetings and are provided an opportunity 
to meet with the BAC in private sessions 
without the Executive Directors being 
present. For each Key Audit Matter, we 
have set out communications with the 
BAC in section 4, including matters that 
required particular judgement for each. 

In addition, our audit team includes a senior 
partner who has specific responsibility for 
ensuring audit quality (our “Audit Quality 
Partner”). The Board Audit Committee met 
with the Audit Quality Partner twice in the 
year to receive a report on his assessment 
of audit quality. The Board Audit 
Committee also met with KPMG’s Head of 
Audit Quality who provided an update on 
the initiatives KPMG is taking to sustain 
high levels of audit quality.

The matters included in the BAC Chair’s 
report on page 166 are materially 
consistent with our observations of those 
meetings. 

In addition, KPMG are invited to attend the 
Board Risk Committee meetings.

Our independence

We have fulfilled our ethical responsibilities 
under, and we remain independent of the 
Group in accordance with, UK ethical 
requirements including the FRC Ethical 
Standard as applied to listed public interest 
entities.

Apart from the matters noted below, we 
have not performed any non-audit 
services during the year ended 31 
December 2023 or subsequently which are 
prohibited by the FRC Ethical Standard.

We have identified that a KPMG member firm 
has provided preparation of local financial 
statements services over the period 2018 to 
2023. That member firm had no involvement 
in the group audit of Barclays PLC. The 
services, which have been terminated, were 
administrative in nature and did not involve 
any management decision-making or 
bookkeeping. The work was undertaken after 
the group audit opinion was signed by KPMG 
LLP for each of the related financial years and 
had no direct or indirect effect on Barclays 
PLC’s consolidated financial statements.

In our professional judgment, we confirm 
that based on our assessment of the 
breach, our integrity and objectivity as 
auditor has not been compromised and we 
believe that an objective, reasonable and 
informed third party would conclude that 
the provision of these services would not 
impair our integrity or objectivity for any of 
the impacted financial years. The Board 
Audit Committee concurred with this view.

We were first appointed as auditor by the 
shareholders for the year ended 31 
December 2017. The period of total 
uninterrupted engagement is for the seven 
financial years ended 31 December 2023. 

The Group lead engagement partner is 
required to rotate after five years. This is 
the second set of UK Financial Statements 
that Stuart Crisp has signed and he will be 
required to rotate after the FY26 audit. 

The average tenure of key audit partners 
who are responsible for component audits, 
as set out in section 7 below, is two years, 
with the shortest being their first year of 
involvement and longest being five years.

Materiality 
(Item 6 below)

Group scope 
(Item 7 below)

Coverage of Group financial statements

Group total income*

The scope of our work is influenced by our 
view of materiality and our assessed risk of 
material misstatement. 

We have determined overall materiality for 
the Barclays PLC Group to be £350m 
(FY22: £275m). 

We determined that profit before tax (PBT) 
remains the key benchmark for the 
Barclays PLC Group. For FY23, we adjusted 
PBT for items which do not represent the 
normal, continuing operations of the 
Group. As such, for FY23 we based our 
materiality on normalised profit before tax 
of £7,484m, of which it represents 4.7% 
(FY22: 3.9%).

Materiality for the parent company 
financial statements as a whole was set at 
£170m (2022: £100m), which is the 
component materiality for the parent 
company determined by the group audit 
engagement team. This is lower than the 
materiality we would otherwise have 
determined with reference to a benchmark 
of net assets of which it represents 0.3% 
(FY22: 0.2%).   
Normalised profit before tax £7,484m

materiality

We have performed risk assessment and 
planning procedures to determine which of 
the Group’s components are likely to 
include risks of material misstatement to 
the Group financial statements, the type of 
procedures to be performed at these 
components and the extent of 
involvement required from component 
auditors around the world for the purpose 
of our opinion on the consolidated financial 
statements. 

We have also considered the extent to 
which the Group has established central 
hubs in shared service centre structures in 
India. The outputs from these hubs are 
included in the financial information of the 
reporting components and so the India 
operations are not considered to be a 
separate component. 

We have performed certain audit 
procedures centrally across the Group, set 
out in more detail in Section 7. In addition, 
we have performed Group level analysis on 
the remaining components to determine 
whether further risks of material 
misstatement exist in those components.

We consider the scope of our audit, as 
communicated to the Board Audit 
Committee, to be an appropriate basis for 
our audit opinion.

work accounted for the following

to the members of Barclays PLC (continued)

The impact of climate change on our audit

In planning our audit, we have considered 
the potential impact of risks arising from 
climate change on the Group’s business 
and its financial statements. The Group 
has set out its ambition under the Paris 
Accord to be a net zero bank by 2050. 
Further information is provided in the 
Group’s Climate and Sustainability report, 
which has been incorporated into the 2023 
Annual Report on pages 59 -129. 

Climate change risks, opportunities and 
the Group’s own commitments and 
changing regulations could have a 
significant impact on the Group’s business 
and operations. There is the possibility that 
climate change risks, both physical and 
transitional, could affect financial 
statement balances, through estimates 
such as credit risk and market risk. There is 
enhanced narrative in the Annual Report 
on climate matters. 

As part of our audit we performed a risk 
assessment of the impact of climate 
change risk and the commitments made 
by the Group in respect of climate change 
on the financial statements and our audit 
approach. As a part of this we held 
discussions with our own climate change 
professionals to challenge our risk 
assessment. In doing this we performed 
the following: 
• Understanding management’s 
processes: we made enquiries to 
understand management’s assessment 
of the potential impact of climate 
change risk on the Group’s Annual 
Report and Accounts and the Group’s 
preparedness for this. As a part of this 
we made enquiries to understand 
management’s risk assessment process 
as it relates to possible effects of 
climate change on the Annual Report 
and Accounts including the way in which 
the accounting policies of the Group 
(including those relating to products 
with specific climate features) are 
updated to reflect climate change risks. 
We also read and discussed with 
management the quantitative analysis 
prepared by the Group to support its 
assessment of the impact of climate risk 
on credit risk.

• Retail credit risk: we assessed how the 
Group considers the impact of physical 
risks on the valuation of mortgage 
collateral. Specifically, we performed 
data and analytic driven risk assessment 
procedures to understand the potential 
impact of flooding and subsidence on 
the valuation of mortgage collateral and 
made enquiries of management to 
understand how this is considered within 
their own collateral valuation process. 
• Corporate credit risk: we assessed how 

the Group considers the impact of 
climate risk on corporate counterparties 
through our individual loan assessments 
where, for performing counterparties, 
we assessed how climate change risk 
impacts certain counterparties within 
the commercial bank, including the 
impact on their credit rating as 
applicable. The focus of our procedures 
was on certain counterparties who 
operate in industries with greater 
exposure to climate risk - the energy, 
transportation, materials and buildings, 
agriculture, food and forest product 
sectors. 

• Market risk: as part of our risk 
assessment, we incorporated a 
consideration of the climate change 
impact on unobservable inputs used in 
the valuation of certain financial 
instruments in elevated risk sectors 
including energy, metals and mining.
• Annual report narrative: we made 

enquiries of management to understand 
the process by which climate related 
narrative is developed including the 
primary sources of data used and the 
governance process in place over the 
narrative. As a part of our risk 
assessment, we read the climate related 
information in the front half of the 
Annual Report and considered 
consistency with the financial 
statements and our audit knowledge. 

On the basis of the procedures performed 
above, we concluded that, while climate 
change posed a risk to the determination 
of asset values in the current year, the risk 
was not significant when we considered 
the nature of the assets and the relevant 
contractual terms.  As a result, there was 
no material impact from climate change on 
our key audit matters.

3. Going concern, viability and 
principal risks and uncertainties

The Directors have prepared the financial 
statements on the going concern basis as 
they do not intend to liquidate the Group 
or the Parent Company or to cease their 
operations, and they have concluded that 
the Group’s and the Parent Company’s 
financial position means that this is 
realistic.

They have also concluded that there are 
no material uncertainties that could have 
cast significant doubt over their ability to 
continue as a going concern for at least a 
year from the date of approval of the 
financial statements (“the going concern 
period”).  
Going concern 

We used our knowledge of the Group and 
Parent Company, the financial services 
industry, and the general economic 
environment to identify the inherent risks 
to the business model and analysed how 
those risks might affect the Group’s and 
Parent Company’s financial resources or 
ability to continue operations over the 
going concern period. The risks that we 
considered most likely to adversely affect 
the Group’s and Parent Company’s 
available financial resources over this 
period were:

• the availability of funding and liquidity in 

the event of a market wide stress 
scenario; and

• the impact on regulatory capital 
requirements in the event of an 
economic slowdown. 

We considered whether these risks could 
plausibly affect the availability of financial 
resources in the going concern period by 
comparing severe, but plausible downside 
scenarios that could arise from these risks 
individually and collectively against the level 
of available financial resources indicated by 
the Group’s financial forecasts. 

Our procedures also included an 
assessment of whether the going concern 
disclosure in note 1 to the financial 
statements gives a complete and accurate 
description of the Directors’ assessment 
of going concern.

KPMG LLP’s independent auditor’s report 
to the members of Barclays PLC (continued)

We are also required to review the Viability 
Statement set out on page 54 under the 
Listing Rules. 

Our work is limited to assessing these 
matters in the context of only the 
knowledge acquired during our financial 
statements audit.  As we cannot predict all 
future events or conditions and as 
subsequent events may result in 
outcomes that are inconsistent with 
judgements that were reasonable at the 
time they were made, the absence of 
anything to report on these statements is 
not a guarantee as to the Group’s and 
Parent Company’s longer-term viability.
Our reporting 

• We have nothing material to add or draw 

attention to in relation to these 
disclosures.

• We have concluded that these 

disclosures are materially consistent 
with the financial statements and our 
audit knowledge.

Accordingly, based on those procedures, 
we found the directors’ use of the going 
concern basis of preparation without any 
material uncertainty for the Group and 
Parent Company to be acceptable.  

However, as we cannot predict all future 
events or conditions and as subsequent 
events may result in outcomes that are 
inconsistent with judgements that were 
reasonable at the time they were made, 
the above conclusions are not a guarantee 
that the Group or the Parent Company will 
continue in operation.
Our conclusions

• We consider that the directors’ use of 

the going concern basis of accounting in 
the preparation of the Group’s and 
Parent Company’s financial statements 
is appropriate;

• We have not identified, and concur with 
the directors’ assessment that there is 
not, a material uncertainty related to 
events or conditions that, individually or 
collectively, may cast significant doubt 
on the Group’s or Parent Company's 
ability to continue as a going concern for 
the going concern period;

• We have nothing material to add or draw 
attention to in relation to the directors’ 
statement in Note 1 to the financial 
statements on the use of the going 
concern basis of accounting with no 
material uncertainties that may cast 
significant doubt over the Group and 
Parent Company’s use of that basis for 
the going concern period, and we found 
the going concern disclosure in note 1 
to be acceptable; and

• The related statement under the Listing 
Rules set out on page 54 is materially 
consistent with the financial statements 
and our audit knowledge.

Disclosures of emerging and principal 
risks and longer-term viability  
Our responsibility 

We are required to perform procedures to 
identify whether there is a material 
inconsistency between the directors’ 
disclosures in respect of emerging and 
principal risks and the viability statement, 
and the financial statements and our audit 
knowledge.

Based on those procedures, we have 
nothing further to add or draw attention to 
in relation to:  

• the directors’ confirmation within the 
viability statement that they have 
carried out a robust assessment of the 
emerging and principal risks facing the 
Group, including those that would 
threaten its business model, future 
performance, solvency and liquidity;  

• the Principal Risks and Uncertainties 

disclosures describing these risks and 
how emerging risks are identified and 
explaining how they are being managed 
and mitigated; and  

• the directors’ explanation in the viability 
statement of how they have assessed 
the prospects of the Group, over what 
period they have done so and why they 
considered that period to be 
appropriate, and their statement as to 
whether they have a reasonable 
expectation that the Group will be able 
to continue in operation and meet its 
liabilities as they fall due over the period 
of their assessment, including any 
related disclosures drawing attention to 
any necessary qualifications or 
assumptions.

4. Key audit matters

What we mean

Key Audit Matters are those matters that, in our professional judgement, were of most significance in the audit of the financial 
statements and include the most significant assessed risks of material misstatement (whether or not due to fraud) identified by us, 
including those which had the greatest effect on: 

• the overall audit strategy; 

• the allocation of resources in the audit; and

• directing the efforts of the engagement team. 

We include below the Key Audit Matters in decreasing order of audit significance together with our key audit procedures to address 
those matters and our results from those procedures. These matters were addressed, and our results are based on procedures 
undertaken for the purpose of our audit of the financial statements as a whole. We do not provide a separate opinion on these matters.

Description of the Key Audit Matter
Subjective estimate

The estimation of expected credit losses 
(“ECL”) on financial instruments involves 
significant judgement and estimates. The key 
areas where we identified greater levels of 
management judgement and therefore 
increased levels of audit focus in the Group’s 
estimation of ECL are:

• Model estimations – Inherently judgemental 
modelling and assumptions are used to 
estimate ECL which involves determining 
Probability of Default (“PD”), Loss Given 
Default (“LGD”), and Exposure at Default 
(“EAD”). ECL may be inappropriate if certain 
models or underlying assumptions do not 
accurately predict defaults or recoveries 
over time, become out of line with wider 
industry experience, or fail to reflect the 
credit risk of financial assets. As a result, 
certain IFRS 9 models and model 
assumptions are the key drivers of 
complexity and uncertainty in the Group’s 
calculation of the ECL estimate. 

• Economic scenarios – IFRS 9 requires the 
Group to measure ECL on an unbiased 
forward-looking basis reflecting a range of 
future economic conditions. Significant 
management judgement is applied in 
determining the forward-looking economic 
scenarios used as an input to calculate ECL, 
the associated scenario probability 
weightings, and the key economic variables 
that drive the scenarios. There is also a high 
level of complexity of models used to derive 
the probability weightings.

Our response to the risk

Our procedures to address the risk included:
Risk assessment: We performed granular and detailed risk assessment procedures over the entirety 
of the loan and advances at amortised cost including off-balance sheet elements of the allowance 
within the Group’s financial statements. As part of these risk assessment procedures, we identified 
the portfolios associated with a risk of material misstatement including those arising from significant 
judgements over the estimation of ECL either due to inputs, methods or assumptions.
Controls testing: We performed end to end process walkthroughs to identify the key systems, 
applications and controls used in the ECL processes. We tested the relevant manual, general IT and 
application controls over key systems used in the ECL process.

Key aspects of our controls testing involved evaluating the design and implementation and testing the 
operating effectiveness of the key controls over the:

• completeness and accuracy of the key inputs into the IFRS 9 impairment models;
• application of the staging criteria;
• model validation, implementation and monitoring;
• completeness, authorisation and calculation of post model adjustments and management 

overlays;

• selection and implementation of economic variables and the controls over the economic scenario 

selection and probabilities; and

• credit reviews that determine customer risk ratings for a population of wholesale customers, 

including a risk-based selection.

Our credit risk modelling expertise: We involved our own credit risk modellers who assisted in the 
following:

• evaluating the Group’s impairment methodologies for compliance with IFRS 9;
•

inspecting model code for the calculation of certain components of the ECL model to assess its 
consistency with the Group’s model methodology;

• evaluating whether model changes (including updated model code), for a selection of models which 

were changed or updated during the year, were appropriate by assessing the updated model 
methodology against the applicable accounting standard;
reperforming the calculation of certain adjustments to assess consistency with the qualitative 
adjustment methodologies; 

•

• assessing and reperforming, for a selection of models, the reasonableness of the model 

predictions by comparing them against actual results and evaluating the resulting differences; 
• evaluating the model output for a selection of models by inspecting the corresponding model 
functionality and independently implementing the model by rebuilding the model code and 
comparing our independent output with management’s output; and
independently recalculating a selection of model assumptions using more recent data for certain 
portfolios. This is used to develop a range for ECL which is compared to management’s point 
estimate.

Annual Report 2023 402

Description of the Key Audit Matter

▪ Qualitative adjustments – Adjustments to 
the model-driven ECL results are raised by 
management to address known impairment 
model limitations, emerging trends, or risks 
not captured by models. They represent 
approximately 6.1% of the ECL. These 
adjustments are inherently uncertain and 
significant management judgement is 
involved in identifying and estimating certain 
post model adjustments (“PMA’s”) and 
management overlays. 

The effect of these matters is that, as part of 
our risk assessment, we determined that the 
impairment of loans and advances to 
customers including off-balance sheet 
elements of the allowance has a high degree of 
estimation uncertainty, with a potential range 
of reasonable outcomes greater than our 
materiality for the financial statements as a 
whole, and possibly many times that amount. 
The credit risk sections of the financial 
statements (pages 291-335) disclose the 
sensitivities estimated by the Group. 
Disclosure quality

The disclosures regarding the Group’s 
application of IFRS 9 are key to explaining the 
key judgements and material inputs to the IFRS 
9 ECL results.
Communications with the Barclays PLC 
Board Audit Committee

Our discussions with and reporting to the 
Board Audit Committee included:

• The effectiveness of the control 
environment operating over the 
calculation of the ECL provisions; 

• The determination and utilisation of 

judgemental post model adjustments 
recognised;

• Model monitoring results and 

adjustments made; 

• Management’s economic forecast and 
associated scenario probability weights; 
and

• The disclosures made to explain ECL, 

including explaining the resulting 
estimation uncertainty.

Our response to the risk
Our economics expertise: We involved our own economic specialists who assisted us in:
• assessing the reasonableness of the Group’s methodology and models for determining the 

economic scenarios used and the probability weightings applied to them;

• assessing key economic variables which included comparing samples of economic variables to 

external sources;

• assessing the overall reasonableness of the economic forecasts by comparing the Group’s 

forecasts to our own modelled forecasts; and

• assessing the reasonableness of the Group’s qualitative adjustments by challenging key economic 

assumptions applied in their calculation based on external sources.

Other test of details:  Key aspects of our testing in addition to those set out above involved:
• sample testing over key inputs into the ECL calculations; 

• selecting a sample of post model adjustments, considering the size and complexity of 

management overlays, to assess the reasonableness of the adjustments by challenging key 
assumptions, inspecting the calculation methodology and tracing a sample of the data used back to 
source data; 

• assessing the completeness of post model adjustments identified based on our knowledge gained 

from other risk-assessment and substantive audit procedures; and

• selecting a sample of credit reviews to assess the reasonableness of customer risk ratings by 

challenging key judgements and considering disconfirming or contradictory evidence.

Assessing transparency:   We assessed whether the disclosures appropriately disclose and address 
the uncertainty which exists when determining the ECL. In addition, we assessed whether the 
disclosure of the key judgements and assumptions was sufficiently clear. 

Further information in the Annual Report 
and Accounts: See the Board Audit 
Committee Report on page 166 for details 
on how the Board Audit Committee 
considered impairment as an area of 
focus, page 431 for the accounting policy 
on accounting for the impairment of 
financial assets under IFRS 9, pages 
291-335 for the credit risk disclosures, and 
page 431 for the financial disclosure note 
8; Credit Impairment charges.

Areas of particular auditor judgement

We identified the following as the areas of 
particular auditor judgement:

• The appropriateness of the model 

estimations and qualitative adjustments 
recorded to the model driven ECL 
calculations to reflect the current 
economic environment.

Our results

Based on the risk identified and our 
procedures performed we considered the 
impairment allowances on loans and 
advances at amortised cost, including off-
balance sheet elements and the related 
disclosures to be acceptable (2022 result: 
acceptable).

* In addition to Level 3 portfolios, the key audit matter identified relates to one Level 2 derivatives portfolio within these balances, and certain X VA adjustments made to derivative 

valuations, both of which we considered to be harder-to-value.

Our response to the risk
Our procedures to address the risk included:
Risk assessment: We performed granular and detailed risk assessment procedures throughout the 
audit period over the entirety of the balances within the Group’s financial statements (i.e. all of the fair 
value financial instruments held by the Group). As part of these risk assessment procedures, we 
identified which portfolios and the associated valuation inputs have a risk of material misstatement 
including those arising from significant judgements over valuation either due to unobservable inputs 
or complex models. 
Control testing: We attended management’s Valuation Committee throughout the year and 
observed discussion and challenge over valuation themes including items related to the valuation of 
certain harder-to-value financial instruments recorded at fair value.

We performed end to end process walkthroughs to identify the key systems, applications and controls 
used in the valuations processes. We tested the design and operating effectiveness of key controls 
relating specifically to these portfolios.

Key aspects of our controls testing involved evaluating the design and implementation and testing the 
operating effectiveness of the key controls over:

•

independent price verification (IPV), performed by a control function, of key market pricing inputs, 
including completeness of positions and valuation inputs subject to the IPV control;

• FVAs, including exit adjustments (to mark the portfolio to bid or offer prices), model shortcoming 

reserves to address model limitations and XVAs; and

•

the validation, completeness, implementation and usage of valuation models. This included 
controls over assessment of model limitations and assumptions.

Our valuations expertise: We involved our own valuation professionals with specialised skills and 
knowledge, who assisted in the following:

•

independently re-pricing a selection of fair value financial instruments and challenging 
management on the valuations where they were outside our tolerance; and

• challenging the appropriateness of significant models and methodologies used in calculating fair 

values, risk exposures and in calculating FVAs and XVAs, including comparison to industry practice.

Seeking contradictory evidence: For a selection of collateral disputes identified through 
management’s control where significant fair value differences were observable with the market 
participant on the other side of the trade, we challenged management’s valuation by inspecting 
evidence of the investigation and resolution of the disputes. We also utilised collateral dispute data to 
identify fair value financial instruments with significant fair value differences against market 
counterparties and selected these to independently reprice.
Inspection of movements: We inspected trading revenue arising on level 3 positions to assess 
whether material day one gains or losses generated were in line with the accounting standards. 
Historical comparison: We performed a retrospective review by inspecting significant gains and 
losses on a selection of new fair value financial instruments, position exits and restructurings 
throughout the audit period and evaluated whether these data points indicated elements of fair value 
not incorporated in the current valuation methodologies. We also inspected movements in 
unobservable inputs throughout the period to challenge whether any gain or loss generated was 
appropriate.
Assessing transparency: For the Level 3 portfolios, we assessed the adequacy of the Group’s 
financial statements disclosures in the context of the relevant accounting standards.

Description of the Key Audit Matter
Subjective valuation

The fair value of the Group’s financial 
instruments is determined through the 
application of valuation techniques which can 
involve the exercise of significant judgement 
by the Group in relation to the choice of the 
valuation models, pricing inputs and post-
model pricing adjustments, including fair value 
adjustments (FVAs) and credit, collateral and 
funding adjustments (together referred to as 
XVAs).

Where significant pricing inputs are 
unobservable, management has limited 
reliable, relevant market data available in 
determining the fair value and hence 
estimation uncertainty can be high. These 
financial instruments are classified as Level 3, 
with management having controls in place 
over the boundary between Level 2 and 3 
positions. Our significant audit risk for the 
Level 3 portfolios is therefore primarily due to 
these unobservable inputs. 

In addition, for the Level 2 portfolios, there 
may also be valuation complexity, specifically 
where valuation modelling techniques result in 
significant limitations or where there is greater 
uncertainty around the choice of an 
appropriate pricing methodology, and 
consequently more than one valuation 
methodology could be used for that product 
across the market. 

We identified two areas of such complexity. 
The first a derivatives portfolio that we 
considered to be harder to value Level 2 due to 
an element of modelling complexity 
associated with the product, and the second 
the XVA adjustments made to uncollateralised 
and partially collateralised derivative 
valuations.

The effect of these matters is that, as part of 
our risk assessment, we determined that the 
subjective estimates in fair value 
measurement of Level 3 and harder-to-value 
Level 2 portfolios have a high degree of 
estimation uncertainty, with a potential range 
of reasonable outcomes greater than our 
materiality for the financial statements as a 
whole, and possibly many times that amount. 
The financial statements (note 17) disclose the 
sensitivity in Level 3 portfolios estimated by 
the Group.
Disclosure quality

For the Level 3 portfolios, the disclosures are 
key to explaining the valuation techniques, key 
judgements, assumptions and material inputs.

Description of the Key Audit Matter
Subjective valuation

The valuation of the defined benefit obligation 
in respect of the UKRF is dependent on key 
actuarial assumptions, including the discount 
rates, retail price index (‘RPI’) and mortality 
assumptions. Small changes to these 
assumptions may still have a significant impact 
on the measurement of the defined benefit 
pension obligation. 

As part of our risk assessment, we determined 
that the defined benefit pension obligation has 
a high degree of estimation uncertainty, with a 
potential range of reasonable outcomes 
greater than our materiality for the financial 
statements, and possibly many times that 
amount.
Disclosure quality

The disclosures regarding the Group’s 
application of IAS 19 (including risks, 
assumptions and sources of estimation 
uncertainty) are key to explaining the key 
judgements applied in the IAS 19 Defined 
Benefit Obligation calculation. 

Communications with the Barclays PLC 
Board Audit Committee

Our discussions with and reporting to the 
Board Audit Committee included:

• Our definition of the Key Audit Matter 
relating to the valuation of the defined 
benefit pension obligation including the 
rationale for not including the valuation 
of pension assets in the key audit 
matter.

• We also discussed our audit response to 
the key audit matter which included the 
use of specialists to challenge key 
aspects of management’s actuarial 
valuation.

Our response to the risk
Our procedures to address the risk included:
Control testing: We performed end to end process walkthroughs to identify the key systems, 
applications and controls used in the defined benefit obligation process. We tested the design and 
operating effectiveness of key controls relating to the process. These included:
• controls over management’s review of IAS19 assumptions including the discount rate, RPI and 

mortality assumptions; and

reconciliation controls of the IAS19 disclosures to underlying data.

•
Evaluation of management’s expert: : We evaluated the objectivity and competence of 
management’s actuarial expert involved in the valuation of the defined benefit pension obligation.
Our actuarial expertise: We involved our own actuarial professionals in the following:

• evaluating the judgements made and the appropriateness of methodologies used by management 

and management’s actuarial expert in determining the key actuarial assumptions; and

• comparing the assumptions used by Barclays PLC to our independently compiled expected ranges 

based on market observable indices and our market experience. 

Assessing transparency: We assessed the adequacy of the Group’s financial statements disclosures 
in the context of the relevant accounting standards.

Areas of particular auditor judgement

Our results

We identified the following as areas of 
particular auditor judgement: 

• Subjective and complex auditor 

judgement was required in evaluating 
the key actuarial assumptions used by 
the Group (including the discount rate, 
retail price index and mortality 
assumptions).

Based on the risk identified and our 
procedures performed we consider the 
valuation of the defined benefit pension 
obligation in respect of UKRF and the 
related disclosures to be acceptable (2022 
result: acceptable).

4.4 User access management

Financial Statement Elements

Our assessment of risk vs FY22

User access management has a potential impact 
throughout the financial statements.

1   Our assessment is the risk is similar to FY22

Our results

FY23 and FY22:

Our testing did not identify 
unauthorised user activities in 
the systems relevant to financial 
reporting which would have 
required us to significantly 
expand the extent of our 
planned detailed testing.

Description of the Key Audit Matter
Control Performance

Operations across several countries support a wide 
range of products and services resulting in a large and 
complex IT infrastructure relevant to the financial 
reporting processes and related internal controls. 

Our response to the risk
Our procedures to address the risk included:
Control testing: We tested the design, implementation and operating effectiveness of 
automated controls that support material balances in the financial statements. We also 
tested the design and operating effectiveness of the relevant preventative and detective 
general IT controls over user access management including:

User access management controls are an integral part 
of the IT environment to ensure both system access 
and changes made to systems and data are authorised 
and appropriate. Our audit approach relies on the 
effectiveness of IT access management controls. Our 
audit procedures identified deficiencies in certain IT 
access controls for systems relevant to financial 
reporting. More specifically, previously identified control 
deficiencies remain open around monitoring of activities 
performed by privileged users on infrastructure 
components. Management has an ongoing programme 
to remediate the deficiencies. Since these deficiencies 
were open during the year, we performed additional 
procedures to respond to the risk of unauthorised 
changes to automated controls over financial reporting, 
such as an assessment of compensating controls 
implemented by management.
Communications with the Barclays PLC 
Board Audit Committee

Our discussions with and reporting  to the 
Board Audit Committee included:

• Our response to the Key Audit Matter.

• authorising access rights for new joiners;

•

•

timely removal of user access rights;

logging and monitoring of user activities;

• privileged user access management and monitoring;

• developer access to transaction and balance information; 

• segregation of duties;

•

•

re-certification of user access rights; and

restricting access to make changes to systems and data.

We performed procedures to assess whether additional detective compensating controls 
operate at the required level of precision to support our assessed risk of unauthorised 
activities and we tested management’s detective controls. 

Areas of particular auditor judgement

We identified the following as the areas of 
particular auditor judgement: 

• The Key Audit Matter relates to 

determining whether user access 
management controls were designed 
and implemented and operated 
effectively. Limited auditor judgement 
was required relative to the other Key 
Audit Matters which have been 
identified.

Our results

Based on the risk identified and our 
procedures performed, we did not identify 
unauthorised user activities in the systems 
relevant to financial reporting which would 
have required us to significantly expand 
the extent of our planned detailed testing.

Description of the Key Audit Matter
Subjective assessment

The Parent Company’s investment in subsidiaries may be 
misstated if the carrying value of the investment in the 
balance sheet is not supported by the recoverable amount 
of the investment. Barclays has estimated the recoverable 
amount using the future cash flows of the underlying 
business (the value in use (“VIU”)). 

The calculation of VIU is dependent on certain key 
assumptions around the future cash flows which have been 
forecasted using the Group’s Medium-Term Plan (‘MTP’), 
the discount rates and the terminal growth rates. These 
assumptions, which are judgemental, are derived from a 
combination of management estimates, market data and 
other information obtained from external sources. 

These assumptions continued to be impacted by 
uncertainty in the wider economic environment. This has 
contributed to the complexity and subjectivity in the 
impairment assessment process, in addition to the 
complexities of the valuation of a Bank.

Due to the materiality of the investment in subsidiaries in 
the context of the Parent Company financial statements, 
this is the area that had the greatest impact on the overall 
Parent Company audit.

Our response to the risk
Our procedures to address the risk included:
Control testing: We performed end to end process walkthroughs to identify the key 
systems, applications and controls used in the process to assess the carrying value of the 
Parent Company’s investment in subsidiaries. We tested the design and operating 
effectiveness of the key controls relating to the process. These included controls over 
the identification of indicators of impairment and review of the key assumptions in 
determining the value in use.
Test of details: We compared the carrying amount of each subsidiary to its draft balance 
sheet to identify whether its net assets, being an approximation of their minimum 
recoverable amount, were in excess of its carrying amount. We assessed for potential 
indicators that investments in subsidiaries might be impaired.
Benchmarking assumptions: For the two largest subsidiaries (Barclays Bank PLC and 
Barclays Bank UK PLC) we compared key assumptions in the associated VIU calculations 
including those underlying certain estimated future cash flows, the discount rate and the 
terminal growth rate to externally derived data including analyst broker reports, peer bank 
data and projected economic growth.
Our valuations expertise: We involved our own valuations specialists to assist us in the 
following:

• evaluating the appropriateness of the discount rate used by independently developing 

discount rate ranges using external data sources and peer bank data; and

• assessing whether the methodology over management’s calculation of the VIU is 

compliant with the requirements of the accounting standard.

Our business understanding: We used our business understanding to evaluate the 
reasonableness of certain key assumptions and considerations made when developing 
the Group’s MTP estimated future cash flows.
Historical comparison: We performed a retrospective review by comparing the MTP 
from previous years to actual results to assess the Group’s ability to accurately prepare 
cash flow forecasts at the individual subsidiary level.
Assessing transparency We assessed whether the disclosures around the assessment 
of recoverability of the Parent Company’s investment in subsidiaries adequately reflects 
key assumptions and sensitivities considering the level of risks inherent in the 
assessment of recoverable amount of the Parent Company’s investment in subsidiaries.

Communications with the Barclays 
Board Audit Committee

Our discussions with and reporting to the 
Board Audit Committee included:

• Our audit response to the Key Audit 
Matter which included the use of 
specialists to challenge key aspects of 
management’s impairment assessment 
and the range of reasonably possible 
alternatives for significant assumptions.

Areas of particular auditor judgement

We identified the following as the areas of 
particular judgement:

• We identified the reasonableness of the 
assumptions underlying the estimated 
future cash flows and appropriateness 
of the discount rate, which was used in 
the impairment assessment, as the 
areas of particular judgement.

Our results

Based on our procedures performed, we 
consider the Parent Company’s 
investment in subsidiaries balance to be 
acceptable (2022 result: acceptable).

and Accounts: See page 503 for the 
accounting policy on the recoverability of 
the investment in subsidiaries and page

5. Our ability to detect 
irregularities, and our response  

Fraud - identifying and responding to 
risks of material misstatement due to 
fraud
Fraud risk assessment 

To identify risks of material misstatement 
due to fraud (“fraud risks”) we assessed 
events or conditions that could indicate an 
incentive or pressure to commit fraud or 
provide an opportunity to commit fraud. In 
this risk assessment we considered the 
following:

• Our meetings throughout the year with 
the Group Head of Risk, Group Head of 
Compliance and Group Head of Legal 
and inspection of Barclays’ internal 
ethics and compliance reporting 
summaries, including those concerning 
investigations and regulatory 
correspondence;

• Enquiries of operational managers, 
internal audit, and the Board Audit 
Committee and inspection of policy 
documentation as to the Group’s high-
level policies and procedures relating to:
◦ detecting and responding to the risks 
of fraud as well as whether they have 
knowledge of any actual, suspected or 
alleged fraud; and

◦ the internal controls established to 
mitigate risks related to fraud, 
including the appropriateness and 
impact of changes made to these 
controls to facilitate remote/hybrid 
working;

• The Group’s remuneration policies and 
key drivers for remuneration and bonus 
levels; and

• Discussions among the engagement 
team regarding how and where fraud 
might occur in the financial statements 
and any potential indicators of fraud. 
The engagement team includes audit 
partners and staff who have extensive 
experience of working with banks, and 
this experience was relevant to the 
discussion about where fraud risks may 
arise. The discussions also involved our 
forensic specialists to assist us in 
identifying fraud risks based on 
discussions of the circumstances of the 
Group and Company, including 
consideration of fraudulent schemes 
that had arisen in similar sectors and 
industries.  The forensic specialists 
participated in the initial fraud risk 
assessment discussions and were 
consulted as required where further 
guidance was necessary.

Fraud risk communication

We communicated identified fraud risks 
throughout the audit team and we 
remained alert to any indications of fraud 
throughout the audit. This included 
communication from the Group to 
component audit teams of relevant fraud 
risks identified at the Group level.
Fraud risks and our procedures to 
address them

We identified four fraud risks which were 
communicated to component audit 
teams. The nature of these fraud risks is 
substantially unchanged from the prior 
year. The fraud risks we identified are set 
out below:

1. IFRS 9 ECL: Judgemental qualitative 

adjustments made to the ECL provision

2. Valuations - risk relating to 

unobservable pricing inputs used to 
price level 3 fair value instruments

3. Existence and accuracy of unconfirmed 
over-the-counter bilateral derivatives

4. The risk of management override of 

controls, common with all audits under 
ISAs (UK). 

As required by auditing standards and 
taking into account our overall knowledge 
of the control environment, we performed 
procedures to address the above risks, the 
risk that Group and component 
management may be in a position to make 
inappropriate accounting entries and the 
risk of bias in accounting estimates and 
judgements. On this audit, we have not 
identified a significant risk of fraud related 
to revenue recognition for the Group as a 
whole. However, we have identified a fraud 
risk in relation to revenue recognition 
within some of the individual components.

Our audit procedures included evaluating 
the design and implementation and 
operating effectiveness of relevant 
internal controls, assessing significant 
accounting estimates for bias, as well as 
substantive procedures to address the 
fraud risks.

These procedures also included identifying 
journal entries to test based on risk criteria 
and comparing the identified entries to 
supporting documentation. 

Incorporating unpredictability into our audit: 
A requirement of the auditing standards is 
that we undertake procedures which are 
deliberately unexpected and could not 
have reasonably been predicted by 
Barclays’ management.  
As an example, we update our criteria for 
selecting journals with a higher risk of 
management override for testing each 
year so that the selection criteria do not 
become predictable. Outside of journals,  
for a selection of fair value financial 
instruments, we performed intra-month 
independent re-pricing to incorporate an 
element of unpredictability in our audit 
procedures. 
Link to key audit matters

Further details of the testing we perform 
over the identified fraud risks for ECL and 
fair value of financial instruments are 
included in the respective key audit 
matters sections 4.1 and 4.2 of this report, 
as the procedures relating to those 
estimates also address the risk of fraud.  
Laws and regulations - identifying and 
responding to risks of material 
misstatement due to non-compliance 
with laws and regulations
Risk assessment 

We identified areas of laws and regulations 
that could reasonably be expected to have 
a material effect on the financial 
statements. For this risk assessment, 
matters considered include the following:

• our general commercial and sector 

experience;

• inquiries with the directors and other 
management (as required by auditing 
standards);

• inspection of the Group’s key regulatory 

and legal correspondence;

• inspection of the policies and 

procedures regarding compliance with 
laws and regulations;

• relevant discussions with the Group’s 

external legal counsel; 

• relevant discussions with the Group’s 

key regulatory supervisors including the 
Prudential Regulation Authority, 
Financial Conduct Authority, Federal 
Reserve Board, Federal Deposit 
Insurance Corporation and the Joint 
Supervisory Team; and

• the Group’s own assessment of the 

risks of non-compliance with laws and 
regulations, and the internal controls 
established to mitigate these. This 
assessment was considered and 
approved by the Board.

to the members of Barclays PLC (continued)

Most significant indirect law/
regulation areas

Secondly, the Group is subject to many 
other laws and regulations where the 
consequences of non-compliance could 
have a material effect on amounts or 
disclosures in the financial statements, for 
instance through the imposition of fines, 
remediation payments or litigation, or the 
loss of the Group’s permission to operate 
in countries where the non-adherence to 
laws could prevent trading in such 
countries.  

We identified the following areas as those 
most likely to have such an effect:

• Specific aspects of regulatory capital 

and liquidity requirements

• Other banking laws and regulations, 
including securities issuance law

• Customer conduct rules

• Money laundering

• Sanctions list and financial crime

• Market abuse regulations

• Certain aspects of companies legislation 
recognising the financial and regulated 
nature of the Group’s activities. 

Auditing standards limit the required audit 
procedures to identify non-compliance 
with these laws and regulations to enquiry 
of the directors and other management 
and inspection of regulatory and legal 
correspondence, if any. If a breach of 
operational regulations is not disclosed to 
us or evident from relevant 
correspondence, an audit will not detect 
that breach.    

Our risk assessment also considered 
instances of non-compliance with laws and 
regulations and enforcement actions 
against the Group during the year and 
specifically those that could reasonably be 
expected to have a material effect on the 
financial statements. 

As the Group operates in a highly regulated 
environment, our assessment of risks of 
material misstatement also considered the 
control environment, including the Group’s 
higher-level procedures for complying with 
regulatory requirements.  Our assessment 
included inspection of key frameworks, 
policies and standards in place, 
understanding and evaluating the role of 
the compliance function in establishing 
these and monitoring compliance and 
testing of related controls around 
whistleblowing and complaints.
Risk communication

Our identified laws and regulations risks 
was communicated throughout our team 
and we remained alert to any indications of 
non-compliance throughout the audit. 
This included communication from the 
Group to component audit teams of 
relevant laws and regulations identified at 
Group level.
Direct laws context and link to audit

The potential effect of these laws and 
regulations on the financial statements 
varies considerably.

Firstly, the Group is subject to laws and 
regulations that directly impact the 
financial statements including:

• financial reporting legislation (including 

related companies’ legislation);

• distributable profits legislation; and

• taxation legislation (direct and indirect). 

We assessed the extent of compliance 
with these laws and regulations as part of 
our procedures on the related financial 
statement items.  

Audit response

In relation to the legal, competition and 
regulatory matters disclosed in note 25 we 
performed audit procedures which 
included making enquiries of Barclays’ 
internal counsel and inspection of minutes 
of meetings and of regulatory 
correspondence. For a subset of these 
matters which we deemed to be more 
significant we also made enquiries of 
external counsel and obtained legal 
confirmations from Barclays’ external 
counsel. 

In respect of regulatory matters relating to 
conduct risk as disclosed in note 25 our 
procedures included inspection of 
regulatory correspondence, independent 
enquiry of the Group’s main regulators and 
performing audit procedures to respond to 
risks of material misstatement identified in 
recognised conduct provisions.
Context of the ability of the audit to 
detect fraud or breaches of law or 
regulation

Owing to the inherent limitations of an 
audit, there is an unavoidable risk that we 
may not have detected some material 
misstatements in the financial statements, 
even though we have properly planned and 
performed our audit in accordance with 
auditing standards.  For example, the 
further removed non-compliance with 
laws and regulations is from the events and 
transactions reflected in the financial 
statements, the less likely the inherently 
limited procedures required by auditing 
standards would identify it.  

In addition, as with any audit, there 
remained a higher risk of non-detection of 
fraud, as these may involve collusion, 
forgery, intentional omissions, 
misrepresentations, or the override of 
internal controls. Our audit procedures are 
designed to detect material misstatement. 
We are not responsible for preventing 
non-compliance or fraud and cannot be 
expected to detect non-compliance with 
all laws and regulations.

6. Our determination of 
materiality

The scope of our audit was influenced by 
our application of materiality. We set 
quantitative thresholds and overlay 
qualitative considerations to help us 
determine the scope of our audit and the 
nature, timing and extent of our 
procedures, and in evaluating the effect of 
misstatements, both individually and in the 
aggregate, on the financial statements as a 
whole. 
Materiality for the financial statements 
as a whole 
2023: £350m 2022: £275m
What we mean

A quantitative reference for the purpose of 
planning and performing our audit  
Basis for determining materiality and 
judgements applied

We have determined overall materiality for 
the Barclays PLC Group to be £350m 
(FY22: £275m). 

We determined that profit before tax (PBT) 
remains the key benchmark for the 
Barclays PLC Group. We selected PBT as 
the benchmark because it is the metric in 
the primary statements which best 
reflects the focus of the users of the 
financial statements. During FY23, 
Barclays PLC took actions that resulted in 
significant additional costs of £927m in Q4 
as disclosed in note 7. These are one-off 
costs to help drive future returns. Given 
the nature of these costs, we normalised 
PBT by adding back these items because 
they do not represent the normal, 
continuing operations of the Group. As 
such, for FY23 we based our Group 
materiality on Group normalised PBT of 
£7,484m (2022: £7,012m).

Our Group materiality of £350m (2022: 
£275m) was determined by applying a 
percentage to normalised PBT. When 
using a profit-related measure to 
determine overall materiality, KPMG’s 
approach is to apply a percentage between 
3% and 5% to the measure. In setting 
overall materiality, we applied a percentage 
of 4.7% (2022: 3.9%) of the benchmark.  

Materiality for the parent company 
financial statements as a whole was set at 
£170m (2022: £100m), which is the 
component materiality for the parent 
company determined by the group audit 
engagement team. This is lower than the 
materiality we would otherwise have 
determined with reference to a benchmark 
of net assets of which it represents 0.3% 
(FY22: 0.2%).
Performance materiality 
2023: £227m 2022: £179m
What we mean

Our procedures on individual account 
balances and disclosures were performed 
to a lower threshold, performance 
materiality, so as to reduce, to an 
acceptable level, the risk that individually 
immaterial misstatements in individual 
account balances add up to a material 
amount across the financial statements as 
a whole.
Basis for determining performance 
materiality and judgements applied

We have considered performance 
materiality at a level of 65% (2022: 65%) of 
materiality for Barclays PLC Group’s 
financial statements as a whole to be 
appropriate. 

The Parent Company performance 
materiality was set at £110m (FY22: £65m) 
which equates to 65% (FY22: 65%) of 
materiality for the Parent Company 
financial statements as a whole.

We applied this percentage in our 
determination of performance materiality 
based on the level of control deficiencies 
during the prior period.
Audit misstatement posting threshold 
2023: £17m 2022: £13m
What we mean

This is the amount below which identified 
misstatements are considered to be 
clearly trivial from a quantitative point of 
view. We may become aware of 
differences below this threshold which 
could alter the nature, timing and scope of 
our audit procedures, for example if we 
identify smaller differences which are 
indicators of fraud. 

This is also the amount above which all 
differences identified are communicated 
to Barclays PLC’s Board Audit Committee.
Basis for determining the audit 
misstatement reporting threshold and 
judgements applied

The audit misstatement posting threshold 
has been set at a level of 5% (2022: 5%) of 
materiality for Barclays PLC’s Group 
financial statements.  

We also report to the Audit Committee 
any other identified misstatements that 
warrant reporting on qualitative grounds. 

The overall materiality for the Group financial statements of £350m (2022: £275m) compares as follows to the other main financial 
statement elements amounts.

7. The scope of our audit

Group scope 
What we mean

How the Group audit team determined the 
procedures to be performed across the 
Group.

We have subjected four (2022: four) of the 
Group’s components to full scope audits 
for Group purposes. Our approach to 
scoping the four components was as 
follows:

• For two components, Barclays Bank UK 
PLC and Barclays Execution Services 
Limited Solus, we directly instructed the 
component audit teams to conduct and 
report to us on full scope audits in 2023 
and 2022;

• The third component, Barclays PLC 

Solus was subject to a full scope audit by 
us in 2023 and 2022; and

• The fourth component, Barclays Bank 
PLC sub-group, was subject to a full 
scope audit by us in 2023 and 2022, as 
detailed below. 

In addition, the group has a large number 
of other components, and we performed 
specified, risk-focused audit procedures 
over some account balances selected 
from amongst those components. The 
components over which we performed 
work represented 0.19% (2022: 7.68%) of 
Barclays PLC Group’s total income and 
0.26% (2022: 0.24%) of the Group’s total 
assets.

Within the Barclays Bank PLC sub-group 
we specified components as follows: 

• Barclays Bank Solus to be subject to a 

full scope audit carried out by us in 2023 
and 2022; 

• Barclays Bank Delaware and Barclays 

Capital Inc to be subject to a full scope 
audit as instructed by us in 2023 and 
2022; and 

• Barclays Bank Ireland PLC and Barclays 
Capital Securities Limited to be subject 
to an audit of certain account balances 
as instructed by us in 2023 and 2022. 

The components within the scope of our 
work accounted for the percentages 
illustrated in section 2 – Group scope.

Barclays PLC has centralised certain 
Group-wide processes in a shared service 
centre in India, the outputs of which are 
included in the financial information of the 
reporting components it services and 
therefore it is not a separate reporting 
component. This service centre is subject 
to specified audit procedures, 
predominantly the testing of transaction 
processing, reconciliations and review 
controls. Additional procedures are 
performed at certain reporting 
components to address the audit risks not 
covered by the work performed by the 
shared service centre.

The Group audit team has also performed 
certain audit procedures on the following 
areas on behalf of relevant components: 

• Testing of IT systems and automated 

business controls; and

• Operating expenses and Group 

recharges.

The Group team communicated the 
results of these procedures to the 
applicable component teams. 

In addition, we have performed Group level 
analysis on the remaining components to 
determine whether further risks of material 
misstatement exist in those components.

We were able to rely upon the Group's 
internal control over financial reporting in 
all areas of our audit, and where our 
controls testing supported this approach, 
which enabled us to reduce the scope of 
our substantive audit work.
Group audit team oversight
What we mean

The extent of the Group audit team’s 
involvement in component audits. 

A hybrid communication and oversight 
strategy was implemented between the 
Group audit team and the components 
during the year.  This included: 

• A global planning conference held in 

London and led by the Group audit team 
to discuss key audit risks and obtain 
input from component teams and other 
participating locations.

• The components in scope for Group 

reporting purposes were either visited 
by the Group audit team to assess the 
audit risk and strategy, or such review 
occurred remotely. Throughout the 
audit, we inspected the components’ 
key working papers to understand and 
challenge the audit approach and audit 
findings of each component, the 
findings reported to the Group team 
were discussed in more detail, and any 
further work required by the Group team 
was then performed by the component 
auditors.

• Instructions issued by the Group audit 

team to component auditors setting out 
the significant areas to be covered, 
including the relevant key audit matters 
identified above and the information to 
be reported back to the Group audit 
team. For example, minimum criteria for 
high-risk journals were set by the Group 
team and applied consistently across 
the audit.

• Review and approval by the Group audit 
team of the component materiality for 
all components.

• Risk assessment and challenge sessions 
with each component audit team were 
held in the planning, interim and final 
phases of the audit, led by the Group 
lead engagement partner and audit 
quality partner. 

• Monthly video conferences with the 

partners and directors of the Group and 
component audit teams along with 
regular ad hoc contact in person and via 
video calls and email exchanges to 
challenge the component audit 
approach and findings.

• Stuart Crisp, the Group Lead 

Engagement Partner (and Senior 
Statutory Auditor), attended each Board 
Audit Committee and Board Risk 
Committee for Barclays PLC and 
Barclays Bank PLC and at least one 
Board Audit Committee for Barclays 
Bank UK, Barclays Bank Europe, and the 
IHC covering Barclays Capital Inc. and 
Barclays Bank Delaware.

The materiality levels applied to the audits 
of the components of Barclays PLC are as 
follows:

consider that the annual report and 
financial statements taken as a whole is 
fair, balanced and understandable, and 
provides the information necessary for 
shareholders to assess the Group’s 
position and performance, business 
model and strategy;

9. Respective responsibilities  

Directors’ responsibilities  

As explained more fully in their statement 
set out on page 190, the Directors are 
responsible for: the preparation of the 
financial statements including being 
satisfied that they give a true and fair view; 
such internal control as they determine is 
necessary to enable the preparation of 
financial statements that are free from 
material misstatement, whether due to 
fraud or error; assessing the Group and 
Parent Company’s ability to continue as a 
going concern, disclosing, as applicable, 
matters related to going concern; and 
using the going concern basis of 
accounting unless they either intend to 
liquidate the Group or the parent Company 
or to cease operations, or have no realistic 
alternative but to do so.    
Auditor’s responsibilities   

Our objectives are to obtain reasonable 
assurance about whether the financial 
statements as a whole are free from 
material misstatement, whether due to 
fraud or error, and to issue our opinion in 
an auditor’s report.  Reasonable assurance 
is a high level of assurance but does not 
guarantee that an audit conducted in 
accordance with ISAs (UK) will always 
detect a material misstatement when it 
exists.  Misstatements can arise from fraud 
or error and are considered material if, 
individually or in aggregate, they could 
reasonably be expected to influence the 
economic decisions of users taken on the 
basis of the financial statements.  

A fuller description of our responsibilities is 
provided on the FRC’s website at 
frc.org.uk/auditorsresponsibilities.  

The Company is required to include these 
financial statements in an annual financial 
report prepared using the single electronic 
reporting format specified in the TD ESEF 
Regulation.  The auditor’s report provides 
no assurance over whether the financial 
report has been prepared in accordance 
with that format.

Note

1 Issuance of debt securities and Redemption of debt securities included in financing activities relate to instruments that qualify as eligible liabilities and satisfy regulatory requirements for 

MREL instruments which came into effect during 2019.  Refer to Note 1, paragraph 4(vi), for further details. 

Interest received was  £62,298m (2022: £40,975m; 2021: £17,194m) and interest paid was £48,246m (2022: £28,709m; 2021: £8,063m).  These amounts include interest paid and received 
arising from trading activities. Dividends received were £0m (2022: £31m; 2021: £20m). The Group is required to maintain balances with central banks and other regulatory authorities.  
These amounted to £3,758m (2022: £3,457m; 2021: £4,750m) and are included within the Cash and cash equivalents. For the purposes of the cash flow statement, cash comprises cash on 
hand and demand deposits and cash equivalents comprise highly liquid investments that are convertible into cash with an insignificant risk of changes in value with original maturities of 
three months or less. Repurchase and reverse repurchase agreements are not considered to be part of cash equivalents.

Barclays PLC

Annual Report 2023 421

Notes to the financial statements

For the year ended 31 December 2023

This section describes the Group’s material policies and critical accounting estimates that relate to the financial statements and notes 
as a whole. If an accounting policy or a critical accounting estimate relates to a particular note, the accounting policy and/or critical 
accounting estimate is contained with the relevant note.
1 Material accounting policies

1. Reporting entity

Barclays PLC is a public company limited by shares registered in England under company number 48839, having its registered office at 1 
Churchill Place, London, E14 5HP.

These financial statements are prepared for Barclays PLC and its subsidiaries (the Group) under Section 399 of the Companies Act 
2006. The Group is a major global financial services provider engaged in retail banking, credit cards, wholesale banking, investment 
banking, wealth management and investment management services. In addition, separate financial statements have been presented 
for the holding company. 
2. Compliance with International Financial Reporting Standards

The consolidated financial statements of the Group, and the separate financial statements of Barclays PLC, have been prepared in 
accordance with UK-adopted international accounting standards. 

The consolidated financial statements of the Group, and the separate financial statements of Barclays PLC, have also been prepared in 
accordance with International Financial Reporting Standards (IFRS) as issued by the International Accounting Standards Board (IASB), 
including interpretations issued by the IFRS Interpretations Committee, as there are no applicable differences from IFRS as issued by 
the IASB for the periods presented.

The principal accounting policies applied in the preparation of the consolidated and separate financial statements are set out below, and 
in the relevant notes to the financial statements. These policies have been consistently applied, with the exception of International Tax 
Reform-Pillar Two Model Rules (Amendments to IAS 12), which is effective from 1 January 2023 and applies retrospectively; and the 
Disclosure of Accounting Policies (Amendments to IAS 1 and IFRS Practice Statement 2), and Definition of an Accounting Estimate 
(Amendments to IAS 8) which were applied from 1 January 2023.
3. Basis of preparation

The consolidated and separate financial statements have been prepared under the historical cost convention modified to include the 
fair valuation of investment property, and particular financial instruments, to the extent required or permitted under IFRS as set out in 
the relevant accounting policies. These financial statements are stated in millions of Pounds Sterling (£m), the functional currency of 
Barclays PLC.

The financial statements have been prepared for Barclays PLC and its subsidiaries (the Group) under Section 399 of the Companies Act 
2006 as applicable to companies using IFRS. The financial statements are prepared on a going concern basis, as the Board is satisfied 
that the Group and the parent company have the resources to continue in business for a period of at least 12 months from approval of 
the financial statements. 

In making this assessment, the Board has considered a wide range of information relating to present and future conditions and includes 
a review of a working capital report (WCR). The WCR is used by the Board to assess the future performance of the Group and that it has 
the resources in place that are required to meet its ongoing regulatory requirements. The assessment is based upon business plans 
which contain future projections of profitability taken from the Group’s medium-term plan as well as projections of regulatory capital 
requirements and business funding needs. The WCR also includes an assessment of the impact of internally generated stress testing 
scenarios on the liquidity and capital requirement forecasts. The stress tests used were based upon an assessment of reasonably 
possible downside economic scenarios that the Group could experience.  Further details are set out in the Viability statement on 
page 54.

The WCR showed that the Group had sufficient capital and liquidity in place to support its future business requirements and remained 
above its regulatory minimum requirements in the stress scenarios. Accordingly, the Directors concluded that there was a reasonable 
expectation that the Group and parent company has adequate resources to continue as a going concern for a period of at least 12 
months from the date of approval of the financial statements.
4. Accounting policies

The Group prepares financial statements in accordance with IFRS. The Group’s material accounting policies relating to specific financial 
statement items, together with a description of the accounting estimates and judgements that were critical to preparing those items, 
are set out under the relevant notes. Accounting policies that affect the financial statements as a whole are set out below.
(i) Consolidation

The consolidated financial statements combine the financial statements of Barclays PLC and all its subsidiaries. Subsidiaries are entities 
over which Barclays PLC has control. The Group has control over another entity when the Group has all of the following:

1) power over the relevant activities of the investee, for example through voting or other rights

2) exposure to, or rights to, variable returns from its involvement with the investee, and

3) the ability to affect those returns through its power over the investee.

As the consolidated financial statements include partnerships where the Group member is a partner, advantage has been taken of the 
exemption under Regulation 7 of the Partnership (Accounts) Regulations 2008 with regard to preparing and filing of individual 
partnership financial statements.

Transactions in foreign currencies are translated into Sterling at the rate ruling on the date of the transaction. Foreign currency 
monetary balances are translated into Sterling at the period end exchange rates. Exchange gains and losses on such balances are taken 
to the income statement.

The Group’s foreign operations (including subsidiaries, joint ventures, associates and branches) based mainly outside the UK may have 
different functional currencies. The functional currency of an operation is the currency of the main economy to which it is exposed.

Prior to consolidation (or equity accounting) the assets and liabilities of non-Sterling operations are translated at the period end 
exchange rate and items of income, expense and other comprehensive income are translated into Sterling at the rate on the date of 
the transactions. Exchange differences arising on the translation of foreign operations are included in currency translation reserves 
within equity. These are transferred to the income statement when the Group disposes of the entire interest in a foreign operation, 
when partial disposal results in the loss of control of an interest in a subsidiary, when an investment previously accounted for using the 
equity method is accounted for as a financial asset, or on the disposal of a foreign operation within a branch.
(iii) Financial assets and liabilities
Recognition

The Group recognises financial assets and liabilities when it becomes a party to the terms of the contract. Trade date or settlement 
date accounting is applied depending on the classification of the financial asset.
Classification and measurement

Financial assets are classified on the basis of two criteria:

i) the business model within which financial assets are managed, and

ii) their contractual cash flow characteristics (whether the cash flows represent ‘solely payments of principal and interest’ (SPPI)).

The Group assesses the business model criteria at a portfolio level. Information that is considered in determining the applicable 
business model includes (i) policies and objectives for the relevant portfolio, (ii) how the performance and risks of the portfolio are 
managed, evaluated and reported to management, and (iii) the frequency, volume and timing of sales in prior periods, sales expectation 
for future periods, and the reasons for such sales.

The contractual cash flow characteristics of financial assets are assessed with reference to whether the cash flows represent SPPI. 
Terms that could change the contractual cash flows so that it would not meet the condition for SPPI are considered, including: (i) 
contingent and leverage features, (ii) non-recourse arrangements, (iii) features that could modify the time value of money, and (iv) 
Social, Environmental and Sustainability-linked features. Terms with de minimis impact do not preclude cash flows from representing 
SPPI.

The accounting policy for each type of financial asset or liability is included within the relevant note for the item. The Group’s policies for 
determining the fair values of the assets and liabilities are set out in Note 17.
Derecognition

The Group derecognises a financial asset, or a portion of a financial asset, from its balance sheet where (i) the contractual rights to cash 
flows from the asset have expired, or (ii) the contractual rights to cash flows from the asset have been transferred (usually by sale) and  
with them either (a) substantially all the risks and rewards of the asset have been transferred, or (b) where neither substantially all the 
risks and reward have been transferred or retained, where control over the asset has been lost. 

Financial liabilities are derecognised when the liability has been settled, has expired or has been extinguished. An exchange of an existing 
financial liability for a new liability with the same lender on substantially different terms – generally a difference of 10% or more in the 
present value of the cash flows or a substantive qualitative amendment – is accounted for as an extinguishment of the original financial 
liability and the recognition of a new financial liability.

It may not be obvious whether substantially all of the risks and rewards of a transferred asset, or portion of an asset, have been 
transferred. It is often necessary to perform a quantitative analysis that compares the Group's exposure to variability in asset cash flows 
before the transfer with its retained exposure after the transfer. A cash flow analysis of this nature may require judgement. In particular, 
it is necessary to estimate the asset’s expected future cash flows as well as potential variability around this expectation. The method of 
estimating expected future cash flows depends on the nature of the asset, with market and market-implied data used to the greatest 
extent possible. The potential variability around this expectation is typically determined by stressing underlying parameters to create 
reasonable alternative upside and downside scenarios. Probabilities are then assigned to each scenario. Stressed parameters may 
include default rates, loss severity, or prepayment rates.
Accounting for reverse repurchase and repurchase agreements including other similar lending and borrowing

Reverse repurchase agreements (and stock borrowing or similar transactions) are a form of secured lending whereby the Group 
provides a loan or cash collateral in exchange for the transfer of collateral, generally in the form of marketable securities subject to an 
agreement to transfer the securities back at a fixed price in the future. Repurchase agreements are where the Group obtains such loans 
or cash collateral, in exchange for the transfer of collateral.

The Group purchases (a reverse repurchase agreement) or borrows securities subject to a commitment to resell or return them. The 
securities are not included in the balance sheet as the Group does not acquire the risks and rewards of ownership. Consideration paid 
(or cash collateral provided) is accounted for as a loan asset at amortised cost, unless it is designated or mandatorily at fair value 
through profit and loss.

Notes to the financial statements (continued)
For the year ended 31 December 2023

The Group may also sell (a repurchase agreement) or lend securities subject to a commitment to repurchase or redeem them. The 
securities are retained on the balance sheet as the Group retains substantially all the risks and rewards of ownership. Consideration 
received (or cash collateral provided) is accounted for as a financial liability at amortised cost, unless it is designated at fair value through 
profit and loss.
(iv) Issued debt and equity instruments

Issued financial instruments or their components are classified as liabilities if the contractual arrangement results in the Group having an 
obligation to either deliver cash or another financial asset, or a variable number of equity shares, to the holder of the instrument. If this is 
not the case, the instrument is generally an equity instrument and the proceeds included in equity, net of transaction costs. Dividends 
and other returns to equity holders are recognised when paid or declared by the members at the Annual General Meeting and treated 
as a deduction from equity.

Where issued financial instruments contain both liability and equity components, these are accounted for separately. The fair value of 
the debt is estimated first and the balance of the proceeds is included within equity.
(v) Cash flow statement

Cash comprises cash on hand and balances at central banks. Cash equivalents comprise loans and advances to banks, cash collateral 
balances with central banks related to payment schemes and treasury and other eligible bills, all with original maturities of three months 
or less.

Investments in debt securities at amortised cost, presented within loans and advances on the balance sheet, are deemed to be 
investing activities for the purposes of the cash flow statement, except those instruments considered to be cash equivalents.  

Debt securities issued and redeemed are considered to be operating activities, except qualifying eligible liabilities that satisfy regulatory 
requirements for MREL instruments (or have previously satisfied these requirements since 2019 when they came into effect), which are 
considered to be financing activities.
5. New and amended standards and interpretations

The accounting policies adopted  have been consistently applied, with the exception of the following:
International Tax Reform—Pillar Two Model Rules (Amendments to IAS 12)

On 23 May 2023, the IASB issued amendments to IAS 12 to provide a mandatory temporary exemption to the requirements to account 
for deferred taxes assets and liabilities related to Pillar Two income taxes, as published by the Organisation for Economic Co-operation 
and Development (OECD).

The amendments are effective for accounting periods beginning on or after 1 January 2023 and the mandatory temporary exemption 
is applied retrospectively to prior periods.

Disclosures related to the amendments are made in Note 9 on page 434.
Disclosure of Accounting Policies (Amendments to IAS 1 and IFRS Practice Statement 2) 

The amendments require entities to disclose their material rather than their significant accounting policies.  The Group adopted the 
amendments effective 1 January 2023.  Whilst these amendments do not change the Group’s accounting policies, the Group has 
reviewed the accounting policy information disclosed in these financial statements against the new requirements.  

Under the amendments, accounting policy information is material if, when considered together with other information included in an 
entity’s financial statements, it can reasonably be expected to influence decisions that the primary users of general purpose financial 
statements make on the basis of those financial statements. 
Definition of an Accounting Estimate (Amendments to IAS 8)

Under the new definition, accounting estimates are clarified as monetary amounts in financial statements that are subject to 
measurement uncertainty. Where an entity's accounting policy requires an item to be measured at monetary amounts that cannot be 
observed directly, it should develop an accounting estimate to achieve this objective.  The amendments are effective 1 January 2023 
and were  adopted on this date. 
IFRS 17 – Insurance contracts

In May 2017, the IASB issued IFRS 17 Insurance Contracts, a comprehensive new accounting standard for insurance contracts covering 
recognition and measurement, presentation and disclosure. IFRS 17 has replaced IFRS 4 Insurance Contracts that was issued in 2005. 
In June 2020, the IASB published amendments to IFRS 17, to include scope exclusion for certain credit card contracts and similar 
contracts that provide insurance coverage, the optional scope exclusion for loan contracts that transfer significant insurance risk, and 
the clarification that only financial guarantees issued are in scope of IFRS 9. 

IFRS 17 applies to all types of insurance contracts (i.e. life, non-life, direct insurance and reinsurance), regardless of the type of entities 
that issue them, as well as to certain guarantees and financial instruments with discretionary participation features. A few scope 
exceptions apply. 

IFRS 17 was effective for accounting periods beginning on or after 1 January 2023 but the impact to the Group is not material.

Future accounting developments

The following accounting standards have been issued by the IASB but are not yet effective:
Classification of Liabilities as Current or Non-current (Amendments to IAS 1)

In January 2020 the IASB issued amendments to IAS 1 to clarify the presentation of liabilities in the balance sheet, with an effective date 
of 1 January 2024.

The amendments clarify that a liability should be classified as non-current only if the entity has the right to defer settlement of the 
liability for at least 12 months after the reporting period, and that (i) the right to defer settlement must exist at the end of the reporting 
period and (ii) management’s intentions or expectations about whether it will exercise its right to defer settlement does not affect the 
classification. Further clarifications include how lending conditions affect classification and classification of liabilities the entity will or 
may settle by issuing its own equity instruments. 

In October 2022, the IASB also issued further amendments to IAS 1 to improve the information an entity provides when its right to 
defer settlement of a liability for at least 12 months is subject to compliance with covenants, and to respond to stakeholders’ concerns 
about the classification of such a liability as current or non-current.
6. Critical accounting estimates and judgements

The preparation of financial statements in accordance with IFRS requires the use of estimates. It also requires management to exercise 
judgement in applying the accounting policies. The key areas involving a higher degree of judgement or complexity or areas where 
assumptions are significant to the consolidated and individual financial statements are highlighted under the relevant note. Critical 
accounting estimates and judgements are disclosed in:
▪ Credit impairment charges on page 431
▪ Tax on page 435
▪ Fair value of financial instruments on page 449
▪ Goodwill and intangible assets on page 466
▪ Pensions and post-retirement benefit obligations on page 485
▪ Provisions including conduct and legal, competition and regulatory matters on page 468.
7. Other disclosures

To improve transparency and ease of reference, by concentrating related information in one place, certain disclosures required under 
IFRS have been included within the Risk review section as follows:
▪ Credit risk on pages 276  to 277 and 291 to 335
▪ Market risk on page 278 and 336 to 337 
▪ Treasury and Capital risk – liquidity on page 278 to 279 and 339 to 349 
▪ Treasury and Capital risk – capital on page 279 and 350 to 356.
These disclosures are covered by the Audit opinion (included on pages 396 to 412) where referenced as audited.

Financial performance and returns

The notes included in this section focus on the results and performance of the Group. Information on the income generated, 
expenditure incurred, segmental performance, tax, earnings per share and dividends are included here. For further detail on 
performance, see income statement commentary within Financial Review (unaudited).
2 Segmental reporting

Presentation of segmental reporting

Operating segments are reported in a manner consistent with the internal reporting provided to the Executive Committee, which is 
responsible for allocating resources and assessing performance of the operating segments, and has been identified as the chief 
operating decision maker. All transactions between business segments are conducted on an arm’s-length basis, with intra-segment 
revenue and costs being eliminated in Head Office. Income and expenses directly associated with each segment are included in 
determining business segment performance.

The Group is a British universal bank diversified by business, geography and income type, serving consumer and wholesale customers 
and clients globally and for segmental reporting purposes it defines its two operating divisions as Barclays UK and Barclays International. 
▪ Barclays UK consists of our UK Personal Banking, UK Business Banking and Barclaycard Consumer UK businesses. These businesses 

are carried on by our UK ring-fenced bank (Barclays Bank UK PLC) and certain other entities within the Group. 

▪ Barclays International consists of our Corporate and Investment Bank and Consumer, Cards and Payments businesses. These 

businesses are carried on by our non ring-fenced bank (Barclays Bank PLC) and its subsidiaries, and certain other entities within the 
Group.

The below table also includes Head Office which comprises head office and legacy businesses, as well as the FTEs employed by Barclays 
Execution Services.

2 Barclays Execution Services Employees are reported within the Head Office Segment. Barclays UK transformed its business in 2021 and consolidated all Customer Care employees, 

who directly serve customers, into Barclays Execution Services to improve customer service and experience. Costs are recharged, while FTEs are reported within Head Office, as at 31 
December 2021 10,700 FTEs were impacted by the move from Barclays UK to Head Office.

Barclays PLC has announced on 20 February 2024 changes to the way that the business is being managed and it has published 
comparative financial information to reflect these changes to its segmental reporting which are effective from January 2024.

From Q124, the Group will present its financial disclosures through the following new segments:

• Barclays UK

• Barclays UK Corporate Bank

• Barclays Private Bank and Wealth Management

• Barclays Investment Bank

• Barclays US Consumer Bank

The previously reported Head office will additionally include the held for sale German consumer finance business and the merchant 
acquiring component on the Payments business both previously reported within Barclays International as part of CC&P.

Considering the revised segmentation in January 2024, our assessment has not led to any further financial impacts. These changes do 
not affect legal entities nor do they impact the Group’s previously reported consolidated financials. A copy of the resegmentation 
document is available at home.barclays/investor-relations/reports-and-events/financial-results/

Interest income on loans and advances at amortised cost and financial assets at fair value through other comprehensive income, and 
interest expense on financial liabilities held at amortised cost, are calculated using the effective interest method which allocates 
interest, and direct and incremental fees and costs, over the expected lives of the assets and liabilities.

The effective interest method requires the Group to estimate future cash flows, in some cases based on its experience of customers’ 
behaviour, considering all contractual terms of the financial instrument, as well as the expected lives of the assets and liabilities.

The Group incurs certain costs to originate credit card balances with the most significant being co-brand partner fees. To the extent 
these costs are attributed to customers that continuously carry an outstanding balance (revolvers) and incremental to the origination 
of credit card balances, they are capitalised and subsequently included within the calculation of the effective interest rate. They are 
amortised to interest income over the period of expected repayment of the originated balance. Costs attributed to customers that 
settle their outstanding balances each period (transactors) are deferred on the balance sheet as a cost of obtaining a contract and 
amortised to fee and commission expense over the life of the customer relationship (refer to Note 4). There are no other individual 
estimates involved in the calculation of effective interest rates that are material to the results or financial position.

4 Net fee and commission income

Accounting for net fee and commission income

The Group recognises fee and commission income charged for services provided by the Group as and when performance obligations 
are satisfied, for example, on completion of the underlying transaction. Incremental costs are reported within fee and commission 
expense if they are directly attributable to generating identifiable fee and commission income. Where the contractual arrangements 
also result in the Group recognising financial instruments in scope of IFRS 9, such financial instruments are initially recognised at fair 
value in accordance with IFRS 9 before applying the provisions of IFRS 15. 

Fee and commission income is disaggregated below by fee types that reflect the nature of the services offered across the Group and 
operating segments, in accordance with IFRS 15. The below table includes a total for fees in scope of IFRS 15. Refer to Note 2 for more 
detailed information about operating segments.

Fee types
Transactional

Transactional fees are service charges on deposit accounts, cash management services fees and transactional processing fees. These 
include interchange and merchant fee income generated from credit and bank card usage. Transaction and processing fees are 
recognised at the point in time the transaction occurs or service is performed. Interchange and merchant fees are recognised upon 
settlement of the card transaction payment.

The Group incurs certain card-related costs including those related to cardholder reward programmes and payments to co-brand 
partners. Cardholder reward programme costs related to customers that settle their outstanding balance each period (transactors) are 
expensed when incurred and presented in fee and commission expense, while costs related to customers that continuously carry an 
outstanding balance (revolvers) are included in the effective interest rate of the receivable (refer to Note 3). Payments to partners for 
new cardholder account originations related to transactor accounts are deferred as costs to obtain a contract under IFRS 15, while 
costs related to revolver accounts are included in the effective interest rate of the receivable (refer to Note 3). Those costs deferred 
under IFRS 15 are capitalised and amortised over the estimated life of the customer relationship. Payments to co-brand partners based 
on revenue sharing to the extent the revenue share relates to "revolvers" are included in the effective interest rate of the receivable and 
to the extent  revenue share relates  to “transactors”  it must be presented in fee and commission expense. Payments based on 
profitability are presented in fee and commission expense.
Advisory

Advisory fees are generated from wealth management services and investment banking advisory services related to mergers, 
acquisitions and financial restructurings. Wealth management advisory fees are earned over the period the services are provided and 
are generally recognised quarterly when the market value of client assets is determined. Investment banking advisory fees are 
recognised at the point in time when the services related to the transaction have been completed under the terms of the engagement. 
Investment banking advisory costs are recognised as incurred in fee and commission expense if direct and incremental to the advisory 
services or are otherwise recognised in operating expenses.
Brokerage and execution

Brokerage and execution fees are earned for executing client transactions with various exchanges and over-the-counter markets and 
assisting clients in clearing transactions and facilitating foreign exchange transactions for spot/forward contracts. Brokerage and 
execution fees are recognised at the point in time the associated service has been completed which is generally the trade date of the 
transaction.
Underwriting and syndication

Underwriting and syndication fees are earned for the distribution of client equity or debt securities and the arrangement and 
administration of a loan syndication. This includes commitment fees to provide loan financing. Underwriting fees are generally 
recognised on trade date if there is no remaining contingency, such as the transaction being conditional on the closing of an acquisition 
or another transaction. Underwriting costs are deferred and recognised in fee and commission expense when the associated 
underwriting fees are recorded. Syndication fees are earned for arranging and administering a loan syndication; however, the associated 
fee may be subject to variability until the loan has been syndicated to other syndicate members or until other contingencies have been 
resolved and therefore the fee revenue is deferred until the uncertainty is resolved.

Included in the underwriting and syndication fees are loan commitment fees, when the drawdown is not probable. Such commitment 
fees are recognised over time through to the contractual maturity of the commitment.
Contract assets and contract liabilities

The Group had no material contract assets or contract liabilities as at 31 December 2023 (2022: £nil; 2021: £nil).
Impairment of fee receivables and contract assets

During 2023, there have been no material impairments recognised in relation to fees receivable and contract assets (2022: £nil; 2021: 
£nil). Fees in relation to transactional business can be added to outstanding customer balances. These amounts may be subsequently 
impaired as part of the overall loans and advances balance.
Remaining performance obligations

The Group applies the practical expedient of IFRS 15 and does not disclose information about remaining performance obligations that 
have original expected durations of one year or less or because the Group has a right to consideration that corresponds directly with 
the value of the service provided to the client or customer. 
Costs incurred in obtaining or fulfilling a contract

The Group expects that incremental costs of obtaining a contract such as success fee and commission fees paid are recoverable and 
therefore capitalise such  contract  costs.  Capitalised contract costs net of amortisation as at 31 December 2023 are £217m (2022: 
£198m; 2021: £154m). 

Capitalised contract costs are amortised over the customer relationship period depending on the transfer of services to which the 
asset pertains. In 2023, the amount of amortisation was £55m (2022: £47m; 2021: £36m) and there was no impairment loss recognised 
in connection with the capitalised contract costs (2022: £nil; 2021: £nil).

5 Net trading income

Accounting for net trading income

Trading positions are held at fair value, and the resulting gains and losses are included in  net trading income, together with interest and 
dividends arising from long and short positions and funding costs relating to trading activities. Incremental costs are reported within net 
trading income if they are directly attributable to generating identifiable trading income.

Income arises from both the sale and purchase of trading positions, margins which are achieved through market-making and customer 
business and from changes in fair value caused by movements in interest and exchange rates, equity prices and other market variables.

Gains or losses on non-trading financial instruments designated or mandatorily at fair value with changes in fair value recognised in the 
income statement are included in net trading income.

 8 Credit impairment charges/(releases)

Accounting for the impairment of financial assets
Impairment

The Group is required to recognise expected credit losses (ECLs) based on unbiased forward-looking information for all financial assets 
at amortised cost, lease receivables, debt financial assets at fair value through other comprehensive income, loan commitments and 
financial guarantee contracts. 

At the reporting date, an allowance (or provision for loan commitments and financial guarantees) is required for the 12 month (Stage 1) 
ECLs. If the credit risk has significantly increased since initial recognition (Stage 2), or if the financial instrument is credit impaired (Stage 
3), an allowance (or provision) should be recognised for the lifetime ECLs. 

The measurement of ECL is calculated using three main components: (i) probability of default (PD) (ii) loss given default (LGD) and (iii) 
the exposure at default (EAD).  

The 12 month and lifetime ECLs are calculated by multiplying the respective PD, LGD and the EAD. The 12 month and lifetime PDs 
represent the PD occurring over the next 12 months and the remaining maturity of the instrument respectively. The EAD represents 
the expected balance at default, taking into account the repayment of principal and interest from the balance sheet date to the default 
event together with any expected drawdowns of committed facilities. The LGD represents expected losses on the EAD given the event 
of default, taking into account, among other attributes, the mitigating effect of collateral value at the time it is expected to be realised 
and the time value of money.  

Expected credit loss measurement is based on the ability of borrowers to make payments as they fall due. The Group also considers 
sector-specific risks and whether additional adjustments are required in the measurement of ECL. Credit risk may be impacted by 
climate considerations for certain sectors, such as oil and gas.

Determining a significant increase in credit risk since initial recognition:

The Group assesses when a significant increase in credit risk has occurred based on quantitative and qualitative assessments. The 
credit risk of an exposure is considered to have significantly increased when:
i) Quantitative test

The annualised lifetime PD has increased by more than an agreed threshold relative to the equivalent at origination.

PD deterioration thresholds are defined as percentage increases, and are set at an origination score band and segment level to ensure 
the test appropriately captures significant increases in credit risk at all risk levels. Generally, thresholds are inversely correlated to the 
origination PD, i.e. as the origination PD increases, the threshold value reduces.

The assessment of the point at which a PD increase is deemed ‘significant’, is based upon analysis of the portfolio’s risk profile against a 
common set of principles and performance metrics (consistent across both retail and wholesale businesses), incorporating expert 
credit judgement where appropriate. Application of quantitative PD floors does not represent the use of the low credit risk exemption 
as exposures can separately move into Stage 2 via the qualitative route described below. 

Wholesale assets apply a 100% increase in PD and 0.2% PD floor to determine a significant increase in credit risk.

Retail assets apply bespoke relative increase and absolute PD thresholds based on product type and origination PD. Thresholds are 
subject to maximums defined by Group policy and typically apply minimum relative thresholds of 50-100% and a maximum relative 
threshold of 400%.

Annual Report 2023 432

Notes to the financial statements (continued)
For the year ended 31 December 2023

For existing/historical exposures where origination point scores or data are no longer available or do not represent a comparable 
estimate of lifetime PD, a proxy origination score is defined, based upon: 

• back-population of the approved lifetime PD score either to origination date or, where this is not feasible, as far back as possible 

(subject to a data start point no later than 1 January 2015); or

• use of available historical account performance data and other customer information, to derive a comparable ‘proxy’ estimation of 

origination PD.
ii) Qualitative test

This is relevant for accounts that meet the portfolio’s ‘high risk’ criteria and are subject to closer credit monitoring.

High risk customers may not be in arrears but either through an event or an observed behaviour exhibit credit distress. The definition 
and assessment of high risk includes as wide a range of information as reasonably available, such as industry and Group-wide customer 
level data, including but not limited to bureau scores and high consumer indebtedness index, wherever possible or relevant.

Whilst the high risk populations applied for IFRS 9 impairment purposes are aligned with risk management processes, they are also 
regularly reviewed and validated to ensure that they capture any incremental segments where there is evidence of credit deterioration.
iii) Backstop criteria

This is relevant for accounts that are more than 30 calendar days past due. The 30 days past due criteria is a backstop rather than a 
primary driver of moving exposures into Stage 2.

The criteria for determining a significant increase in credit risk for assets with bullet repayments follows the same principle as all other 
assets, i.e. quantitative, qualitative and backstop tests are all applied.

Exposures will move back to Stage 1 once they no longer meet the criteria for a significant increase in credit risk. This means that, at a 
minimum all payments must be up-to-date, the PD deterioration test is no longer met, the account is no longer classified as high risk, 
and the customer has evidenced an ability to maintain future payments. 

Exposures are only removed from Stage 3 and reassigned to Stage 2 once the original default trigger event no longer applies. 
Exposures being removed from Stage 3 must no longer qualify as credit impaired, and:

a) the obligor will also have demonstrated consistently good payment behaviour over a 12-month period, by making all consecutive 
contractual payments due and, for forborne exposures, the relevant EBA defined probationary period has also been successfully 
completed or;

b) (for non-forborne exposures) the performance conditions are defined and approved within an appropriately sanctioned restructure 

plan, including 12 months’ payment history have been met.

Management overlays and other exceptions to model outputs are applied only if consistent with the objective of identifying significant 
increases in credit risk.
Forward-looking information

The measurement of ECL involves complexity and judgement, including estimation of PD, LGD, a range of unbiased future economic 
scenarios, estimation of expected lives (where contractual life is not appropriate), and estimation of EAD and assessing significant 
increases in credit risk.

Credit losses are the expected cash shortfalls from what is contractually due over the expected life of the financial instrument, 
discounted at the original effective interest rate (EIR). ECLs are the unbiased probability-weighted credit losses determined by 
evaluating a range of possible outcomes and considering future economic conditions.

Refer to the Measurement uncertainty and sensitivity analysis section on page 311 for further details. 
Definition of default, credit impaired assets, write-offs, and interest income recognition

The definition of default for the purpose of determining ECLs, and for internal credit risk management purposes, has been aligned to 
the Regulatory Capital CRR Article 178 definition of default, to maintain a consistent approach with IFRS 9 and associated regulatory 
guidance. The Regulatory Capital CRR Article 178 definition of default considers indicators that the debtor is unlikely to pay, includes 
exposures in forbearance and is no later than when the exposure is more than 90 days past due. When exposures are identified as credit 
impaired at the time when they are purchased or originated, interest income is calculated on the carrying value net of the impairment 
allowance.

An asset is considered credit impaired when one or more events occur that have a detrimental impact on the estimated future cash 
flows of the financial asset. This comprises assets defined as defaulted and other individually assessed exposures where imminent 
default or actual loss is identified.

Uncollectable loans are written off against the related allowance for loan impairment on completion of the Group’s internal processes 
and when all reasonably expected recoverable amounts have been collected. Subsequent recoveries of amounts previously written off 
are credited to the income statement. The timing and extent of write-offs may involve some element of subjective judgement. 
Nevertheless, a write-off will often be prompted by a specific event, such as the inception of insolvency proceedings or other formal 
recovery action, which makes it possible to establish that some or the entire advance is beyond realistic prospect of recovery.
Accounting for purchased financial guarantee contracts

The Group may enter into a financial guarantee contract which requires the issuer of such contract to reimburse the Group for a loss it 
incurs because a specified debtor fails to make payment when due in accordance with the terms of a debt instrument. For these 
separate financial guarantee contracts, the Group recognises a reimbursement asset aligned with the recognition of the underlying

Notes to the financial statements (continued)
For the year ended 31 December 2023

ECLs, if it is considered virtually certain that a reimbursement would be received if the specified debtor fails to make payment when due 
in accordance with the terms of the debt instrument.
Loan modifications and renegotiations that are not credit-impaired

When modification of a loan agreement occurs as a result of commercial restructuring activity rather than due to the credit risk of the 
borrower, an assessment must be performed to determine whether the terms of the new agreement are substantially different from 
the terms of the existing agreement. This assessment considers both the change in cash flows arising from the modified terms as well 
as the change in overall instrument risk profile. In respect of payment holidays granted to borrowers which are not due to forbearance, if 
the revised cash flows on a present value basis (based on the original EIR) are not substantially different from the original cash flows, the 
loan is not considered to be substantially modified. 

Where terms are substantially different, the existing loan will be derecognised and a new loan will be recognised at fair value, with any 
difference in valuation recognised immediately within the income statement, subject to observability criteria.

Where terms are not substantially different, the loan carrying value will be adjusted to reflect the present value of modified cash flows 
discounted at the original EIR, with any resulting gain or loss recognised immediately within the income statement as a modification gain 
or loss. 
Expected life

Lifetime ECLs must be measured over the expected life. This is restricted to the maximum contractual life and takes into account 
expected prepayment, extension, call and similar options. The exceptions are certain revolving financial instruments, such as credit 
cards and bank overdrafts, that include both a drawn and an undrawn component where the entity’s contractual ability to demand 
repayment and cancel the undrawn commitment does not limit the entity’s exposure to credit losses to the contractual notice period. 
For revolving facilities, expected life is analytically derived to reflect the behavioural life of the asset, i.e. the full period over which the 
business expects to be exposed to credit risk. Behavioural life is typically based upon historical analysis of the average time to default, 
closure or withdrawal of facility. Where data is insufficient or analysis inconclusive, an additional ‘maturity factor’ may be incorporated to 
reflect the full estimated life of the exposures, based upon experienced judgement and/or peer analysis. Potential future modifications 
of contracts are not taken into account when determining the expected life or EAD until they occur.
Discounting

ECLs are discounted at the EIR at initial recognition or an approximation thereof and consistent with income recognition. For loan 
commitments the EIR is the rate that is expected to apply when the loan is drawn down and a financial asset is recognised. Issued 
financial guarantee contracts are discounted at the risk free rate. Lease receivables are discounted at the rate implicit in the lease. For 
variable/floating rate financial assets, the spot rate at the reporting date is used and projections of changes in the variable rate over the 
expected life are not made to estimate future interest cash flows or for discounting.
Modelling techniques

Currently, Internal Ratings- Based models are leveraged to calculate the point-in-time PD and LGD, which serve as key inputs to the 
IFRS 9 models. Thereafter, these inputs are extrapolated by the IFRS 9 models to create macroeconomic sensitive forecast of PDs, 
LGDs and in turn ECL.
Forbearance

A financial asset is subject to forbearance when it is modified due to the credit distress of the borrower. A modification made to the 
terms of an asset due to forbearance will typically be assessed as a non-substantial modification that does not result in derecognition of 
the original loan, except in circumstances where debt is exchanged for equity. 

Both performing and non-performing forbearance assets are classified as Stage 3 except where it is established that the concession 
granted has not resulted in diminished financial obligation and that no other regulatory definition of default criteria have been triggered, 
in which case the asset is classified as Stage 2. The minimum probationary period for non-performing forbearance is 12 months and for 
performing forbearance, 24 months. Hence, a minimum of 36 months is required for non-performing forbearance to move out of a 
forborne state.

No financial instrument in forbearance can transfer back to Stage 1 until all of the Stage 2 thresholds are no longer met and can only 
move out of Stage 3 when no longer credit impaired.
Critical accounting estimates and judgements

IFRS 9 impairment involves several important areas of judgement, including estimating forward-looking modelled parameters (PD, LGD 
and EAD), developing a range of unbiased future economic scenarios, estimating expected lives and assessing significant increases in 
credit risk, based on the Group’s experience of managing credit risk. The determination of expected life is most material for Barclays' 
credit card portfolios which is obtained via behavioural life analysis to materially capture the risk of these facilities. 

Within the retail and small businesses portfolios, which comprise large numbers of small homogenous assets with similar risk characteristics 
where credit scoring techniques are generally used, the impairment allowance is calculated using forward-looking modelled parameters which 
are typically run at account level. There are many models in use, each tailored to a product, line of business or customer category. Judgement 
and knowledge is needed in selecting the statistical methods to use when the models are developed or revised. Management adjustments to 
impairment models, which contain an element of subjectivity, are applied in order to factor in certain conditions or changes in policy that are not 
fully incorporated into the impairment models, or to reflect additional facts and circumstances at the period end. Management adjustments are 
reviewed and incorporated into future model development where appropriate.

Notes to the financial statements (continued)
For the year ended 31 December 2023

For individually significant assets in Stage 3, impairment allowances are calculated on an individual basis and all relevant considerations that have 
a bearing on the expected future cash flows across a range of economic scenarios are taken into account. These considerations can be 
particularly subjective and can include the business prospects for the customer, the realisable value of collateral, the Group’s position relative to 
other claimants, the reliability of customer information and the likely cost and duration of the work-out process. The level of the impairment 
allowance is the difference between the value of the discounted expected future cash flows (discounted at the loan’s original effective interest 
rate), and its carrying amount. Furthermore, judgements change with time as new  information becomes available or as work-out strategies 
evolve, resulting in frequent revisions to the impairment allowance as individual decisions are taken. Changes in these estimates would result in a 
change in the allowances and have a direct impact on the impairment charge. 

Further information on impairment allowances, impairment charges, management adjustments to models for impairment, measurement 
uncertainty, sensitivity analysis and related credit information is set out within the Credit risk performance section. 

Temporary adjustments to calculated IFRS9 impairment allowances may be applied in limited circumstances to account for situations where 
known or expected risk factors or information have not been considered in the ECL assessment or modelling process. For further information 
please see page 307 in the Credit risk performance section.

Information about the potential impact of the physical and transition risks of climate change on borrowers is considered, taking into account 
reasonable and supportable information to make accounting judgements and estimates. Climate change is inherently of a long-term nature, 
with significant levels of uncertainty, and consequently requires judgement in determining the possible impact in the next financial year, if any.

1 Recoveries and reimbursements includes £29m (2022: £199m, 2021: £(306)m) for reimbursements expected to be received under the arrangement where Group has entered into 

financial guarantee contracts which provide credit protection over certain assets with third parties and cash recoveries of previously written off amounts of £44m (2022: £64m, 2021: 
£66m).

2 Includes net impairment charges of £19m relating to the German consumer finance portfolio classified as assets held for sale during the year. 
3 Includes Debt securities at amortised cost.

Write-offs that can be subjected to enforcement activity

The contractual amount outstanding on financial assets that were written off during the year and that can still be subjected to 
enforcement activity is £597m (2022: £949m). This is lower than the write-offs presented in the movement in gross exposures and 
impairment allowance table due to assets sold during the year post write-offs and post write-off recoveries. 
Modification of financial assets

Financial assets of £2,690m (2022: £2,412m, 2021: £3,446m), with a loss allowance measured at an amount equal to lifetime ECL, were 
subject to non-substantial modification during the year, with a resulting loss of £4m (2022: £4m, 2021: £11m). The gross carrying 
amount of financial assets subject to non-substantial modification for which the loss allowance has changed to a 12 month ECL during 
the year amounts to £149m (2022: £1,077m, 2021: £419m). 
9 Tax

Accounting for income taxes
The Group applies IAS 12 Income Taxes in accounting for taxes on income. Income tax payable on taxable profits (current tax) is 
recognised as an expense in the periods in which the profits arise. Withholding taxes are also treated as income taxes. Income tax 
recoverable on tax allowable losses is recognised as a current tax asset only to the extent that it is regarded as recoverable by offsetting 
against taxable profits arising in the current or prior periods. Current tax is measured using tax rates and tax laws that have been 
enacted or substantively enacted at the balance sheet date.

Deferred tax assets are recognised to the extent that it is probable that taxable profit will be available against which the deductible 
temporary differences, and the carry forward of unused tax credits and unused tax losses can be utilised. Deferred tax liabilities are 
recognised for all taxable temporary differences except for the initial recognition of goodwill. Deferred tax is not recognised where the 
temporary difference arises from the initial recognition of an asset or liability in a transaction that is not a business combination and, at 
the time of the transaction, affects neither the accounting profit nor taxable profit or loss. Deferred tax is determined using tax rates 
and legislation enacted or substantively enacted by the balance sheet date which are expected to apply when the deferred tax asset is

realised or the deferred tax liability is settled. Deferred tax assets and liabilities are only offset when there is both a legal right to set-off 
and an intention to settle on a net basis. 

The Group considers an uncertain tax position to exist when it considers that ultimately, in the future, the amount of profit subject to 
tax may be greater than the amount initially reflected in the Group’s tax returns. The Group accounts for provisions in respect of 
uncertain tax positions in two different ways.  

A current tax provision is recognised when it is considered probable that the outcome of a review by a tax authority of an uncertain tax 
position will alter the amount of cash tax due to, or from, a tax authority in the future. From recognition, the current tax provision is then 
measured at the amount the Group ultimately expects to pay the tax authority to resolve the position. The accrual of interest and 
penalty amounts in respect of uncertain income tax positions is recognised as an expense within profit before tax.

Deferred tax provisions are adjustments made to the carrying value of deferred tax assets in respect of uncertain tax positions. A 
deferred tax provision is recognised when it is considered probable that the outcome of a review by a tax authority of an uncertain tax 
position will result in a reduction in the carrying value of the deferred tax asset. From recognition of a provision, measurement of the 
underlying deferred tax asset is adjusted to take into account the expected impact of resolving the uncertain tax position on the loss or 
temporary difference giving rise to the deferred tax asset. 

The approach taken to measurement takes account of whether the uncertain tax position is a discrete position that will be reviewed by 
the tax authority in isolation from any other position, or one of a number of issues which are expected to be reviewed together 
concurrently and resolved simultaneously with a tax authority. The Group’s measurement of provisions is based upon its best estimate 
of the additional profit that will become subject to tax. For a discrete position, consideration is given only to the merits of that position. 
Where a number of issues are expected to be reviewed and resolved together, the Group will take into account not only the merits of its 
position in respect of each particular issue but also the overall level of provision relative to the aggregate of the uncertain tax positions 
across all the issues that are expected to be resolved at the same time. In addition, in assessing provision levels, it is assumed that tax 
authorities will review uncertain tax positions and that all facts will be fully and transparently disclosed. 
Critical accounting estimates and judgements

There are two key areas of judgement that impact the reported tax position. Firstly, the level of provisioning for uncertain tax positions; 
and secondly, the recognition and measurement of deferred tax assets. 

The Group does not consider there to be a significant risk of a material adjustment to the carrying amount of current and deferred tax 
balances, including provisions for uncertain tax positions in the next financial year. The provisions for uncertain tax positions cover a 
diverse range of issues and reflect advice from external counsel where relevant. It should be noted that only a proportion of the total 
uncertain tax positions will be under audit at any point in time, and could therefore be subject to challenge by a tax authority over the 
next year. 

Deferred tax assets have been recognised based on business profit forecasts which included consideration for the current view of 
climate impacts. Details on the recognition of deferred tax assets are provided in this note.

Annual Report 2023 437

Notes to the financial statements (continued)
For the year ended 31 December 2023

Factors influencing the effective tax rate

As a result of the increase in the UK corporation tax rate from 19% to 25% from 1 April 2023, the applicable UK corporation tax rate for 
the year ended 31 December 2023 is 23.5%. In addition, the banking surcharge rate reduced from 8% to 3% from 1 April 2023 resulting 
in a total tax rate applicable to banks’ UK profits of 27.75% for the year ended 31 December 2023.

The effective tax rate of 18.8% is lower than the applicable UK corporation tax rate of 23.5% primarily due to tax relief on payments 
made under AT1 instruments and tax relief on holdings of inflation-linked government bonds. These factors, which have each 
decreased the effective tax rate, are partially offset by non-creditable taxes including withholding taxes.
Factors that may influence the effective tax rate in future periods

The Group’s future tax charge will be sensitive to the geographic mix of profits earned, the tax rates in force and changes to the tax 
rules in the jurisdictions that the Group operates in.

Tax law is, at times, complex, and it is the role of courts and tribunals to act as the final authority on the correct interpretation of tax law.  
In October 2023, a First-tier Tax Tribunal hearing took place between Barclays Bank PLC and HM Revenue & Customs in respect of the 
UK corporation tax treatment of an element of the finance costs associated with reserve capital instruments issued as part of the 
capital raising announced by Barclays in October 2008, which have since been redeemed. The maximum additional tax liability that could 
arise under the dispute is £215m and a provision of £106m is carried in respect of this uncertainty. The judgement is expected to be 
received in early 2024.

The OECD and G20 Inclusive Framework on Base Erosion and Profit Shifting announced plans under the Pillar Two Framework to 
introduce a global minimum tax rate of 15% and the OECD issued model rules in 2021. Further OECD guidance has been released 
during 2022 and 2023 and the UK Government enacted legislation on 11 July 2023 to implement the global minimum tax rules and a UK 
domestic minimum tax. The UK’s Pillar Two rules apply for accounting periods beginning on or after 31 December 2023 and will apply in 
respect of profits for every jurisdiction where the Group operates.

Additionally, the Group may be subject to Qualifying Domestic Minimum Top-up Taxes (QDMTTs) under the Pillar Two rules 
implemented in its operating jurisdictions. The application of QDMTT rules should not affect the overall impact of any additional taxes 
resulting from the Pillar Two regime on the Group’s tax charge, as any taxes paid under a local QDMTT would be expected to result in a 
reduction in any top-up tax being payable in the UK.

The Group has adopted the International Tax Reform - Pillar Two Model Rules amendments to IAS 12, which were issued on 23 May 
2023 and approved by the UK Endorsement Board on 19 July 2023, and has applied the exception set out in paragraph 4A in respect of 
recognising and disclosing information about deferred tax assets and liabilities related to Pillar Two income taxes.

The Group has reviewed the published UK legislation alongside the OECD model rules and guidance and has performed an assessment 
of the expected impact of the new regime. Additional taxes resulting from the implementation of Pillar Two are expected to arise from 1 
January 2024 in respect of a limited number of jurisdictions in which the Group operates, principally in the Isle of Man, Jersey, Guernsey, 
and Ireland, by virtue of their low statutory tax rates. However, these additional taxes are not expected to significantly increase the 
Group's future tax charge based on an estimated impact of c.£20m per annum, with actual future liabilities being dependent on levels of 
profits in particular jurisdictions. The Group will continue to review further guidance due to be released by the OECD and governments 
implementing this new tax regime to assess the potential impact.

In the USA, the corporate alternative minimum tax on adjusted financial statements income introduced by the Inflation Reduction Act 
became effective on 1 January 2023. The Group will continue to review the regulations and guidance as they are issued. However, the 
Group’s tax liability was not increased as a result of the corporate alternative minimum tax in 2023 and it is not expected that it will 
materially increase the Group’s future effective tax rate.

The tax relating to each component of other comprehensive income can be found in the consolidated statement of comprehensive 
income.

US deferred tax assets in the IHC and US Branch Tax Groups

The deferred tax asset in the IHC Tax Group of £973m (2022: £1,094m) includes £35m (2022: £21m) relating to tax losses, with the 
balance relating to temporary differences. The deferred tax asset in Barclays Bank PLC’s US Branch Tax Group of £386m (2022: 
£482m) relates entirely to temporary differences. 

In relation to the IHC Tax Group, these temporary differences include £387m (2022: £434m) arising from New York State and City prior 
net operating loss conversion which can be carried forward and will expire in 2034. Business profit forecasts indicate that all of the New 
York State attributable amounts will be utilised prior to expiry and that £38m of the New York City attributable amounts previously 
recognised will not be utilised prior to expiry.  Accordingly, in the current period the deferred tax asset recognised has been reduced by 
£38m.
UK Tax Group deferred tax asset

The deferred tax asset in the UK Tax Group of £4,081m (2022: £4,925m) includes £1,566m (2022: £1,535m) relating to tax losses, with 
the balance relating to temporary differences. There is no time limit on utilisation of UK tax losses and business profit forecasts indicate 
that these losses will be fully recovered.
Other deferred tax assets (outside the UK and US tax groups)

The deferred tax asset of £520m (2022: £490m) in other entities within the Group includes £147m (2022: £90m) relating to tax losses. 
These deferred tax assets relate to a number of different territories and their recognition is based on profit forecasts or local country 
law which indicate that it is probable that those deferred tax assets will be fully recovered.

Of the deferred tax asset of £520m (2022: £490m), an amount of £20m (2022: £33m) relates to entities which have suffered a loss in 
either the current or prior year and for which the utilisation of the deferred tax is dependent on future taxable profits. This has been 
taken into account in reaching the above conclusion that these deferred tax assets will be fully recovered in the future.  

The table below shows movements on deferred tax assets and liabilities during the year. The amounts are different from those 
disclosed on the balance sheet and in the preceding table as they are presented before offsetting asset and liability balances where 
there is a legal right to set-off and an intention to settle on a net basis.

Tax losses and temporary differences

Deferred tax assets have not been recognised in respect of gross deductible temporary differences of £527m (2022: £111m), unused 
tax credits of £381m (2022: £323m), and gross tax losses of £21,681m (2022: £22,537m). The tax losses include capital losses of 
£3,965m (2022: £3,935m). Of these tax losses, £79m (2022: £149m) expire within five years, £13m (2022: £401m) expire within six to 
ten years, £10,504m (2022: £10,393m) expire within eleven to twenty years and £11,085m (2022: £11,594m) can be carried forward 
indefinitely. Deferred tax assets have not been recognised in respect of these items because it is not probable that future taxable 
profits and gains will be available against which they can be utilised. 
Group investments in subsidiaries, branches and associates

Deferred tax is not recognised in respect of the value of the Group's investments in subsidiaries, branches and associates where the 
Group is able to control the timing of the reversal of the temporary differences and it is probable that such differences will not reverse in 
the foreseeable future. The aggregate amount of these temporary differences for which deferred tax liabilities have not been 
recognised was £873m (2022: £852m).

The calculation of basic earnings per share is based on the profit attributable to equity holders of the parent and the basic weighted 
average number of shares excluding treasury shares held in employee benefit trusts or held for trading. When calculating the diluted 
earnings per share, the weighted average number of shares in issue is adjusted for the effects of all expected dilutive potential ordinary 
shares held in respect of Barclays PLC, totalling 450m (2022: 534m, 2021: 435m) shares. The number of share options outstanding, 
under schemes that were considered to be potentially dilutive was 750m (2022: 789m, 2021: 688m) in total. These options have strike 
prices ranging from £0.83 to £1.51.

Of the total number of employee share options and share awards at 31 December 2023, 39m (2022: 27m, 2021: 5m) were anti-dilutive.

The 888m decrease (2022: 652m decrease, 2021: 315m decrease) in the basic weighted average number of shares is primarily due to 
the impact of the share buy-back programmes completed each year.
11 Dividends on ordinary shares

The Directors have approved a total dividend in respect of 2023 of 8.00p per ordinary share of 25p each. The full year dividend for 2023 
of 5.30p per ordinary share will be paid on 3 April 2024 to shareholders on the Share Register on 1 March 2024. On 31 December 2023, 
there were 15,155m ordinary shares in issue. The financial statements for the year ended 31 December 2023 do not reflect this 
dividend, which will be accounted for in shareholders’ equity as an appropriation of retained profits in the year ending 31 December 
2024. 

The Directors have confirmed their intention to initiate a share buyback of up to £1bn  after the balance sheet date. The proposed 
share buyback  is expected to  commence in the first quarter of 2024. The financial statements for the year ended 31 December 2023  
do not reflect the impact of the proposed share buyback, which will be accounted for as and when shares are repurchased by the 
Company.   

The 2023 financial statements include the 2023 interim dividend of £417m (2022: £364m, 2021: £339m); a full year dividend declared in 
relation to 2022 of £793m (2021: £664m, 2020: £173m ) and two share buyback programmes totalling £1,250m (2022: £1,500m, 2021: 
£1,200m). Dividends and share buybacks are funded out of distributable reserves.

13 Financial assets at fair value through the income statement

Accounting for financial assets designated at fair value

Financial assets, other than those held for trading, are classified in this category if they are so irrevocably designated at inception and 
the use of the designation removes or significantly reduces an accounting mismatch.

Subsequent changes in fair value for these instruments are recognised in the income statement in net investment income, except if 
reporting it in trading income reduces an accounting mismatch.

The details on how the fair value amounts are derived for financial assets at fair value are described in Note 17.
Accounting for financial assets mandatorily at fair value

Financial assets that are held for trading are recognised at fair value through profit or loss. In addition, financial assets are held at fair 
value through profit or loss if they do not contain contractual terms that give rise on specified dates to cash flows that are SPPI, or if the 
financial asset is not held in a business model that is either (i) a business model to collect the contractual cash flows or (ii) a business 
model that is achieved by both collecting contractual cash flows and selling.

14 Derivative financial instruments

Accounting for derivatives

Derivative instruments are contracts whose value is derived from one or more underlying financial instruments or indices defined in the 
contract. They include swaps, forward-rate agreements, futures, options and combinations of these instruments and primarily affect 
the Group’s net interest income, net trading income and derivative assets and liabilities. Notional amounts of the contracts are not 
recorded on the balance sheet. Derivatives are used to hedge interest rate, credit risk, inflation risk, exchange rate, commodity equity 
exposures, and exposures to certain indices such as house price indices and retail price indices related to non-trading positions.

All derivative instruments are held at fair value through profit or loss, except for derivatives that are in a designated cash flow or net 
investment hedge accounting relationship. Derivatives are classified as assets when their fair value is positive or as liabilities when their 
fair value is negative. 
Hedge accounting
The Group applies the requirements of IAS 39 Financial Instruments: Recognition and Measurement for hedge accounting purposes. 
The Group applies hedge accounting to represent the economic effects of its interest rate, currency and contractually-linked inflation 
risk management strategies. Where derivatives are held for risk management purposes, and when transactions meet the required 
criteria for documentation and hedge effectiveness, the Group applies fair value hedge accounting, cash flow hedge accounting, or 
hedging of a net investment in a foreign operation, as appropriate to the risks being hedged.
Fair value hedge accounting

Changes in fair value of derivatives that qualify and are designated as fair value hedges are recorded in the income statement, together 
with changes in the fair value of the hedged asset or liability that are attributable to the hedged risk. The fair value changes adjust the 
carrying value of the hedged asset or liability held at amortised cost.

If hedge relationships no longer meet the criteria for hedge accounting, hedge accounting is discontinued. For fair value hedges of 
interest rate risk, the fair value adjustment to the hedged item is amortised to the income statement over the period to maturity of the 
previously designated hedge relationship using the effective interest method. If the hedged item is sold or repaid, the unamortised fair 
value adjustment is recognised immediately in the income statement. For items classified as fair value through other comprehensive 
income, the hedge accounting adjustment is included in other comprehensive income.
Cash flow hedge accounting

For qualifying cash flow hedges, the fair value gain or loss associated with the effective portion of the cash flow hedge is recognised 
initially in other comprehensive income, and then recycled to the income statement in the periods when the hedged item will affect 
profit or loss. Any ineffective portion of the gain or loss on the hedging instrument is recognised in the income statement immediately.

When a hedging instrument expires or is sold, or when a hedge no longer meets the criteria for hedge accounting, any cumulative gain 
or loss existing in equity at that time remains in equity and is recognised when the hedged item is ultimately recognised in the income 
statement. When a forecast transaction is no longer expected to occur, the cumulative gain or loss that was recognised in equity is 
immediately transferred to the income statement.
Hedges of net investments

The Group’s net investments in foreign operations, including monetary items accounted for as part of the net investment, are hedged 
for foreign currency risks using both derivatives and foreign currency borrowings. Hedges of net investments are accounted for 
similarly to cash flow hedges; the effective portion of the gain or loss on the hedging instrument is being recognised directly in other 
comprehensive income and the ineffective portion being recognised immediately in the income statement. The cumulative gain or loss 
recognised in other comprehensive income is recognised in the income statement on the disposal or partial disposal of the foreign 
operation, or other reductions in the Group’s investment in the operation.

Assets and liabilities held at fair value

Hedge accounting

Hedge accounting is applied predominantly for the following risks:
▪

Interest rate risk – arises due to a mismatch between fixed interest rates and floating interest rates. Interest rate risk also includes 
exposure to inflation risk for certain types of investments.

▪ Currency risk – arises due to assets or liabilities being denominated in different currencies than the functional currency of the relevant 
entity. At a consolidated level, currency risk also arises when the functional currency of subsidiaries are different from the parent.
▪ Contractually linked inflation risk – arises from financial instruments within contractually specified inflation risk. The Group does not 

hedge inflation risk that arises from other activities.

In order to hedge these risks, the Group uses the following hedging instruments:
▪
▪ Currency derivatives to swap foreign currency exposures into the entity’s functional currency, and net investment exposure to local 

Interest rate derivatives to swap interest rate exposures into either fixed or variable rates.

currency.

▪

Inflation derivatives to swap inflation exposure into either fixed or variable interest rates.

In some cases, certain items which are economically hedged may be ineligible hedged items for the purposes of IAS 39, such as core 
deposits and equity. In these instances, a proxy hedging solution can be utilised whereby portfolios of floating rate assets are 
designated as eligible hedged items in cash flow hedges.

In some hedging relationships, the Group designates risk components of hedged items as follows:
▪ Benchmark interest rate risk as a component of interest rate risk, such as the Risk Free Rate (RFR) component.
▪
▪ Spot exchange rate risk for foreign currency financial assets or financial liabilities.
▪ Components of cash flows of hedged items, for example certain interest payments for part of the life of an instrument.

Inflation risk as a contractually specified component of a debt instrument.

Using the benchmark interest rate risk results in other risks, such as credit risk and liquidity risk, being excluded from the hedge 
accounting relationship. 

In respect of many of the Group’s hedge accounting relationships, the hedged item and hedging instrument change frequently due to 
the dynamic nature of the risk management and hedge accounting strategy. The Group applies hedge accounting to dynamic 
scenarios, predominantly in relation to interest rate risk, with a combination of hedged items in order for its financial statements to 
reflect as closely as possible the economic risk management undertaken. In some cases, if the hedge accounting objective changes, 
the relevant hedge accounting relationship is de-designated and is replaced with a different hedge accounting relationship. 

Changes in the GBP value of net investments due to foreign currency movements are captured in the currency translation reserve, 
resulting in a movement in CET1 capital. The Group mitigates this by matching the CET1 capital movements to the revaluation of the 
foreign currency RWA exposures. Net investment hedges are designated where necessary to reduce the exposure to movement in a 
particular exchange rate to within limits mandated by Risk. As far as possible, existing external currency liabilities are designated as the 
hedging instruments.

The hedging instruments share the same risk exposures as the hedged items. Hedge effectiveness is determined with reference to 
quantitative tests, predominantly regression testing, but to the extent hedging instruments are exposed to different risks than the 
hedged items, this could result in hedge ineffectiveness or hedge accounting failures.

Sources of ineffectiveness include the following:
▪ Mismatches between the contractual terms of the hedged item and hedging instrument, including basis differences.
▪ Changes in credit risk of the hedging instruments.
▪

If a hedging relationship becomes over-hedged, for example in hedges of net investments if the net asset value designated at the 
start of the period falls below the amount of the hedging instrument.

Notes to the financial statements (continued)
Assets and liabilities held at fair value

15 Financial assets at fair value through other comprehensive income

Accounting for financial assets at fair value through other comprehensive income (FVOCI)

Financial assets that are debt instruments held in a business model that is achieved by both collecting contractual cash flows and selling 
and that contain contractual terms that give rise on specified dates to cash flows that are SPPI are measured at FVOCI. They are 
subsequently remeasured at fair value and changes therein (except for those relating to impairment, interest income and foreign 
currency exchange gains and losses) are recognised in other comprehensive income until the assets are sold. Interest (calculated using 
the effective interest method) is recognised in the income statement in net interest income (Note 3). Upon disposal, the cumulative 
gain or loss recognised in other comprehensive income is included in net investment income (Note 6).

In determining whether the business model is achieved by both collecting contractual cash flows and selling financial assets, it is 
determined that both collecting contractual cash flows and selling financial assets are integral to achieving the objective of the business 
model. The Group will consider past sales and expectations about future sales to establish if the business model is achieved.

For equity securities that are not held for trading, the Group may make an irrevocable election on initial recognition to present 
subsequent changes in the fair value of the instrument in other comprehensive income (except for dividend income which is recognised 
in profit or loss).

In accordance with IFRS 9, financial liabilities may be designated at fair value, with gains and losses taken to the income statement within 
net trading income (Note 5) and net investment income (Note 6). Movements in own credit are reported through other comprehensive 
income, unless the effects of changes in the liability's credit risk would create or enlarge an accounting mismatch in P&L. In these 
scenarios, all gains and losses on that liability (including the effects of changes in the credit risk of the liability) are presented in P&L. On 
derecognition of the financial liability no amount relating to own credit risk is recycled to the income statement. The Group has the 
ability to make the fair value designation when holding the instruments at fair value reduces an accounting mismatch (caused by an 
offsetting liability or asset being held at fair value), or is managed by the Group on the basis of its fair value, or includes terms that have 
substantive derivative characteristics (Note 14).

The details on how the fair value amounts are arrived at for financial liabilities designated at fair value are described in Note 17.

Notes to the financial statements (continued)
Assets and liabilities held at fair value

17 Fair value of financial instruments

Accounting for financial assets and liabilities – fair values

Financial instruments that are held for trading are recognised at fair value through profit or loss. In addition, financial assets are held at 
fair value through profit or loss if they do not contain contractual terms that give rise on specified dates to cash flows that are SPPI, or if 
the financial asset is not held in a business model that is either (i) a business model to collect the contractual cash flows or (ii) a business 
model that is achieved by both collecting contractual cash flows and selling. Subsequent changes in fair value for these instruments are 
recognised in the income statement in net investment income, except if reporting it in trading income reduces an accounting 
mismatch.

Wherever possible, fair value is determined by reference to a quoted market price for that instrument. For many of the Group’s financial 
assets and liabilities, especially derivatives, quoted prices are not available and valuation models are used to estimate fair value. The 
models calculate the expected cash flows under the terms of each specific contract and then discount these values back to a present 
value. These models use as their basis independently sourced market inputs including, for example, interest rate yield curves, equities 
and commodities prices, option volatilities and currency rates.

For financial liabilities measured at fair value, the carrying amount reflects the effect on fair value of changes in own credit spreads 
derived from observable market data such as in primary issuance and redemption activity for structured notes.

On initial recognition, it is presumed that the transaction price is the fair value unless there is observable information available in an 
active market to the contrary.

For valuations that have made use of unobservable inputs, the difference between the model valuation and the initial transaction price 
(Day one profit) is recognised in profit or loss either: on a straight-line basis over the term of the transaction; or over the period until all 
inputs will become observable where appropriate; or released in full when previously unobservable inputs become observable.

Various factors influence the availability of observable inputs and these may vary from product to product and change over time. 
Factors include the depth of activity in the relevant market, the type of product, whether the product is new and not widely traded in the 
marketplace, the maturity of market modelling and the nature of the transaction (bespoke or generic). To the extent that valuation is 
based on models or inputs that are not observable in the market, the determination of fair value can be more subjective, dependent on 
the significance of the unobservable input to the overall valuation. Unobservable inputs are determined based on the best information 
available, for example by reference to similar assets, similar maturities or other analytical techniques.

The sensitivity of valuations used in the financial statements to possible changes in significant unobservable inputs is shown on page 
456.
Critical accounting estimates and judgements

The valuation of financial instruments often involves a significant degree of judgement and complexity, in particular where valuation 
models make use of unobservable inputs (‘Level 3’ assets and liabilities). This note provides information on these instruments, including 
the related unrealised gains and losses recognised in the period, a description of significant valuation techniques and unobservable 
inputs, and a sensitivity analysis.

Climate-related risks are assumed to be included in the fair values of assets and liabilities traded in active markets. Within less active 
markets, for counterparties and instruments identified as being more susceptible to climate change risk, an impact assessment was 
performed through increasing their probability of default. The change in valuation of the assets and liabilities from this assessment was 
sufficiently immaterial to necessitate any amendment to the reported year end valuations.
Valuation

Assets and liabilities according to a hierarchy that reflects the observability of significant market inputs. The three levels of the fair value 
hierarchy are defined below with judgement applied in determining the boundary between Level 2 and 3 classification.
Quoted market prices – Level 1

Assets and liabilities are classified as Level 1 if their value is observable in an active market. Such instruments are valued by reference to 
unadjusted quoted prices for identical assets or liabilities in active markets where the quoted price is readily available, and the price 
represents actual and regularly occurring market transactions. An active market is one in which transactions occur with sufficient 
volume and frequency to provide pricing information on an ongoing basis.
Valuation technique using observable inputs – Level 2 

Assets and liabilities classified as Level 2 have been valued using models whose inputs are observable either directly or indirectly. 
Valuations based on observable inputs include assets and liabilities such as swaps and forwards which are valued using market standard 
pricing techniques, and options that are commonly traded in markets where all the inputs to the market standard pricing models are 
observable. For certain instruments that derive a fair value using unobservable inputs that are not considered significant, then the asset 
or liability may be classified as Level 2.

Assets and liabilities held at fair value

Valuation technique using significant unobservable inputs – Level 3 

Assets and liabilities are classified as Level 3 if their valuation incorporates significant inputs that are not based on observable market 
data (unobservable inputs). A valuation input is considered observable if it can be directly observed from transactions in an active 
market, or if there is compelling external evidence demonstrating an executable exit price. Unobservable input levels are generally 
determined via reference to observable inputs, historical observations or using other analytical techniques.

The following table shows the Group’s assets and liabilities that are held at fair value disaggregated by valuation technique (fair value 
hierarchy) and balance sheet classification:

Valuation techniques and sensitivity analysis

Sensitivity analysis is performed on products with significant unobservable inputs (Level 3) to generate a range of reasonably possible 
alternative valuations. The sensitivity methodologies applied take account of the nature of the valuation techniques used, as well as the 
availability and reliability of observable proxy and historical data and the impact of using alternative models.

Sensitivities are dynamically calculated on a monthly basis. The calculation is based on range or spread data of a reliable reference 
source or a scenario based on relevant market analysis alongside the impact of using alternative models. Sensitivities are calculated 
without reflecting the impact of any diversification in the portfolio.

The valuation techniques used, observability and sensitivity analysis for material products within Level 3, are described below.
Interest rate derivatives
Description: Derivatives linked to interest rates or inflation indices. The category includes futures, interest rate and inflation swaps, 
swaptions, caps, floors, inflation options, balance guaranteed swaps and other exotic interest rate derivatives.
Valuation: Interest rate and inflation derivatives are generally valued using curves of forward rates constructed from market data to 
project and discount the expected future cash flows of trades. Instruments with optionality are valued using volatilities implied from 
market inputs, and use industry standard or bespoke models depending on the product type.

Observability: In general, inputs are considered observable up to liquid maturities which are determined separately for each input and 
underlying. Unobservable inputs are generally set by referencing liquid market instruments and applying extrapolation techniques or 
inferred via another reasonable method.
Foreign exchange derivatives
Description: Derivatives linked to the foreign exchange (FX) market. The category includes FX forward contracts, FX swaps and FX 
options. The majority are traded as over the counter (OTC) derivatives.
Valuation: FX derivatives are valued using industry standard and bespoke models depending on the product type. Valuation inputs 
include FX rates, interest rates, FX volatilities, interest rate volatilities, FX interest rate correlations and others as appropriate.
Observability: FX correlations, forwards and volatilities are generally observable up to liquid maturities which are determined separately 
for each input and underlying. Unobservable inputs are set by referencing liquid market instruments and applying extrapolation 
techniques, or inferred via another reasonable method.
Credit derivatives
Description: Derivatives linked to the credit spread of a referenced entity, index or basket of referenced entities or a pool of referenced 
assets (e.g. a securitised product). The category includes single name and index credit default swaps (CDS) and total return swaps 
(TRS).
Valuation: CDS are valued on industry standard models using curves of credit spreads as the principal input. Credit spreads are observed 
directly from broker data, third party vendors or priced to proxies.
Observability: CDS contracts referencing entities that are actively traded are generally considered observable. Other valuation inputs 
are considered observable if products with significant sensitivity to the inputs are actively traded in a liquid market. Unobservable 
valuation inputs are generally determined with reference to recent transactions or inferred from observable trades of the same issuer 
or similar entities.
Equity derivatives
Description: Exchange traded or OTC derivatives linked to equity indices and single names. The category includes vanilla and exotic 
equity products.
Valuation: Equity derivatives are valued using industry standard models. Valuation inputs include stock prices, dividends, volatilities, 
interest rates, equity repurchase curves and, for multi-asset products, correlations.
Observability: In general, valuation inputs are observable up to liquid maturities which are determined separately for each input and 
underlying. Unobservable inputs are set by referencing liquid market instruments and applying extrapolation techniques, or inferred via 
another reasonable method.
Corporate debt
Description: Primarily corporate bonds.
Valuation: Corporate bonds are valued using observable market prices sourced from broker quotes, inter-dealer prices or other reliable 
pricing sources.
Observability: Prices for actively traded bonds are considered observable. Unobservable bonds prices are generally determined by 
reference to bond yields or CDS spreads for actively traded instruments issued by or referencing the same (or a similar) issuer.
Reverse repurchase and repurchase agreements
Description: Includes securities purchased under resale agreements, securities sold under repurchase agreements, and other similar 
secured lending agreements. The agreements are primarily short-term in nature.
Valuation: Repurchase and reverse repurchase agreements are generally valued by discounting the expected future cash flows using 
industry standard models that incorporate market interest rates and repurchase rates, based on the specific details of the transaction.
Observability: Inputs are deemed observable up to liquid maturities or for consensus pricing with low pricing-range and are determined 
based on the specific features of the transaction. Unobservable inputs are generally set by referencing liquid market instruments and 
applying extrapolation techniques, or inferred via another reasonable method.
Loans
Description: A drawn lending facility issued to corporate clients and customers. 
Valuation:  Loans are valued either using a price-based approach, or  through  models that discount expected future cash flows based 
on interest rates and loan spreads.
Observability: Within this loan population, the price or loan spread may be  generally unobservable.  
Private equity investments
Description: Includes investments in equity holdings in operating companies not quoted on a public exchange.
Valuation: Private equity investments are valued in accordance with the ‘International Private Equity and Venture Capital Valuation 
Guidelines’ which require the use of a number of individual pricing benchmarks such as the prices of recent transactions in the same or 
similar entities, discounted cash flow analysis and comparison with the earnings or revenue multiples of listed companies. While the 
valuation of unquoted equity instruments is subjective by nature, the relevant methodologies are commonly applied by other market 
participants and have been consistently applied over time.

Observability: Inputs are considered observable if there is active trading in a liquid market of products with significant sensitivity to the 
inputs. Unobservable inputs include earnings or revenue estimates, multiples of comparative companies, marketability discounts and 
discount rates.
Other
Description: Other includes funds and fund-linked products, issued debt, government sponsored debt, asset backed securities, equity 
cash products  and  investment property.
Assets and liabilities reclassified between Level 1 and Level 2

During the period, there were no material transfers between Level 1 and Level 2 (2022: there were no material transfers between Level 
1 and Level 2).
Level 3 movement analysis

The following table summarises the movements in the Level 3 balances during the period. Transfers have been reflected as if they had 
taken place at the beginning of the year.

Asset and liability transfers between Level 2 and Level 3 are primarily due to i) an increase or decrease in observable market activity 
related to an input or ii) a change in the significance of the unobservable input, with assets and liabilities classified as Level 3 if an 
unobservable input is deemed significant.

2 The units used to disclose ranges for significant unobservable inputs are percentages, points and basis points. Points are a percentage of par; for example, 100 points equals 100% of 

par. A basis point equals 1/100th of 1%; for example, 150 basis points equals 1.5%.

3 Certain derivative instruments are classified as Level 3 due to a significant unobservable credit spread input into the calculation of the Credit Valuation Adjustment for the instruments. 

The range of significant unobservable credit spreads is between 29-1672bps (2022: 17-2,159bps).

Notes to the financial statements (continued)
Assets and liabilities held at fair value

The following section describes the significant unobservable inputs identified in the table above, and the sensitivity of fair value 
measurement of the instruments categorised as Level 3 assets or liabilities to increases in significant unobservable inputs. Where 
sensitivities are described, the inverse relationship will also generally apply.

Where reliable interrelationships can be identified between significant unobservable inputs used in fair value measurement, a 
description of those interrelationships is included below.
Forwards

A price or rate that is applicable to a financial transaction that will take place in the future.

In general, a significant increase in a forward in isolation will result in a fair value increase for the contracted receiver of the underlying 
(currency, bond, commodity, etc.), but the sensitivity is dependent on the specific terms of the instrument.
Credit spread

Credit spreads typically represent the difference in yield between an instrument and a benchmark security or reference rate. Credit 
spreads reflect the additional yield that a market participant demands for taking on exposure to the credit risk of an instrument and 
form part of the yield used in a discounted cash flow calculation.

In general, a significant increase in credit spread in isolation will result in a movement in a fair value decrease for a cash asset.

For a derivative instrument, a significant increase in credit spread in isolation can result in a fair value increase or decrease depending on 
the specific terms of the instrument.
Volatility

Volatility is a measure of the variability or uncertainty in return for a given derivative underlying. It is an estimate of how much a particular 
underlying instrument input or index will change in value over time. In general, volatilities are implied from observed option prices. For 
unobservable options the implied volatility may reflect additional assumptions about the nature of the underlying risk, and the strike/
maturity profile of a specific contract.

In general a significant increase in volatility in isolation will result in a fair value increase for the holder of a simple option, but the 
sensitivity is dependent on the specific terms of the instrument.

There may be interrelationships between unobservable volatilities and other unobservable inputs (e.g. when equity prices fall, implied 
equity volatilities generally rise) but these are generally specific to individual markets and may vary over time.
Correlation

Correlation is a measure of the relationship between the movements of two variables. Correlation can be a significant input into 
valuation of derivative contracts with more than one underlying instrument. Credit correlation generally refers to the correlation 
between default processes for the separate names that make up the reference pool of a CDO structure.

A significant increase in correlation in isolation can result in a fair value increase or decrease depending on the specific terms of the 
instrument.
Comparable price

Comparable instrument prices are used in valuation by calculating an implied yield (or spread over a liquid benchmark) from the price of a 
comparable observable instrument, then adjusting that yield (or spread) to account for relevant differences such as maturity or credit 
quality. Alternatively, a price-to-price basis can be assumed between the comparable and unobservable instruments in order to 
establish a value.

Loans includes a portfolio of loans extended to clients within the Group’s leveraged finance business. Leveraged finance loans are 
originated where Barclays provide financing commitments to clients to facilitate strategic transactions such as leverage buyouts and 
acquisitions. The sensitivity of the portfolio to unobservable inputs is judgmental reflecting their illiquid nature and the significance of 
unobservable price inputs to the valuation.

In general, a significant increase in comparable price in isolation will result in an increase in the price of the unobservable instrument. For 
derivatives, a change in the comparable price in isolation can result in a fair value increase or decrease depending on the specific terms 
of the instrument.
Loan spread

Loan spreads typically represent the difference in yield between an instrument and a benchmark security or reference rate. Loan 
spreads typically reflect credit quality, the level of comparable assets such as gilts and other factors, and form part of the yield used in a 
discounted cash flow calculation.

Loans containing unobservable input loan spreads into their valuation primarily consist of long-dated fixed rate loans extended to 
counterparties in the UK Education, Social Housing and Local Authority sectors (ESHLA). The loans are categorised as Level 3 in the fair 
value hierarchy due to their illiquid nature and the significance of unobservable loan spreads to the valuation. Valuation uncertainty 
arises from the long-dated nature of the portfolio, the lack of secondary market in the loans and the lack of observable loan spreads. 
The majority of ESHLA loans are to borrowers in heavily regulated sectors that are considered extremely low credit risk, and have a 
history of near zero defaults since inception. While the overall loan spread range is from 40bps to 307bps (2022: 50bps to 589bps), the 
vast majority of spreads are concentrated towards the bottom end of this range, with 98% of the loan notional being valued with 
spreads less than 200bps for the current period.

In general, a significant increase in loan spreads in isolation will result in a fair value decrease for a loan.

EBITDA multiple

EBITDA multiple is the ratio of the valuation of the investment to the earnings before interest, taxes, depreciation and amortisation.

In general, a significant increase in the multiple will result in a fair value increase for an investment.
Earnings multiple

Earnings or Revenue multiple is the ratio of the valuation of the investment to the earnings or revenue. In general, a significant increase 
in the multiple will result in a fair value increase for an investment.

The effect of stressing unobservable inputs to a range of reasonably possible alternatives, alongside considering the impact of using 
alternative models, would be to increase fair values by up to £1,290m (2022: £1,076m) or to decrease fair values by up to £1,633m 
(2022: £1,328m) with substantially all the potential effect impacting profit and loss. Unfavourable changes shown in the table above are 
partly provided for through the capital and prudential valuation adjustment framework

The Group uses mid-market pricing where it is a market maker and has the ability to transact at, or better than, mid price (which is the 
case for certain equity, bond and vanilla derivative markets). For other financial assets and liabilities, bid-offer adjustments are recorded 
to reflect the exit level for the expected close out strategy. The methodology for determining the bid-offer adjustment for a derivative 
portfolio involves calculating the net risk exposure by offsetting long and short positions by strike and term in accordance with the risk 
management and hedging strategy.

Bid-offer levels are generally derived from market quotes such as broker data. Less liquid instruments may not have a directly 
observable bid-offer level. In such instances, an exit price adjustment may be derived from an observable bid-offer level for a 
comparable liquid instrument, or determined by calibrating to derivative prices, or by scenario or historical analysis.

Exit price adjustments derived from market bid-offer spreads have decreased by £8m to £(569)m.
Discounting approaches for derivative instruments
Collateralised

In line with market practice, the methodology for discounting collateralised derivatives takes into account the nature and currency of 
the collateral that can be posted within the relevant credit support annex (CSA). The CSA aware discounting approach recognises the 
‘cheapest to deliver’ option that reflects the ability of the party posting collateral to change the currency of the collateral.
Uncollateralised

A fair value adjustment of £(4)m is applied to account for the impact of incorporating the cost of funding into the valuation of 
uncollateralised and partially collateralised derivative portfolios and collateralised derivatives where the terms of the agreement do not 
allow the rehypothecation of collateral received. The  derivative funding adjustment  has decreased by £7m to £(4)m .

Derivative credit and debit valuation adjustments

Derivative credit valuation adjustments and Derivative debit valuation adjustments are incorporated into derivative valuations to reflect 
the impact on fair value of counterparty credit risk and Barclays’ own credit quality respectively. These adjustments are calculated for 
uncollateralised and partially collateralised derivatives across all asset classes. Derivative credit valuation adjustments and Derivative 
debit valuation adjustments are calculated using estimates of exposure at default, probability of default and recovery rates, at a 
counterparty level. Counterparties include (but are not limited to) corporates, sovereigns and sovereign agencies and supranationals.

Exposure at default is generally estimated through the simulation of underlying risk factors through approximating with a more vanilla 
structure, or by using current or scenario-based mark to market as an estimate of future exposure.

Probability of default and recovery rate information is generally sourced from the CDS markets. Where this information is not available, 
or considered unreliable, alternative approaches are taken based on mapping internal counterparty ratings onto historical or market-
based default and recovery information. 

Derivative credit valuation adjustments decreased by £110m to £(209)m as a result of tightening input counterparty credit spreads. 
Derivative debit valuation adjustments decreased by £64m to £144m as a result of tightening input Barclays Bank PLC credit spreads .

Correlation between counterparty credit and underlying derivative risk factors, termed ‘wrong-way,’ or ‘right-way’ risk, is not 
systematically incorporated into the derivative credit valuation adjustments calculation but is adjusted where the underlying exposure is 
directly related to the counterparty.

Barclays continues to monitor market practices and activity to ensure the approach to uncollateralised derivative valuation remains 
appropriate.
Portfolio exemptions

The Group uses the portfolio exemption in IFRS 13 Fair Value Measurement to measure the fair value of groups of financial assets and 
liabilities. Instruments are measured using the price that would be received to sell a net long position (i.e. an asset) for a particular risk 
exposure or to transfer a net short position (i.e. a liability) for a particular risk exposure in an orderly transaction between market 
participants at the balance sheet date under current market conditions. Accordingly, the Group measures the fair value of the group of 
financial assets and liabilities consistently with how market participants would price the net risk exposure at the measurement date.
Unrecognised gains as a result of the use of valuation models using unobservable inputs

The amount that has yet to be recognised in income that relates to the difference between the transaction price (the fair value at initial 
recognition) and the amount that would have arisen had valuation models using unobservable inputs been used on initial recognition, 
less amounts subsequently recognised, is £205m (2022: £126m) for financial instruments measured at fair value and £192m (2022: 
£216m) for financial instruments carried at amortised cost. There are additions and FX loss of £136m (2022: £59m additions and FX 
gains), and amortisation and releases of £57m (2022: £66m) for financial instruments measured at fair value and additions of £0m 
(2022: £0m) and amortisation and releases of £24m (2022: £14m) for financial instruments measured at amortised cost.
Third-party credit enhancements

Structured and brokered certificates of deposit issued by Barclays are insured up to $250,000 per depositor by the Federal Deposit 
Insurance Corporation (FDIC) in the US. The FDIC is funded by premiums that Barclays and other banks pay for deposit insurance 
coverage. The carrying value of these issued certificates of deposit that are designated under the IFRS 9 fair value option includes this 
third party credit enhancement. The on-balance sheet value of these brokered certificates of deposit amounted to £5,162m (2022: 
£5,197m).

The fair value is an estimate of the price that would be received to sell an asset or paid to transfer a liability in an orderly transaction 
between market participants at the measurement date. As a wide range of valuation techniques are available, it may not be appropriate 
to directly compare this fair value information to independent market sources or other financial institutions. Different valuation 
methodologies and assumptions can have a significant impact on fair values which are based on unobservable inputs.
Financial assets
Loans and advances at amortised cost

The fair value of loans and advances, for the purpose of this disclosure, is derived from discounting expected cash flows in a way that 
reflects the current market price for lending to issuers of similar credit quality. Where market data or credit information on the 
underlying borrowers is unavailable, a number of proxy/extrapolation techniques are employed to determine the appropriate discount 
rates. For 2023, the fair value is lower than carrying value mainly on fixed rate products driven by rising interest rates. The majority will be 
part of a wider portfolio which includes fair valued instruments that are not presented in this table.
Reverse repurchase agreements and other similar secured borrowing

The fair value of reverse repurchase agreements approximates carrying amount as these balances are generally short dated and fully 
collateralised.
Financial liabilities
Deposits at amortised cost

In many cases, the fair value disclosed approximates carrying value because the instruments are short term in nature or have interest 
rates that reprice frequently, such as customer accounts and other deposits and short-term debt securities.

The fair value for deposits with longer-term maturities, mainly time deposits, are estimated using discounted cash flows applying either 
market rates or current rates for deposits of similar remaining maturities. Consequently, the fair value discount is minimal.
Repurchase agreements and other similar secured borrowing

The fair value of repurchase agreements approximates carrying amounts as these balances are generally short dated.
Debt securities in issue

Fair values of other debt securities in issue are based on quoted prices where available, or where the instruments are short dated, 
carrying amount approximates fair value.
Subordinated liabilities

Fair values for dated and undated convertible and non-convertible loan capital are based on quoted market rates for the issuer 
concerned or issuers with similar terms and conditions.

18 Offsetting financial assets and financial liabilities

The Group reports financial assets and financial liabilities on a net basis on the balance sheet only if there is a legally enforceable right to 
set-off the recognised amounts and there is intention to settle on a net basis, or to realise the asset and settle the liability 
simultaneously. The following table shows the impact of netting arrangements on:
▪ all financial assets and liabilities that are reported net on the balance sheet
▪ all derivative financial instruments and reverse repurchase and repurchase agreements and other similar secured lending and 

borrowing agreements that are subject to enforceable master netting arrangements or similar agreements, but do not qualify for 
balance sheet netting.

The ‘Net amounts’ presented  are not intended to represent the Group’s actual exposure to credit risk, as a variety of credit mitigation 
strategies are employed in addition to netting and collateral arrangements.

includes cash collateral netted of £9,067m (2022: £15,098m). Settlements assets and liabilities have been offset amounting to £29,297m (2022: £24,250m). 

2 Financial collateral of £41,247m (2022: £45,981m) was received in respect of derivative assets, including £31,211m (2022: £34,547m) of cash collateral and £10,036m (2022: £11,434m) 

of non-cash collateral. Financial collateral of £27,978m (2022: £26,639m) was placed in respect of derivative liabilities, including £24,260m (2022: £25,222m) of cash collateral and 
£3,718m (2022: £1,417m) of non-cash collateral. The collateral amounts are limited to net balance sheet exposure so as to not include overcollateralisation.

3 This column includes contractual rights of set-off that are subject to uncertainty under the laws of the relevant jurisdiction.
4 The balance sheet total is the sum of ‘Net amounts reported on the balance sheet’ that are subject to enforceable netting arrangements and ‘Amounts not subject to enforceable 

netting arrangements’.

5 Reverse repurchase agreements and other similar secured lending of £151,725m (2022: £165,457m) is split by fair value £149,131m (2022: £164,681m) and amortised cost £2,594m 
(2022: £776m). Repurchase agreements and other similar secured borrowing of £227,316m (2022: £199,798m) is split by fair value £185,715m (2022: £172,746m) and amortised cost 
£41,601m (2022: £27,052m).

Derivative assets and liabilities

The ‘Financial instruments’ column identifies financial assets and liabilities that are subject to set-off under netting agreements, such as 
the ISDA Master Agreement or derivative exchange or clearing counterparty agreements, whereby all outstanding transactions with 
the same counterparty can be offset and close-out netting applied across all outstanding transactions covered by the agreements if an 
event of default or other predetermined events occur.

Financial collateral refers to cash and non-cash collateral obtained, typically daily or weekly, to cover the net exposure between 
counterparties by enabling the collateral to be realised in an event of default or if other predetermined events occur.
Repurchase and reverse repurchase agreements and other similar secured lending and borrowing

The ‘Financial instruments’ column identifies financial assets and liabilities that are subject to set-off under netting agreements, such as 
Global Master Repurchase Agreements and Global Master Securities Lending Agreements, whereby all outstanding transactions with 
the same counterparty can be offset and close-out netting applied across all outstanding transactions covered by the agreements if an 
event of default or other predetermined events occur.

Financial collateral typically comprises highly liquid securities which are legally transferred and can be liquidated in the event of 
counterparty default.

These offsetting and collateral arrangements and other credit risk mitigation strategies used by the Group are further explained in the 
Credit risk management section.

Assets at amortised cost and other investments

The notes included in this section focus on the Group’s property, plant and equipment, leases and goodwill and intangible assets. 
Details regarding the Group’s liquidity and capital position can be found in the Treasury and Capital risk section.
19 Property, plant and equipment

Accounting for property, plant and equipment

Property, plant and equipment is stated at cost, which includes direct and incremental acquisition costs less accumulated depreciation 
and provisions for impairment, if required. Subsequent costs are capitalised if these result in enhancement of the asset.

Depreciation is provided on the depreciable amount of items of property, plant and equipment on a straight-line basis over their 
estimated useful economic lives. Depreciation rates, methods and the residual values underlying the calculation of depreciation of 
items of property, plant and equipment are kept under review to take account of any change in circumstances including consideration 
on future Climate and Sustainability investments. 

The Group uses the following annual rates in calculating depreciation:

the table above.
Investment property

The Group initially recognises investment property at cost, and subsequently at fair value at each balance sheet date, reflecting market 
conditions at the reporting date. Gains and losses on remeasurement are included in the income statement.

1 Right of use (ROU) asset balances relate to property leases under IFRS 16. Refer to Note 20 for further details.
2 Disposals primarily pertain to  fully depreciated assets which are not in use.

Property rentals of £12m (2022: £10m) have been included in other income.

The fair value of investment property is determined by reference to current market prices for similar properties, adjusted as necessary 
for condition and location, or by reference to recent transactions updated to reflect current economic conditions. Discounted cash 
flow techniques may be employed to calculate fair value where there have been no recent transactions, using current external market 
inputs such as market rents and interest rates. Valuations are carried out by management with the support of appropriately qualified 
independent valuers. 
20 Leases

Accounting for leases

When the Group is the lessee, it is required to recognise both:
▪ A lease liability, measured at the present value of remaining cash flows on the lease, and 
▪ A right of use (ROU) asset, measured at the amount of the initial measurement of the lease liability, plus any lease payments made 

prior to commencement date, initial direct costs, and estimated costs of restoring the underlying asset to the condition required by 
the lease, less any lease incentives received.

Subsequently the lease liability will increase for the accrual of interest, resulting in a constant rate of return throughout the life of the 
lease, and reduce when payments are made. The right of use asset will amortise to the income statement over the life of the lease. 

When the lease liability is remeasured, a corresponding adjustment is made to the carrying amount of the ROU asset, or is recorded in 
the income statement if the carrying amount of the ROU asset has been reduced to nil.

On the balance sheet, the ROU assets are included within property, plant and equipment and the lease liabilities are included within 
other liabilities. 

The Group applies the recognition exemption in IFRS 16 for leases with a term not exceeding 12 months. For these leases the lease 
payments are recognised as an expense on a straight line basis over the lease term unless another systematic basis is more 
appropriate.

Assets at amortised cost and other investments

When the Group is the lessor, the lease must be classified as either a finance lease or an operating lease. A finance lease is a lease which 
confers substantially all the risks and rewards of the leased assets on the lessee. An operating lease is a lease where substantially all of 
the risks and rewards of the leased asset remain with the lessor.
As a Lessor

Finance lease receivables are included within loans and advances at amortised cost.

The Group leases various offices, branches and other premises under non-cancellable lease arrangements to meet its operational 
business requirements. In some instances, Barclays will sublease property to third parties when it is no longer needed to meet business 
requirements. Currently, Barclays does not have any material subleasing arrangements.

ROU asset balances relate to property leases only. Refer to Note 19 for the carrying amount of ROU assets.

The total expenses recognised during the year for short term leases were £2m (2022: £1m). The portfolio of short term leases to which 
Barclays is exposed at the end of the year is not dissimilar to the expenses recognised in the year.

In addition to the cash flows identified above, Group is exposed to:
▪ Variable lease payments: This variability will typically arise from either inflation index instruments or market-based pricing 

adjustments. Currently, Barclays has 517 (2022: 401) leases out of the total 756 (2022: 896) leases which have variable lease payment 
terms based on market-based pricing adjustments. Of the gross cash flows identified above £1,062m (2022: £1,087m) is attributable 
to leases with some degree of variability predominately linked to market-based pricing adjustments.

▪ Extension and termination options: The table above represents Barclays' best estimate of future cash outflows for leases, including 
assumptions regarding the exercising of contractual extension and termination options. The above gross cash flows have been 
reduced by £441m (2022: £516m) for leases where Barclays is highly expected to exercise an early termination option. However, 
there is no significant impact where Barclays is expected to exercise an extension option.

In 2023, Group does not have any sale and leaseback transaction (2022: £88m).

The Group does not have any restrictions or covenants imposed by the lessor on its property leases which restrict its businesses.

21 Goodwill and intangible assets

Accounting for goodwill and intangible assets
Goodwill

Goodwill arising on the acquisition of subsidiaries represents the excess of the fair value of the purchase consideration over the fair 
value of the Group’s share of the assets acquired and the liabilities and contingent liabilities assumed on the date of the acquisition.

Goodwill is reviewed annually for impairment, or more frequently when there are indications that impairment may have occurred. The 
test involves comparing the carrying value of a cash generating unit (CGU) including goodwill with the present value of the pre-tax cash 
flows, discounted at a rate of interest that reflects the inherent risks, of the CGU to which the goodwill relates, or the CGU's fair value if 
this is higher.
Intangible assets

Intangible assets are initially recognised when they are separable or arise from contractual or other legal rights, the cost can be 
measured reliably and, in the case of intangible assets not acquired in a business combination, where it is probable that future economic 
benefits attributable to the assets will flow from their use.

For internally generated intangible assets, only costs incurred during the development phase are capitalised. Expenditure in the 
research phase is expensed when it is incurred.

Intangible assets are stated at cost (which is, in the case of assets acquired in a business combination, the acquisition date fair value) 
less accumulated amortisation and impairment, if any, and are amortised over their useful lives in a manner that reflects the pattern to 
which they contribute to future cash flows, generally using the amortisation periods set out below:

1 Exceptions to the above rate relate to useful lives of certain core banking platforms that are assessed individually and, if appropriate, amortised over longer periods ranging from 10 

to 15 years.

Intangible assets are reviewed for impairment when there are indications that impairment may have occurred. Intangible assets not yet 
available for use are reviewed annually for impairment.

2 In the current year the group has reclassified assets with a total net book value of £412m recognised on balance sheet relating to sign-on bonus payments made to co-brand credit card 

partners from Intangible Assets (Licenses and other) to Other Assets. This change in classification has been made to more appropriately reflect the nature of the assets.

The German consumer finance business moved to assets held for sale during the year and this resulted in an impairment of Intangible 
assets of £32m.

Critical accounting estimates and judgements
Goodwill

Testing goodwill for impairment involves a significant amount of judgement. Goodwill is allocated to CGUs for the purpose of 
impairment testing.  The review of goodwill for impairment involves calculating a value in use (VIU) valuation which is compared to the 
carrying value of a CGU associated with the goodwill to determine whether any impairment has occurred. This includes the 
identification of independent CGUs across the organisation and the allocation of goodwill to those CGUs. 

The calculation of a value in use contains a high degree of uncertainty in estimating the future cash flows and the rates used to discount 
them. Key judgements include determining the carrying value of the CGU, the cash flows and discount rates used in the calculation. 
▪ The cash flow forecasts used by management involve judgement and are based upon a view of the prospects of the business and 

market conditions at the point in time the assessment is prepared, including the potential effect of climate change. The estimation of 
cash flows is sensitive to the periods for which detailed forecasts are available and to assumptions regarding long-term sustainable 
cash flows.

▪ The discount rates applied to the future cash flows also involve judgement as they can have a significant impact on the valuation. 

The discount rates used are compared to market participants to ensure that they are appropriate and based on an estimated cost of 
equity for each CGU. 

▪ The choice of a terminal growth rate used to determine the present value of the future cash flows of the CGUs is also a judgement 

that can impact the outcome of the assessment. The terminal growth rate and discount rates used may vary due to external market 
rates and economic conditions that are beyond management’s control, including the potential effect of climate change. 

Further details of some of the key judgements are set out below. 
2023 impairment review

The 2023 impairment review was performed during Q4 2023, with the approach and analysis set out below.
Determining the carrying value of CGUs

The carrying value for each CGU is the sum of the tangible equity, goodwill and intangible asset balances associated with that CGU.

The Group manages the assets and liabilities of its CGUs with reference to the tangible equity of the respective businesses. That 
tangible equity is derived from the level of risk weighted assets (RWAs) and capital required to be deployed in the CGU and therefore 
reflects its relative risk, as well as the level of capital that management consider a market participant would be required to hold and 
retain to support business growth. 

Goodwill is initially allocated to CGUs or groups of CGUs that are expected to benefit from the synergies of the acquisition that 
generated it. Goodwill is only reallocated if there is a change in its use or when reporting structures are altered in a way that changes the 
composition of one or more cash-generating units to which goodwill has been allocated. During the year, the Merchant Acquiring 
business was split from the Cards & Payments business and was identified as a CGU.
Cash flows

The five-year cash flows used in the calculation are based on the formally agreed medium-term plans approved by the Board. These are 
prepared using macroeconomic assumptions which management consider reasonable and supportable, and reflect business agreed 
initiatives for the forecast period. The macroeconomic assumptions underpinning the medium term plan were determined during 2023 
and management has considered whether there are subsequent significant changes in those assumptions which would adversely 
impact the results of the impairment review.

As required by IAS 36, estimates of future cash flows exclude cash inflows or outflows that are expected to arise from restructuring 
initiatives where a constructive obligation to carry out the plan does not yet exist. 

In line with prior year treatment, the Education, Social Housing and Local Authority (ESHLA) portfolio has been excluded from the 
Business Banking CGU cash flows. This is a legacy loan portfolio which was previously within the Non-Core bank and was not part of the 
business to which the goodwill relates. As such, the cash flows relating to this portfolio have been excluded from the Business Banking 
VIU calculation.  
Discount rates

IAS 36 requires that the discount rate used in a value in use calculation reflects the pre-tax rate an investor would require if they were to 
choose an investment that would generate similar cash flows to those that the entity expects to generate from the asset. In 
determining the discount rate, management identified the cost of equity associated with market participants that closely resemble the 
Group's CGUs. The cost of equity has been used as the discount rate in the impairment assessment and applied to the post tax cash 
flows of the CGU. This post-tax method incorporates the impact of changing tax rates on the cash flows and is expected to produce 
the same VIU result as a pre-tax method adjusted for varying tax rates. Using the resultant VIU the equivalent pre-tax discount rate has 
been calculated. The cost of equity rate used for all CGUs in this year’s calculation has been increased to the reflect the relative volatility 
of Barclays PLC’s stock price versus the average of our peers. The range of equivalent pre-tax discount rates applicable across the 
CGUs range from 14.7% to 18.5% (2022: 14.1% to 16.5%). 
Terminal growth rate

The terminal growth rate is used to estimate the effect of projecting cash flows to the end of an asset’s useful economic life. It is 
management’s judgement that the cash flows associated with the CGUs will grow in line with the major economies in which the Group 
operates. Inflation rates are used as an approximation of future growth rates and form the basis of the terminal growth rates applied. 
The terminal growth rate used is 2.0% (2022: 2.0%).

Outcome of goodwill and intangibles review

The Personal Banking and Business Banking CGUs carry the majority of the Group’s goodwill balance, predominantly as a consequence 
of the Woolwich acquisition. The goodwill within Personal Banking was £3,064m ( 2022: £2,752m), of which £2,501m (2022: £2,501m) 
was attributable to Woolwich, and within Business Banking was £629m (2022: £629m), fully attributable to Woolwich.

The largest portion of the Group's intangible assets sits within the Investment Bank CGU, part of Barclays International with an 
allocation of £1,043m (2022: £919m). 

The recoverable amount for both Personal Banking and Business Banking have decreased in comparison to the 2022 impairment 
review, reflective of changes in the interest rate and macroeconomic outlook.

An impairment of £33m of goodwill and £257m of intangible assets has been identified and recognised for the year, fully impairing the 
goodwill and intangibles of the Merchant Acquiring CGU.  In all other CGUs, the value in use exceeds the carrying value and no 
impairment has been identified.  

The outcome of the impairment review for Personal Banking, Business Banking, Barclaycard UK and Cards and Payments  are set out 
below:

All CGUs showed a reduction in value in use in the period which is mainly attributable to the increase in the discount rates used in the 
assessment as a result of increases in interest rates as well as the introduction of the Barclays share price volatility premium.

The value in use for Barclaycard UK has reduced to a level that an adverse movement in any of the key judgement areas would result in 
an impairment.
Sensitivity of key judgements

The CGUs are sensitive to possible adverse changes in the key assumptions that support the recoverable amount:
Cash flows: The medium-term plans used to determine the cash flows used in the VIU calculation rely on macroeconomic forecasts, 
including interest rates, GDP and unemployment, and forecast levels of market and client activity. Interest rate assumptions impact 
planned cash flows from both customer income and structural hedge contributions and therefore cash flow expectations are highly 
sensitive to movements in the yield curve. The cash flows also contain assumptions with regard to the prudential and financial conduct 
regulatory environment which may be subject to change. Given the current level of economic uncertainty, a 10% reduction in cash 
flows has been provided to show the sensitivity of the outcome to a change in these key assumptions. 
Discount rate: The discount rate should reflect the market risk-free rate adjusted for the inherent risks of the business it is applied to. 
Management have identified discount rates for comparable businesses and consider these to be a reasonable estimate of a suitable 
market rate for the profile of the business unit being tested. The risk that these discount rates may not be appropriate is quantified 
below and shows the impact of a 100bps change in the discount rate. 
Terminal growth rate: The terminal growth rate is used to estimate the cash flows into perpetuity based on the expected longevity of 
the CGU's businesses. The terminal growth rate is sensitive to uncertainties in the macroeconomic environment. The risk that using 
inflation data may not be appropriate for its determination is quantified below and shows the impact of 100bps change in the terminal 
growth rate. 
Allocated capital rate: Tangible equity is allocated based on the level of risk weighted assets (RWAs) and capital required to be 
deployed in the CGU which is dependent on the relative risk of businesses. The capital ratio used in determining the level of tangible 
equity allocated to the CGU and its capital cash flows could move over time. The impact of a 50bps increase in capital ratio is quantified 
below.

Accruals, provisions, contingent liabilities and legal proceedings

The notes included in this section focus on the Group’s accruals, provisions and contingent liabilities. Provisions are recognised for 
present obligations arising as consequences of past events where it is probable that a transfer of economic benefit will be necessary to 
settle the obligation, and it can be reliably estimated. Contingent liabilities reflect potential liabilities that are not recognised on the 
balance sheet.

Provisions are recognised for present obligations arising as consequences of past events where it is more likely than not that a transfer 
of economic benefit will be necessary to settle the obligation, which can be reliably estimated.
Critical accounting estimates and judgements

The financial reporting of provisions involves a significant degree of judgement and is complex. Identifying whether a present obligation 
exists and estimating the probability, timing, nature and quantum of the outflows that may arise from past events requires judgements 
to be made based on the specific facts and circumstances relating to individual events and often requires specialist professional advice. 
When matters are at an early stage, accounting judgements and estimates can be difficult because of the high degree of uncertainty 
involved. Management continues to monitor matters as they develop to re-evaluate on an ongoing basis whether provisions should be 
recognised, however there can remain a wide range of possible outcomes and uncertainties, particularly in relation to legal, competition 
and regulatory matters, and as a result it is often not practicable to make meaningful estimates even when matters are at a more 
advanced stage. 

The amount that is recognised as a provision can also be very sensitive to the assumptions made in calculating it. This gives rise to a 
large range of potential outcomes which require judgement in determining an appropriate provision level. See Note 25 for more detail of 
legal, competition and regulatory matters.

Accruals, provisions, contingent liabilities and legal proceedings

Redundancy and restructuring

These provisions comprise the estimated cost of restructuring, including redundancy costs where an obligation exists. For example, 
when the Group has a detailed formal plan for restructuring a business and has raised valid expectations in those affected by the 
restructuring by announcing its main features or starting to implement the plan. 
Customer redress

Customer redress provisions comprise the estimated cost of making redress payments to customers, clients and counterparties for 
losses or damages associated with inappropriate judgement in the execution of the Group’s business activities. 
Legal, competition and regulatory matters

The Group is engaged in various legal proceedings, both in the UK and a number of other overseas jurisdictions, including the US. For 
further information in relation to legal proceedings and discussion of the associated uncertainties, refer to Note 25. 
Sundry provisions

This category includes provisions that do not fit into any of the other categories, such as fraud losses and dilapidation provisions.
Undrawn contractually committed facilities and guarantees

Impairment allowance under IFRS 9 considers both the drawn and the undrawn counterparty exposure. For retail portfolios, the total 
impairment allowance is allocated to the drawn exposure to the extent that the allowance does not exceed the exposure as ECL is not 
reported separately. Any excess is reported on the liability side of the balance sheet as a provision. For wholesale portfolios, the 
impairment allowance on the undrawn exposure is reported on the liability side of the balance sheet as a provision. For further 
information, refer to the Credit risk section for loan commitments and financial guarantees on page 298.
24 Contingent liabilities and commitments

Accounting for contingent liabilities 

Contingent liabilities are possible obligations whose existence will be confirmed only by uncertain future events and present obligations 
where the transfer of economic resources is uncertain or cannot be reliably measured. Contingent liabilities are not recognised on the 
balance sheet but are disclosed unless the likelihood of an outflow of economic resources is remote.

The following table summarises the nominal principal amount of contingent liabilities and commitments which are not recorded on-
balance sheet:

Guarantees and letters of credit pledged as collateral security

25 Legal, competition and regulatory matters

The Group faces legal, competition and regulatory challenges, many of which are beyond our control. The extent of the impact of these 
matters cannot always be predicted but may materially impact our operations, financial results, condition and prospects. Matters arising 
from a set of similar circumstances can give rise to either a contingent liability or a provision, or both, depending on the relevant facts 
and circumstances. 

The recognition of provisions in relation to such matters involves critical accounting estimates and judgments in accordance with the 
relevant accounting policies applicable to Note 24, Provisions. We have not disclosed an estimate of the potential financial impact or 
effect on the Group of contingent liabilities where it is not currently practicable to do so. Various matters detailed in this note seek 
damages of an unspecified amount. While certain matters specify the damages claimed, such claimed amounts do not necessarily 
reflect the Group’s potential financial exposure in respect of those matters.

Matters are ordered under headings corresponding to the financial statements in which they are disclosed. 
1. Barclays PLC and Barclays Bank PLC
Investigations into certain advisory services agreements and other proceedings
FCA proceedings

In 2008, Barclays Bank PLC and Qatar Holdings LLC entered into two advisory service agreements (the Agreements). The Financial 
Conduct Authority (FCA) conducted an investigation into whether the Agreements may have related to Barclays PLC’s capital raisings 
in June and November 2008 (the Capital Raisings) and therefore should have been disclosed in the announcements or public 
documents relating to the Capital Raisings. In 2013, the FCA issued warning notices (the Warning Notices) finding that Barclays PLC and 
Barclays Bank PLC acted recklessly and in breach of certain disclosure-related listing rules, and that Barclays PLC was also in breach of 
Listing Principle 3. The financial penalty provided in the Warning Notices was £50m. Barclays PLC and Barclays Bank PLC contested the 
findings. In September 2022, the FCA’s Regulatory Decisions Committee (RDC) issued Decision Notices finding that Barclays PLC and 
Barclays Bank PLC breached certain disclosure-related listing rules. The RDC also found that in relation to the disclosures made in the 
Capital Raising of November 2008, Barclays PLC and Barclays Bank PLC acted recklessly, and that Barclays PLC breached Listing 
Principle 3. The RDC upheld the combined penalty of £50m on Barclays PLC and Barclays Bank PLC, the same penalty as in the Warning 
Notices. Barclays PLC and Barclays Bank PLC have referred the RDC’s findings to the Upper Tribunal for reconsideration. 
Other proceedings

In November 2023, Barclays received requests for arbitration from two Jersey special purpose vehicles connected to PCP International 
Finance Limited asserting claims in relation to the October 2008 capital raising. Barclays is defending these claims.

Regulators and law enforcement agencies, including certain competition authorities, from a number of governments have conducted 
investigations relating to Barclays Bank PLC’s involvement in allegedly manipulating certain financial benchmarks, such as LIBOR. 
Various individuals and corporates in a range of jurisdictions have threatened or brought civil actions against the Group and other banks 
in relation to the alleged manipulation of LIBOR and/or other benchmarks. 
USD LIBOR civil actions

The majority of the USD LIBOR cases, which have been filed in various US jurisdictions, have been consolidated for pre-trial purposes in 
the US District Court in the Southern District of New York (SDNY). The complaints are substantially similar and allege, among other 
things, that Barclays PLC, Barclays Bank PLC, Barclays Capital Inc. (BCI) and other financial institutions individually and collectively 
violated provisions of the US Sherman Antitrust Act (Antitrust Act), the US Commodity Exchange Act (CEA), the US Racketeer 
Influenced and Corrupt Organizations Act (RICO), the US Securities Exchange Act of 1934 and various state laws by manipulating USD 
LIBOR rates.

Putative class actions and individual actions seek unspecified damages with the exception of one lawsuit, in which the plaintiffs are 
seeking no less than $100m in actual damages and additional punitive damages against all defendants, including Barclays Bank PLC. 
Some of the lawsuits also seek trebling of damages under the Antitrust Act and RICO. 
Sterling LIBOR civil actions

In 2016, two putative class actions filed in the SDNY against Barclays Bank PLC, BCI and other Sterling LIBOR panel banks alleging, 
among other things, that the defendants manipulated the Sterling LIBOR rate in violation of the Antitrust Act, CEA and RICO, were 
consolidated. The defendants’ motion to dismiss the claims was granted in 2018. The plaintiffs have appealed the dismissal.
Japanese Yen LIBOR civil actions

In 2012, a putative class action was filed in the SDNY against Barclays Bank PLC and other Japanese Yen LIBOR panel banks by a lead 
plaintiff involved in exchange-traded derivatives and members of the Japanese Bankers Association’s Euroyen Tokyo Interbank 
Offered Rate (Euroyen TIBOR) panel. The complaint alleges, among other things, manipulation of the Euroyen TIBOR and Yen LIBOR 
rates and breaches of the CEA and the Antitrust Act. In 2014, the court dismissed the plaintiff’s antitrust claims, and, in 2020, the court 
dismissed the plaintiff’s remaining CEA claims.  

In 2015, a second putative class action, making similar allegations to the above class action, was filed in the SDNY against Barclays PLC, 
Barclays Bank PLC and BCI. Barclays and the plaintiffs reached a settlement of $17.75m for both actions, which received final court 
approval in March 2023. This matter is now concluded.
ICE LIBOR civil action

In August 2020, an action related to the LIBOR benchmark administered by the Intercontinental Exchange Inc. and certain of its 
affiliates (ICE) was filed by a group of individual plaintiffs in the US District Court for the Northern District of California on behalf of

individual borrowers and consumers of loans and credit cards with variable interest rates linked to USD ICE LIBOR. The plaintiffs’ motion 
seeking, among other things, preliminary and permanent injunctions to enjoin the defendants from continuing to set LIBOR or enforce 
any financial instrument that relies in whole or in part on USD LIBOR was denied. The defendants’ motion to dismiss the case was 
granted in September 2022. The plaintiffs filed an amended complaint, which was dismissed in October 2023. The plaintiffs are 
appealing the dismissal.
Non-US benchmarks civil actions

There remains one claim, issued in 2017, against Barclays Bank PLC and other banks in the UK in connection with alleged manipulation 
of LIBOR. Proceedings have also been brought in a number of other jurisdictions in Europe, Argentina and Israel relating to alleged 
manipulation of LIBOR and EURIBOR. Additional proceedings in other jurisdictions may be brought in the future. 
Foreign Exchange investigations and related civil actions 

The Group has been the subject of investigations in various jurisdictions in relation to certain sales and trading practices in the Foreign 
Exchange market. Settlements were reached in various jurisdictions in connection with these investigations, including the EU and US. 
The financial impact of any remaining ongoing investigations is not expected to be material to the Group’s operating results, cash flows 
or financial position. Various individuals and corporates in a range of jurisdictions have threatened or brought civil actions against the 
Group and other banks in relation to alleged manipulation of Foreign Exchange markets. 
US FX opt out civil action 

In 2018, Barclays Bank PLC and BCI settled a consolidated action filed in the SDNY, alleging manipulation of Foreign Exchange markets 
(Consolidated FX Action), for a total amount of $384m. Also in 2018, a group of plaintiffs, who opted out of the Consolidated FX Action, 
filed a complaint in the SDNY against Barclays PLC, Barclays Bank PLC, BCI and other defendants. Some of the plaintiffs’ claims were 
dismissed in 2020. Barclays PLC, Barclays Bank PLC, and BCI have reached a settlement of all claims against them in the matter. A 
settlement payment was made in April 2023 and the matter is now concluded.	The financial impact of this settlement is not material to 
the Group’s operating results, cash flows or financial position.
US retail basis civil action 

In 2015, a putative class action was filed against several international banks, including Barclays PLC and BCI, on behalf of a proposed 
class of individuals who exchanged currencies on a retail basis at bank branches (Retail Basis Claims). The SDNY has ruled that the Retail 
Basis Claims are not covered by the settlement agreement in the Consolidated FX Action. The Court subsequently dismissed all Retail 
Basis  Claims  against  the  Group  and  all  other  defendants.  The  plaintiffs  filed  an  amended  complaint.  The  defendants’  motion  for 
summary judgment was granted in March 2023, dismissing the plaintiffs’ remaining claims. The plaintiffs have appealed the decision.  
Non-US FX civil actions

Legal proceedings have been brought or are threatened against Barclays PLC, Barclays Bank PLC, BCI and Barclays Execution Services 
Limited (BX) in connection with alleged manipulation of Foreign Exchange in the UK, a number of other jurisdictions in Europe, Israel, 
Brazil and Australia. Additional proceedings may be brought in the future.

The above-mentioned proceedings include two purported class actions filed against Barclays PLC, Barclays Bank PLC, BX, BCI and 
other financial institutions in the UK Competition Appeal Tribunal (CAT) in 2019. The CAT refused to certify these claims in the first 
quarter of 2022.  In July 2023 (as amended in November 2023), the Court of Appeal overturned the CAT’s decision and found that the 
claims should be certified on an opt out basis. The Court of Appeal upheld the CAT’s determination as to which of the two purported 
class representatives should be chosen to bring the claim. Subject to any further appeal, only the claim brought by the chosen class 
representative will now proceed in the CAT. Also in 2019, a separate claim was filed in the UK in the High Court of Justice (High Court), 
and subsequently transferred to the CAT, by various banks and asset management firms against Barclays Bank PLC and other financial 
institutions alleging breaches of European and UK competition laws related to FX trading. This claim has been settled as part of the 
settlement payment referred to under the US FX opt out civil action above and the matter is now concluded.
Metals-related civil actions 

A US civil complaint alleging manipulation of the price of silver in violation of the CEA, the Antitrust Act and state antitrust and consumer 
protection laws was brought by a proposed class of plaintiffs against a number of banks, including Barclays Bank PLC, BCI and BX, and 
transferred to the SDNY. The complaint was dismissed against these Barclays entities and certain other defendants in 2018, and 
against the remaining defendants in May 2023. The plaintiffs have appealed the dismissal of the complaint against all defendants.

Civil actions have also been filed in Canadian courts against Barclays PLC, Barclays Bank PLC, Barclays Capital Canada Inc. and BCI on 
behalf of proposed classes of plaintiffs alleging manipulation of gold and silver prices. 
US residential mortgage related civil actions 

There  are  two  US  Residential  Mortgage-Backed  Securities  (RMBS)  related  civil  actions  arising  from  unresolved  repurchase  requests 
submitted  by  Trustees  for  certain  RMBS,  alleging  breaches  of  various  loan-level  representations  and  warranties  (R&Ws)  made  by 
Barclays  Bank  PLC  and/or  a  subsidiary  acquired  in  2007.  In  one  action,  the  parties  have  agreed  to  settle  the  litigation.  The  financial 
impact of the settlement is not material to the Group’s operating results, cash flows or financial position. Barclays’ motion to dismiss 
the other repurchase action was denied in October 2023. Barclays is appealing the decision. 
Government and agency securities civil actions 
Treasury auction securities civil actions

Consolidated putative class action complaints filed in US federal court against Barclays Bank PLC, BCI and other financial institutions 
under the Antitrust Act and state common law allege that the defendants (i) conspired to manipulate the US Treasury securities market 
and/or (ii) conspired to prevent the creation of certain platforms by boycotting or threatening to boycott such trading platforms. The 
court dismissed the consolidated action in March 2021.The plaintiffs filed an amended complaint. The defendants’ motion to dismiss

the  amended  complaint  was  granted  in  March  2022.  The  plaintiffs  appealed  this  decision,  and  in  February  2024  the  appellate  court 
affirmed the dismissal.

In addition, certain plaintiffs have filed a related, direct action against BCI and certain other financial institutions, alleging that defendants 
conspired to fix and manipulate the US Treasury securities market in violation of the Antitrust Act, the CEA and state common law. This 
action remains stayed.
Supranational, Sovereign and Agency bonds civil actions

Civil antitrust actions have been filed in the SDNY and Federal Court of Canada in Toronto against Barclays Bank PLC, BCI, BX, Barclays 
Capital Securities Limited and, with respect to the civil action filed in Canada only, Barclays Capital Canada, Inc. and other financial 
institutions alleging that the defendants conspired to fix prices and restrain competition in the market for US dollar-denominated 
Supranational, Sovereign and Agency bonds. The SDNY actions were dismissed and these matters are now concluded. 

In the Federal Court of Canada action, the parties have reached a settlement in principle, which will require court approval. The financial 
impact of the settlement is not expected to be material to the Group’s operating results, cash flows or financial position. 
Variable Rate Demand Obligations civil actions

Civil actions have been filed against Barclays Bank PLC and BCI and other financial institutions alleging the defendants conspired or 
colluded to artificially inflate interest rates set for Variable Rate Demand Obligations (VRDOs). VRDOs are municipal bonds with interest 
rates that reset on a periodic basis, most commonly weekly. Two actions in state court have been filed by private plaintiffs on behalf of 
the states of Illinois and California. Three putative class action complaints have been consolidated in the SDNY. In the consolidated 
SDNY class action, certain of the plaintiffs’ claims were dismissed in November 2020 and June 2022 and the plaintiffs’ motion for class 
certification was granted in September 2023, which means the case may proceed as a class action. The defendants are appealing this 
decision. In the California action, the California appeals court reversed the dismissal of the plaintiffs’ claims in April 2023. In the Illinois 
action, the defendants reached a settlement with the Attorney General for the State of Illinois to resolve the litigation. The court 
approved the settlement in October 2023 and dismissed the matter. The financial impact of the settlement is not material to the 
Group’s operating results, cash flows or financial position. This matter is now concluded.
Odd-lot corporate bonds antitrust class action

In 2020, BCI, together with other financial institutions, were named as defendants in a putative class action. The complaint alleges a 
conspiracy to boycott developing electronic trading platforms for odd-lots and price fixing. The plaintiffs demand unspecified money 
damages. The defendants’ motion to dismiss was granted in 2021 and the plaintiffs have appealed the dismissal.  
Credit Default Swap civil action

A putative antitrust class action is pending in New Mexico federal court against Barclays Bank PLC, BCI and various other financial 
institutions. The plaintiffs, the New Mexico State Investment Council and certain New Mexico pension funds, allege that the defendants 
conspired to manipulate the benchmark price used to value Credit Default Swap (CDS) contracts at settlement (i.e. the CDS final 
auction price). The plaintiffs allege violations of US antitrust laws and the CEA, and unjust enrichment under state law. The defendants’ 
motion to dismiss was denied in June 2023.
Interest rate swap and credit default swap US civil actions 

Barclays PLC, Barclays Bank PLC and BCI, together with other financial institutions that act as market makers for interest rate swaps 
(IRS), are named as defendants in several antitrust actions, including one putative class action and individual actions brought by certain 
swap execution facilities, which are consolidated in the SDNY. The complaints allege the defendants conspired to prevent the 
development of exchanges for IRS and demand unspecified money damages. The plaintiffs’ motion for class certification was denied in 
December 2023, meaning the case cannot proceed as a class action. The plaintiffs have sought the court’s leave to appeal that 
decision. 

In 2017, Tera Group Inc. (Tera) filed a separate civil antitrust action in the SDNY claiming that certain conduct alleged in the IRS cases 
also caused Tera to suffer harm with respect to the Credit Default Swaps market. In 2019, the court dismissed Tera’s claims for unjust 
enrichment and tortious interference but denied motions to dismiss the antitrust claims. Tera filed an amended complaint in January 
2020. Barclays’ motion to dismiss all claims was granted in August 2023. Tera has filed a Notice of Appeal.	
BDC Finance L.L.C. 

In 2008, BDC Finance L.L.C. (BDC) filed a complaint in the Supreme Court of the State of New York (NY Supreme Court), demanding 
damages  of  $298m,  alleging  that  Barclays  Bank  PLC  had  breached  a  contract  in  connection  with  a  portfolio  of  total  return  swaps 
governed by an ISDA Master Agreement (the Master Agreement). Following a trial, the court ruled in 2018 that Barclays Bank PLC was 
not a defaulting party, which was affirmed on appeal. In April 2021, the trial court entered judgment in favour of Barclays Bank PLC for 
$3.3m and as yet to be determined legal fees and costs. BDC appealed. In January 2022, the appellate court reversed the trial court’s 
summary  judgment  decision  in  favour  of  Barclays  Bank  PLC  and  remanded  the  case  to  the  lower  court  for  further  proceedings.  The 
parties filed cross-motions on the scope of trial. In January 2024, the court ruled in Barclays’ favour. BDC is appealing, and the trial is 
adjourned until the appeal is decided.

In 2011, BDC’s investment advisor, BDCM Fund Adviser, LLC and its parent company, Black Diamond Capital Holdings, LLC, also sued 
Barclays Bank PLC and BCI in Connecticut State Court for unspecified damages allegedly resulting from Barclays Bank PLC’s conduct 
relating to the Master Agreement, asserting claims for violation of the Connecticut Unfair Trade Practices Act and tortious interference 
with business and prospective business relations. This case has been withdrawn.

Civil actions in respect of the US Anti-Terrorism Act 

Eight civil actions, on behalf of more than 4,000 plaintiffs, were filed in US federal courts in the US District Court in the Eastern District of 
New York (EDNY) and SDNY against Barclays Bank PLC and a number of other banks. The complaints generally allege that Barclays Bank 
PLC and those banks engaged in a conspiracy to facilitate US dollar-denominated transactions for the Iranian Government and various 
Iranian banks, which in turn funded acts of terrorism that injured or killed the plaintiffs or the plaintiffs’ family members. The plaintiffs 
seek to recover damages for pain, suffering and mental anguish under the provisions of the US Anti-Terrorism Act, which allow for the 
trebling of any proven damages. 

The court granted the defendants’ motions to dismiss three out of the six actions in the EDNY. The plaintiffs appealed in one action and 
the dismissal was affirmed, and judgment was entered, in January 2023. The court has given the plaintiffs until February 2024 to make a 
motion to vacate the judgment. The other two dismissed actions in the EDNY were consolidated into one action. The plaintiffs in that 
action,  and  in  one  other  action  in  the  EDNY,  filed  amended  complaints  in  December  2023.  The  two  other  actions  in  the  EDNY  are 
currently stayed. Out of the two actions in the SDNY, the court granted the defendants’ motion to dismiss the first action. That action is 
stayed, and the second SDNY action is stayed pending any appeal on the dismissal of the first. 
Shareholder derivative action

In November 2020, a purported Barclays shareholder filed a putative derivative action in New York state court against BCI and a number 
of  current  and  former  members  of  the  Board  of  Directors  of  Barclays  PLC  and  senior  executives  or  employees  of  the  Group.  The 
shareholder filed the claim on behalf of nominal defendant Barclays PLC, alleging that the individual defendants harmed the company 
through breaches of their duties, including under the Companies Act 2006. The plaintiff seeks damages on behalf of Barclays PLC for 
the  losses  that  Barclays  PLC  allegedly  suffered  as  a  result  of  these  alleged  breaches.  An  amended  complaint  was  filed  in  April  2021, 
which BCI and certain other defendants moved to dismiss. The motion to dismiss was granted in April 2022. The plaintiff appealed the 
decision, and the dismissal was unanimously affirmed in June 2023 by the First Judicial Department in New York. The plaintiff has sought 
leave to appeal the First Judicial Department’s decision to the New York Court of Appeals.
Derivative transactions civil action

In 2021, Vestia, a Dutch housing association, brought a claim against Barclays Bank PLC in the UK in the High Court in relation to a series 
of derivative transactions entered into with Barclays Bank PLC between 2008 and 2011, seeking damages of £329m. Barclays Bank PLC 
is defending the claim and has made a counterclaim.
Skilled person review in relation to historic timeshare loans and associated matters 

Clydesdale Financial Services Limited (CFS), which trades as Barclays Partner Finance and houses Barclays’ point-of-sale finance 
business, was required by the FCA to undertake a skilled person review in 2020 following concerns about historic affordability 
assessments for certain loans to customers in connection with timeshare purchases. The skilled person review was concluded in 2021. 
CFS complied fully with the skilled person review requirements, including carrying out certain remediation measures. CFS was not 
required to conduct a full back book review. Instead, CFS reviewed limited historic lending to ascertain whether its practices caused 
customer harm and is remediating any examples of harm. This work was substantially completed during 2023, utilising provisions 
booked to account for any remediations. 
Motor finance commission arrangements 

In January 2024, the FCA announced that it was appointing a skilled person to undertake a review of the historical use of discretionary 
commission arrangements and sales in the motor finance market across several firms.  This follows two final decisions by the UK 
Financial Ombudsman Service (FOS), including one upholding a complaint against CFS in relation to commission arrangements and 
disclosure in the sale of motor finance products and a number of complaints and court claims, including some against CFS.  Barclays will 
co-operate fully with the FCA’s skilled person review, the outcome of which is unknown, including any potential financial impact.  The 
FCA plans to set out next steps on this matter by the end of September 2024. Barclays ceased operating in the motor finance market in 
late 2019. 
Over-issuance of securities in the US

In March 2022, executive management became aware that Barclays Bank PLC had issued securities materially in excess of the set 
amount under its US shelf registration statements. As a result, Barclays Bank PLC commenced a rescission offer on 1 August 2022, by 
which Barclays Bank PLC offered to repurchase relevant affected securities from certain holders, which expired on 12 September 2022. 
Further, in September 2022, the SEC announced the resolution of its investigation of Barclays PLC and Barclays Bank PLC relating to 
such over-issuance of securities. 

In September 2022, a purported class action claim was filed in the US District Court in Manhattan seeking to hold Barclays PLC, Barclays 
Bank PLC and former and current executives responsible for declines in the price of Barclays PLC’s American depositary receipts, which 
the plaintiffs claim occurred as a result of alleged misstatements and omissions in its public disclosures. The defendants have moved to 
dismiss the case. In addition, holders of a series of ETNs have brought claims against Barclays PLC, Barclays Bank PLC, and former and 
current executives and board members in the US alleging, among other things, that Barclays’ failure to disclose that these ETNs were 
unregistered securities misled investors and that, as a result, Barclays is liable for the holders’ alleged losses following the suspension of 
further sales and issuances of such series of ETNs. Two such actions are purported class actions that have been consolidated into a 
single action in federal court in New York. Barclays has moved to dismiss the complaint.

Any liabilities, claims or actions in connection with the over-issuance of securities under Barclays Bank PLC’s US shelf registration 
statements could have an adverse effect on the Group’s business, financial condition, results of operations and reputation as a 
frequent issuer in the securities markets.

HM Revenue & Customs (HMRC) assessments concerning UK Value Added Tax

In 2018, HMRC issued notices that have the effect of either removing certain Barclays overseas subsidiaries that have operations in the 
UK from Barclays’ UK VAT group or preventing them from joining it. Supplies between members of a UK VAT group are generally free 
from VAT. The notices had both retrospective and prospective effect. Barclays has appealed HMRC’s decisions to the First Tier 
Tribunal (Tax Chamber) in relation to both the retrospective VAT assessments and the on-going VAT payments made since 2018. 
£181m of VAT (inclusive of interest) was assessed retrospectively by HMRC covering the periods 2014 to 2018, of which approximately 
£128m is expected to be attributed to Barclays Bank UK PLC and £53m to Barclays Bank PLC. This retrospectively assessed VAT was 
paid in 2018 and an asset, adjusted to reflect expected eventual recovery, is recognised. Since 2018 Barclays has paid, and recognised 
as an expense, VAT on intra-group supplies from the relevant subsidiaries to the members of the VAT group.	
FCA investigation into transaction monitoring

The FCA has been investigating Barclays’ compliance with UK money laundering regulations and the FCA’s rules and Principles for 
Businesses in an enforcement investigation which is focused on aspects of Barclays’ transaction monitoring in relation to certain 
business lines now in Barclays Bank UK PLC. The FCA has informed Barclays that it is closing the enforcement investigation into this 
matter. 
3. Barclays PLC
Civil action in respect of Barclays’ statements regarding the relationship between its former CEO and Jeffrey Epstein

In November 2023, a purported class action was filed in federal court in California against Barclays PLC and a number of current and 
former members of the Board of Directors of Barclays PLC. The complaint seeks to hold the defendants responsible for declines in the 
price of Barclays PLC’s American depositary receipts, which the plaintiffs claim occurred as a result of alleged misstatements and 
omissions in Barclays’ public disclosures relating to its former CEO’s relationship with Jeffrey Epstein.
Alternative trading systems

In 2020, a claim was brought against Barclays PLC in the UK in the High Court by various shareholders regarding Barclays PLC’s share 
price based on the allegations contained within a complaint by the New York State Attorney General (NYAG) in 2014. Such claim was 
settled in 2016, as previously disclosed. The more recent claim seeks unquantified damages and Barclays is defending the claim. The 
NYAG complaint was filed against Barclays PLC and BCI in the NY Supreme Court alleging, among other things, that Barclays PLC and 
BCI engaged in fraud and deceptive practices in connection with LX, BCI’s SEC-registered alternative trading system. 
General

The Group is engaged in various other legal, competition and regulatory matters in the UK, the US and a number of other overseas 
jurisdictions. It is subject to legal proceedings brought by and against the Group which arise in the ordinary course of business from time 
to time, including (but not limited to) disputes in relation to contracts, securities, guarantees, debt collection, consumer credit, fraud, 
trusts, client assets, competition, data management and protection, intellectual property, money laundering, financial crime, 
employment, environmental and other statutory and common law issues.

The Group is also subject to enquiries and examinations, requests for information, audits, investigations and legal and other 
proceedings by regulators, governmental and other public bodies in connection with (but not limited to) consumer protection 
measures, measures to combat money laundering and financial crime, compliance with legislation and regulation, wholesale trading 
activity and other areas of banking and business activities in which the Group is or has been engaged. The Group is cooperating with the 
relevant authorities and keeping all relevant agencies briefed as appropriate in relation to these matters and others described in this 
note on an ongoing basis.

At the present time, Barclays PLC does not expect the ultimate resolution of any of these other matters to have a material adverse 
effect on the Group’s financial position. However, in light of the uncertainties involved in such matters and the matters specifically 
described in this note, there can be no assurance that the outcome of a particular matter or matters (including formerly active matters 
or those matters arising after the date of this note) will not be material to Barclays PLC’s results, operations or cash flows for a particular 
period, depending on, among other things, the amount of the loss resulting from the matter(s) and the amount of profit otherwise 
reported for the reporting period.

Dated subordinated liabilities are issued by Barclays PLC, Barclays Bank PLC and its subsidiaries for the development and expansion of 
their businesses and to strengthen their respective capital bases. The principal terms of the dated subordinated liabilities are described 
below:
Subordination

Dated subordinated liabilities issued by Barclays PLC ranks behind the claims against Barclays PLC of unsecured unsubordinated 
creditors but before the claims of the holders of its equity.

All dated subordinated liabilities externally issued by Barclays Bank PLC rank behind the claims against Barclays Bank PLC of depositors 
and other unsecured unsubordinated creditors but before the claims of the holders of its equity. The dated subordinated liabilities 
externally issued by other subsidiaries are similarly subordinated as the external subordinated liabilities issued by Barclays Bank PLC.
Interest

Interest on the Floating Rate Notes is fixed periodically in advance, based on the related market rates. 

Interest on Fixed Rate Notes is set by reference to market rates at the time of issuance and fixed until maturity.

Interest on the 4.836% USD Fixed Rate Subordinated Callable Notes, 3.75% SGD Fixed Rate Resetting Subordinated Callable Notes, 
3.75% GBP Fixed Rate Resetting Subordinated Callable Notes, 3.811% USD  Fixed Rate Resetting Subordinated Callable notes, 1.125%  
EUR Fixed Rate Resetting Subordinated Callable Notes, 3.564% USD Fixed Rate Resetting Subordinated Callable Notes, and the  
8.407% GBP Fixed Rate Resetting Subordinated Callable Notes  are fixed until the call date. After the respective call dates, in the event 
that they are not redeemed, the interest rates will be reset and fixed until maturity based on a market rate. Interest on the 5.088%  USD 
Fixed-to-Floating Rate Subordinated Callable Notes and 7.119% USD  Fixed-to-Floating Rate Subordinated Callable Notes are fixed 
until the call date. After the call date, in the event that they are not redeemed, the interest rate will reset periodically in advance based 
on market rates.
Repayment

Those subordinated liabilities with a call date are repayable at the option of the issuer on such call date in accordance with the 
conditions governing the respective debt obligations, some in whole or in part, and some only in whole. The remaining dated 
subordinated liabilities outstanding at 31 December 2023 are redeemable only on maturity, subject in particular cases to provisions 
allowing an early redemption in the event of certain changes in tax law, or to certain changes in legislation or regulations. 

Any repayments prior to maturity require, in the case of Barclays PLC and Barclays Bank PLC, the prior consent of the PRA, or in the 
case of the overseas issues, the approval of the local regulator for that jurisdiction and of the PRA in certain circumstances.

There are no committed facilities in existence at the balance sheet date which permit the refinancing of debt beyond the date of 
maturity.

Capital instruments, equity and reserves

The principal terms of the AT1 securities are described below:
▪ AT1 securities rank behind the claims against Barclays PLC of i) unsubordinated creditors; ii) claims which are expressed to be 

subordinated to the claims of unsubordinated creditors of Barclays PLC but not further or otherwise; or iii) claims which are, or are 
expressed to be, junior to the claims of other creditors of Barclays PLC, whether subordinated or unsubordinated, other than claims 
which rank, or are expressed to rank, pari passu with, or junior to, the claims of holders of the AT1 securities.

▪ AT1 securities are undated and are redeemable, at the option of Barclays PLC, in whole on (i) the initial reset date, or on any fifth 

anniversary after the initial reset date or (ii) any day falling in a named period ending on the initial reset date, or on any fifth anniversary 
after the initial reset date. In addition, the AT1 securities are redeemable, at the option of Barclays PLC, in whole in the event of 
certain changes in the tax or regulatory treatment of the securities. Any redemptions require the prior consent of the PRA.

▪

Interest on the AT1 securities will be due and payable only at the sole discretion of Barclays PLC, and Barclays PLC has sole and 
absolute discretion at all times and for any reason to cancel (in whole or in part) any interest payment that would otherwise be payable 
on any interest payment date.

Barclays Bank PLC and protective rights of non-controlling interests

Barclays PLC holds 100% of the voting rights of Barclays Bank PLC. As at 31 December 2023, Barclays Bank PLC has in issue preference 
shares and Upper Tier 2 instruments. These are non-controlling interests to the Group.

A fixed coupon rate is attached to all Upper Tier 2 instruments until the initial call date.

After the initial call date, in the event they are not redeemed, coupon payments in relation to the  6.125% Undated Notes are fixed 
periodically in advance for five-year periods based on market rates. Coupon payments for all other Upper Tier 2 instruments are at rates 
fixed periodically in advance based on market rates.

The payment of preference share dividends and Upper Tier 2 coupons are typically at the discretion of Barclays Bank PLC, except for 
coupon payments that become compulsory where Barclays PLC has declared or paid a dividend on ordinary shares, or in certain cases, 
any class of preference shares, in the preceding six-month period.  Coupons not paid become payable in each case if such a dividend is 
subsequently paid or in certain other circumstances. No dividend or coupon payments may be made unless Barclays Bank PLC satisfies 
a specified solvency test. Under the terms of these instruments, Barclays PLC may not pay dividends on ordinary shares until a dividend 
or coupon is next paid on these instruments or the instruments are redeemed or purchased by Barclays Bank PLC. There are no 
restrictions on Barclays Bank PLC’s ability to remit capital to the Parent as a result of these issued instruments. 

Preference share redemptions are typically at the discretion of Barclays Bank PLC and are redeemable in whole, but not in part, at the 
initial call date and on any dividend payment date after the initial call date, pursuant to their respective terms. Upper Tier 2 instruments 
are repayable, at the option of Barclays Bank PLC in whole at the initial call date and on any fifth anniversary after the initial call date. In 
addition, each issue of Upper Tier 2 instruments is repayable, at the option of Barclays Bank PLC, in whole for certain tax reasons, either 
at any time, or on an interest payment date. There are no events of default except non-payment of principal or mandatory interest. Any 
repayments or redemptions require the prior consent of the PRA, and in respect of the preference shares, any such redemption will be 
subject to the Companies Act 2006 and the Articles of Barclays Bank PLC.

30 Staff costs

Accounting for staff costs

Deferred cash and share awards are made to employees to incentivise performance over the period employees provide services. To 
receive payment under an award, employees must provide service over the vesting period. The period over which the expense for 
deferred cash and share awards is recognised is based upon the period employees consider their services contribute to the awards. For 
past awards, the Group considers that it is appropriate to recognise the awards over the period from the date of grant to the date that 
the awards vest. In relation to awards granted from 2017, the Group, taking into account the changing employee understanding 
surrounding those awards, considered it appropriate for expense to be recognised over the vesting period including the financial year 
prior to the grant date.  

The accounting policies for share-based payments, and pensions and other post-retirement benefits are included in Note 31 and Note 
32 respectively.

31 Share-based payments

Accounting for share-based payments

Employee incentives include awards in the form of shares and share options, as well as offering employees the opportunity to purchase 
shares on favourable terms. The cost of the employee services received in respect of the shares or share options granted is recognised 
in the income statement over the period that employees provide services. The overall cost of the award is calculated using the number 
of shares and options expected to vest and the fair value of the shares or options at the date of grant. 

The number of shares and options expected to vest takes into account the likelihood that performance and service conditions included 
in the terms of the awards will be met. For other share-based payment schemes such as Sharesave and Sharepurchase, there are non-
vesting conditions which must be met. Failure to meet the non-vesting condition is treated as a cancellation, resulting in an acceleration 
of recognition of the cost of the employee services.

The fair value of shares is the market price ruling on the grant date, in some cases adjusted to reflect restrictions on transferability. The 
fair value of options granted is determined using the Black Scholes model to estimate the numbers of shares likely to vest. The model 
takes  into  account  the  exercise  price  of  the  option,  the  current  share  price,  the  risk-free  interest  rate,  the  expected  volatility  of  the 
share price over the life of the option and other relevant factors. Market conditions that must be met in order for the award to vest are 
also  reflected  in  the  fair  value  of  the  award,  as  are  any  other  non-vesting  conditions  –  such  as  continuing  to  make  payments  into  a 
share-based savings scheme. 

The charge for the year arising from share-based payment schemes was as follows:

SVP awards have been granted to participants in the form of a conditional right to receive Barclays PLC shares or provisional allocations 
of Barclays PLC shares which vest or are considered for release over a period of three, four, five or seven years. Participants do not pay 
to receive an award or to receive a release of shares. For awards granted before December 2017, the grantor may also make a dividend 
equivalent  payment  to  participants  on  release  of  a  SVP  award.  SVP  awards  are  also  made  to  eligible  employees  for  recruitment 
purposes. All awards are subject to potential forfeiture in certain leaver scenarios.
Deferred Share Value Plan (DSVP)

The  terms  of  the  DSVP  are  materially  the  same  as  the  terms  of  the  SVP  as  described  above,  save  that  Executive  Directors  are  not 
eligible to participate in the DSVP and the DSVP operates over market purchase shares only.
Other schemes  

In addition to the SVP and DSVP, the Barclays PLC Group operates a number of other schemes settled in Barclays PLC Shares including 
Sharesave  (both  UK  and  Ireland),  Sharepurchase  (both  UK  and  overseas),  and  the  Barclays  PLC  Group  Long  Term  Incentive  Plan.  A 
delivery of upfront shares to ‘Material Risk Takers’ can be made as a Share Incentive Award (Holding Period) under the SVP.

Employee benefits

SVP and DSVP are nil cost awards on which the performance conditions are substantially completed at the date of grant. Consequently, 
the fair value of these awards is based on the market value at that date.

Sharesave has a contractual life of 3 years and 5 years, the expected volatility is 34.10% for 3 years and 33.12% for 5 years. The risk free 
interest  rates  used  for  valuations  are  4.60%  and  4.36%  for  3  years  and  5  years  respectively.  The  pure  dividend  yield  rates  used  for 
valuations are 5.27% and 5.02% for 3 years and 5 years respectively. The repo rates used for valuations are (0.50)% and (0.57)% for 
3 years and 5 years respectively. The inputs into the model such as risk free interest rate, expected volatility, pure dividend yield rates 
and repo rates are derived from market data.

There were no significant modifications to the share-based payments arrangements in 2023 and 2022.

As at 31 December 2023, the total liability arising from cash-settled share-based payments transactions was £5m (2022: £5m).
Holdings of Barclays PLC shares and hedges

Various employee benefit trusts established by the Group hold shares in Barclays PLC to meet obligations under the Barclays share-
based payment schemes. The total number of Barclays shares held in these employee benefit trusts at 31 December 2023 was 19m 
(2022: 14m). Dividend rights have been waived on all these shares. The total market value of the shares held in trust based on the year 
end share price of £1.54 (2022: £1.59) was £29m (2022: £22m). For accounting of treasury shares, see Note 28.

The Group has entered into physically settled forward contracts to hedge the settlement of certain share-based payment schemes. 
The fixed forward price to be paid under these contracts is £481m and has been recorded in retained earnings.

32 Pensions and post-retirement benefits

Accounting for pensions and post-retirement benefits

The Group operates a number of pension schemes and post-employment benefit schemes.
Defined contribution schemes – the Group recognises contributions due in respect of the accounting period in the income statement. 
Any contributions unpaid at the balance sheet date are included as a liability.
Defined benefit schemes – the Group recognises its obligations to members of each scheme at the period end, less the fair value of the 
scheme assets after applying the asset ceiling test. 

Each scheme’s obligations are calculated using the projected unit credit method. Scheme assets are stated at fair value as at the period 
end.

Changes in pension scheme liabilities or assets (remeasurements) that do not arise from regular pension cost, net interest on net 
defined benefit liabilities or assets, past service costs, settlements or contributions to the scheme, are recognised in other 
comprehensive income. Remeasurements comprise experience adjustments (differences between previous actuarial assumptions 
and what has actually occurred), the effects of changes in actuarial assumptions, return on scheme assets (excluding amounts included 
in the interest on the assets) and any changes in the effect of the asset ceiling restriction (excluding amounts included in the interest on 
the restriction).
Post-employment benefit schemes – the cost of providing healthcare benefits to retired employees is accrued as a liability in the financial 
statements over the period that the employees provide services to the Group, using a methodology similar to that for defined benefit 
pension schemes.
Pension schemes
UK Retirement Fund (UKRF)

The UKRF is the Group’s main scheme, representing 96% (2022: 96%) of the Group’s total retirement benefit obligations. Barclays Bank 
PLC is the principal employer of the UKRF. The UKRF was closed to new entrants on 1 October 2012, and comprises 10 sections, the 
two most significant of which are: 
▪ Afterwork, which comprises a contributory cash balance defined benefit element, and a voluntary defined contribution element. The 
cash balance element is accrued each year and revalued until Normal Retirement Age in line with the increase in Retail Price Index 
(RPI) (up to a maximum of 5% p.a.). The main risks that Barclays runs in relation to Afterwork are limited although additional 
contributions are required if pre-retirement investment returns are not sufficient to provide for the benefits. 

▪ The 1964 Pension Scheme. Most employees recruited before July 1997 built up benefits in this non-contributory defined benefit 
scheme in respect of service up to 31 March 2010. Pensions were calculated by reference to service and pensionable salary. From 
1 April 2010, members became eligible to accrue future service benefits in either Afterwork or the Pension Investment Plan, a historic 
defined contribution section which is now closed to future contributions. The risks that Barclays runs in relation to the 1964 section 
are typical of final salary pension schemes, principally that investment returns fall short of expectations, that inflation exceeds 
expectations, and that retirees live longer than expected. 

Barclays Pension Savings Plan (BPSP)

The BPSP is a defined contribution scheme providing benefits for all new UK hires from 1 October 2012. BPSP is not subject to the 
same investment return, inflation or life expectancy risks for Barclays that defined benefit schemes are. Members’ benefits reflect 
contributions paid and the level of investment returns achieved.
Other

Apart from the UKRF and the BPSP, Barclays operates a number of smaller pension and long-term employee benefits and post-
retirement healthcare plans globally, the largest of which are the US defined benefit and defined contribution schemes. Many of the 
schemes are funded, with assets backing the obligations held in separate legal vehicles such as trusts. Others are operated on an 
unfunded basis. The benefits provided, the approach to funding, and the legal basis of the schemes, reflect local environments.
Governance

The UKRF operates under trust law and is managed and administered on behalf of the members in accordance with the terms of the 
Trust Deed and Rules and all relevant legislation. The Corporate Trustee is Barclays Pension Funds Trustees Limited, a private limited 
company and a wholly owned subsidiary of Barclays Bank PLC. The Trustee is the legal owner of the assets of the UKRF which are held 
separately from the assets of the Group.

The Trustee Board comprises six Management Directors selected by Barclays, of whom three are independent Directors with no 
relationship with Barclays (and who are not members of the UKRF), plus three Member Nominated Directors selected from eligible 
active, deferred or pensioner members who apply for the role.

The BPSP is a Group Personal Pension arrangement which operates as a collection of personal pension plans. Each personal pension 
plan is a direct contract between the employee and the BPSP provider (Legal & General Assurance Society Limited), and is regulated by 
the FCA. 

Similar principles of pension governance apply to the Group’s other pension schemes, depending on local legislation.

Included within the benefit obligation is £694m (2022: £690m) relating to overseas pensions and £201m (2022: £201m) relating to other 
post-employment benefits. 

As at 31 December 2023, the UKRF’s scheme assets were in surplus versus IAS 19 obligations by £3,616m (2022: £4,690m). The 
decrease in the UKRF surplus during the year was driven by lower corporate bond yields and the assets underperforming the discount 
rate.

The weighted average duration of the benefit payments reflected in the defined benefit obligation for the UKRF is 12 years (2022: 13 
years). The UKRF expected benefits promised to date are projected to be paid out for in excess of 50 years, although 30% of the 
benefits are expected to be paid in the next 10 years; 35% in years 11 to 20 and 20% in years 21 to 30. The remainder of the benefits are 
expected to be paid beyond 30 years.

Of the £1,075m (2022: £1,299m) UKRF benefits paid out, £122m (2022: £390m) related to transfers out of the fund.

Notes to the financial statements (continued)
Employee benefits

Where a scheme’s assets exceed its obligation, an asset is recognised to the extent that it does not exceed the present value of future 
contribution holidays or refunds of contributions (the asset ceiling). In the case of the UKRF the asset ceiling is not applied as, in certain 
specified circumstances such as wind-up, the Group expects to be able to recover any surplus. Similarly, a liability in respect of future 
minimum funding requirements is not recognised. The Trustee does not have a substantive right to augment benefits, nor do they have 
the right to wind up the plan except in the dissolution of the Group or termination of contributions by the Group. The application of the 
asset ceiling to other plans and recognition of additional liabilities in respect of future minimum funding requirements are considered on 
an individual plan basis.
Critical accounting estimates and judgements

Actuarial valuation of the scheme's obligation is dependent upon a series of assumptions. Below is a summary of the main financial and 
demographic assumptions adopted for the UKRF.

Key UKRF financial assumptions

Discount rate

Inflation rate (RPI)

2023

% p.a.

 4.49

2022

% p.a.

 4.80 

 3.21 

The UKRF discount rate assumption for 2023 was based on a standard WTW RATE Link model. The RPI inflation assumption for 2023 
was set by reference to the Bank of England’s implied inflation curve. The inflation assumption incorporates a deduction of 20 basis 
points as an allowance for an inflation risk premium. The methodology used to derive the discount rate and inflation assumptions is 
consistent with that used at the prior year end. 

The UKRF’s post-retirement mortality assumptions are based on best estimates derived from an analysis in 2022 of the UKRF’s own 
post-retirement mortality experience and taking account of recent evidence from published mortality surveys. An allowance has been 
made for future mortality improvements based on the 2022 core projection model published by the Continuous Mortality Investigation 
Bureau subject to a long-term trend of 1.25% per annum in future improvements (2022: 1.25% per annum).  The table below shows 
how the assumed life expectancy at 60, for members of the UKRF, has varied over the past three years:

Assumed life expectancy

Through transactions in 2020 and 2022 approximately  three-quarters of the longevity risk for current pensioners has been reinsured, 
and the transactions will provide income to the UKRF if pensions are paid out for longer than expected. The contracts form part of the 
UKRF’s investment portfolio.
Sensitivity analysis on actuarial assumptions

The sensitivity analysis has been calculated by valuing the UKRF liabilities using the amended assumptions shown in the table below and 
keeping the remaining assumptions the same as disclosed in the table above, except in the case of the inflation sensitivity where other 
assumptions that depend on assumed inflation have also been amended correspondingly. The difference between the recalculated 
liability figure and that stated in the balance sheet reconciliation table above is the figure shown. The selection of these movements to 
illustrate the sensitivity of the defined benefit obligation to key assumptions should not be interpreted as Barclays expressing any 
specific view of the probability of such movements happening.

A long-term investment strategy has been set for the UKRF, with its asset allocation comprising a mixture of equities, bonds, property 
and other appropriate assets. This recognises that different asset classes are likely to produce different long-term returns and some 
asset classes may be more volatile than others. The long-term investment strategy ensures, among other aims, that investments are 
adequately diversified.

1 Valuation of unquoted assets is provided by the underlying managers or qualified independent valuers. The valuation for some of the unquoted assets, in particular private equities, is 

based on valuations as at 30 September 2023 adjusted by cash flows, these being the latest available valuations as at the point of publication. All valuations are determined in 
accordance with relevant industry guidance. Barclays does not believe these valuations will differ materially from the fair value, in the context of the overall UKRF asset size.

2 Cash and liquid assets for the UKRF consists of £354m (2022: £521m) Cash, £91m (2022: £80m) Receivables/payables, £3,036m (2022:£3,286m)  Pooled cash funds and £(1,588)m 

(2022: £(2,390)m)  Repurchase agreements.

Included within the fair value of UKRF scheme assets was nil (2022: nil) relating to shares in Barclays PLC and nil (2022: nil) relating to 
bonds issued by Barclays PLC. The UKRF also invests in pooled investment vehicles which may hold shares or debt issued by Barclays 
PLC.

During 2023, the Trustee undertook a review of the investment strategy to reflect updated liabilities and market assumptions. The 
Trustee agreed to continue their existing de-risking plan and make no fundamental changes to the investment strategy.

At 31 December 2023, 39% of the UKRF assets were invested in liability-driven investment strategies; primarily UK gilts as well as 
interest rate and inflation swaps. These swaps are used to better match the assets to its liabilities. The swaps are used to reduce the 
scheme’s inflation and duration risks against its liabilities.

The UKRF employs derivative instruments, where appropriate, to match assets more closely to liabilities, or to achieve a desired 
exposure or return.  The value of assets shown reflects the assets held by the UKRF, with any derivative holdings reflected on a fair value 
basis. The UKRF uses repurchase agreements and reverse repurchase agreements to achieve the Trustee’s liability hedging objective. 
Investment managers are allowed to undertake repo transactions on the UKRF’s existing gilt holdings to raise cash with which to buy 
additional gilts for efficient portfolio management; and reverse repo transactions to receive gilts and be paid a fee for providing cash.

Employee benefits

The UKRF has a comprehensive and robust liquidity framework in place. The aim of the liquidity framework is to ensure that pension 
payments and other liquidity outflows are paid in due course, sufficient liquidity and collateral is maintained to achieve strategic 
allocation targets and that all liquidity outflows/collateral needs are covered without forced sale or strategic asset allocation changes.

The UKRF holds two longevity reinsurance contracts covering c75% of the current pensioner liabilities. The contracts provide income 
to the UKRF if pensions are paid out for longer than expected. At 31 December 2023, the combined value of the contracts was £(131)m  
(2022: £(123)m). The negative value reflects the estimated impact of changes in the reinsurance market, demographic assumptions 
and risk premia since the contracts were entered into by the UKRF.

For information on the UKRF Trustee’s approach to Responsible Investment and Climate Risk, in the context of managing the UKRF, 
please refer to the UKRF Trustee website at http://epa.towerswatson.com/accounts/barclays/public/barclays-bank-responsible-
investment-policy/.
Triennial valuation

The UKRF annual funding update as at 30 September 2023 showed a funding surplus of £2.03bn compared to £1.97bn  at 30 
September 2022 triennial actuarial valuation. The improvement was mainly due to asset returns outperforming the change in liabilities.

The main differences between the funding and accounting assumptions are a different approach to setting the discount rate and a 
more conservative longevity assumption for funding.

As part of the 2022 triennial valuation, the Trustee and Barclays Bank PLC agreed an annual adequacy test on a basis more prudent than 
the IAS 19 or funding bases. Should the UKRF be sufficiently funded on this basis, the regular employer contributions to the UKRF to 
fund future Afterwork accrual will not be required in the following calendar year. The test will be reviewed at the 2025 triennial valuation. 
The test was passed in September, so no regular employer contributions are required for 2024.

The next funding valuation of the UKRF is due to be completed in 2026 with an effective date of 30 September 2025.
Other support measures agreed which remain in place

Collateral – Barclays Bank PLC has entered into an agreement with the UKRF Trustee to provide collateral to cover at least 100% of any 
funding deficit with an overall cap of £9bn, to provide security if the UKRF is in a funding deficit. The collateral pool is currently zero, 
reflecting the surplus funding position. The arrangement provides the UKRF Trustee with dedicated access to the pool of assets in the 
event of Barclays Bank PLC not paying any required deficit reduction contribution to the UKRF or in the event of Barclays Bank PLC’s 
insolvency. 

Participation – As permitted under the Financial Services and Markets Act 2000 (Banking Reform) (Pensions) Regulations 2016, Barclays 
Bank UK PLC is a participating employer in the UKRF and will remain so during a transitional phase until September 2025 as set out in a 
deed of participation. In the event of Barclays Bank PLC’s insolvency during this period provision has been made to require Barclays 
Bank UK PLC to become the principal employer of the UKRF. Barclays Bank PLC’s Section 75 debt would be triggered by the insolvency 
(the debt would be calculated after allowing for the payment to the UKRF of any collateral above).

Defined benefit contributions paid with respect to the UKRF were as follows:

to UK defined contribution schemes in 2024 is £32m to the UKRF and £293m to the BPSP.

The country of registration or incorporation is also the principal area of operation of each of the above subsidiaries. 

Ownership interests are in some cases different to voting interests due to the existence of non-voting equity interests, such as 
preference shares. Refer to Note 29 for more information. 

Determining whether the Group has control of an entity is generally straightforward based on ownership of the majority of the voting 
capital. However, in certain instances, this determination will involve judgement, particularly in the case of structured entities where 
voting rights are often not the determining factor in decisions over the relevant activities. This judgement will involve assessing the 
purpose and design of the entity. It will also often be necessary to consider whether the Group, or another involved party with power 
over the relevant activities, is acting as a principal in its own right or as an agent on behalf of others.  

There is also often considerable judgement involved in the ongoing assessment of control over structured entities. In this regard, where 
market conditions have deteriorated such that the other investors’ exposures to the structure’s variable returns have been 
substantively eliminated, the Group may conclude that the managers of the structured entity are acting as its agent and therefore will 
consolidate the structured entity.

This entity is managed by an external counterparty and consequently is not controlled by the Group. Interests relating to this entity are 
included in Note 34.
Significant restrictions

As is typical for a group of its size and international scope, there are restrictions on the ability of Barclays PLC to obtain distributions of 
capital, access the assets or repay the liabilities of members of its Group due to the statutory, regulatory and contractual requirements 
of its subsidiaries and due to the protective rights of non-controlling interests. These are considered below.
Regulatory requirements

Barclays’ principal subsidiary companies have assets and liabilities before intercompany eliminations of £2,022bn (2022: £1,962bn) and 
£1,927bn (2022: £1,869bn) respectively. Certain of these assets and liabilities are subject to prudential regulation and regulatory capital 
requirements in the countries in which they are regulated. These require entities to maintain minimum capital levels which cannot be 
returned to the parent company, Barclays PLC, on a going concern basis. 

In order to meet capital requirements, subsidiaries may issue certain equity-accounted and debt-accounted financial instruments and 
non-equity instruments such as Tier 1 and Tier 2 capital instruments and other forms of subordinated liabilities. Refer to Note 26 and 
Note 27 for particulars of these instruments. These instruments may be subject to cancellation clauses or preference share 
restrictions that would limit the ability of the entity to repatriate the capital on a timely basis.
Liquidity requirements

Regulated subsidiaries of the Group are required to meet applicable PRA or local regulatory requirements pertaining to liquidity. The 
regulated subsidiaries include Barclays Bank PLC and Barclays Capital Securities Limited (which are regulated on a combined basis 
under a Domestic Liquidity Sub-Group (DoLSub) arrangement), Barclays Bank UK PLC, Barclays Bank Ireland PLC, Barclays Capital Inc. 
and Barclays Bank Delaware. Refer to the Liquidity risk section for further details of liquidity requirements, including those of the Group’s 
significant subsidiaries.
Statutory requirements 

The Group’s subsidiaries are subject to statutory requirements not to make distributions of capital and unrealised profits and generally 
to maintain solvency. These requirements restrict the ability of subsidiaries to make remittances of dividends to Barclays PLC, the 
ultimate parent, except in the event of a legal capital reduction or liquidation. In most cases, the regulatory restrictions referred to 
above exceed the statutory restrictions.
Asset encumbrance

The Group uses its financial assets to raise finance in the form of securitisations and through the liquidity schemes of central banks, as 
well as to provide security to the UK Retirement Fund. Once encumbered, the assets are not available for transfer around the Group. 
The assets typically affected are disclosed in Note 37.
Other restrictions

The Group is required to maintain balances with central banks and other regulatory authorities, and these amounted to £3,758m (2022: 
£3,457m).

34 Structured entities

A structured entity is an entity in which voting or similar rights are not the dominant factor in deciding who  controls the entity.  Voting 
rights may relate to administrative tasks only, with the relevant activities of the entity being directed by means of contractual 
arrangements.  Structured entities are generally created to achieve a narrow and well-defined objective with restrictions around their 
ongoing activities. 

Depending on the Group’s power over the activities of the entity and its exposure to and ability to influence its own returns, it may 
consolidate the entity. In other cases, it may sponsor or have exposure to such an entity but not consolidate it.
Consolidated structured entities

The Group has contractual arrangements which may require it to provide financial support to the following types of consolidated 
structured entities:

• Securitisation vehicles: The Group uses securitisation as a source of financing and a means of risk transfer.  Where entities are 

controlled by the Group, they are consolidated.  Refer to Note 36 for further detail.

▪ Commercial Paper (CP) conduits: These entities issue CP and use the proceeds to lend to clients as part of the Group's multi-seller 
conduit programme.   The Group has provided £22.4bn (2022: £20.8bn) in contractual liquidity facilities to the CP conduits that the 
Group consolidates. These amounts represent the maximum the conduits can lend externally. The amounts of CP conduit lending 
(drawn and undrawn) to unconsolidated structured entities can be seen in Other interests in unconsolidated structured entities 
under multi-seller conduit programme in the Nature of interest table.

▪ Employee benefit trusts: The Group provides capital contributions to employee benefit trusts to enable them to meet obligations to 

employees in relation to share-based remuneration arrangements.

▪ Tender Option Bond (TOB)  trusts: During 2023, the Group provided undrawn liquidity facilities of £3.7bn (2022: £3.8bn) to 

consolidated TOB trusts.  These trusts invest in fixed income instruments issued by state, local or other municipalities in the United 
States, funded by long-term senior floating-rate notes and junior residual securities.    

Unconsolidated structured entities

The term ‘unconsolidated structured entities’ refers to structured entities not controlled by Barclays, and are established either by 
Barclays or a third party. An interest in a structured entity is any form of contractual or non-contractual involvement which creates 
variability in returns arising from the performance of the entity for the Group. Such interests include holdings of debt or equity 
securities, derivatives that transfer financial risks from the entity to the Group, lending, loan commitments, financial guarantees and 
investment management agreements.

The Group enters into transactions with unconsolidated structured entities in the normal course of business to facilitate customer 
transactions, to provide  risk management services and for specific investment opportunities.  This is predominantly within the CIB 
business. Structured entities may take the form of funds, trusts, securitisation vehicles, and private investment companies. The largest 
transactions for Barclays include loans and derivatives with hedge fund structures and special purpose entities, multi-seller conduit 
lending, holding notes issued by securitisation vehicles, and facilitating customer requirements through funds.

The nature and extent of the Group’s interests in structured entities is summarised below:

Secured financing arrangements, short-term traded interests and traded derivatives are typically managed under Market risk 
management policies described in the Market risk management section which includes an indication of the change of risk measures 
compared to last year. For this reason, the total assets of these entities are not considered meaningful for the purposes of 
understanding the related risks and so have not been presented. Other interests include conduits and lending where the interest is 
driven by normal customer demand. As at 31 December 2023, Barclays entered into transactions with approximately 6,000 (2022: 
6,000) structured entities.
Secured financing 

The Group routinely enters into reverse repurchase contracts, margin lending, stock borrowing and similar arrangements on normal 
commercial terms where the counterparty to the arrangement is a structured entity. Due to the nature of these arrangements, 
especially the transfer of collateral and ongoing margining, the Group is able to manage its variable exposure to the performance of the 
structured entity counterparty. The counterparties included in secured financing mainly include hedge fund limited structures, 
investment companies and special purpose entities.
Short-term traded interests

As part of its market making activities, the Group buys and sells interests in structured vehicles, which are predominantly debt securities 
issued by asset securitisation vehicles. Such interests are typically held individually or as part of a larger portfolio for no more than 90 
days. In such cases, the Group typically has no other involvement with the structured entity other than the securities it holds as part of 
trading activities and its maximum exposure to loss is restricted to the carrying value of the asset.
Traded derivatives

The Group enters into a variety of derivative contracts with structured entities which reference market risk variables such as interest 
rates, equities, foreign exchange rates and credit indices among other things. The main derivative types which are considered interests 
in structured entities include equity options, index-based and entity-specific credit default swaps, and total return swaps.  Interest rate 
swaps and foreign exchange derivatives that are not complex and which expose the Group to insignificant credit risk by being senior in

Scope of consolidation

the payment waterfall of a securitisation and derivatives that are determined to introduce risk or variability to a structured entity are not 
considered to be an interest in an entity and have been excluded from the disclosures.

A description of the types of derivatives and the risk management practices are detailed in Note 14. The risk of loss may be mitigated 
through ongoing margining requirements as well as a right to cash flows from the structured entity which are senior in the payment 
waterfall. Such margining requirements are consistent with market practice for many derivative arrangements and in line with the 
Group’s normal credit policies.

Derivative transactions require the counterparty to provide cash or other collateral under margining agreements to mitigate 
counterparty credit risk. The Group is mainly exposed to settlement risk on these derivatives which is mitigated through daily margining. 
Total notional contract amounts were £335,552m (2022: £244,780m).

Except for credit default swaps where the maximum exposure to loss is the swap notional amount, it is not possible to estimate the 
maximum exposure to loss in respect of derivative positions as the fair value of derivatives is subject to changes in market rates of 
interest, exchange rates and credit indices which by their nature are uncertain. In addition, the Group’s losses would be subject to 
mitigating action under its traded market risk and credit risk policies that require the counterparty to provide collateral in cash or other 
assets in most cases.
Other interests in unconsolidated structured entities

The Group’s interests in structured entities not held for the purposes of short-term trading activities are set out below, summarised by

Maximum exposure to loss

Unless specified otherwise below, the Group’s maximum exposure to loss is the total of its on-balance sheet positions and its off-
balance sheet arrangements, being loan commitments and financial guarantees. Exposure to loss is mitigated through collateral, 
financial guarantees, the availability of netting and credit protection held.
Multi-seller conduit programme

Barclays' multi-seller conduit programme engages in providing financing to various clients and holds whole or partial interests in pools of 
receivables or similar obligations. These instruments are protected from loss through over-collateralisation, seller guarantees, or other 
credit enhancements provided to the conduit entities. The Group’s off-balance sheet exposure included in the table above represents 
liquidity facilities that are provided to the conduit for the benefit of the holders of the commercial paper issued by the conduit and will

only be drawn where the conduit is unable to access the commercial paper market. If these liquidity facilities are drawn, the Group is 
protected from loss through over-collateralisation, seller guarantees, or other credit enhancements provided to the conduit.
Lending

The portfolio includes lending provided by the Group to unconsolidated structured entities in the normal course of its lending business 
to earn income in the form of interest and lending fees and includes loans to structured entities that are generally collateralised by 
property, equipment or other assets. All loans are subject to the Group’s credit sanctioning process. Collateral arrangements are 
specific to the circumstances of each loan with additional guarantees and collateral sought from the sponsor of the structured entity 
for certain arrangements. During the period the Group incurred immaterial impairment against such facilities.
Other

This includes fair value loans with structured entities where the market risk is materially hedged with corresponding derivative contracts, 
interests in debt securities issued by securitisation vehicles and drawn and undrawn loan facilities to these entities. In addition, other 
includes investment funds with interests restricted to management fees based on performance of the fund and trusts held on behalf of 
beneficiaries with interests restricted to unpaid fees.
Assets transferred to sponsored unconsolidated structured entities

Barclays is considered to sponsor another entity if: it had a key role in establishing that entity, it transferred assets to the entity, the 
Barclays name appears in the name of the entity or it provides guarantees on the entity’s performance. As at 31 December 2023, 
assets transferred to sponsored unconsolidated structured entities were £1,420m (2022: £1,665m).

The Group has provided £nil (2022: £nil) to its joint ventures and associates. The Barclays drawn commitments to finance or otherwise 
provide resources to its joint ventures and associates are £474m (2022: £474m) The Barclays share of the associates and joint 
ventures unutilised credit facilities commitments amounted to £1,695m (2022: £1,796m).
36 Securitisations

Accounting for securitisations

The Group uses securitisations as a source of finance and a means of risk transfer. Such transactions generally result in the transfer of 
contractual cash flows from portfolios of financial assets to holders of issued debt securities.

Securitisations may, depending on the individual arrangement, result in continued recognition of the securitised assets and the 
recognition of the debt securities issued in the transaction; lead to partial continued recognition of the assets to the extent of the 
Group’s continuing involvement in those assets or lead to derecognition of the assets and the separate recognition, as assets or 
liabilities, of any rights and obligations created or retained in the transfer. Full derecognition only occurs when the Group transfers both 
its contractual right to receive cash flows from the financial assets, or retains the contractual rights to receive the cash flows, but 
assumes a contractual obligation to pay the cash flows to another party without material delay or reinvestment, and also transfers 
substantially all the risks and rewards of ownership, including credit risk, prepayment risk and interest rate risk.

In the course of its normal banking activities, the Group makes transfers of financial assets, either where legal rights to the cash flows 
from the asset are passed to the counterparty or beneficially, where the Group retains the rights to the cash flows but assumes a 
responsibility to transfer them to the counterparty. Depending on the nature of the transaction, this may result in derecognition of the 
assets in their entirety, partial derecognition or no derecognition of the assets subject to the transfer. 

A summary of the main transactions, and the assets and liabilities and the financial risks arising from these transactions, is set out below:
Transfers of financial assets that do not result in derecognition
Securitisations

The Group was party to securitisation transactions involving its credit card balances and other personal lending. In these transactions, 
the assets, interests in the assets, or beneficial interests in the cash flows arising from the assets, are transferred to a special purpose 
entity, which then issues interest bearing debt securities to third party investors. 

Securitisations may, depending on the individual arrangement, result in continued recognition of the securitised assets and the 
recognition of the debt securities issued in the transaction. Partial continued recognition of the assets to the extent of the Group’s

Balances included within loans and advances at amortised cost represent securitisations where substantially all the risks and rewards of 
the asset have been retained by the Group and balances included within Financial assets at FVTPL represent securitisations where the 
risks and rewards are neither substantially transferred nor retained.

The relationship between the transferred assets and the associated liabilities is that holders of notes may only look to cash flows from 
the securitised assets for payments of principal and interest due to them under the terms of their notes, although the contractual 
terms of their notes may be different to the maturity and interest of the transferred assets.

If Barclays transfers a financial asset but does not transfer or retain substantially all the risk and rewards of the asset and retains control 
over it, the transferred assets is recognised to the extent of Barclays’ continuing involvement. Total Financial assets of £3,353m (2022: 
£828m) were transferred in this manner and the carrying value of the asset representing continued involvement is included in the table 
above.

For transfers of assets in relation to repurchase agreements, refer to Note 37.
Continuing involvement in financial assets that have been derecognised

In some cases, the Group may have transferred a financial asset in its entirety but may have continuing involvement in it. This arises in 
asset securitisations where loans and asset backed securities were derecognised as a result of the Group’s involvement with asset 
backed securities, residential mortgage backed securities and commercial mortgage backed securities. Continuing involvement largely 
arises from providing financing into these structures in the form of retained notes, which do not bear first losses.

37 Assets pledged, collateral received and assets transferred

Assets are pledged or transferred as collateral to secure liabilities under repurchase agreements, securitisations and stock lending 
agreements or as security deposits relating to derivatives. Assets transferred are non-cash assets transferred to a third party that do 
not qualify for derecognition from the Group balance sheet, for example because Barclays retains substantially all the exposure to those 
assets under an agreement to repurchase them in the future for a fixed price.

Assets pledged or transferred as collateral include all assets categorised as encumbered in the disclosure on pages 197 to 201 of the 
Barclays PLC Pillar 3 Report 2023 (unaudited), other than those held in commercial paper conduits. In these transactions, the Group will 
be required to step in to provide financing itself under a liquidity facility if the vehicle cannot access the commercial paper market.

Where non-cash assets are pledged or transferred as collateral for cash received, the asset continues to be recognised in full, and a 
related liability is also recognised on the balance sheet. Where non-cash assets are pledged or transferred as collateral in an exchange 
for non-cash assets, the transferred asset continues to be recognised in full, and there is no associated liability as the non-cash 
collateral received is not recognised on the balance sheet. The Group is unable to use, sell or pledge the transferred assets for the 
duration of the transaction and remains exposed to interest rate risk and credit risk on these pledged assets. Unless stated, the 
counterparty's recourse is not limited to the transferred assets.

Collateralised transactions, such as securities lending and borrowing, repurchase and derivative transactions are conducted in 
accordance with standard terms which are customary in the market.

The following table summarises the nature and carrying amount of the assets pledged as security:

netting. Included within Other are agreements where a counterparty's recourse is limited to the transferred assets. The relationship 
between the gross transferred assets and the associated liabilities is that holders of notes may only look to cash flows from the 
securitised assets for payments of principal and interest due to them under the terms of their notes.

40 Assets and liabilities included in disposal group classified as held for sale

Accounting for  non-current assets held for sale and associated liabilities

The Group applies IFRS 5 Non-current Assets Held for Sale and Discontinued Operations.  Non-current assets (or disposal groups) are 
classified as held for sale when their carrying amount is to be recovered principally through a sale transaction rather than continuing use. 
In order to be classified as held for sale, the asset must be available for immediate sale in its present condition subject only to terms that 
are usual and customary, and the sale must be highly probable. Non-current assets (or disposal groups) held for sale are measured at 
the lower of carrying amount and fair value less cost to sell.  Assets and liabilities classified as held for sale are presented separately in 
the consolidated balance sheet.  
Management accounting estimates and judgements

Management judgement is required in determining whether the IFRS 5 held for sale classification criteria are met, in particular whether 
the sale is highly probable and expected to qualify for recognition as a completed sale within 12 months of classification. This 
assessment requires consideration of how committed management is to the sales plan, the likelihood of obtaining regulatory or other 
external approvals which is often required for sales of banking operations and how committed the buyer is to complete the sales 
transaction within the agreed timelines.

Barclays is currently engaged in a process to sell its German consumer finance business (comprising credit cards, unsecured personal 
loans and deposits), currently within CC&P, as part of our ambition to simplify Barclays and support our focus on growing our key 
businesses.  A sale is expected to complete in 2024. 

The perimeter of the disposal group has been accounted for in line with the requirements of IFRS5 as at 31 December 2023.  A detailed 
analysis of the disposal group is presented below:

Barclays announced on 9 February 2024 that Barclays Bank UK PLC has entered into an agreement with Tesco Personal Finance plc 
(operating using the trading name “Tesco Bank”) to acquire its retail banking business, which includes credit cards, unsecured personal 
loans, deposits and the operating infrastructure. Additionally upon completion, Barclays Bank UK PLC will enter into a long-term, 
exclusive strategic partnership with Tesco Stores Limited for an initial period of 10 years to market and distribute credit cards,

customers. The transaction involves the acquisition of approximately £8.3bn of unsecured lending balances, including approximately

deposits. The acquisition is expected to occur in H2 2024, subject to court sanction and regulatory approvals.

42 Barclays PLC (the Parent company)

Total income
Dividend received from subsidiaries

Dividends received from subsidiaries of £2,818m (2022: £2,797m, 2021: £1,356m) relates to dividends received from Barclays 
Execution Services Limited £165m, Barclays Bank UK PLC £1,305m  and Barclays Bank PLC £1,348m. 
Other income

Other income of £1,174m (2022: £(654)m expense, 2021: £659m income) includes fair value and foreign exchange gains of £50m 
(2022: £1,673m, 2021: £250m) on positions with subsidiaries and £985m (2022: £905m, 2021: £804m) of income received from gross 
coupon payments on Barclays Bank PLC and Barclays Bank UK PLC-issued AT1 securities.
Total assets and liabilities
Investment in subsidiaries

The investment in subsidiaries of £64,461m (2022: £64,544m) predominantly relates to investments in the ordinary shares of Barclays 
Bank PLC of £36,340m (2022: £36,340m) and their AT1 securities of £10,757m (2022: £10,760m), as well as investments in the 
ordinary shares of Barclays Bank UK PLC of  £14,245m (2022: 14,245m) and their AT1 securities of  £2,439m (2022: £2,570m). The 
decrease of £83m during the year resulted from a capital injection of £50m to Barclays Principal Investments Limited offset by a 
decrease in the AT1 holdings and associated fair value which totalled £133m.
Impairment in subsidiaries

At the end of each reporting period an impairment review is undertaken in respect of investment in the ordinary shares of subsidiaries. 
Where impairment may be indicated a test of the carrying value against the recoverable value is performed; impairment being indicated 
where the investment exceeds the recoverable amount. The recoverable amount is calculated as a value in use (VIU) which is derived 
from the present value of future cash flows expected to be received from the investment. The VIU calculations use forecast profits 
based on financial budgets approved by management, covering a five year period as an approximation of future cash flows discounted 
using a pre-tax discount rate appropriate to the subsidiary being tested. A terminal growth rate has then been applied to the cash flows 
thereafter which is based upon expectations of future inflation rates. The 2023 review identified the value in use calculated was higher 
than the carrying value for all subsidiaries.
Loans and advances to subsidiaries

During the year loans and advances to subsidiaries decreased by £4,702m to £18,926m (2022: £23,628m). The decrease was largely 
driven due to maturities of £4,982m intra-group loans to Barclays PLC subsidiaries and foreign exchange impact of £1,049m due to the 
appreciation of GBP largely against USD. This was partially offset by the new issuances of intra-group loans to Barclays PLC subsidiaries 
of £1,260m.
Subordinated liabilities and debt securities in issue

During the year, Barclays PLC issued USD1,500m of Fixed-to-Floating Rate Resetting Subordinated Callable Notes, which are included 
within the subordinated liabilities balance of £10,018m (2022: £11,230m). Debt securities in issue of £18,308m (2022: £24,086m) have 
reduced during the year primarily due to  maturities of £4,931m senior issuances and the  foreign exchange impact of £847m due to the 
appreciation of GBP largely against USD.
Financial assets and liabilities designated at fair value

Financial liabilities designated at fair value of £31,832mm (2022: £22,971m) primarily included new issuances during the year of 
EUR1,250m Fixed Rate Resetting Senior Callable Notes, £2,000m Fixed Rate Resetting Senior Callable Notes, USD8,200m Fixed-to-
Floating Rate Senior Callable Notes and USD300m Floating Rate Senior Notes . The proceeds raised through these transactions were 
used to invest in subsidiaries of Barclays PLC and are included within the financial assets designated at fair value through the income 
statement balance of £35,787m (2022: £28,930m). The effect of changes in the liabilities fair value, including those due to credit risk, is 
expected to offset the changes in the fair value of the related financial asset in the income statement. The difference between the 
financial liabilities carrying amount and the contractual amount on maturity is £1,838m (2022: £2,100m).
Derivative financial instruments 

During the year derivative financial liabilities decreased by £195m to £711m (2022: £906m). This is primarily driven by the gain in 
derivatives due to a decreasing rate environment.
Total equity
Called up share capital and share premium

Called up share capital and share premium of Barclays PLC is £4,288m (2022: £4,373m). The decrease in the year is primarily due to 
837m shares repurchased with a total nominal value of £209m. This decrease was offset by shares issued under employee share 
schemes.
Other equity instruments

Other equity instruments of £13,198m (2022: £13,250m) comprises AT1 securities issued by Barclays PLC. The AT1 securities are 
perpetual securities with no fixed maturity and are structured to qualify as AT1 instruments under prevailing capital rules applicable as at 
the relevant issue date. During the year there were three issuances with principal amounts totalling £1,500m, USD1,750m and 
SGD400m and redemptions with principal amounts totalling £1,250m and USD2,500m. For further details, please refer to Note 27.

Annual Report 2023 508

Subject to Barclays PLC’s obligations under the applicable 
laws and regulations of any relevant jurisdiction (including, 
without limitation, the UK and the US) in relation to 
disclosure and ongoing information, we undertake no 
obligation to update publicly or revise any forward-looking 
statements, whether as a result of new information, future 
events or otherwise.

This document is printed on Revive 100 Offset, made from

Forward-looking statements

The terms Barclays or Group refer to Barclays PLC 
together with its subsidiaries. Unless otherwise stated, the 
income statement analysis compares the year ended 31 
December 2023 to the corresponding twelve months of 
2022 and balance sheet analysis as at 31 December 2023 
with comparatives relating to 31 December 2022. The 
abbreviations ‘£m’ and ‘£bn’ represent millions and 
thousands of millions of Pounds Sterling respectively; the 
abbreviations ‘$m’ and ‘$bn’ represent millions and 
thousands of millions of US Dollars respectively; and the 
abbreviations ‘€m’ and ‘€bn’ represent millions and 
thousands of millions of Euros respectively.
There are a number of key judgement areas, for example 
impairment calculations, which are based on models and 
which are subject to ongoing adjustment and modifications. 
Reported numbers reflect best estimates and judgements 
at the given point in time.
Relevant terms that are used in this document but are not 
defined under applicable regulatory guidance or 
International Financial Reporting Standards (IFRS) are 
explained in the results glossary that can be accessed at 
home.barclays/ investor-relations/reports-and-events/
latest-financial-results.
These results will be filed on a Form 20-F with the US 
Securities and Exchange Commission (SEC) as soon as 
practicable following their publication. Once filed with the 
SEC, a copy of the Form 20-F will be available from the 
Barclays Investor Relations website at home.barclays/
annualreport and from the SEC’s website at sec.gov.
Barclays is a frequent issuer in the debt capital markets and 
regularly meets with investors via formal road-shows and 
other ad hoc meetings. Consistent with its usual practice, 
Barclays expects that from time to time over the coming 
quarter it will meet with investors globally to discuss these 
results and other matters relating to the Group.

Non-IFRS performance measures

Barclays’ management believes that the non-IFRS 
performance measures included in this document provide 
valuable information to the readers of the financial 
statements as they enable the reader to identify a more 
consistent basis for comparing the businesses’ 
performance between financial periods and provide more 
detail concerning the elements of performance which the 
managers of these businesses are most directly able to 
influence or are relevant for an assessment of the Group. 
They also reflect an important aspect of the way in which 
operating targets are defined and performance is 
monitored by Barclays’ management. However, any non-
IFRS performance measures in this document are not a 
substitute for IFRS measures and readers should consider 
the IFRS measures as well. Refer to pages 387 to 393 for 
further information and calculations of non-IFRS 
performance measures included throughout this 
document, and the most directly comparable IFRS 
measures.

This document contains certain forward-looking 
statements within the meaning of Section 21E of the US 
Securities Exchange Act of 1934, as amended, and Section 
27A of the US Securities Act of 1933, as amended, with 
respect to the Group. Barclays cautions readers that no 
forward-looking statement is a guarantee of future 
performance and that actual results or other financial 
condition or performance measures could differ materially 
from those contained in the forward-looking statements. 
Forward-looking statements can be identified by the fact 
that they do not relate only to historical or current facts. 
Forward-looking statements sometimes use words such as 
‘may’, ‘will’, ‘seek’, ‘continue’, ‘aim’, ‘anticipate’, ‘target’, 
‘projected’, ‘expect’, ‘estimate’, ‘intend’, ‘plan’, ‘goal’, 
‘believe’, ‘achieve’ or other words of similar meaning. 
Forward-looking statements can be made in writing but 
also may be made verbally by directors, officers and 
employees of the Group (including during management 
presentations) in connection with this document. Examples 
of forward-looking statements include, among others, 
statements or guidance regarding or relating to the 
Group’s future financial position, business strategy, income 
levels, costs, assets and liabilities, impairment charges, 
provisions, capital leverage and other regulatory ratios, 
capital distributions (including policy on dividends and share 
buybacks), return on tangible equity, projected levels of 
growth in banking and financial markets, industry trends, 
any commitments and targets (including environmental, 
social and governance (ESG) commitments and targets), 
plans and objectives for future operations and other 
statements that are not historical or current facts. By their 
nature, forward-looking statements involve risk and 
uncertainty because they relate to future events and 
circumstances. Forward-looking statements speak only as 
at the date on which they are made. Forward-looking 
statements may be affected by a number of factors, 
including, without limitation: changes in legislation, 
regulations, governmental and regulatory policies, 
expectations and actions, voluntary codes of practices and 
the interpretation thereof, changes in International 
Financial Reporting Standards and other accounting 
standards, including practices with regard to the 
interpretation and application thereof and emerging and 
developing ESG reporting standards; the outcome of 
current and future legal proceedings and regulatory 
investigations; the Group’s ability along with governments 
and other stakeholders to measure, manage and mitigate 
the impacts of climate change effectively; environmental, 
social and geopolitical risks and incidents, pandemics and 
similar events beyond the Group’s control; the impact of 
competition in the banking and financial services industry; 
capital, liquidity, leverage and other regulatory rules and 
requirements applicable to past, current and future periods; 
UK, US, Eurozone and global macroeconomic and business 
conditions, including inflation; volatility in credit and capital 
markets; market related risks such as changes in interest 
rates and foreign exchange rates; reforms to benchmark 
interest rates and indices; higher or lower asset valuations; 
changes in credit ratings of any entity within the Group or 
any securities issued by it; changes in counterparty risk; 
changes in consumer behaviour; the direct and indirect 
consequences of the conflicts in Ukraine and the Middle 
East on European and global macroeconomic conditions, 
political stability and financial markets; political elections; 
developments in the UK’s relationship with the European 
Union (EU); the risk of cyberattacks, information or security 
breaches, technology failures or other operational 
disruptions and any subsequent impacts on the Group’s 
reputation, business or operations; the Group’s ability to 
access funding; and the success of acquisitions, disposals 
and other strategic transactions. A number of these factors 
are beyond the Group’s control. As a result, the Group’s 
actual financial position, results, financial and non-financial 
metrics or performance measures or its ability to meet 
commitments and targets may differ materially from the 
statements or guidance set forth in the Group’s forward-
looking statements. In setting its targets and outlook for 
the period 2024-2026, Barclays has made certain 
assumptions about the macro-economic environment, 
including, without limitation, inflation, interest and 
unemployment rates, the different markets and 
competitive conditions in which Barclays operates, and its 
ability to grow certain businesses and achieve costs savings 
and other structural actions. Additional risks and factors 
which may impact the Group’s future financial condition 
and performance are identified in the description of 
material existing and emerging risks beginning on page 258 
of this Annual Report.
