Forward-looking statements

Barclays PLC

Annual Report 2023 139

This document contains certain forward-looking 
statements within the meaning of Section 21E 
of the US Securities Exchange Act of 1934,
as amended, and Section 27A of the US 
Securities Act of 1933, as amended, with respect 
to the Group. Barclays cautions readers that
 no forward-looking statement is a guarantee 
of future performance, and that actual results
or other financial condition or performance 
measures could differ materially from those 
contained in the forward-looking statements. 
Forward-looking statements can be identified by 
the fact they do not relate only to historical or 
current facts. Forward-looking statements 
sometimes use words such as ‘may’, ‘will’, ‘seek’, 
‘continue’, ‘aim’, ‘anticipate’, ‘target’, ‘projected’, 
‘expect’, ‘estimate’, ‘intend’, ‘plan’, ‘goal’, ‘believe’, 
‘achieve’ or other words of similar meaning. 
Forward-looking statements can be made in 
writing but may also be made verbally by 
directors, officers and employees of the Group, 
including during management presentations, 
in connection with this document. Examples
 of forward-looking statements include, among 
others, statements or guidance regarding or 
relating to the Group’s future financial position, 
business strategy, income levels, costs, assets 
and liabilities, impairment charges, provisions, 
capital, leverage and other regulatory ratios, 

capital distributions – including policy on 
dividends and share buybacks – return on 
tangible equity, projected levels of growth in 
banking and financial markets, industry trends, 
any commitments and targets – including ESG 
commitments and targets – plans and objectives 
for future operations, and other statements that 
are not historical or current facts. By their nature, 
forward-looking statements involve risk and 
uncertainty because they relate to future events 
and circumstances. Forward-looking statements 
speak only as at the date on which they are made. 
Forward-looking statements may be affected by 
a number of factors, including, without limitation: 
changes in legislation; regulations, governmental 
and regulatory policies, expectations and actions, 
voluntary codes of practices, and the 
interpretation thereof; changes in International 
Financial Reporting Standards and other 
accounting standards, including practices with 
regard to the interpretation and application 
thereof and emerging and developing ESG 
reporting standards; the outcome of current and 
future legal proceedings and regulatory 
investigations; the Group’s ability along with 
governments and other stakeholders to 
measure, manage and mitigate the impacts of 
climate change effectively; environmental, social 
and geopolitical risks and incidents, pandemics 

and similar events beyond the Group’s control; 
the impact of competition in the banking and 
financial services industry; capital, liquidity, 
leverage and other regulatory rules and 
requirements applicable to past, current and 
future periods; UK, US, Eurozone and global 
macroeconomic and business conditions, 
including inflation; volatility in credit and capital 
markets; market-related risks such as changes in 
interest rates and foreign exchange rates; 
reforms to benchmark interest rates and indices; 
higher or lower asset valuations; changes in 
credit ratings of any entity within the Group or 
any securities issued by it; changes in 
counterparty risk; changes in consumer 
behaviour; the direct and indirect consequences 
of the conflicts in Ukraine and the Middle East on 
European and global macroeconomic conditions, 
political stability and financial markets; political 
elections; developments in the UK’s relationship 
with the European Union (EU); the risk of 
cyberattacks, information or security breaches, 
technology failures or other operational 
disruptions and any subsequent impacts on the 
Group’s reputation, business or operations; the 
Group’s ability to access funding; and the 
success of acquisitions, disposals and other 
strategic transactions. A number of these 
factors are beyond the Group’s control. 

As a result, the Group’s actual financial position, 
results, financial and non-financial metrics or 
performance measures or its ability to meet 
commitments and targets may differ materially 
from the statements or guidance set forth in the 
Group’s forward-looking statements. In setting 
its targets and outlook for the period 2024-2026, 
Barclays has made certain assumptions about 
the macro-economic environment, including, 
without limitation, inflation, interest and 
unemployment rates, the different markets and 
competitive conditions in which Barclays 
operates, and its ability to grow certain 
businesses and achieve costs savings and other 
structural actions. Additional risks and factors 
that may impact the Group’s future financial 
condition and performance are identified in the 
description of material existing and emerging 
risks beginning on page 258 of this 
Annual Report.

Subject to Barclays PLC’s obligations under the 
applicable laws and regulations of any relevant 
jurisdiction – including, without limitation, the 
UK and the US – in relation to disclosure and 
ongoing information, we undertake no obligation 
to update publicly or revise any forward-looking 
statements, whether as a result of new 
information, future events or otherwise.

Directors’ report: Our governance framework

Barclays PLC

Annual Report 2023 150

A Group-wide governance framework 
facilitating effective decision-making
Driving long-term sustainable value for our shareholders, with regard to 
the interests of our stakeholders.

Group structure 

Barclays PLC (BPLC) is the Group’s 
parent company and has a premium 
listing on the London Stock Exchange. 

Each of the Group’s key operating 
entities - Barclays Bank PLC (BBPLC), 
Barclays Bank UK PLC (BBUKPLC), 
Barclays Europe, Barclays US LLC and 
Barclays Bank Delaware - has its own 
board (with Executive and Non-
Executive Directors) and board 
committees. 

These main operating companies are 
supported by our Group-wide service 
company, BX, which provides 
technology, operations and functional 
services to businesses across the 
Group.

Our governance framework

The Board recognises that effective 
governance is key to the successful 
development and execution of the Group’s 
strategy. We think of governance as how 
the Board makes decisions and provides 
oversight to promote Barclays’ success for 
the long-term sustainable benefit of our 
shareholders, having regard to the 
interests of our stakeholders (including our 
clients, customers, colleagues and the 
society and wider environment in which we 
operate).

Our Group-wide governance framework 
is constructed to:

• facilitate the effective management of 

the Group by our Group Chief Executive 
and his ExCo across our 
diverse businesses 

• support and provide oversight and 

constructive challenge of the Group’s 
major subsidiary boards in the UK, 
Ireland and the US, consistent with the 
legal, regulatory and independence 
requirements applicable to 
those entities.

Generally, there is one set of rules for the 
Group. Group-wide frameworks, policies 
and standards are adopted throughout the 
Group unless local laws or regulations (for 
example, the ring-fencing obligations 
applicable to BBUKPLC) require otherwise, 
or ExCo deems that it would otherwise be 
appropriate in a specific instance.

Corporate Governance 
Operating Manual 
Our Corporate Governance Operating 
Manual outlines how the Group’s significant 
subsidiaries (and their respective boards 
and board committees) should interact 
with each other. It also provides guidance 
and clarity for management and Directors 
as to how these relationships and 
processes should work in practice. This is a 
dynamic document that evolves with the 
changing nature of the Group.
The role of the Board 

The BPLC Board sets the Purpose, 
strategic direction and risk appetite for the 
Group and is the ultimate decision-making 
body for matters of Group-wide strategic, 
financial, regulatory or reputational 
significance. 

We partially consolidated and streamlined 
the membership of the BPLC and BBPLC 
Boards in 2019, to improve efficiency and 
co-ordination while reducing complexity 
and unnecessary duplication. 

As a result, membership of the BBPLC 
Board is a subset of the BPLC Board. All 
members of the BPLC Board (except the 
Senior Independent Director, Chair of 
BBUKPLC and at least one other Non-
Executive Director) also serve on the 
Board of BBPLC.    

We believe that having members of the 
BPLC Board serving as the Chairs of some 
of the Group’s main subsidiaries supports 
improved efficiency, escalation and co-
ordination while ensuring an appropriate 
focus is given to matters relevant to each 
entity.

Matters reserved to the Board 

Matters reserved solely for the decision-
making power of the Board are set out in 
our bespoke Matters Reserved to the Board. 
Those matters include material decisions 
relating to:

• strategy

• risk appetite

• medium term plans

• capital and liquidity plans

• risk management and controls 

frameworks

• approval of financial statements

• approval of large transactions 

• approval of share allotments, dividends 

and share buybacks. 

Responsibility for the Group’s business on 
a day-to-day basis has been delegated by 
the Board to the Group Chief Executive, 
supported by his ExCo, to make and 
implement operational decisions. 
Information provided to 
the Board 

The Group Chairman is responsible for 
setting the Board’s agenda, primarily 
focused on strategy, performance, value 
creation, culture, stakeholders and 
accountability. The Chairman also ensures 
that Board members receive timely and 
high-quality information to enable them to 
make sound decisions and promote the 
success of BPLC. 

The Group Company Secretary, working in 
collaboration with the Group Chairman, is 
responsible for ensuring good governance 
and information flow, to support the 
Board’s effectiveness. In 2023, we 
continued to strive for balanced papers 
which clearly identify substantive issues 
and key points for the Board’s attention, 
continuing the momentum created in 
previous years.

The Board is kept informed of key business 
developments throughout the year 
through regular updates from the 
Executive Directors and senior 
management, in addition to the 
presentations delivered to the Board and 
the Board Committees as part of formal 
meetings.
+

Details of key Board activities for 2023 are set 
out on pages 153 to 155.

Directors are able to seek independent 
and professional advice at Barclays’ 
expense, where required, to enable them 
to fulfil their obligations to the Board. 
Attendance at Board meetings

Directors are expected to attend every 
Board meeting. Where a Director is not 
able to attend a Board meeting, the 
relevant Director’s views are made known 
to the Group Chairman in advance of the 
meeting. The Chairman also meets 
privately, on a regular basis, with each 
Non-Executive Director.
+

Details of Director attendance at Board 
meetings in 2023 are shown on the next page.

Board Committees 

The Board is supported in its work by its 
Committees - the Board Nominations 
Committee, Board Audit Committee, 
Board Risk Committee, Board 
Remuneration Committee and the Board 
Sustainability Committee - each of which 
has its own terms of reference clearly 
setting out its remit and decision-making 
powers. This structure enables the Board 
to spend a significant proportion of its time 
focusing on the Group’s strategy. 

The Board Committees are comprised 
solely of Non-Executive Directors, with the 
exception of the Board Sustainability 
Committee of which the Group Chief 
Executive is an Executive member.

The Chairs of each Committee report on 
their Committee’s work at every scheduled 
Board meeting. 
Board effectiveness

The effectiveness of the Board, its 
Committees and individual Directors are 
assessed on an annual basis. We carried 
out an internally facilitated effectiveness 
review for 2023, which was led by the SID 
and supported by the Group Company 
Secretary. In line with the requirements of 
the Code, we intend to conduct an 
externally-facilitated review of the Board, 
Board Committees and individual 
Directors in 2024. 
+ You can read more about the 2023 effectiveness 

review, and progress against recommendations 
from the 2022 review, in the Board Nominations 
Committee report on page 164.

Directors’ report: Key Board activities

Key Board activities in 2023

Keenly focused on strategy to drive the long-term success of Barclays.

Throughout 2023, the Board devoted 
significant attention to Barclays’ strategy, 
working closely with the Group Chief 
Executive and his ExCo both to drive 
forward the implementation of the Group’s 
strategy as set by the Board and to 
challenge itself on Barclays' strategic 
ambitions. 

Against a backdrop of geopolitical 
tensions, together with high interest rates 
and inflationary pressures, the Board 
remained focused on driving sustainable 
long-term value for the benefit of all of our 
stakeholders. You can read about how the 
Board has taken into account stakeholder 
interests in our Section 172(1) statement 
in the Strategic report from page 38.

Within the overarching consideration of 
Group strategy matters, the Board 
continued to give significant consideration 
to our climate and sustainability strategy. 
Given the importance of the work to 
address the climate challenge, the Board 
approved the establishment of the Board 
Sustainability Committee in March 2023. 
The Board Sustainability Committee 
supports the Board's oversight of the 
Group's climate strategy and sustainability 
agenda, including our ambition to be a net 
zero bank by 2050. Please see the Board 
Sustainability Committee report on page 
180 for further detail. 

You can read more about the key areas 
of Board focus in 2023 in the rest of 
this section.

Spotlight

Board engagement with 
colleagues

The Board strongly believes in the 
importance of engaging with our 
stakeholders and hearing their views, 
which brings valuable outside 
perspectives to the Board. In particular, 
the Board recognises that our 
colleagues are critical to our success. 
Ensuring that Board members have an 
opportunity to engage directly with 
colleagues is an important part of our 
method of workforce engagement and 
helps the Board take the issues of 
interest to our colleagues into account 
in its decision-making. During 2023, 
Board engagement with colleagues 
included: 

• The Group Chairman and Mary 

Francis visited our contact centre in 
Wavertree, Liverpool, to experience 
the Consumer Duty 'in action', 
meeting with customer-facing 
colleagues and learning about how 
Barclays is addressing vulnerable 
customer needs. 

• The Group Chief Executive and 
Group Finance Director hosted 
quarterly all-colleague town halls on 
Barclays' financial performance.

• Robert Berry and Sir John Kingman 
visited Barclays branches in London 
where they met colleagues.

• The Group Chief Executive hosted 

the Citizenship and Diversity Awards 
to celebrate colleagues who have 
made a positive impact in their 
communities and have helped to 
strengthen the diversity, equity and 
inclusion (DEI) culture within 
Barclays.

• Julia Wilson participated in a 

celebration event to congratulate 
newly promoted Managing Directors 
from across the Group.

• The Group Chairman, along with 

other Board members, visited the 
new trading floors at our head office 
in London, meeting colleagues in the 
Markets business and experiencing 
the trading floors first-hand.  

• Board members spent time with 

Barclays UK colleagues based in the 
UK and India. 

• The Group Finance Director met 

colleagues during visits to our New 
York, Glasgow and Northampton 
Campuses, and hosted other 
colleague events including an event 
to mark International Women's Day.

Directors’ report: Board Nominations Committee report (continued)

Board size   

As at 31 December 2023, the size of the 
Board was 13.  

Continuing to review the optimal size of 
the Board is an important part of the 
Committee’s medium and longer-term 
succession planning. As part of this, the 
Committee takes into account the need 
for the Board to be small enough to 
operate in an efficient and collaborative 
manner yet large enough to ensure an 
appropriate mix of skills and diversity, to 
support succession planning and to 
accommodate the additional roles and 
responsibilities of some of our Directors 
on Board Committees, and on the Boards 
of BBPLC, BBUKPLC, Barclays Europe, 
Barclays US LLC and BX. 

The Committee considers that the size of 
the Board contributes to its effectiveness. 

Composition

Through considering the skills, 
experience, knowledge and diversity 
required for effective Board, Board

Director, including details of the skills, 
experience and knowledge they bring

memberships and other principal 
appointments on pages 145 to 148.  

Changes to Board composition 
in 2023 

The Committee oversaw a series of 
changes to Board and Board Committee 
composition during the course of 2023, 
building on the progress made in 2022. 
Board and Board Committee changes are 
set out in the table on the previous page of 
this report. 

The Board considers that these changes 
have enhanced the effectiveness of the 
Board and relevant Committees, providing 
valuable input and support to their work as 
well as bringing new and diverse 
perspectives to discussions.

We continued to strengthen the 
composition of the Board with the addition 
of two Non-Executive Directors in 2023. 
Marc Moses, appointed with effect from 23 
January 2023, brings to the Board a strong 
technical finance background and 
extensive knowledge of banking and 
financial services. Sir John Kingman has a 
deep background in financial services, 
gained from his executive and non-
executive career, and joined as a Non-
Executive Director with effect from 
1 June 2023, upon taking up his role as 
Chair of BBUKPLC. 

Mike Ashley retired from the Board at the 
conclusion of our AGM on 3 May 2023 and 
Crawford Gillies retired shortly thereafter 
on 31 May 2023, each having served on the 
Board for around nine years. Both Mike and 
Crawford made a significant contribution 
to the Group during the course of their 
tenure, for which the Committee and the 
Board are very grateful.

Diversity

The Committee and the Board 
recognise the benefits of diversity in all 
its forms, including in relation to 
gender, ethnicity, age, sexual 
orientation, disability and socio-
economic background.

Having due regard for the benefits of 
diversity - at Board, Board Committee 
and ExCo level - is a vital part of the 
Committee’s role in leading 
appointments and succession planning 
for these key roles.   

Gender and ethnic diversity 
reporting

Disclosures in the form prescribed by the 
new UK Listing Rules requirements relating 
to gender and ethnic diversity of the Board 
and executive management can be found 
in this section.

Data relating to the gender and ethnic 
diversity of the Board was collected by way 
of a questionnaire. This questionnaire 
asked all individual Board members to 
disclose their gender identity and ethnic 
background, on a voluntary self-reporting 
basis, by selecting options aligned with 
those in the left-hand columns of the 
tables to the right (and therefore included 
the option not to specify an answer).

Barclays’ employees (including executive 
management, as defined in the table to the 
right) are asked to confirm their gender 
and ethnicity at the onboarding stage, on a 
voluntary self-reporting basis, by selecting 
options (which include the option not to 
specify an answer). Data relating to the 
gender and ethnic diversity of executive 
management (as defined) was sourced 
from this existing data, which is held within 
Barclays’ secure HR system.
Board Diversity and Inclusion 
Policy 

On the recommendation of the 
Committee, the Board adopted a revised 
version of the Board Diversity and Inclusion 
Policy on 8 February 2024.

The policy confirms the Board is 
supportive of the Group’s culture in which 
Barclays is committed to continuing to 
build a diverse, equitable and inclusive 
workplace, and that the Board recognises 
the benefits of a diverse, equitable and 
inclusive Board, reflective of the 
communities in which we operate, in 
driving effective decision-making.

objective criteria, recognising the benefits 
that diversity, in all its forms, brings to the 
Board, and that due regard will be also 
given to diversity and inclusion 
characteristics when considering Board 
Committee appointments.  

The policy sets out the Board’s existing 
gender and ethnic diversity targets 
detailed in the table on the following page, 
which are aligned with the targets 
recommended by the FTSE Women 
Leaders Review on gender diversity and 
the Parker Review Committee Report into 
Ethnic Diversity of UK Boards, which are 
reflected in the Listing Rules.

Directors’ report: Board Nominations Committee report (continued)

In addition, the policy also confirms the 
Board's ongoing commitment to operating 
in a way that supports diversity, equity and 
inclusion, where Directors’ views are both 
encouraged and heard.

As set out in the table within this section, 
at 31 December 2023, the proportion of 
women on the Board was 38%. While this 
fell short of the 40% target set out in the 
Listing Rules, FTSE Women Leaders 
Review and our Board Diversity and 
Inclusion Policy, the Board satisfied the 
target of having at least one woman in a 
senior Board role. 

As we reported in our 2022 Annual Report 
and as set out in our Board Diversity and 
Inclusion Policy (as described above), the 
Committee and the Board remain 
committed to ensuring that all Board 
appointments and succession plans are 
based on merit and objective criteria, with 
due regard given to diversity, and focused 
on meeting our gender diversity targets as 
set out in our Board Diversity and Inclusion 
Policy by 2025 while continuing to bring the 
very best, diverse talent we can attract to 
the Board. You can read more about the 
Board appointment process and 
succession planning in the sections that 
follow.  

We also recognise and embrace the 
benefits of diversity at Board Committee 
level. As at 31 December 2023, Board 
Committee gender diversity was 
as follows: 

• Board Nominations Committee 

– 40% women 

• Board Audit Committee 

– 50% women

• Board Risk Committee 

– 43% women

• Board Sustainability Committee 

– 43% women 

• Board Remuneration Committee 

– 60% women

Gender diversity within ExCo, 
ExCo direct reports and the 
wider workforce 

Group-wide, Barclays remains committed 
to its DEI vision and strategy, which was 
refreshed in 2022, and includes a series of 
principles and strategic priorities designed 
to support Barclays make progress against 
the six DEI agendas including its Gender 
Ambition, which is focused on improving 
gender diversity in senior leadership across 
Barclays.

The Board received an update during the 
year on Barclays' DEI ambitions, including a 
focus on the Gender Ambition, as 
described in the Key Board activities 
section on page 153.  

In 2022, Barclays announced its refreshed 
Gender Ambition of 33% representation of 
women in senior leadership roles - 
Managing Directors and Directors - by the 
end of 2025, having achieved its initial 
target of 28% representation of women in 
these roles by the end of 2021.

To achieve this ambition, Barclays focuses 
on the retention, development, 
progression and hiring of diverse talent at 
all levels. Regular reporting on progress 
against ambitions is shared with senior 
management. As at 31 December 2023, 
representation of women among 
Managing Directors and Directors was at 
30%Δ globally, and Barclays is focused on 
continuing its efforts to identify diverse 
talent in the market and develop existing 
diverse talent within Barclays.

The Committee is also mindful of the 
voluntary target recommended by the 
FTSE Women Leaders Review of 40% 
representation of women for ExCo and 
their direct reports by the end of 2025.

As at 31 December 2023, representation 
of women among ExCo and their direct 
reports stood at 27%Δ, remaining level with 
the 2022 year end position. 

While this fell short of the FTSE Women 
Leaders Review recommendation, 
increasing gender diversity within both 
ExCo and their direct reports, to ensure 
a diverse pipeline for ExCo succession, 
remains a key priority for Barclays and the 
Committee. 

In 2023, Barclays continued to have one 
ex-officio position on ExCo, with each 
appointee serving for a four-month 
rotation. This initiative, first introduced in 
2016, broadens the scope of perspectives 
and contributions made to ExCo, while also 
providing appointees with exposure to 
matters of Group-wide significance and 
further leadership experience. In 2023, 
all three holders of this position 
were women.

There are additional initiatives and actions 
being taken across our businesses to 
further strengthen the senior leadership 
pipeline; these include using the ex officio 
position at business unit executive 
committees, sponsorship programmes to 
support individual development and 
working with senior recruitment partners 
to strengthen our external pipeline.

Ethnic diversity reporting as at 
31 December 2023 

As at 31 December 2023, 23% of the 
Board (three members) were from a 
minority ethnic background (excluding 
minority white ethnic groups), meeting the 
targets set out in the Listing Rules, the 
recommendations contained within the 
Parker Review Committee Report into the 
Ethnic Diversity of UK Boards and the 
ethnic diversity target in the Board 
Diversity and Inclusion Policy. 

Alongside the Board, the Committee 
continues to support the Group’s 
Multicultural agenda, including Barclays' 
Underrepresented Race and Ethnicity 
Ambition. Venkat, our Group Chief 
Executive, has made a significant 
contribution to Barclays’ diversity agenda. 
Having achieved our Race at Work 
ambition to double the number of Black 
Managing Directors globally from nine to 
18 by 2022, in January 2023, we set a new 
ambition to increase the population of 
Managing Directors from 
underrepresented ethnicities by at least 
50% by the end of 2025.

You can find more information on Barclays’ 
continued commitment to its Multicultural 
agenda, including information regarding

The Committee will continue to review the 
Board’s recruitment priorities and give 
further consideration to the desired skills 
and experience for potential candidates, to 
ensure that due consideration continues 
to be given to strong potential candidates 
who would enhance the effectiveness of 
the Board.  
Non-Executive Director 
independence 

In line with the requirements of the Code, 
a majority of our Board comprises 
independent Non-Executive Directors. 
The independence of our Non-Executive 
Directors is considered by the Committee 
on an annual basis, having regard to the 
independence criteria set out in the Code. 
As part of this process, the Committee 
reviews the length of tenure of all 
Directors, which can affect independence, 
and makes any recommendations to the 
Board accordingly.

The Committee reviewed the 
independence of all Non-Executive 
Directors serving on the Board as at 31 
December 2023. The independence of 
those who had served on the Board for 
more than six years (Diane Schueneman 
and Mary Francis) and more than nine 
years (Tim Breedon) was subject to a more 
rigorous review. The Committee remains 
satisfied that the length of their tenure has 
no impact on their respective levels of 
independence or the effectiveness of their 
contributions. The Committee and the 
Board consider all of the Non-Executive 
Directors to be independent.

For further details of the Committee’s 
review of the independence of Tim 
Breedon, please refer to the Succession 
section below.

During 2023, Mike Ashley and Crawford 
Gillies stepped down from the Board. Mike 
and Crawford did not raise any concerns 
about the operation of the Board or 
management.

Process for 
appointments

The Committee leads the process for 
Board appointments, ensuring that all 
appointments are based on merit and 
objective criteria - focusing on the 
skills, experience and knowledge 
required for the Board’s effectiveness 
and to support the continued delivery 
of the Group’s strategy - while also 
promoting diversity of background 
and opinion.  

Appointments to the Board are made 
following a formal, rigorous and 
transparent procedure, facilitated by 
the Committee with the aid of 
external search consultancy firms, as 
outlined in further detail below.

Non-Executive 
Director recruitment

The Committee regularly reviews and 
updates a series of skills-based Non-
Executive Director recruitment priorities. 
These priorities underpin the searches 
required for the Board to ensure orderly 
succession as Non-Executive Directors 
approach the end of their tenure and to 
ensure an optimum balance of skills and 
experience on the Board. 

The Committee considered and refreshed 
the priorities in 2023, in light of Non-
Executive Director recruitment activity, 
including the appointments of Marc Moses 
and Sir John Kingman during 2023 and two 
Non-Executive Directors having stepped 
down from the Board in 2023 at the end of 
their tenure. The Committee has agreed 
that all Board members should have the 
opportunity to meet leading candidates, 
and that diversity should remain a priority 
in all searches.     

Based on the agreed priorities, the 
Committee has set rigorous criteria for the 
roles it is seeking to fill, both in terms of 
experience and personal qualities. 
Independent search firms Spencer Stuart 
and Egon Zehnder supported our targeted 
external mapping and search processes 
for additional Non-Executive Directors to 
complement the range of skills on the 
Board in 2023, based on the agreed 
criteria. Diversity of background and 
experience remain at the forefront of 
those searches. 

Spencer Stuart and Egon Zehnder do not 
have any connection to Barclays or any of 
the Directors other than to assist with 
searches for executive and non-executive

Director appointments and reappointments

Board and executive 
appointments process

In 2023, the Committee reviewed and endorsed a refresh of the process for Board and Board Committee 
memberships, appointments and removals, and management appointments and removals.   

Searches for potential candidates have due regard to the clear benefits of diversity and are co-ordinated across the 
Group’s significant subsidiaries where appropriate. We aim to ensure that all Board members have the opportunity to 
meet leading candidates where possible. 

Our standard practice is to appoint any new Non-Executive Director or Chair to the Board for an initial three-year 
term, subject to annual re-election at the AGM (as outlined below). This may be extended for a further term of up to 
three years. 

As such, our Non-Executive Directors typically serve up to a minimum of six years, although this period may be 
extended where considered appropriate by the Committee.

All Directors are subject to appointment or reappointment (as appropriate) each year by shareholders at the AGM.

and reappointment

Time commitment 

All new Directors are asked to disclose 
their other significant commitments, which 
are then taken into account by the 
Committee when considering any 
proposed appointment to ensure that 
Directors can discharge their 
responsibilities to Barclays effectively. 
Expected time commitments are agreed 
with each Non-Executive Director on an 
individual basis, and include time to 
understand the business and complete 
training as well as time to attend and 
prepare for formal Board and Board 
Committee meetings. In considering 
whether a Director has sufficient time to 
commit to their role, the Committee has 
regard to regulatory and Code 
requirements, as well as key investor and 
proxy advisor guidelines. Details of the 
external executive and non-executive 
directorships held within listed companies 
for each of the Directors are set out in the 
table on this page. You can find details of 
other principal appointments for each 
Director in the Board of Directors section 
from page 145. 

The Committee reviewed the existing 
commitments disclosed by each of Marc 
Moses and Sir John Kingman ahead of their 
respective appointments to the Board, and 
was comfortable that these would not 
impact their ability to devote such time as 
is necessary to discharge their duties to 
Barclays effectively.  

Before accepting any significant new 
commitment outside of Barclays, all 
Directors must seek approval from the 
Board (providing an indication of expected 
time commitment). Prior to approving any 
significant new external commitment for a 
Director, the Board reviews all relevant 
facts and circumstances (including the 
expected role and time commitment, as 
well as the nature of the external 
organisation).

All Directors are expected to commit 
additional time as necessary to their work 
on the Board, where circumstances 
require. For the year ended 31 December 
2023 and as at the date of publication, the 
Board is satisfied that none of the 
Directors is over-committed and that each 
of the Directors allocates sufficient time to 
their role in order to discharge their 
responsibilities effectively. A record of 
each Director’s time commitments is 
maintained.

Conflicts of interest

The Board has the authority to authorise 
Director conflicts of interest, in 
accordance with the Companies Act 2006 
and BPLC’s articles of association. This 
ensures that the influence of third parties 
does not compromise the independent 
judgement of the Board. Directors are 
required to declare any potential or actual 
conflicts of interest that could interfere 
with their ability to act in the best interests 
of the Group.

regarding succession planning and 
proposed appointments for ExCo, 
including in relation to the review of the 
balance of skills and diversity on ExCo and 
for key successors. The Committee 
approved the ExCo changes in 2023, as set 
out on page 149, prior to implementation.     
+ You can read more about gender diversity 

within ExCo and their direct reports in the 
Diversity section of this Board 
Nominations Committee report.  

Succession

Through robust succession planning 
throughout the year, the Committee 
ensures that we will continue to strike 
the right balance of skills, experience, 
diversity and effectiveness on the 
Board, Committees and ExCo, as well 
as accounting for current and 
anticipated future business needs.  

The Committee’s vital work in this area 
includes both medium-term planning 
(orderly refreshing of the Board, 
Committees and ExCo) and long-term 
planning (looking ahead to the skills 
that may be required on the Board and 
the ExCo in the future).

Committee consideration of 
succession

As at 1 November 2023, Tim Breedon had 
served on the Board for 11 years. In early 
2024, the Committee undertook a 
rigorous assessment of Tim’s continued 
independence, as it had done in the two 
previous years. Following careful 
consideration, the Committee concluded 
that it remained appropriate for Tim to 
continue to serve on the Board beyond his 
11-year tenure. 

In reaching this conclusion, the Committee 
recognises the significant value that Tim 
continues to bring to Board discussions, 
particularly given his breadth of financial 
services sector experience and deep 
knowledge of risk and regulatory issues. 

Both the Committee and the Board 
continue to believe that it is advantageous 
for Group-wide decision-making to have 
the Chairs of the Group’s significant 
subsidiaries sit on the BPLC Board, 
considering that this provides connectivity 
with the Group's significant subsidiaries, 
bringing with it important insight into Board 
discussions. With these factors in mind, 
and in light of Tim’s ongoing role as Chair 
of Barclays Europe, the Group’s principal 
European subsidiary, the Committee and 
the Board consider it is appropriate for Tim 
to continue as an independent Non-
Executive Director on the BPLC Board in 
the near-term. 

Given the Board's preference for the 
Chairs of the Group's significant 
subsidiaries to also be represented on the 
Board, in light of Tim's tenure, the 
Committee is giving due consideration to 
potential successors for his roles on the 
Board and as Chair of Barclays Europe. 

Diane Schueneman will have been on the 
Board for nine years in June 2024, and the 
Committee is also giving due 
consideration to potential successors for 
her roles on the BPLC Board and as Chair 
of BX.
Tenure

The Committee and the Board consider 
that length of tenure is only one of the 
factors to be considered with respect to 
Director independence, and accordingly, 
that tenure alone should not result in a loss 
of independence. The Committee and the 
Board are confident that Tim remains 
independent and continues to provide 
effective challenge, advice and support to 
management on business performance 
and decision-making. Having undertaken a 
rigorous review of Tim’s performance as a 
Non-Executive Director and taking into 
account other relevant factors that might 
be considered likely to impair, or could 
appear to impair, his independence 
including as set out in Provision 10 of the 
Code, the Committee and the Board 
consider Tim to be independent.

Actions taken during the year

Areas

Discussion of key 
areas of focus  

Board agendas

In the context of what is understandably a structured 
meeting agenda, Board members would welcome the 
opportunity for more unstructured discussion of key areas 
of focus for the Board - whether in regard to particular 
matters on the agenda or other macro or external 
developments since the previous meeting.

Introduction of standing Board agenda item for open 
discussion of major current topics with Board members.   

Consideration should continue to be given to the 
structure of Board agendas to ensure that time allocations 
are appropriate.

The format of certain standing Board agenda items 
continued to evolve, with positive Board feedback 
received on changes made. 

Board materials 

Continued focus on ensuring balanced papers which 
clearly identify substantive points and key issues for the 
Board’s attention.

Additional time allocated on the Board agenda for 
discussion of material items. 

The Group Chairman and Group Chief Executive 
continued to work with management to ensure that 
substantive points and key issues for discussion by the 
Board were as clear and concise as possible within papers 
presented to the Board.

Committee reporting 
to Board

Engagement with 
senior executives 

Continued focus on Committee reporting to the Board, to 
ensure the Board has the right level of visibility on key 
areas of focus.

Inclusion of written reports of certain Committee 
meetings within Board papers, in addition to thematic, 
forward-looking reports.  

Continue to identify opportunities for more informal 
engagement between the Non-Executive Directors and 
senior executives outside the boardroom.

More informal engagement included engagement with 
management on Board papers, Board and Committee 
dinners with relevant senior executives, Board support for 
certain client events and Board engagement with 
colleagues as described in the Key Board activities section. 

External perspectives included the external briefing 
provided to the Board Sustainability Committee on policy 
and regulatory developments in relation to biodiversity 
and nature.

Outside perspectives  Continue to identify opportunities to bring external 

perspectives into the Board.

Individual Director effectiveness

All Directors in office at the end of 2023 
were subject to an individual effectiveness 
review. The Group Chairman considered 
each Director’s individual contribution to 
the Board as well as any feedback received 
as part of the broader Board and Board 
Committee effectiveness reviews.

Based on these reviews, the Board 
accepted the view of the Committee that 
each Director to be proposed for election 
or re-election at the 2024 AGM continues 
to be effective and contributes to Barclays’ 
long-term sustainable success.

All of the current Directors of the 
Company intend to submit themselves for 
election or re-election at the 2024 AGM 
and will be unanimously recommended by 
the Board for election or re-election as 
appropriate.

2023 Board effectiveness review

Feedback provided by interviewees as part 
of the 2023 Board effectiveness review 
provides important insight into the Board’s 
performance, including areas in which the 
Board could be more effective.

Following consideration of the findings of 
the 2023 Board effectiveness review, the 
Committee remains satisfied that the 
Board is operating effectively.
Feedback from 2023 review

Feedback from this review indicated that 
the Board is operating well and effectively, 
with Board members commenting 
favourably on the culture of the Board, 
where members feel able to share their 
different perspectives and views. Board 
members emphasised how this culture is 
supported by the inclusive style of the 
Group Chairman and his values-driven 
approach. The review indicated that Board 
composition is considered to be a 
strength, bringing together a range of 
diverse and complementary backgrounds, 
including deep financial services expertise. 
The interaction between the Board and 
the Board Committees was commented 
upon favourably, with regular reporting 
ensuring the Board has good visibility on 
key areas of focus. The review highlighted 
the positive relationship between the 
Board and management, and an 
appropriate level of support and challenge. 
Recommendations from 2023 review 

The 2023 review outlined the following key 
recommendations: 

• consider how Board agendas might be 

structured to (i) allow for deeper 
discussion of business performance; 
and (ii) create more flexibility for 
discussion of key topics and reflections 
within the agenda

• identify opportunities for more open and 
wide-ranging discussions on big picture 
issues

• continue to focus on ensuring balanced 
papers which clearly identify substantive 
points and key issues for the Board’s 
attention

• continue to identify opportunities to 
bring external perspectives into the 
Board.

2023 Board Committee 
effectiveness review

The Board Committee reviews are an 
important part of the way Barclays 
monitors and improves Committee 
performance and effectiveness, 
maximising strengths and highlighting 
areas for further development. 

The results of the 2023 Board 
Nominations Committee effectiveness 
review are reported below, and the results 
of the reviews of the effectiveness of the 
other Board Committees are reported 
within their individual reports elsewhere in 
this Board Governance report.  

Following consideration of the findings of 
the 2023 Board Committee effectiveness 
reviews, the Committee remains satisfied 
that each of the Board Committees are 
operating effectively. 
Review of Board Nominations 
Committee effectiveness

The results of the 2023 review confirm the 
Committee is operating effectively. It is 
considered well constituted and chaired, 
providing high-quality oversight and 
constructive challenge to management in 
the areas within its remit. The review 
highlights that the Committee is 
considered to have the right level of skills 
and experience. 

Feedback indicates that the allocation of 
time between agenda items in Committee 
meetings is appropriate, with sufficient 
time for discussion and challenge, and 
focus on the right areas. 

The Committee’s interaction with the 
Board, Board Committees and senior 
management is considered effective, 
noting that sufficient time is allocated at 
Board meetings for the Chair to report to 
the Board on the work of the Committee. 
Feedback indicated that concurrent 
meetings of the BPLC and BBPLC Board 
Nominations Committee continue to be 
effective, with coverage of BBPLC matters 
within concurrent meetings considered 
appropriate.  

Interaction with the BBUKPLC Board 
Nominations Committee was also 
considered effective, confirming that the 
Committee continues to exercise 
sufficient oversight of issues relevant to 
the Committee’s remit relating to 
BBUKPLC.

Annual Report 2023 166

Focused on a robust internal control 
environment

Overseeing the integrity of our financial disclosures and the effectiveness 
of the internal control environment.
Dear Fellow Shareholders

I was appointed as Chair of the Committee 
in April 2023 and so this is my first report of 
the Board Audit Committee as Committee 
Chair. 

I would like to extend my thanks to my 
predecessor, Mike Ashley, for his careful 
stewardship of the Committee and 
diligence in handing it over to me. We also 
welcomed Marc Moses to the Committee 
on 23 January 2023, bringing his strong 
technical finance background with a deep 
knowledge of banking and financial 
services.

During the year, the Committee has had a 
significant focus on management’s 
initiatives to drive sustainable 
improvements in the Group’s internal 
control environment. Specifically, the 
Committee received regular updates on 
the internal control environment from the 
business heads, Group Chief Internal 
Auditor, Group Chief Controls Officer and 
KPMG, identifying any thematic trends 
which may be arising across the Group and 
encouraging management to take a pro-
active approach in identifying areas for 
enhancement.

The Committee also maintained close 
oversight of an internal programme 
established by the Group Chief Executive 
at the end of 2022, and led by the Group 
Chief Operating Officer, to improve senior 
oversight of the more material regulatory 
remediation programmes with a view to 
enhancing controls in order to achieve a 
consistently excellent operating 
environment across the Group. This 
programme operates in parallel with the 
broader cultural change programme led by 
our Group Chief Executive, which you can 
read more about in the Section 172(1) 
statement in the Strategic report.

The Committee recognises that 
maintaining a robust system of internal 
control is a continuous journey and there 
will always be programmes in train to 
ensure that ongoing improvements are 
made. As part of this, the Committee has 
been receiving reports on an internal 
programme to enhance the system

of risk management and internal control 
for compliance with laws, rules and 
regulations. Financial crime controls also 
continue to be an area of significant focus 
for the Group and the Committee is 
closely following management’s progress 
in this area to ensure that the control 
framework is robust. Previous reports of 
the Committee also highlighted significant 
work by management on control 
remediation and enhancement 
programmes in relation to trading controls. 
While that work remains ongoing, the 
Committee was pleased to see significant 
progress made during 2023, with key 
remediation programmes in those areas 
scheduled to achieve significant 
milestones or complete during 2024.

To decide whether any control issues 
required specific disclosure in this Annual 
Report, the Committee continued to apply 
similar concepts to those used for 
assessing internal control over financial 
reporting for the purposes of the US 
Sarbanes-Oxley Act (SOx). The 
Committee is satisfied that there are no 
control issues which are considered to be a 
material weakness and which merit specific 
disclosure. 

In overseeing the integrity of our financial 
disclosures, the Committee was mindful 
that the macroeconomic environment 
during the year remained challenging with 
continuing high interest rates, inflationary 
pressures and geopolitical uncertainty. 
The Committee received regular updates 
from the Group Finance Director and 
Group Chief Accounting Officer, focusing 
on key areas including credit impairment 
and coverage, provisions, valuations and 
tax. The Committee will continue to closely 
monitor management’s judgements in 
these areas and their disclosure. 

The Committee works closely with the 
Board Risk Committee and Board 
Sustainability Committee, ensuring a 
streamlined view of matters of relevance 
across the Committees. The Committee 
welcomed enhanced reporting by 
management with the incorporation of 
operational risk dashboards to provide a 
more holistic view across the controls and 
risk space. This is expected to support the 
effective and efficient consideration by the 
Board Audit Committee and Board Risk 
Committee of matters relevant to both 
committees.

Looking ahead

Management has made some significant 
progress on remediation during the course 
of 2023; maintaining that momentum in 
2024 will be a key focus of the Committee.

Finally, after some five years in the role, 
and having made significant progress in 
the operation and methodologies used by 
BIA, Lindsay O’Reilly will be stepping down 
as Group Chief Internal Auditor during 
2024. The Committee will be looking to 
approve the appointment of a new Group 
Chief Internal Auditor in the coming 
months and would like to extend its thanks 
to Lindsay for her invaluable support, which 
is continuing through this transition period.

Julia Wilson

Chair, Board Audit Committee

19 February 2024

The results of the Committee 
effectiveness review for 2023 confirm the 
Committee is operating effectively. It is 
considered well constituted and chaired, 
providing an effective and appropriate level 
of challenge and oversight of the areas 
within its remit. Feedback recognised the 
effective transition of the Chair in April 
2023. The review highlights that the 
Committee is considered to have the right 
level of skills and experience, including 
recent and relevant financial experience, 
and is of an appropriate size. Feedback 
indicates that the Committee is 
considered to operate at the right level of 
debate, and confirms that the allocation of 
time between agenda items in Committee 
meetings is appropriate, with sufficient 
time for discussion and challenge. 

The Committee’s interaction with the 
Board, Board Committees and senior 
management is considered effective, 
noting that sufficient time is allocated at 
Board meetings for the Chair to report to 
the Board on the work of the Committee. 
Feedback indicated that concurrent 
meetings of the BPLC and BBPLC Board 
Audit Committee continue to be effective, 
with coverage of BBPLC matters within 
concurrent meetings considered 
appropriate. 

Interaction with the BBUKPLC Board Audit 
Committee was also considered effective, 
confirming that the Committee continues 
to exercise sufficient oversight of issues 
relevant to the Committee’s remit relating 
to BBUKPLC.

Please see the report of the Board 
Nominations Committee for details on the 
process for conducting the 2023 
Committee effectiveness review. 

With respect to climate matters, the 
Committee received input from the Board 
Sustainability Committee on our external 
climate and sustainability narrative 
disclosures. Best practice and regulation 
regarding climate and sustainability 
reporting and related assurance are still 
evolving, while investor and other 
stakeholder appetite for information 
continues to grow, and this is an area to 
which the Committee will continue to have 
close regard. Barclays’ climate strategy 
remains a key focus of the Group and the 
Committee continues to monitor that the 
impact of climate change has been 
addressed in preparing the Group’s 
financial statements. 

The independent assurance and challenge 
provided by both Barclays Internal Audit 
(BIA) and KPMG as statutory auditor are 
critical to the Committee’s oversight role 
in relation to internal controls and financial 
reporting. For this reason, the Committee 
continues to hold regular separate private 
sessions with each of the Group Chief 
Internal Auditor and the lead KPMG audit 
engagement partner without 
management present.

The Committee has oversight of Barclays’ 
whistleblowing programme and I took over 
the role of Group Whistleblowers' 
Champion upon my appointment as 
Committee Chair. During 2023, I met with 
the FCA and also held regular meetings 
with the Whistleblowing team to 
understand their key areas of focus and 
the Committee continues to receive 
detailed semi-annual whistleblowing 
updates. 

Throughout the year I also held regular 
meetings with a number of other 
colleagues and stakeholders to discuss 
any material and emerging key issues 
impacting the Group (including its key 
subsidiaries) and of relevance to the 
Committee. This included regular 
meetings with the Chair of the BBUKPLC 
Board Audit Committee, the Group 
Finance Director, Group Chief Internal 
Auditor and lead KPMG audit partner. As 
Committee Chair, throughout the year I 
also engaged regularly with the Group’s 
key regulators, including meeting with 
representatives of the PRA, FCA and 
FRBNY.

Committee composition and 
meetings

The Committee is composed solely of 
independent Non-Executive Directors. 
Membership of the Committee is designed 
to provide the breadth of financial expertise 
and commercial acumen that the 
Committee needs to fulfil its responsibilities. 
Its members as a whole have recent and 
relevant experience of the banking and 
financial services sector, in addition to 
general management and commercial 
experience; and are financially literate. Julia 
Wilson, the Committee Chair, and who is the 
designated financial expert on the 
Committee for the purposes of SOx, has 
significant corporate finance, tax and 
accounting experience including serving as 
the Group Finance Director of 3i plc from 
2008 to 2022 and as Chair of the board audit 
committee at Legal & General Group plc. 

In 2023, the Committee met 12 times, with 
no ad hoc meetings held during the year 
(2022: 14 times, including four ad hoc 
meetings). Attendance by members at 
Committee meetings is shown on page 166. 

Primary activities  

Committee meetings were attended by 
representatives from management, 
including the Group Chief Executive, 
Group Finance Director, Group Chief 
Internal Auditor, Group Chief Controls 
Officer, Group Chief Risk Officer, Group 
Chief Operating Officer, Group General 
Counsel and Group Chief Compliance 
Officer, as well as representatives from the 
businesses and other functions, and from 
BBPLC senior management reflecting the 
partially consolidated operation of the 
BPLC and BBPLC Committee meetings. 
The lead audit engagement partner of 
KPMG also attended Committee 
meetings. 

The Board, together with the Committee, 
is responsible for ensuring the 
independence and effectiveness of the 
internal audit function and external 
auditors. The appointment and removal of 
the Group Chief Internal Auditor is a 
matter reserved to the Committee, and 
the appointment and removal of the 
external auditor is a matter reserved to the 
Board based on the recommendation of 
the Committee. Neither task is delegated 
to management.

Role of the Committee

The role of the Committee is to 
review and monitor, among other 
things:

• the integrity of the Group’s financial 

statements and related 
announcements

• the effectiveness of the Group’s 

internal controls

• the independence and 

effectiveness of the internal and 
external audit processes

• the Group’s relationship with the 

external auditor

• the effectiveness of the Group’s 

whistleblowing procedures.

The Committee’s terms of reference 
are available at home.barclays/who-

The Committee discharged its responsibilities in 2023 through monitoring the effectiveness of the internal control environment and 
internal and external audit processes, as well as the integrity of financial statements and related announcements having regard to the 
current macroeconomic environment.

Fair, balanced and

(including Country- by-
Country Reporting and

Statement)

In light of the Board’s obligation under the 
Code, the Committee assesses external 
reporting to ensure it is fair, balanced and 
understandable.

In addition to this Annual Report and associated year-end reports, the 
Committee also reviewed the Group’s half-year and quarterly results 
announcements and the presentations to analysts. The Committee informed 
these reviews through: 

• consideration of reports of the Group Disclosure Committee

• direct questioning of management on the transparency and accuracy of 

disclosures

• consideration of the results of management’s processes relating to financial 

reporting matters, including the output of the Group’s internal control 
assessments and the SOx s404 internal control processes.

The Committee closely considered the Group's financial disclosures and 
provided feedback, including on areas where disclosures could be enhanced. 

Recognising the increasing focus on, and prominence of, ESG reporting, the 
Committee considered the governance and assurance framework for such 
disclosures. The Committee emphasised the importance of management 
continuing to review and enhance the processes and controls around the 
disclosures (particularly in relation to the underlying data) as the disclosure 
framework and expected use of the information evolves. 

Having evaluated all of the available information, the assurances by 
management and underlying processes used to prepare the published financial 
information, the Committee concluded and recommended to the Board that 
the 2023 Annual Report and Accounts are fair, balanced and understandable.

Barclays makes certain assumptions and 
estimates, analysis of which underpins 
provisions made for the costs of customer 
redress. The Committee analyses the 
judgements and estimates made by 
management to evaluate the adequacy of 
the provisions, including with regards to 
Barclays' provisioning for legacy conduct 
issues.

The Committee monitors management's 
judgements in relation to expected credit 
losses (ECLs), which are modelled using a 
range of forecast economic scenarios. They 
use forward-looking models which require 
judgements to be made over modelling 
assumptions, including: 

•

•

•

•

the determination of macroeconomic 
scenarios to be used

the methodology for weighting of 
scenarios 

the criteria used to determine significant 
deterioration in credit quality 

the application of management 
adjustments to the ECL modelled output.

The Committee considers management's 
judgement in relation to goodwill and 
intangibles. The carrying value of goodwill 
and intangible assets is assessed on the 
basis of discounted forecast future earnings. 
Given the significant component of earnings 
attributable to net interest income, such 
forecasts are particularly sensitive to the 
level of long-term interest rates and 
assumed levels of future lending. The period 
over which intangible assets are amortised 
appropriately reflects the useful economic 
life.

Barclays is engaged in various legal, 
competition and regulatory matters which 
may give rise to provisioning based on the 
facts.

The level of provisioning is subject to 
management judgement on the basis of 
legal advice and is, therefore, an area of 
focus for the Committee.

Barclays exercises judgement in the 
valuation and disclosure of financial 
instruments, derivative assets and certain 
portfolios, particularly where quoted market 
prices are not available.

The Committee is responsible for 
considering the Group's tax strategy and 
overseeing compliance with the Group's Tax 
Principles. Barclays is subject to taxation in a 
number of jurisdictions globally and makes 
judgements with regard to provisioning for 
tax at risk and to the recognition and 
measurement of deferred tax assets.

The Committee reviewed and challenged management’s approach to conduct 
provisions throughout the year and was satisfied that management's 
judgement and approach resulted in an adequate and appropriate level of 
provision in relation to the various conduct matters.

As part of its monitoring, the Committee considered regular reports from 
management on:

•

the impact of the macroeconomic environment, including high interest 
rates, inflationary pressures and unemployment levels

• model changes and model validation, and the impact of this on the use of 

post-model adjustments

•

the refresh of macroeconomic variables and associated weighting.

The Committee closely considered management’s judgement on impairment 
coverage levels, including the impact of increasing delinquency levels in certain 
areas of the portfolio.

Having considered and scrutinised the reports, the Committee agreed with 
management’s conclusion that the impairment provision was appropriate.

The Committee considered management's reports on its assessment of the 
Group's goodwill balances and intangibles to identify any indicators of 
impairment, including the methodology and controls applied to the process. 

The Committee was satisfied with management's determination on the 
indicators of impairment and quantum of the impairment amount identified.

The Committee received regular reports on the status of current legal, 
competition and regulatory matters and considered the impact of those 
matters on the Group’s provision levels. It also oversaw enhancements in the 
reporting to the Committee on these matters. It considered management’s 
judgements on the level of provision to be taken and accompanying 
disclosures and agreed that the level of provision at the year end was 
appropriate. 

The Committee also reviewed the disclosures made in respect of legal, 
competition and regulatory matters, and concluded that they provided 
appropriate information for investors.

The Committee scrutinised management's approach to valuations, including in 
respect of pensions and the leveraged finance portfolio.

The Committee was satisfied with the accounting treatment in respect of the 
various matters.

The Committee:

•

•

received reports from the Global Head of Tax, including updates on the work 
of the Tax Management Oversight Committee

reviewed the appropriateness of provisions made for uncertain tax 
positions and management’s approach to the tax treatment of index-linked 
gilts and its impact on the Group’s effective tax rate

• considered the impact of the UK Government’s implementation of the 

OECD’s global minimum tax rules

• monitored the Group’s interactions with tax authorities and the material tax 

risks for the Group.

The Committee approved the UK Tax Strategy statement published in the 
Country Snapshot report and recommended the Country Snapshot to the 
Board for approval.

Going concern and viability 
Going concern 
and long-term 
viability

Barclays is required to assess whether it is 
appropriate to prepare the financial 
statements on a going concern basis. In 
accordance with the Code, Barclays must 
provide a statement of its viability. To 
support this, the Committee considers both 
the going concern assumption and the form 
and content of the Viability Statement.

The Committee considered both the going concern assumption and the form 
and content of the Viability Statement taking into account: 

•

•

•

the MTP and Working Capital Report

the forecast capital, liquidity and funding profiles

the results of stress tests based on internal and regulatory assumptions.

The Committee recommended to the Board that the financial statements 
should be prepared on a going concern basis and that there were no material 
uncertainties that would impact the going concern statement which required 
disclosure. 

The Committee recommended the Viability Statement to the Board for 
approval.

The Committee assesses the distributable 
reserves position in considering 
management’s proposals for distributions 
(dividends and share buy-backs) for the full 
year ended 31 December 2022 and for the 
half year ended 30 June 2023.

Having regard to the distributable reserves available to the Company, the 
Committee reviewed and reported to the Board on proposals for (i) a dividend 
for the financial year ended 31 December 2022 of 5.0p per share along with a 
share buy-back of up to £500m; and (ii) a dividend for the half year ended 
30 June 2023 of 2.7p per share along with a share buy-back of up to £750m.

In early 2024, the Committee reviewed and reported to the Board on the 
distributable reserves position for the full year dividend for the year ended 
31 December 2023 along with a proposed share buy-back.

The Committee considers the effectiveness 
of the overall control environment, including 
the status of any significant control issues 
and the progress of specific remediation 
plans.

The Committee:

• considered feedback received from regulatory stakeholders on the Group’s 

internal control environment and management’s response

• evaluated and tracked the status of the more significant control matters 

through regular reports from the Group Chief Controls Officer

• discussed reports from heads of key businesses (including Barclays UK and 
BBPLC) on their control environment, together with views from the second 
and third lines of defence.

The Committee received regular deep dive reports on the more material 
remediation programmes across the Group, keeping a close eye on 
management’s progress and delivery against key milestones, including 
through to closure of a programme and validation by BIA. The Committee 
challenged management’s approach to measuring progress and emphasised 
the importance of qualitative factors such as the embedment and 
sustainability of programmes. 

The Committee considers the adequacy of 
the Group’s arrangements to allow 
colleagues to raise concerns in confidence 
and anonymously without fear of retaliation, 
and the outcomes of any substantiated 
case.

The Committee received detailed semi-annual reports on whistleblowing from 
management. It monitored key whistleblowing metrics, the 'speak up' culture 
across the Group (and key metrics underpinning this) and any potential 
whistleblowing trends which might emerge.

The Committee also monitored the implementation of enhancements to the 
whistleblowing process following the external benchmarking review conducted 
in 2022.

performed, the level of resources, and the 
methodology and coverage of the internal 
audit plan.

External audit
External audit

The Committee monitors the work and 
performance of KPMG.

Through regular reports from BIA, the Committee:

•

•

•

•

reviewed and agreed internal audit plans, methodology and deliverables for 
2023, including consideration of how regulatory priorities and required 
regulatory coverage has been reflected in the plan

reviewed BIA's audit reports in relation to specific audits, key areas of focus 
and themes 

tracked the levels of adverse audits and issues raised by BIA and monitored 
related remediation plans

received regular updates on BIA colleague matters, including colleague 
engagement and resourcing 

• discussed BIA's assessment of the control environment and management 

control approach in Group companies and functions. 

The Committee noted the independence of the BIA function, and through 
reviewing BIA's quality assurance updates was pleased to see the reports 
demonstrating the independence of BIA’s quality assurance function. 

The Committee considered and was comfortable with the approach by BIA to 
embed the UK Consumer Duty into the BIA framework.

The Committee conducted a performance assessment of BIA for 2023 and 
concluded it was satisfied with BIA's performance against its objectives agreed 
with the Committee Chair at the beginning of the year.

At the end of the year, the Committee approved the 2024 audit plan, detailing 
the number of audits to be undertaken and the focus areas. It also approved 
BIA's Audit Charter following the annual review.

The Committee:

• met with key members of the KPMG audit team to discuss the 2023 audit 

plan and KPMG’s areas of focus

• approved the 2023 audit plan and the main areas of focus for the year

• assessed regular reports from KPMG on the progress of the 2023 audit and 

any material accounting and control issues identified

• discussed KPMG’s draft reports on control areas of focus and the control 

environment ahead of the 2023 year end

• approved the terms of the audit engagement letter and associated fees for 

2023, on behalf of the Board.

The Committee sought KPMG's views on a number of specific matters, 
including management's approach to critical accounting judgements and 
estimates, and sought to understand where KPMG had challenged 
management's assessment prior to reaching a conclusion. This included 
considering KPMG challenge in relation to key controls matters and the 
approach to disclosures in the Group's full year, half-year and interim financial 
results. 

The Committee considered KPMG’s response to the PRA Written Auditor 
Reporting for 2022, and discussed with KPMG the questions in scope for the 
2023 Written Auditor Reporting.

External auditor

Following an external audit tender in 2015, KPMG was appointed as Barclays’ statutory auditor with effect from the 2017 financial year. 
Stuart Crisp, Barclays’ lead audit engagement partner, has been in the role since 2022 and attends all meetings of the Committee.
Assessing external auditor effectiveness, objectivity and independence and non-audit services

The Committee is responsible for assessing the effectiveness, objectivity and independence of the Group’s statutory auditor. This 
responsibility was discharged by the Committee throughout the year at formal meetings, during private meetings with KPMG and 
through discussions with key Group executives. In particular, the Committee assessed KPMG’s effectiveness, objectivity and 
independence in the following ways:

Throughout the year

• Met with senior members of the KPMG audit team from 

the UK, Ireland and US to discuss the approach to the 2023 
audit.

• Reviewed regular reports from management on the non-

audit services provided by KPMG to Barclays.

• Reviewed regular reports from management detailing any 

employees or workers hired from KPMG.

• Discussed with KPMG their consideration of internal 

controls over financial reporting.

• Considered areas in which KPMG had challenged 

management’s assumptions in areas of key judgement.

• Assessed any potential threats to independence that were 
self-identified and reported by KPMG, all of which were 
regarded by the Committee as being adequately 
addressed.

Annual assessment, audit quality 
and external findings

• The Group undertakes an annual formal assessment of 

KPMG’s performance, independence and objectivity. The 
assessment for 2023 was conducted in early 2024, by way 
of a questionnaire completed by key stakeholders across 
the Group who have regular interaction with KPMG. The 
questionnaire was designed to evaluate KPMG’s audit 
process, its effectiveness and overall output.

• Consistent with previous years, in 2023 KPMG nominated 

a senior partner of the audit team to have specific 
responsibility for ensuring audit quality. The Committee 
received reports from him during the year on his 
assessment of audit quality.

• The findings of the FRC’s Audit Quality Report on KPMG 
published in July 2023, including its inspection of the 
Barclays audit for the year ended 31 December 2021, 
provided further comfort to the Committee on the quality 
and effectiveness of KPMG’s audit, acknowledging that 
there remains areas for improvement.

Outcome

Taking into account the result of all of the above, the Committee considered that KPMG maintained its independence and 
objectivity, exercised robust challenge and demonstrated professional scepticism in the audit process. The Committee was 
therefore satisfied that the audit process was effective.

Non-audit services

In order to safeguard the auditor’s 
independence and objectivity, Barclays has 
in place the Group Policy on the Provision 
of Services by the Group Statutory Auditor 
(the Policy) setting out the circumstances 
in which the auditor may be engaged to 
provide non-audit services. The Policy 
applies to all Barclays subsidiaries and 
other material entities over which Barclays 
has significant influence. The core principle 
of the Policy is that non-audit services 
(other than those legally required to be 
carried out by the Group’s auditor) should 
be performed by the auditor only in certain 
controlled circumstances. A summary of 
the Policy can be found at home.barclays/
who-we-are/our-governance/auditor-
independence/

The Policy sets out the type of services 
that the auditor is permitted to carry out 
and pre-approves certain of these services 
provided the fee is below a certain 
threshold, except for specific categories of 
permitted services that require explicit 

Committee approval. All other permitted 
services must be approved in advance by 
the Committee. The Policy requires that all 
proposed work must be sponsored by a 
senior executive who is not involved in any 
work to which the proposed engagement 
relates. The audit assignment partner 
must also confirm that the engagement 
has been approved in accordance with the 
auditor’s own internal ethical standards 
and does not pose any threat to the 
auditor’s independence or objectivity. 

The Policy is reviewed by the Committee 
on an annual basis to ensure that it is fit for 
purpose and that it reflects applicable rules 
and guidelines. The Policy is aligned with 
both the FRC’s requirements and KPMG’s 
own internal policy on non-audit services 
for FTSE 350 companies, which broadly 
restricts non-audit work to services that 
are ‘closely related’ to the audit. 

In early 2023, KPMG advised the 
Committee that, following on from an 
event notified to the Committee in late 
2022, a further instance had been 

identified of a KPMG member firm having 
provided services in connection with the 
preparation of local statutory accounts of 
a small overseas subsidiary not in scope for 
the Group audit. KPMG assured the 
Committee, having made appropriate 
enquiries of their member firms providing 
services to the Group, that these were 
isolated instances. In these circumstances, 
the Committee agreed with KPMG’s 
assessment that this had not impaired 
their integrity or objectivity. 

In view of the events notified by KPMG, the 
Committee reviewed the Policy in early 
2023 to determine whether any revisions 
were required to ensure such events did 
not arise again. While it was determined 
that the Policy provided sufficiently clear 
guidance in terms of prohibited non-audit 
service work, certain enhancements were 
made to the Policy to further support the 
operation of the Policy including by 
specifying examples of the type of work 
prohibited under each headline service.

The Statutory Audit Services for Large Companies Market 
Investigation (Mandatory Use of Competitive Tender Processes 
and Audit Committee Responsibilities) Order 2014

An external audit tender was conducted in 2015 and the decision was made to 
appoint KPMG as Barclays’ external auditor with effect from the 2017 financial year. 

Barclays is in compliance with the requirements of The Statutory Audit Services for 
Large Companies Market Investigation (Mandatory Use of Competitive Tender 
Processes and Audit Committee Responsibilities) Order 2014, which relates to the 
frequency and governance of tenders for the appointment of the external auditor 
and the setting of a policy on the provision of non-audit services. 

As explained in previous Committee reports, provided that KPMG continues to 
maintain its independence and objectivity, and the Committee remains satisfied 
with its performance, the Board does not intend to tender for an alternative external 
auditor to be appointed before the end of the current required period of 10 years. 
Accordingly, any tender is expected to be in respect of the 2027 financial year 
onwards and is likely to take place in 2025. The Committee has reconfirmed that it 
would not be appropriate to tender before this date. The Committee observed that 
there has been significant rotation of the senior members of the audit team since 
2017 and more recent changes in certain members of the Barclays senior finance 
team, both of which have reduced any potential familiarisation threat.

The fees payable to KPMG for the year 
ended 31 December 2023 amounted to 
£78m (2022: £71m), of which £14m (2022: 
£13m) was payable in respect of non-audit 
services. A breakdown of the fees payable 
to the auditor for statutory audit and non-
audit work can be found in Note 39 of the 
financial statements. Of the £14m of non-
audit services provided by KPMG during 
2023, the significant categories of 
engagement, i.e. services where the fees 
amounted to more than £500,000, 
included: 

• audit-related services: services in 

connection with CASS (Client Assets 
Sourcebook) audits

• other services in connection with 

regulatory, compliance and internal 
control reports and specific audit 
procedures, required by law or 
regulation to be provided by the 
statutory auditor

• other attestation and assurance 

services, such as ongoing attestation 
and assurance services for treasury 
and capital markets transactions to 
meet regulatory requirements, including 
regular reporting obligations and 
verification reports.

Providing considered risk oversight 
through challenging times

Proactive risk management in a dynamic risk environment.

Dear Fellow Shareholders 

During 2023, the Committee focused on 
the financial and operational challenges 
arising from ongoing macroeconomic 
uncertainty and geopolitical tensions, 
overseeing management’s proactive 
approach to positioning the Group 
appropriately for the uncertain 
environment.

The macroeconomic outlook was defined 
by central bank efforts to contain inflation 
through higher interest rates, balanced 
against the desire to protect economic 
growth and employment. As the year 
came to a close, market participants 
remained focused on the expected turn of 
the rates cycle and the implications for 
asset prices and the credit cycle. The 
Committee remained watchful of these 
events and other risks, such as the 
potential for disorderly market corrections 
and economic slowdowns across the 
globe; alongside wider geopolitical 
tensions and their impact on Barclays’ 
portfolios and businesses. Throughout the 
year the Committee heard from and 
challenged senior business leaders, in 
addition to second line risk and compliance 
colleagues, about how they consider and 
manage risks as they execute their 
business strategies, including any 
mitigating actions being taken. 

2023 was undoubtedly a challenging year 
for the banking sector with significant 
market volatility, particularly in the first half 
of the year, coupled with the collapse of a 
number of US regional banks and the 
takeover of a distressed global bank. In 
addition to overseeing Barclays’ 
management of its liquidity and capital 
positions, the Committee reviewed 
management’s learnings from these 
events to help ensure that Barclays 
remains resilient through periods of stress.

1 There were nine scheduled meetings and two ad hoc 
meetings of the Committee in 2023. Owing to prior 
commitments and ad hoc meetings being called at 
short notice, Mohamed A. El-Erian was unable to 
Notes
attend two scheduled meetings, Diane Schueneman 
was unable to attend one scheduled meeting and 
one ad hoc meeting and Brian Gilvary was unable to 
attend one ad hoc meeting. 

Alongside financial risks, the Committee 
oversaw management’s work to drive 
robust operational risk management 
across Barclays; in this regard, the 
Committee considered the risks of cyber-
related attacks and their potential impact 
on customers and clients, and heard from 
management about ongoing work to 
strengthen the bank’s cybersecurity 
defences. In addition, the Committee 
monitored work in Barclays UK designed to 
reduce risk by improving the control 
environment and drive efficiencies. 

The Committee tracked Barclays' progress 
towards ensuring it can recover its most 
important business services in the event of 
material service disruption within tolerance 
by the regulatory deadline of March 2025.

Financial crime risk across the financial 
services sector has grown as a result of the 
increasing sophistication of bad-actors. In 
recognition of the growing risks, the 
Committee closely monitored 
management’s work to identify and 
mitigate financial crime risk across the 
Group, in line with increased regulatory 
expectations. 

Conduct risk remains a key area of 
oversight. The Committee oversaw 
management’s preparations for the 
implementation of the Financial Conduct 
Authority’s (FCA) ‘Consumer Duty' in July 
2023, and continues to monitor 
management's efforts to ensure good 
outcomes for retail customers. 

During the year, the Committee reviewed 
changes to the Group’s Enterprise Risk 
Management Framework (ERMF), to 
underpin work to strengthen how the 
Group manages the risks of non-
compliance with laws, rules and regulations 
(LRR). As part of this a new LRR risk was 
established alongside conduct risk under a 
new Principal Risk called Compliance risk.

Looking ahead 

The Committee actively encourages 
management to be alert to areas of 
emerging risk, particularly in light of the 
rapidly evolving macroeconomic, 
geopolitical and technological 
environments. As we move into 2024, 
geopolitical tensions, macroeconomic 
uncertainty and inflationary pressures are 
expected to continue, with further 
uncertainty on the horizon in light of the 
upcoming election cycles in many of our 
key markets, including the US and UK. The 
Committee will continue to work with 
management to anticipate, stress test and 
prepare for periods of volatility to prevent 
outsized or unexpected losses 
materialising and to manage emerging 
risks as they arise. 

Robert Berry

Chair, Board Risk Committee

19 February 2024

The Committee continued to oversee how 
climate change is driving financial and 
operational risks, the materiality of their 
impact and how Barclays is managing them 
through the Climate Principal Risk 
Framework. The Committee received 
updates on the Bank’s ongoing 
advancements to its climate risk 
management approach, including the 
development of a risk appetite, monitored 
through a range of quantitative metrics. 
The Committee also heard from senior 
business leaders about how climate risks 
are being integrated into their business 
strategies and plans.

The Committee approved the results of 
the 2023 internal climate stress test (CST) 
and considered lessons learned that will 
enable Barclays to better assess specific 
climate vulnerabilities as well as the impact 
that climate factors can have on the 
financial stresses used to calibrate overall 
risk appetite. The Committee will continue 
to maintain close oversight of the annual 
CST as it is further integrated into the 
Group’s planning and stress testing 
framework. 

As part of its work overseeing climate risk, 
the Committee worked closely with the 
Board Audit Committee and Board 
Sustainability Committee, ensuring a 
streamlined view of matters of relevance 
across the Committees. 

The Group uses models and data to 
support a broad range of business 
decisions and risk management activities 
across the Group. This is an area impacted 
by rapid technological change and 
increasing regulatory scrutiny and the 
Committee continued to focus on the 
Bank’s approach to managing the 
associated risks, including its approach to 
developing and validating models, and 
monitoring of their performance through a 
volatile macro environment.

The volume of regulatory change across 
the global financial services industry is 
significant. The Committee heard from 
management about the impact of these 
changes for Barclays and the work 
necessary to ensure compliance. This is an 
area to which the Committee expects to 
devote attention in 2024 and beyond. 

By way of a final word, in 2023, the 
Committee oversaw a change to the 
senior management of the Compliance 
function, with the appointment of a new 
Group Chief Compliance Officer, Kirsty 
Everett, who took up the role in July 2023. 
In 2023 we also welcomed both Marc 
Moses and Sir John Kingman (Chair of 
Barclays UK) to the Committee, both of 
whom bring with them a deep knowledge 
of financial services.
Committee effectiveness 

The results of the Committee 
effectiveness review for 2023 confirm the 
Committee is operating effectively; it is 
considered well constituted and chaired, 
providing an effective and appropriate level 
of challenge and oversight of the areas 
within its remit. Feedback noted members’ 
wide and diverse skills and experience, 
recognising that recent additions to 
Committee composition had been positive 
in providing the Committee with a deeper 
retail perspective. Feedback indicates that 
the Committee is considered to operate at 
the right level of debate. It also confirms 
that the allocation of time between agenda 
items in meetings is appropriate, with 
sufficient time for discussion and 
challenge. 

The Committee’s interaction with the 
Board, Board Committees and senior 
management is also considered effective, 
noting that sufficient time is allocated at 
Board meetings for the Chair to report to 
the Board on the work of the Committee. 
Feedback indicated that concurrent 
meetings of the BPLC and BBPLC Board 
Risk Committee continue to be effective, 
with coverage of BBPLC matters within 
concurrent meetings considered 
appropriate. 

Interaction with the BBUKPLC Board Risk 
Committee was also considered effective, 
confirming that the Committee continues 
to exercise appropriate oversight of issues 
relevant to the Committee’s remit relating 
to BBUKPLC.

Please see the report of the Board 
Nominations Committee for further details 
on the process for conducting the 2023 
Committee effectiveness review.

Directors’ report: Board Sustainability Committee report

Driving forward our net zero ambition

Overseeing our climate and sustainability strategy.

Dear Fellow Shareholders

I am delighted to present to you the first 
report of the Board Sustainability 
Committee. 

In March 2020, Barclays announced its 
ambition to be a net zero bank by 2050, 
becoming one of the first banks to do so. In 
2023, we continued to pursue 
opportunities and support our clients as 
they transition their businesses to a low-
carbon economy. 

When I wrote to you ahead of our 2023 
AGM, I highlighted that a key commitment 
for Barclays over the subsequent 12 
months was to help finance this transition 
and in December 2022 we announced a 
new target to facilitate $1trn of Sustainable 
and Transition Financing between 2023 
and 2030, and increased our investment 
mandate to £500m of capital to invest in 
early-stage climate-tech companies by the 
end of 2027. Today we are reporting 
$67.8bn financing facilitated towards the 
$1trn Sustainable and Transition Financing 
target and £138m invested since March 
2020 in 21 climate-tech companies. 

A second key priority was to assess 
baseline emissions for the four remaining 
high-emitting sectors in our portfolio, as 
well as developing a high-level modelled 
assessment of our overall balance sheet, 
consistent with the approach outlined by 
the Partnership for Carbon Accounting 
Financials (PCAF). We have announced 
new targets for Aviation, Commercial Real 
Estate and Agriculture, and published our 
first high-level modelled assessment under 
PCAF. We have also published our updated 
Climate Change Statement which includes 
new restrictions on oil and gas financing. In 
particular, we will stop directly financing 
new oil and gas projects, and have set clear 
expectations for our energy clients to 
produce transition or decarbonisation 
plans and set near-term targets to reduce 
emissions.

The final key priority was to refine our 
Client Transition Framework so as to 
improve our ability to work with clients in 
high-emitting sectors on their individual 
transition plans. This will allow us to 
measure and monitor our clients’ 
decarbonisation progress and assess the 
implications for our targets, and to offer 
more tailored support to clients’ transition 
requirements.

Having cross-membership on the 
Committee with the Chairs of our Board 
Audit, Remuneration and Risk Committees, 
as well as connectivity with the BBUKPLC 
Board, helps to ensure a streamlined 
approach to Board-level oversight of all 
climate and sustainability related matters.
Committee effectiveness

The results of the Committee 
effectiveness review for 2023 confirm the 
Committee is operating effectively. It is 
considered well constituted and chaired, 
providing high-quality oversight and 
constructive challenge to management in 
the areas within its remit. The review 
highlights that the Committee is 
considered to have the right level of skills 
and experience, including climate/
sustainability expertise, and is of an 
appropriate size. The review noted the 
benefits of having cross-membership 
between the Committee and the Board Risk 
Committee and the Board Audit 
Committee, and having the Group Chief 
Executive as a member of the Committee 
in the context of the development of 
Barclays’ climate strategy as well as the 
skills and experience he brings to the 
Committee.

Note

1 There were four scheduled Committee meetings 
held in 2023. Owing to prior commitments, Brian 
Gilvary was unable to attend two meetings and Dawn 
Fitzpatrick was unable to attend one meeting.

The Board has direct oversight of and 
responsibility for the Group’s climate and 
sustainability strategy. However, given the 
importance of this work and the growing 
importance of other sustainability areas, 
including nature and biodiversity, in March 
2023 the Board approved the 
establishment of a new Board 
Sustainability Committee to support and 
advise the Board in its oversight of climate 
and sustainability matters.

The Committee receives presentations 
into the challenges and opportunities in 
this area (including external input on 
specific areas of focus), undertakes 
detailed reviews and discussions and 
makes recommendations to the Board on 
key topics. The table on page 182 provides 
an overview of the Committee’s work in 
2023 supporting the Board in overseeing 
the activities to meet our climate priorities. 

In addition to myself, the members of the 
Committee are Robert Berry, Dawn 
Fitzpatrick, Mary Francis, Brian Gilvary, C.S. 
Venkatakrishnan and Julia Wilson. Tracy 
Corrigan also attends Committee 
meetings as a non-executive 
representative of the BBUKPLC Board.

As an Executive member of the Committee, our Group Chief Executive brings 
invaluable climate and sustainability insight to the Committee’s discussions, 
including the views of key external stakeholders. He is also a member of the UNEP 
FI Leadership Council and a member of the CNBC ESG Council, and through those 
roles he is able to bring external perspectives of key climate/sustainability matters 
to the Committee’s discussions.

Annual Report 2023 181

Directors’ report: Board Sustainability Committee report (continued)

Feedback indicates that the Committee is 
considered to operate at the right level of 
debate, and that the allocation of time 
between agenda items in Committee 
meetings is appropriate, with sufficient time 
for discussion and challenge, and focus on 
the right matters. 

The review concluded that the 
Committee’s interaction with the Board, 
Board Committees and senior 
management is considered effective, 
noting that sufficient time is allocated at 
Board meetings for the Chair to report to 
the Board on the work of the Committee 
and to provide feedback on key 
sustainability policy matters in support of 
the Board’s continued oversight. Feedback 
indicated that concurrent meetings of the 
BPLC and BBPLC Board Sustainability 
Committee are effective, with coverage of 
BBPLC matters within concurrent 
meetings considered appropriate. The 
addition of a representative to the 
Committee from the BBUKPLC Board at 

the beginning of 2024 was considered to 
support ongoing BBUKPLC Board 
engagement in respect of sustainability 
matters impacting the Group.

Please see the report of the Board 
Nominations Committee for further details 
on the process for conducting the 2023 
Committee effectiveness review.
Looking ahead

Looking ahead to 2024, a key focus for the 
Committee will be oversight of 
management’s development of Barclays' 
transition plan, informed by the work of the 
UK's Transition Plan Taskforce, in 
conjunction with ongoing work to 
implement the Group’s climate strategy by 
supporting clients with their transition 
plans. 

A critical component of the work 
undertaken to addressing the climate 
challenge is the approach by governments 
with respect to climate and sustainability 
policy and financing. The importance of 

having clear requirements for the 
transition, and clarity and consistency in 
respect of government policy and 
financing, are key in supporting all those 
committed to transitioning to a low carbon 
economy. This is an area to which the 
Committee will have close regard this year. 

Finally, as indicated above, nature and 
biodiversity are areas of growing 
importance on the sustainability agenda. 
The Committee is looking forward to 
building on the work done in 2023 and the 
external briefing it received on this subject 
by having a greater focus on the impact of 
these areas, including how they can be 
reflected in Barclays’ own ambition to be a 
net zero bank.

appointments are viewed through a diversity 
lens and are based on merit and objective 
criteria, which focus on the skills and 
experience required for the Board's 
effectiveness and the delivery of the Group's 
strategy. 

A revised Board Diversity and Inclusion Policy 
was adopted on 8 February 2024. For further 
detail, refer to the Board Nominations 
Committee report on page 158.

rigorous and transparent process facilitated 
by the Board Nominations Committee, with 
the aid of external search consultancy firms. 

All Directors are subject to annual re-election 
at the AGM. See page 185 for further detail. 

Each year, we carry out an effectiveness 
review to evaluate the performance of the 
Board, Board Committees and individual 
Directors. In line with the Code, the review 
was conducted internally for 2023, and is 
expected to be conducted externally in 2024.

Committee, is responsible for ensuring the 
independence and effectiveness of the 
internal audit function and external auditors.  

The Directors are responsible for ensuring 
that management maintains an effective 
system of risk management and internal 
control and for assessing its effectiveness. 
Such a system is designed to identify, 
evaluate and manage, rather than eliminate, 
the risk of failure to achieve business 
objectives and can only provide reasonable, 
and not absolute, assurance against material 
misstatement or loss. 

Processes are in place for identifying, 
evaluating and managing the Principal Risks 
facing the Group. A key component of The 
Barclays Guide is the ERMF. The purpose of 
the ERMF is to identify and set minimum 
requirements of the main risks to the 
strategic objectives of the Group.

The Group is committed to operating within 
a strong system of internal control. The 
Barclays Guide contains the overarching 
framework setting out the approach of the 
Group to internal governance. 

Key controls are assessed on a regular basis 
for both design and operating effectiveness. 
Issues arising out of these assessments, 
where appropriate, are reported to the 
Board Audit Committee. 

The Board Audit Committee oversees the 
control environment (and remediation of 
related issues). It also reviews annually the 
risk management and internal control 
system. 

The Board Audit Committee has concluded 
that throughout the year ended 31 
December 2023 and to date, the Group has 
operated an effective system of internal 
control that provides reasonable assurance 
of financial and operational controls and 
compliance with laws and regulations. 

You can read more about the Board Audit 
Committee and its work, including its 
oversight of the internal control framework 
and areas of ongoing enhancement, from 
page 191.

Remuneration

The Remuneration report from page 191 
sets out the purpose and activities of the 
Board Remuneration Committee, a 
summary of the remuneration policy for the 
Executive Directors and how it is aligned 
with the policy for the wider workforce, as 
well as the Directors’ remuneration 
outcomes for 2023.

The remuneration policies and procedures 
support the Group's strategy and enable us 
to reward sustainable performance, which is 
a key element of our Remuneration 
Philosophy, in line with our Values, Mindset 
and risk expectations.

All Executive Director and senior 
management remuneration policies are 
developed in accordance with the Group's 
formal and transparent procedures 
(ensuring that no Director is involved in 
deciding their own remuneration outcome) 
and are, where possible, aligned to wider 
workforce policies.

Board Remuneration Committee members 
exercise independent judgement and 
discretion when determining remuneration 
outcomes, considering the company and 
individual performance, wider workforce 
and other relevant stakeholder 
considerations.

Allotment for cash of equity securities

Waiver of dividends

Section 414A of the Companies Act 2006 
requires the Directors to present a 
Strategic report in the Annual Report and 
Financial Statements. This report can be 
found on pages 3 to 55.

The Company has chosen, in accordance 
with section 414C(11) of the Companies 
Act 2006, and as noted in this Directors’ 
report, to include certain matters in its 
Strategic report that would otherwise be 
disclosed in this Directors’ report:

• an indication of likely future 

developments may be found in the 
Strategic report

• the particulars of important events 
affecting the Company since the 
financial year end can be found in the 
Strategic report and Note 25 (Legal, 
competition and regulatory matters) to 
the financial statements. 

Profit and dividends 

Statutory profit after tax for 2023 was 
£5,323m (2022: £5,973m). The 2023 full 
year dividend of 5.3p per ordinary share will 
be paid on 3 April 2024 to shareholders 
whose names are on the Register of 
Members at the close of business on 1 
March 2024. With the 2023 half year 
dividend totalling 2.7p per ordinary share, 
paid in September 2023, the total dividend 
for 2023 is 8.0p (2022: 7.25p) per ordinary 
share. The half year and full year dividends 
for 2023 amounted to £1,210m (2022: 
£1,028m). BPLC also completed share 
buy-back programmes during 2023, 
further details of which can be found later 
in this section.

Shareholders may have their dividends 
reinvested in Barclays by joining the 
Barclays Dividend Reinvestment Plan 
(DRIP). Further details regarding the DRIP 
can be found at home.barclays/dividends 
and shareview.co.uk/info/drip

The nominee company of certain 
Employee Benefit Trusts (EBTs) holding 
shares in Barclays in connection with the 
operation of our employee share plans has 
lodged evergreen dividend waivers on 
shares held by it that have not been 
allocated to employees. The total amount 
of dividends waived during the year ended 
31 December 2023 was £1.70m (2022: 
£6.28m).

Directors’ indemnities

Qualifying third party indemnity provisions 
(as defined by Section 234 of the 
Companies Act 2006) were in force during 
the course of the financial year ended 
31 December 2023 for the benefit of the 
then Directors of the Company and the 
then Directors of certain of the Company's 
subsidiaries and, at the date of this report, 
are in force for the benefit of the Directors 
of the Company and the directors of 
certain of the Company's subsidiaries in 
relation to certain losses and liabilities 
which they may incur (or have incurred) in 
connection with their duties, powers or 
office. The Group also maintains Directors’ 
and Officers’ Liability Insurance which gives 
appropriate cover for legal action brought 
against its Directors. 

Qualifying pension scheme indemnity 
provisions (as defined by Section 235 of 
the Companies Act 2006) were in force 
during the course of the financial year 
ended 31 December 2023 for the benefit 
of the then Directors, and at the date of

political purposes in the UK or outside the 
UK, nor did it make any political donations 
to political parties or other political 
organisations or to any independent 
election candidates, nor did it incur any

Support for candidates and colleagues 
with disabilities and long-term 
conditions 

Barclays is committed to attracting and 
retaining a diverse workforce, and our 
commitment to inclusion means we want 
to ensure that candidates with disabilities 
and long-term health conditions receive 
support and adjustments in the application 
process and beyond. Barclays welcomes 
applications from all candidates and is 
committed to ensuring reasonable 
adjustments (accommodations) are put in 
place to ensure a fair and inclusive 
recruitment process. Barclays is 
committed to providing all colleagues with 
the support and tools they need to have a 
productive and fulfilling career. We can 
consider making adjustments to remove 
or reduce barriers colleagues might face if 
they have a disability, health concern or 
mental health condition We also ensure 
opportunities for training, career 
development and promotion are available 
to all.
Research and development

In the ordinary course of business, the 
Group develops new products and services 
in each of its business divisions.

Greenhouse gas emissions, 
energy consumption and energy 
efficiency action

Although financed emissions account for 
the greatest proportion of our climate 
impact, we have also continued addressing 
our operational emissions – an important 
factor in meeting our ambition to be a net 
zero bank by 2050.
Progress to date

1
In 2023 we achieved our milestone
 of 
50% reduction of our Scope 1 and 2 
location-based GHG emissions ahead of 
2030 – reducing these emissions by 51%Δ. 
We continued to source 100% renewableΔ 
2
electricity
 for our global real estate 
3
portfolio
 and continued to meet our 90% 
Scope 1 and 2 market-based emissions 
4
 – reducing these 
reduction target
emissions by 93%Δ.
Key contributors to our progress include 
5
global real estate portfolio right-sizing
and energy efficiency programmes, as well 
as company vehicles electrification, and 
our continued focus on renewable 
electricity sourcing.

For our Scope 3 operational emissions our 
focus remained on engaging with our key 
stakeholders and making data 
enhancements, particularly by acquiring 
primary supplier data and evolving our 
accounting methodology in line with 
industry standards and best practice. We 
also continued to pursue the integration of 
ESG considerations and expectations into 
processes throughout the procurement 
lifecycle.

We expect that our progress against our 
net zero operations targets and 
milestones is likely to be variable and non-
linear. Our net zero operations strategy is 
dependent on broader industry, 
technological and regulatory changes that 
are outside Barclays’ control and may 
affect our ability to achieve our targets and 
milestones. Further, as the accounting 
standards and data underlying our net zero 
operations strategy continue to evolve 
and be refined, this could impact our 
metrics, targets and milestones.

Annual Report 2023 187

Directors’ report: Other statutory and regulatory information (continued)

Notes

1 In this section, a reference to a 'milestone' denotes an 
indicator we are working towards and report against.
2 We maintained 100% renewable electricity sourcing for 
our global real estate portfolio through instruments 
including green tariffs (55%) and energy attribute 
certificates (EACs)(45%).

3 Global real estate portfolio includes offices, branches, 

campuses and data centres.

4 In this section, a reference to a 'target' denotes an 
indicator linked to our executive remuneration.
5 By right-sizing we are optimising our space and 
associated resources for our operational needs.

Progress against our targets and 
milestones may also be impacted by 
management decisions based on key 
drivers unrelated to climate, for example 
prudent risk management practices. Our 
intent is to enhance data collection and 
accuracy to help identify key contributors 
to our impact, determine opportunities for 
improvement, and support the integration 
of sustainability into our business 
operations.

These measures build on those taken 
during 2022 to implement our net zero 
operations strategy. Further information is 
available on page 191 of the Barclays PLC 
Annual Report 2022. 

GHG Emissions Table and Notes

We have disclosed global GHG emissions 
and energy use data as required by the 
Large and Medium-sized Companies and 
Groups (Accounts and Reports) Regulations 
2008. See the ESG Data Centre for further 
details on our annual operational GHG 
emissions since 2018, including our Scope 1, 
Scope 2 (location and market based) and 
Scope 3 operational emissions. We further

1 The carbon reporting year for our GHG emissions is 1 October to 30 September. The carbon reporting year is not fully aligned to the financial reporting year covered by this Directors’ 

report. Details of our approach to assurance over the data is set out in the 2023 Barclays Strategic report.

2 The methodology used to calculate our GHG emissions follows the 'Greenhouse Gas Protocol (GHG): A Corporate Accounting and Reporting Standard (Revised Edition)', defined by the 
World Resources Institute/World Business Council for Sustainable Development. We have adopted the operational control approach to define our reporting boundary. For 2023, we 
have applied the latest emission factors as of 31 December 2023. Reported emissions for Scope 2 location and market-based have been recalculated back to the 2018 baseline, due to 
updated internal and external data. The associated emissions have also been re-classified from Scope 2 electricity to Scope 3 Category 8 (Upstream Leased Assets) as these emissions 
are currently outside of our operational control. In 2022 we reported Scope 2 location-based emissions of 103,422 tCo2e; the recalculated figure is 99,782 tCO2e. In 2022 we reported 
Scope 2 market-based emissions of 1,883 tCo2e; the recalculated figure is 1,963 tCO2e. In 2022 we reported energy use of 467,939 MWh; the recalculated figure is 463,973 MWh.
3 Scope 1 emissions include our direct GHG emissions from natural gas, fuel oil, company cars and HFC refrigerants. In the case of company-owned vehicles, emissions are limited to UK 

vehicles only as this is the only country in which expense data is available. 

4 Scope 2 GHG emissions include our indirect GHG emissions from purchased electricity, purchased heat, cooling and steam . Market-based emissions have been reported for 2023 and 

2022. We have used a zero emission factor where we have green tariffs or energy attribute certificates in place globally.  

5 Scope 3 category 1, 2 and 4 emissions are excluded as these emissions cannot be broken down by country. Scope 3 category 1, 2 and 4 emissions can be found in the Operational 

Footprint tab of the ESG Data Centre. 

6  Intensity ratio calculations have been calculated using location-based emission factors only.
7 Energy consumption data is captured through utility billing; meter reads or estimates. Principal measures we have undertaken in 2023 to improve energy efficiency include the following: 

• Right-sized our global real estate portfolio, therefore optimising our space and associated resources for our operational needs. 
• Deployed our global energy optimisation programme by adjusting corporate offices' settings and systems during periods of low or no occupancy to reduce our demand for energy 

while keeping our buildings running. In 2023 the programme contributed to approximately 9.1 GWh in energy savings at our UK sites – equivalent to the annual electricity 
consumption of approximately 2,600 UK households. 

Δ    2023 data subject to independent limited assurance under ISAE (UK) 3000 and ISAE 3410. Current and previous limited assurance scope and opinions can be found within the ESG

Directors’ report: Other statutory and regulatory information (continued)

Share capital
Share capital structure

The Company has ordinary shares in issue. 
The Company’s Articles also allow for the 
issuance of sterling, US dollar, euro and 
yen preference shares (preference 
shares). No preference shares have been 
issued as at 16 February 2024 (the latest 
practicable date for inclusion in this report). 
Ordinary shares therefore represent 100% 
of the total issued share capital as at 
31 December 2023 and as at 16 February 
2024 (the latest practicable date for 
inclusion in this report).
Details of the movement in ordinary share 
capital during the year can be found in 
Note 27 to the financial statements. 
The rights and obligations attaching to the 
Company's ordinary shares and 
preference shares are set out in the 
Company's Articles, copies of which are 
available on the Company's website at 
home.barclays/corporategovernance 
Voting

Every member who is present in person or 
represented at any general meeting of the 
Company, and who is entitled to vote, has 
one vote on a show of hands. Every proxy 
present has one vote. The proxy will have 
one vote for, and one vote against, a 
resolution if he/she has been instructed to 
vote for, or against, the resolution by 
different members or in one direction by a 
member while another member has 
permitted the proxy discretion as to how 
to vote.
On a poll, every member who is present in 
person or by proxy and who is entitled to 
vote has one vote for every share held. In 
the case of joint holders, only the vote of 
the senior holder (as determined by the 
order in the share register) or his/her proxy 
may be counted. If any sum payable 
remains unpaid in relation to a member’s 
shareholding, that member is not entitled 
to vote that share or exercise any other 
right in relation to a meeting of the 
Company unless the Board otherwise 
determines.
If any member, or any other person 
appearing to be interested in any of the 
Company’s ordinary shares, is served with 
a notice under Section 793 of the 
Companies Act 2006 and does not supply 
the Company with the information 
required in the notice, then the Board, in its 
absolute discretion, may direct that that 
member shall not be entitled to attend or 
vote at any meeting of the Company. 

Person interested

2
BlackRock, Inc.

Notes 

The Board may further direct that, if the 
shares of the defaulting member 
represent 0.25% or more of the issued 
shares of the relevant class, dividends or 
other monies payable on those shares 
shall be retained by the Company until the 
direction ceases to have effect and no 
transfer of those shares shall be registered 
(other than certain specified ‘excepted 
transfers’). A direction ceases to have 
effect seven days after the Company has 
received the information requested, or 
when the Company is notified that an 
excepted transfer of all of the relevant 
shares to a third party has occurred, or as 
the Board otherwise determines.
Transfers

Ordinary shares may be held in either 
certificated or uncertificated form. 
Certificated ordinary shares may be 
transferred in writing in any usual or other 
form approved by the Group Company 
Secretary and executed by or on behalf of 
the transferor. Transfers of uncertificated 
ordinary shares must be made in 
accordance with the Companies Act 2006 
and the CREST Regulations.
The Board is not bound to register a 
transfer of partly paid ordinary shares or 
fully paid shares in exceptional 
circumstances approved by the FCA. 
The Board may also decline to register an 
instrument of transfer of certificated 
ordinary shares unless (i) it is duly stamped, 
deposited at the prescribed place and 
accompanied by the share certificate(s) 
and such other evidence as reasonably 
required by the Board to evidence right to 
transfer, (ii) it is in respect of one class of 
shares only, and (iii) it is in favour of a single 
transferee or not more than four joint 
transferees (except in the case of 
executors or trustees of a member).
The Company is not aware of any 
agreements between holders of securities 
that may result in restrictions on the 
transfer of securities or voting rights.
Variation of rights

The rights attached to any class of shares 
may be varied either with the consent in 
writing of the holders of at least 75% in 
nominal value of the issued shares of that 
class, or with the sanction of a special 
resolution passed at a separate meeting of 
the holders of the shares of that class. The 
rights of shares shall not (unless expressly 
provided by the rights attached to such 
shares) be deemed varied by the creation 
of further shares ranking equally with them 
or subsequent to them.

Limitations on foreign shareholders

There are no restrictions imposed by the 
Articles or (subject to the effect of any 
economic sanctions that may be in force 
from time to time) by current UK laws 
which relate only to non-residents of the 
UK and which limit the rights of such non-
residents to hold or (when entitled to do 
so) vote the ordinary shares.
Exercisability of rights under an 
employee share scheme

EBTs operate in connection with certain of 
the Group’s Employee Share Plans (Plans). 
The trustees of the EBTs may exercise all 
rights attached to the shares in 
accordance with their fiduciary duties, 
other than as specifically restricted in the 
documents governing the Plans. The 
trustees of the EBTs have informed the 
Company that their normal policy is to 
abstain from voting in respect of the 
Barclays shares held in trust. The trustees 
of the Global Sharepurchase EBT and UK 
Sharepurchase EBT may vote in respect of 
Barclays shares held in the EBTs, but only 
as instructed by participants in those Plans 
in respect of their partnership shares and 
(when vested) matching and dividend 
shares. The trustees will not otherwise 
vote in respect of shares held in the 
Sharepurchase EBTs.
Special rights

There are no persons holding securities 
that carry special rights with regard to the 
control of the Company.
Major shareholders

Major shareholders do not have different 
voting rights from those of other 
shareholders. Information provided to the 
Company by substantial shareholders 
(holding voting rights of 3% or more in the 
financial instruments of the Company) 
pursuant to the DTRs are published via a 
Regulatory Information Service and is 
available on the Company’s website. As at 
31 December 2023, the Company had 
been notified under Rule 5 of the DTRs of 
the following holdings of voting rights in

Directors’ report: Other statutory and regulatory information (continued)

Powers of Directors to issue and allot or 
buy back the Company’s shares

The powers of the Directors are 
determined by the Companies Act 2006 
and the Company’s Articles. The Directors 
are authorised to issue and allot shares 
and to buy back shares subject to, and on 
the terms of, the annual shareholder 
approval at the AGM. Such authorities 
were granted by shareholders at the 2023 
AGM. It will be proposed at the 2024 AGM 
that the Directors be granted new 
authorities to issue and allot and buy back 
shares.
Repurchase of shares

On 13 March 2023 and 28 July 2023 the 
Company commenced share buy-back 
programmes to purchase its ordinary 
shares of £0.25p each up a maximum 
consideration of £500m and £750m, 
respectively. The first share buy-back 
programme concluded on 14 April 2023 
and the second share buy-back 
programme concluded on 23 October 
2023. The Company repurchased for 
cancellation 343,041,720 ordinary shares 
at a volume weighted average price of 
145.7549 pence per ordinary share during 
the first buy-back programme and 
493,603,770 ordinary shares at a volume 
weighted average price of 151.9437 pence 
per ordinary share during the second buy-
back programme. The purpose of the buy-
back programmes was to reduce the 
Company’s number of outstanding 
ordinary shares. 

In aggregate, the Company purchased 
836,645,490 ordinary shares during 2023 
with an aggregate nominal value of 
approximately £209m (this represented 
approximately 5.5% of the Company's 
issued share capital as at 31 December 
2023) for an aggregate consideration of 
£1,250m excluding taxes and expenses.
All of the repurchased ordinary shares 
have been cancelled. 

No further shares have been repurchased 
since the completion of the second share 
buy-back programme on 23 October 
2023. The maximum number of ordinary 
shares which could be repurchased by the 
Company as part of any share buy-back 
under the authority for on-market share 
buy-backs granted at the 2023 AGM is 
1,093,533,143 ordinary shares (being 
1,587,136,913 less the 493,603,770 
shares repurchased as part of the second 
share buy-back programme).
Distributable reserves

As at 31 December 2023, the distributable 
reserves of the Company were £21,162m 
(2022: £21,701m).

Change of control

There are no significant agreements to 
which the Company is a party that take 
effect, alter or terminate on a change of 
control of the Company following a 
takeover bid. There are no agreements 
between the Company and its Directors or 
employees providing for compensation for 
loss of office or employment that occurs 
because of a takeover bid.
Controls over financial reporting

A framework of disclosure controls and 
procedures is in place to support the 
approval of the financial statements of the 
Group. 

Specific governance committees are 
responsible for examining the financial 
reports and disclosures to help ensure that 
they have been subject to adequate 
verification and comply with applicable 
standards and legislation. 

Where appropriate, these committees 
report their conclusions to the Board Audit 
Committee, which debates such 
conclusions and provides further 
challenge. Finally, the Board scrutinises and 
approves results announcements and the 
Annual Report to ensure that appropriate 
disclosures have been made. This 
governance process is designed to ensure 
that both management and the Board are 
given sufficient opportunity to debate and 
challenge the financial statements of the 
Group and other significant disclosures 
before they are made public. 
Management’s report on internal control 
over financial reporting 

Management is responsible for 
establishing and maintaining adequate 
internal control over financial reporting 
under the supervision of the principal 
executive and financial officers, to provide 
reasonable assurance regarding the 
reliability of financial reporting and the 
preparation of financial statements, in 
accordance with (a) UK-adopted 
international accounting standards; and (b) 
International Financial Reporting 
Standards (IFRS) as issued by the 
International Accounting Standards Board 
(IASB), including interpretations issued by 
the IFRS Interpretations Committee.  

Internal control over financial reporting 
includes policies and procedures that 
pertain to the maintenance of records 
that, in reasonable detail: 

• accurately and fairly reflect transactions 

and dispositions of assets 

• provide reasonable assurances that 

transactions are recorded as necessary 
to permit preparation of financial 
statements in accordance with UK-
adopted international accounting 
standards and IFRS and that receipts 
and expenditures are being made only in 
accordance with authorisations of 
management and the respective 
Directors 

• provide reasonable assurance regarding 

prevention or timely detection of 
unauthorised acquisition, use or 
disposition of assets that could have a 
material effect on the financial 
statements. 

Internal control systems, no matter how 
well designed, have inherent limitations 
and may not prevent or detect 
misstatements. Also, projections of any 
evaluation of effectiveness to future 
periods are subject to the risk that internal 
control over financial reporting may 
become inadequate because of changes in 
conditions or that the degree of 
compliance with the policies or procedures 
may deteriorate.

Management has assessed internal 
control over financial reporting as at 31 
December 2023. In making its 
assessment, management utilised the 
criteria set out in the 2013 COSO 
framework. Management has concluded 
that, based on its assessment, internal 
control over financial reporting was 
effective as at 31 December 2023. 

The system of internal financial and 
operational controls is also subject to 
regulatory oversight in the UK and 
overseas. Further information on 
supervision by financial services regulators 
is provided under Supervision and 
Regulation in the Risk review section on 
pages 363 to 372.
Changes in internal control over financial 
reporting  

There have been no changes that 
occurred during the period covered by this 
report, which have materially affected or 
are reasonably likely to materially affect the 
Group’s internal control over financial 
reporting.

Directors’ report: Other statutory and regulatory information (continued)

Disclosure of information to the auditor

Preparation of accounts

Each Director confirms that, so far as he/
she is aware, there is no relevant audit 
information of which our auditor is 
unaware and that each of the Directors 
has taken all the steps that he/she ought 
to have taken as a Director to make 
himself/herself aware of any relevant audit 
information and to establish that our 
auditor is aware of that information. This 
confirmation is given pursuant to Section 
418 of the Companies Act 2006 and 
should be interpreted in accordance with, 
and subject to, those provisions.
Directors’ responsibilities

The following statement, which should be 
read in conjunction with the Auditor’s 
report set out on pages 396 to 412, is 
made with a view to distinguishing for 
shareholders the respective 
responsibilities of the Directors and of the 
auditor in relation to the accounts.
Going concern

The Group’s business activities and factors 
likely to affect its future development and 
performance are disclosed in the Strategic 
report and Risk review sections of this 
report. The financial performance is 
disclosed within the Financial review with 
funding, liquidity and capital details 
contained within the Risk performance 
section. The Group’s objectives and 
policies in managing the financial risks to 
which it is exposed are discussed in the 
Risk management section.

The Directors considered it appropriate to 
prepare the financial statements on a 
going concern basis.

In preparing each of the Group and 
company financial statements, the 
Directors are required to:

• assess the Group and Company’s ability 

to continue as a going concern, 
disclosing, as applicable, matters related 
to going concern

• use the going concern basis of 

accounting unless they either intend to 
liquidate the Group or the Parent 
company or to cease operations, or 
have no realistic alternative but to do so.

The Directors are required by the 
Companies Act 2006 to prepare Group 
and Company accounts for each financial 
year and, with regard to Group accounts, in 
accordance with UK-adopted international 
accounting standards. The Directors have 
prepared these accounts in accordance 
with (a) UK-adopted international 
accounting standards; and (b) IFRS as 
issued by the IASB, including 
interpretations issued by the IFRS 
Interpretations Committee. Pursuant to 
the Companies Act 2006, the Directors 
must not approve the accounts unless 
they are satisfied that they give a true and 
fair view of the state of affairs of the Group 
and the Company and of their profit or loss 
for that period.

The Directors consider that, in preparing 
the financial statements, the Group and 
the Company have used appropriate 
accounting policies, supported by 
reasonable judgements and estimates, 
and that all accounting standards which 
they consider to be applicable have been 
followed.

The Directors are satisfied that the Annual 
Report and financial statements, taken as a 
whole, are fair, balanced and 
understandable, and provide the 
information necessary for shareholders to 
assess the Group and Company’s position 
and performance, business model and 
strategy.

The Directors are responsible for such 
internal controls as they determine are 
necessary to enable the preparation of 
financial statements that are free from 
material misstatement, whether due to 
fraud or error.
Directors’ responsibility statement

The Directors have responsibility for 
ensuring that the Company and the Group 
keep accounting records which disclose 
with reasonable accuracy the financial 
position of the Company and the Group 
and which enable them to ensure that the 
accounts comply with the Companies Act 
2006.

The Directors are also responsible for 
preparing a Strategic report, Directors’ 
report, Directors’ remuneration report and 
Corporate Governance Statement in 
accordance with applicable law and 
regulations.

The Directors are responsible for the 
maintenance and integrity of the Annual 
Report and Financial Statements as they 
appear on our website. Legislation in the 
UK governing the preparation and 
dissemination of financial statements may 
differ from legislation in other jurisdictions.

The Directors have a general responsibility 
for taking such steps as are reasonably 
open to them to safeguard the assets of 
the Group and to prevent and detect fraud 
and other irregularities.

The Directors, whose names and functions 
are set out on pages 145 to 148, confirm 
to the best of their knowledge that:

(a) the financial statements, prepared in 
accordance with (i) UK-adopted 
international accounting standards; and (ii) 
IFRS as issued by the IASB, including 
interpretations issued by the IFRS 
Interpretations Committee, give a true and 
fair view of the assets, liabilities, financial 
position and profit or loss of the Company 
and the undertakings included in the 
consolidation taken as a whole; and

(b) the management report, on pages 4 to 
58, which is incorporated in the Directors’ 
report, includes a fair review of the 
development and performance of the 
business and the position of the Company 
and the undertakings included in the 
consolidation taken as a whole, together 
with a description of the Principal Risks and 
uncertainties that they face.

On behalf of the Board, I am pleased to 
present the Remuneration report for 2023. 
Over the next few pages, we set out our 
key considerations and the remuneration 
decisions we took as a result – both for the 
Executive Directors of Barclays PLC and 
for the wider workforce. 
Since last year’s report, Sir John Kingman 
and Julia Wilson have joined the 
Committee – bringing new perspectives 
and a wealth of experience. I would like 
formally to welcome them both.

I would also like to thank you, our 
shareholders, for the support you showed 
at our 2023 Annual General Meeting, 
approving both our current Directors’ 
Remuneration Policy to apply for three 
years from the date of that meeting – 
supported by 97% of shareholder votes – 
and the implementation during 2022 of our 
previous Directors' Remuneration Policy.
Performance in 2023 

As always, our remuneration approach is 
rooted in our commitment to reward 
sustainable performance. As the Group 
Chief Executive sets out in his review, our 
diversified income approach has enabled 
us to continue to deliver well in 2023 
despite an external backdrop of persistent 
uncertainty – with heightened volatility 
across asset classes, some significant 
market disruption, and escalating 
geopolitical tensions. In this testing 
environment, we took deliberate, proactive 
steps to protect the Group: maintaining a 
prudent approach to risk management; 
managing our balance sheet with care; and 
continuing to invest in talent and 
technology in sustainable growth areas, 
while maintaining our focus on costs.

Barclays demonstrated its sound footing in 
2023 and continued to see solid income

performance across all three of our 
operating businesses – resulting in Group 
income of £25.4bn, up 2% on 2022. 
Operating expenses for 2023 were 
£16.9bn, a 1% increase on 2022, reflecting 
business growth, investment spend and 
inflation – delivering statutory profit before 
tax of £6.6bn (2022: £7.0bn), down 6%. 

This included £927m of structural cost 
actions taken in the fourth quarter to help 
drive future returns, having reviewed the 
shape, efficiency and focus of our 
businesses. Excluding these costs, profit 
before tax was £7.5bn (2022: £7.7bn, 
excluding the Over-issuance of Securities) 
and RoTE was 10.6%, achieving our 
greater-than-10% target. Our primary 
frame of reference was financial outcomes 
1
on this basis
, to understand the 
underlying performance of the business 
separate from the costs associated with 
the decisions we made to shape its future. 
We ended the year with a CET1 ratio of 
13.8%, within our target range of 13% to 
14%. We will deliver increased capital 
distributions to shareholders, up c.37% on 
2022, via a total dividend for the year of 
8.0p per share and £1.75bn of announced 
share buybacks – equivalent to a total 
payout of c.19.4p per share.

Although income is down for some 
business areas, those reductions are from 
a starting point of strong 2022 
performance for most business areas.
The Corporate and Investment Bank in 
2023 saw income down slightly, a resilient

performance given the unsettled 
macroeconomic backdrop and the lowest 
investment banking wallet in the last 
2
decade
. Global Markets continued to 
grow its income from our top 100 clients 
and maintained its revenue ranking of 
3
sixth
. Investment Banking also maintained 
its sixth rank globally, despite the subdued 
dealmaking environment, and returned to 
4
first in the UK
, up from fourth in 2022. For 
Consumer, Cards and Payments, income 
was up 18%, reflecting the expansion and 
deepening of our client relationships – 
including our latest partnership launch with 
Microsoft and Mastercard. Income was 
also up in Barclays UK, supported by the 
higher interest rate environment, partially 
offset by competition in mortgage and 
savings products.

Annual Report 2023 192

Remuneration report (continued)

The Committee has maintained its focus 
on ensuring we reward performance that is 
sustainable. During 2023 the management 
team has been embedding a new 
operating standard – Consistently 
Excellent – which aims to transform the 
operational resilience of Barclays. Raising 
our operating standards and reducing the 
impact on financial performance of 
unexpected issues will strengthen our 
foundation to deliver sustainable 
performance. This was reflected in our 
objective setting, performance 
assessment and reward processes for 
senior colleagues for 2023, and in our 
recognition platform for all colleagues, and 
will be embedded more deeply and widely 
during 2024. Striving to achieve a 
consistently excellent standard is 
becoming part of our culture, and initial 
feedback suggests our work to equip all 
colleagues with the right skills to achieve 
this resonates as a way of driving 
long-term success. 
Colleague remuneration 

Alongside rewarding sustainable 
performance, our Fair Pay Agenda 
continues to underpin all our remuneration 
decisions – ensuring we are paying 
colleagues fairly for the work they do and 
recognising the contributions of all, within 
the resources available to us. This is 
especially pertinent given the challenges 
colleagues continue to face – particularly 
those who are lower-paid, given higher-
than-normal increases in the cost of living 
over recent years. You can read more in 
the 'Wider workforce remuneration' 
section on page 204 and in our sixth annual 
Fair Pay Report published alongside this 
Annual Report. We have also published our 
pay gap figures for employees in the UK 
and in Ireland. 

Paying at least a living wage to all our 
colleagues is a central element of our Fair 
Pay Agenda. We continue to ensure we 
meet or exceed living wage benchmarks in 
every jurisdiction in which our employees  
are based. In the UK our employees  
already received more than the Living 
Wage Foundation’s benchmarks, and we 
are further increasing our minimum UK 
full-time equivalent salary to £24,000. We 
continue to meet or exceed Fair Wage 
Network living wage benchmarks in all 
other countries.

We have continued our work to be simpler, 
more transparent and more consistent in 
how we pay our more-junior colleagues. 
For more junior roles in Barclays UK and 
the support functions in the UK, we publish 
starting salaries by role – providing 

transparency for job candidates and 
existing staff alike. From 2023, the 
performance rating of each individual 
across this population consistently drives 
their annual bonus outcome as a 
percentage of their salary. In previous 
years a range of different approaches were 
used and the annual bonus outcomes for 
many of these roles were discretionary.

In setting this year's incentive pool we 
considered Barclays’ financial and non-
financial performance, and the 
performance of the individual businesses 
that make up the Group, in both absolute 
and relative terms. We considered each 
business's contribution to the 
achievement of our strategic targets and 
its importance to our future success. The 
Committee also wanted to recognise the 
resilience across our operating businesses, 
delivered against a backdrop of 
macroeconomic uncertainty, as well as the 
support our colleagues provided to 
customers and clients. Taking all of this 
into account, the Committee has 
approved a Group incentive pool for 2023 
performance of £1,745m (2022: £1,790m), 
down 3% compared to the final incentive 
pool for 2022, which included a c.£500m 
reduction for risk and control issues that 
came to light during 2022. Risk and 
conduct adjustments to the 2023 
incentive pool are materially less than 
those for 2022, so the incentive pool 
before risk adjustments each year fell by 
c.15% from 2023 to 2022.

This level of incentive funding for 2023 
reflects the lower year-on-year financial 
outcomes in some business areas, while 
also enabling us to reward colleagues for 
the performance delivered – recognising 
the progress made towards our strategic 
priorities and our ambition to be 
consistently excellent in our operations. 
We also considered the competitive 
market for hiring and retaining the talent 
we need to achieve those priorities in the 
future. In doing so, we weighed the views 
and expectations of you as shareholders, 
of our customers and clients, of our 
colleagues, and of our stakeholders in 
wider society. Consistent with our Fair Pay 
Agenda, we have chosen to protect the 
incentive outcomes for our more junior 
colleagues – so, in business areas where 
incentive spend was down year on year, 
more senior colleagues experienced 
greater reductions in annual bonus awards. 
As always, a significant portion of the pool 
will be delivered in shares, most of which 
will be deferred over a number of years.

Remuneration report (continued)

Executive Director remuneration

The Executive Directors' pay in 2024

The Committee carefully considered the 
performance measures for the Executive 
Directors’ 2024 annual bonus and the 
2024-2026 LTIP, and updated elements of 
both the financial and non-financial 
measures in each plan to better reflect the 
revised targets set out under 'Our 
strategy' from page 11, and our long-term 
climate strategy.

For the 2024 annual bonus, a total 
operating expenses measure replaces 
cost: income ratio – reflecting the 
continued importance of cost discipline 
while providing a more focused and simpler 
measure of cost control within the year. 
Other financial measures and weightings in 
the bonus are unchanged. 

For the 2024-2026 LTIP we have 
increased slightly the weighting of RoTE, 
from 25% to 30%, given the focus on 
improving RoTE within the Group's 2026 
targets. This is accommodated via a small 
reduction to the weighting of the relative 
total shareholder return measure from 
25% to 20%. All other financial measures in 
the LTIP remain unchanged from the 
previous year's award, including the 
continued use of cost: income ratio as a 
longer-term cost measure.

We also reviewed the non-financial 
measures for both the 2024 annual bonus 
and 2024-2026 LTIP, to ensure they 
reflect the Group’s shorter- and longer-
term priorities. Our commitment to align 
our financing with the goals and timelines 
of the Paris Climate Agreement has been 
and remains a key component of our 
climate strategy. Many of our climate and 
sustainability targets are longer term, 
including through to 2050, and progress 
towards these is expected to be non-
linear. As such, we have retained the 
Climate & sustainability category within the 
Strategic non-financial assessment for the 
annual bonus and LTIP, but increased its 
weighting in the LTIP from 10% to 15% – 
accommodating this by reducing the 
weighting of the LTIP risk-related 
measures (which this year also incorporate 
assessment of operational excellence) 
from 10% to 5%. 

Determining Executive Directors' pay 
outcomes

The Committee considered the Executive 
Directors’ annual bonus outcomes in the 
context of the Group’s performance and 
the performance of each Executive 
Director during 2023.

The 2023 annual bonus outcome for C.S. 
Venkatakrishnan (known as Venkat) was 
53.3% of maximum, and for Anna Cross 
was 54.3% of maximum (2022: 75.4% for 
both). Profit before tax provided a 21.1% 
outcome out of a possible 50%, and the 
cost: income ratio provided a 2.7% 
outcome out of a possible 10%. 
Performance against the strategic non-
financial measures was good, which 
resulted in a 16.5% outcome out of a 
possible 25% and the performance of each 
of the Executive Directors against their 
personal objectives was also assessed and 
taken into account (13.0% for Venkat and 
14.0% for Anna out of a possible 15%).

Before finalising those outcomes, the 
Committee reflected on their 
appropriateness. We reviewed the 
underlying financial health of the Group, 
which is strong and well-capitalised. We 
considered the bonus outcomes in the 
context of those for the wider workforce, 
ensuring suitable alignment both this year 
and over a multi-year period, and also 
compared to historical outcomes for the 
Executive Directors in the context of 
performance each year. We concluded 
that the outcomes are appropriate in the 
context of the performance achieved and 
that no further discretionary adjustment 
was warranted. 

Neither Venkat nor Anna Cross 
participated in the 2021-2023 LTIP cycle, 
as neither was an Executive Director at the 
time those awards were granted. The 
Committee did, however, assess 
performance against the measures for this 
LTIP cycle to determine the vesting 
outcome for the previous Group Finance 
Director, who is the sole remaining 
participant. This was 53.2% of the 
maximum, as outlined later in this report. 

The Committee decided to grant awards 
under the 2024-2026 LTIP cycle with a 
face value at grant of 140% of Fixed Pay 
for Venkat and 134% of Fixed Pay for Anna 
Cross, reflecting the personal contribution 
made by each to a solid 2023 performance 
– and to provide each with a significant 
incentive award subject to forward-looking 
performance conditions during 2024 to 
2026.

At the same time the ways we approach 
and monitor risk, and ensure a high 
standard of operational performance, are 
fundamental to delivering sustainable 
performance every year. To reflect our 
focus on this across Barclays, we have 
included a Risk & operational excellence 
category within the Strategic non-financial 
element of the 2024 annual bonus, with a 
weighting of 10% – accommodated via a 
slight reduction in the weighting of other 
Strategic non-financial bonus measures. 
The Climate & sustainability, Customers & 
clients, and Colleagues categories are 
each weighted 5%.

The Committee will continue to review the 
measures and weightings for the Executive 
Directors' incentives each year, to ensure 
they appropriately support the delivery of 
our strategy and reflect our priorities.

In early 2024, the Committee reviewed the 
level of Fixed Pay for Venkat and Anna 
Cross, in the same way and at the same 
time as fixed pay was reviewed for the 
wider workforce. The Committee 
increased Fixed Pay by 2.5% for both 
Venkat and Anna, resulting in Fixed Pay of 
£2,947,000 and £1,845,000 respectively,  
effective from 1 March 2024. These 
percentage increases are significantly 
lower than the average across the wider 
workforce, in particular for other UK 
employees within the scope of the 2024 
UK pay deal with the union Unite – with a 
5.55% budget for salary increases for 
junior employees and a 3.75% budget for 
other union-recognised employees. Even 
following these Fixed Pay increases, the 
total compensation opportunity for each 
Executive Director remains well behind the 
median opportunity for equivalent roles 
across our international banking peer 
group.
Shareholder alignment 

Of the total variable pay awards to Venkat 
and Anna Cross in respect of 2023 
performance (2023 annual bonus plus 
2024-2026 LTIP), 96% and 94% 
respectively will be in shares that must be 
retained for a period of between one and 
eight years from grant – aligning the 
Executive Directors' interests with those 
of our shareholders. Both Venkat and Anna 
Cross already have significant 
shareholdings.

Remuneration report (continued)

Group Chair and Non-Executive 
Director fees

The Committee periodically reviews the 
Group Chair's fee, and the Directors' 
Remuneration Policy allows for increases 
of up to 20% during the policy's three-year 
term. The Committee last increased the 
Group Chair's fee with effect from 1 
January 2023, having considered the fee in 
the context of the Chair fees paid across 
our international banking peer group – with 
a particular focus on the UK banks, given 
the regional differences in both the role 
and pay for non-executive directors 
including chairs. Prior to that, this fee had 
remained at the same level since 2015. 
Early in 2024, the Committee approved a 
2% increase in the Group Chair's fee, from 
£840,000 to £856,800, effective 1 January 
2024. Each year £100,000 of the fee will 
continue to be used to purchase Barclays 
shares that will be retained on the Group 
Chair's behalf until he retires from the 
Board. No other changes were made to 
the Group Chair's remuneration 
arrangements or benefits.

In January 2024 the Board reviewed the 
other Non-Executive Directors' fees, 
which were also last increased with effect 
from 1 January 2023, and approved 2% 
increases to those fees effective 
1 January 2024 (with the relevant Non-
Executive Directors having recused 
themselves from those discussions). 
Update in respect of Jes Staley's 
remuneration 

As outlined in the 2021 Annual Report, 
Jes Staley stepped down from the role of 
Group Chief Executive on 
31 October 2021 and his unvested awards 
were suspended pending further 
developments in respect of the regulatory 
and legal proceedings related to the FCA 
and PRA investigation regarding Mr Staley.

In October 2023, the FCA issued a 
Decision Notice in relation to Mr Staley. 

The Committee considered the detailed 
findings in this Decision Notice and 
concluded that Mr Staley should be 
ineligible for or forfeit a number of his 
awards, including the bonus award in 
respect of the 2021 performance year, all 
of his unvested LTIP awards – both those 
for which the performance had already 
been assessed and those still subject to 
performance conditions – and his other 
unvested deferred bonus awards from 
earlier years. The total value of the lapsed 
LTIP awards and forfeited deferred bonus 
awards at that time was £17.8m. 
Looking ahead

As we move into 2024, the Committee 
maintains its commitment to rewarding 
sustainable performance. 

We will use our remuneration policies and 
practices to incentivise the Executive 
Directors and the management team to 
deliver our three year plan, improving 
operational and financial performance, and 
improving shareholder returns. 

We will support the management team to 
use performance management and pay:

– to align the wider workforce to those 

same priorities

– to reinforce the importance of good 
conduct, strong controls and risk 
management and

– to support Barclays' Purpose, Values 
and Mindset, and our ambition to 
achieve a standard of being consistently 
excellent.

We will continue to engage with our 
shareholders and other stakeholders on 
pay and will be meeting with our largest 
shareholders to discuss our pay outcomes 
for 2023. 

Beyond this, we will maintain focus on our 
Fair Pay Agenda, continuing to support our 
colleagues and ensuring the way we pay 
our people supports the long-term health 
and success of the Group.

Brian Gilvary

Chair, Board Remuneration Committee 
February 2024 

Removal of the regulatory 
requirement to operate 
a 2:1 'bonus cap'

With effect from 31 October 2023, 
the PRA and FCA removed the UK 
regulatory requirement for certain 
banks, including Barclays, to apply a 
maximum 1:1 ratio of variable to fixed 
remuneration for employees who are 
deemed to have a material risk impact 
on their firm – known as Material Risk 
Takers (MRTs) – or up to a 2:1 ratio if 
shareholders approve the adoption of 
that higher maximum. Our 
shareholders approved the adoption 
of a 2:1 maximum ratio for Barclays 
MRTs around the time that these 
regulations first came into effect.   
Going forward, such banks – including 
Barclays – will be permitted to set their 
maximum variable pay ratios to be 
greater than 2:1.

As the new regulations were published 
close to the end of 2023, the 
Committee determined that the 2:1 
cap would continue to apply in 
Barclays for the 2023 performance 
year. The Committee will consider this 
further in respect of 2024 and future 
years. 

A relatively small number of our 
employees are potentially impacted 
by this regulatory change. Our 
Executive Directors’ maximum 
variable pay opportunity is governed 
by the Directors' Remuneration Policy 
that shareholders approved at our 
2023 AGM, and therefore is 
unchanged by these new regulations. 
The Directors' Remuneration Policy 
will continue to apply until a new policy 
is approved by shareholders. No new 
Directors' Remuneration Policy is 
proposed for 2024.

Wider workforce remuneration

Our remuneration philosophy

Our Fair Pay Agenda

Our remuneration philosophy applies to all employees and sets out 
the way we approach remuneration. Its aim is to be as simple and 
clear as possible, while ensuring strong alignment with risk and 
conduct as well as our Values and Mindset. It is also closely aligned 
with Provision 40 of the FRC's UK Corporate Governance Code. 
The remuneration decisions set out in this report are a result of the 
application of our remuneration philosophy in respect of 2023.

Paying people fairly is an essential element of our pay philosophy. 
We have developed our fair pay approach over a number of years, 
and we continue to ensure that fairness is a key and explicit 
consideration in the way we make all of our pay decisions.
Our fair pay principles

Fair pay for the lowest paid 
Paying fairly for work done, in a simple and transparent way.

Philosophy

Attract and retain 
talent needed to 
deliver Barclays’ 
strategy

Align pay with 
investor and other 
stakeholder 
interests

Reward sustainable 
performance

Support Barclays’ 
Values and culture

Align with risk 
appetite, risk 
exposure and 
conduct 
expectations

Be fair, transparent  
and as simple  as 
possible

Long-term success depends on the talent of our 
employees. This means attracting and retaining  
an appropriate range of talent to deliver against 
our strategy, and paying the right amount for that 
talent.

Remuneration should be designed with 
appropriate consideration of the views, rights and 
interests of stakeholders. This means listening to 
our shareholders, other investors, regulators, 
government, customers and employees and 
ensuring their views are appropriately 
represented in remuneration decision-making.

Sustainable performance means making a 
positive and enduring difference to investors, 
customers and communities, delivering good 
customer outcomes, taking pride in leaving things 
better than we found them and playing a valuable 
role in society.

Results must be achieved in a manner consistent 
with our Values. Our Values, culture and Mindset 
should drive the way that business is conducted.

Designed to reward employees for achieving 
results in line with the Group’s risk appetite and 
conduct expectations.

We are committed to ensuring pay is fair, simple 
and transparent for all our stakeholders. All 
employees and stakeholders should understand 
how we reward our employees, and fairness 
should be a lens through which we make 
remuneration decisions.

Equal opportunities to progress 
Providing equal employment opportunities to all, so everyone can 
enjoy a successful career at Barclays.

Engaging with colleagues 
Engaging with colleagues to understand their views on the 
culture of the organisation and enabling the representation of 
employees in our remuneration decision-making process.

Alignment of employee and Executive Director pay 
Linking both Executive Director and employee pay to sustainable 
business performance.

Equal pay commitment 
Rewarding employees fairly for their contribution and making 
sure pay and performance decisions never take into account any 
protected characteristics.

Supporting our colleagues

We provided higher salary increase budgets for junior 
employees, including under the UK pay deal with Unite 
In business areas where the incentive spend was reduced, we 
protected incentive outcomes for junior employees
Over 97% of employees globally are eligible for private 
medical cover
We continued to enhance our wellbeing provision, 
including the addition of a new wellbeing training module 
We offer dedicated menopause support through our 
healthcare providers across all our large locations as well as 
training for people leaders

Alignment of remuneration policy for the wider workforce and Executive Directors

Most elements of remuneration policy are aligned for the wider workforce and the Executive Directors. Differences in policy 
implementation between seniority levels reflect our remuneration philosophy. For example, the balance between fixed and variable pay 
is shifted toward fixed pay for employees in more-junior roles and towards variable pay for those in more-senior roles. A large 
proportion of variable pay for senior employees, or the majority of variable pay and half of Fixed Pay for the Executive Directors, is 
delivered in shares over multiple years – aligning their interests more closely with those of shareholders – whereas pay is primarily in 
cash for more-junior employees. Aligned with our Fair Pay Agenda, UK employer pension contributions are also higher for our junior 
employees. 

The table below provides a summary of remuneration arrangements for the wider workforce and the Executive Directors.

Annual bonus

Reflects the individual’s role, skills and experience and is reviewed annually. Fixed pay is 
increased where justified by role change, increased responsibility or a change in the 
market rate for the role. Salaries may also be increased in line with local statutory 
requirements and with union and works council commitments.

All in salary for most, paid in cash. Some 
roles are also entitled to receive certain 
cash allowances.

All in salary for most. For a small number of 
senior employees (2% globally) a 
proportion is delivered in Role Based Pay 
(RBP), in cash or shares, to recognise the 
seniority, scale and complexity of their role. 
The RBP value may change, for example, 
where justified by a role or responsibility 
change or a change in the market rate for 
the role.

Reflects the individual’s role, skills and

Annual increases are typically no more than 
the average increase for UK employees.

50% is delivered in cash (paid monthly), and 
50% in shares. The shares are delivered in 
four equal quarterly instalments and are 
then subject to a holding period, with 
restrictions lifting over five years.

criteria.

Assessed against predetermined targets 
and measures to align with financial 
performance, strategic non-financial 
performance and personal performance. 

Delivery

In cash following the performance year.

Long Term 
Incentive Plan 
(LTIP) award

Not applicable to the wider workforce.

For many a proportion of annual bonus is 
deferred to future years. Deferred 
bonuses are generally delivered half in 
deferred cash and half in deferred shares, 
released in equal annual instalments over 
three, four, five or seven years, with a 
further six or 12-month holding period for 
some roles.

The majority of annual bonus is generally 
deferred in shares and then subject to a 
further 12-month holding period. Across 
the annual bonus and any LTIP award 
combined, deferral will always at least meet 
regulatory requirements.

The value received from LTIP awards 
depends on assessment of performance 
over a three-year period against Group-
wide financial and non-financial measures. 
Delivery is in shares between the third and 
seventh year from grant, with each release 
subject to a further 12-month holding 
period. 

All-employee 
share plans

Provide an opportunity for all employees to acquire Barclays shares, in some locations on beneficial terms. Barclays operates all-
employee share plans in locations representing 99% of employees globally.

Role of the Remuneration Committee in wider workforce remuneration

The Committee considers the overarching objectives, principles and parameters of remuneration policy across the Group, ensuring a 
coherent approach in respect of all employees. In discharging this responsibility the Committee seeks to ensure the policy is fair and 
transparent, avoids complexity, and assesses – among other things – the impact of pay arrangements in supporting the Group’s culture, 
Values and strategy and on all elements of risk management. The Committee performs the following activities in relation to wider 
workforce remuneration: 

– Ensures alignment of remuneration with the remuneration philosophy, Fair Pay Agenda and Barclays' Purpose, Values, Mindset, 

conduct expectations and long-term success 

– Ensures alignment of wider workforce and Executive Director remuneration policies 

– Approves the bonus pool across the wider workforce and reviews wider workforce pay outcomes 

– Reviews the annual Group fixed pay budgets.

Performance management

Performance management plays a key role 
both in supporting colleagues to progress 
their careers and in making Barclays a 
consistently excellent organisation. 

Our performance management approach 
centres on continuous performance 
management principles.

This encourages people leaders to discuss 
performance throughout the year, 

including reviewing progress made against 
‘what’ has been achieved (performance 
versus individual objectives) and ‘how’ it 
has been achieved (behaviours in line with 
our Values and Mindset, in addition to our 
leadership behaviours for senior leaders). 
At year-end, colleagues are assessed 
separately on the ‘what’ and the ‘how' of 
their performance. 

This assessment is reflected in colleague 
performance ratings and bonus outcomes.

For 2023, our aspiration to be a 
consistently excellent organisation was 
reflected in performance management for 
senior colleagues – and will be embedded 
more deeply and widely during 2024.

We seek to consider the views of all of our stakeholders in remuneration decision-making, including colleagues, investors and regulators.  

Colleagues

Investors 

Other stakeholders

We engage with colleagues to understand their 
views through our Your View surveys, union and 
works council engagements, and townhalls. We  
also engage with colleagues through our 
Employee Resource Groups, webcasts, 
workshops and events. 

Our ongoing engagement with the union Unite 
in the UK covers a range of topics, such as fair 
pay and the increasing cost of living, and this is 
another opportunity for the views of colleagues 
to inform decision-making. For information on 
our 2024 pay deal with Unite see 'Salary budget 
for 2024', below.

We publish information to explain to colleagues 
how the Group’s performance and pay 
approach aligns to the Fair Pay Agenda, and to 
help them understand the employee benefits 
Barclays provides – so they can make the most 
of what is on offer. To communicate pay in a 
clear way, each colleague receives a 
Compensation Profile detailing their fixed pay 
and incentives for the previous year and their 
fixed pay for the following year.

We recognise that remuneration is an area of 
particular interest to some shareholders. We 
listen to their views and take these into account 
when setting remuneration or considering 
changes to remuneration policies. Accordingly, 
the Group Chair or Remuneration Committee 
Chair hold meetings each year with major 
shareholders and representative groups to 
understand their views, accompanied by senior 
Barclays employees. In 2023, we discussed our 
remuneration policies and our 2022 pay 
outcomes with representatives of some of our 
institutional shareholders and proxy voting 
agencies.

This kind of engagement helps inform the 
Committee's work and contributes directly to 
the decisions it makes in relation to Executive 
Directors' remuneration. For example, 
shareholder views were a key consideration in 
the Committee's decision to increase the 
weighting of the Climate & sustainability 
category from 10% to 15% for the 2024-2026 
LTIP cycle.

Each year, the Barclays Internal Audit or Chief 
Controls Office teams review our remuneration 
policies and how we've operated our 
remuneration processes, to provide assurance 
to the management team and the Committee 
that we are compliant with regulatory 
requirements. 

Whenever regulations on remuneration are 
changed, we review our remuneration policies 
and practices to ensure they are compliant – 
and make changes if necessary. 

In 2023 we continued to engage with our 
regulators to ensure we understand their 
perspectives, and to explain our performance, 
pay priorities and decision-making. We took 
their views into consideration when making our 
remuneration decisions for 2023, and continue 
to ensure we have ongoing regulatory dialogue 
on remuneration.

Fixed pay decisions for 2024

Living wage employer  

We continue to ensure that we at least 
meet the living wage benchmarks for each 
location, and are an accredited Living 
Wage employer in the UK.
Salary budget for 2024 

We targeted our salary increase budgets 
so there are higher increases for the most 
junior colleagues. In the UK, with the union 
Unite, we have agreed a salary increase 
budget of 5.55% for our junior employees 
and 3.75% for other union-recognised 
employees. For junior employees in India 
and the US salary increase budgets are 8% 
and 3.25% respectively.
The percentage Fixed Pay increases for 
the Executive Directors are below the 
average percentage increases for the 
wider workforce; the Group Chief 
Executive and Group Finance Director will 
each receive a 2.5% increase in Fixed Pay. 

Exceeding the living wage in key locations

We pay at least the living wage in all locations. Below are our minimum hourly rates 
from 1 March 2024 for the UK, USA and India, where 90% of employees are based.

Pay transparency

We have continued to simplify our pay 
approach for junior colleagues, making it 
easier for them to understand how their 
pay is set and managed.

Pay levels and annual salary increases for 
our most junior roles in Barclays UK and 
support functions in the UK are based on 
role type, and starting salaries are published. 

Annual bonus approaches for those 
populations have also been harmonised. 
Previously, bonus outcomes were fully 
discretionary for many of these roles. From 
2023, annual bonus outcomes are a set 
percentage of salary, differentiated by each 
employee's performance rating.
