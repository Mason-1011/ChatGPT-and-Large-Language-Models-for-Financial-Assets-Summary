Letter from the Chairman

Reflecting  
on a year 
of progress

We have delivered progress 
on a number of projects in 2023, 
and we have reasons to look 
forward to a positive outlook 
for the year ahead.

Dear shareholders,

In 2023, we marked our 40th year of operating copper mines. Since 
the start of the Michilla mine in the north of Chile, and through careful 
planning, dedication, a clear vision and investment, we have grown 
to become one of the world’s leading copper producers. As a business 
focused on creating value for our employees, local communities, 
partners and shareholders, we are proud to reflect on the strong 
performance that was delivered in a safe and sustainable manner 
over the course of the year.

2023 highlights

We delivered strong performance in 2023, with record safety 
performance and higher copper production following construction 
of the expansion at Los Pelambres. We have successfully protected 
profit margins during the recent period of high inflation, and we 
have continued to exceed the minimum payout ratio according 
to our dividend policy, proposing a full year dividend equal to 50% 
of underlying net earnings.

Investment is key to maintaining our competitiveness, and we made 
important decisions during the year to further develop our two 
principal mining districts – Los Pelambres and Centinela. Mining 
is a long-term business, and the decisions that we have taken have 
been carefully planned in order to create maximum long-term value 
for all our stakeholders.

We have recently completed construction of an expansion at Los 
Pelambres, which included building a desalination plant to increase 
water availability, as well as additional processing capacity at the mine. 
Also, we have approved the plan to double the capacity of our 
desalination plant and to build a new concentrate pipeline by the end 
of 2027, thereby securing the long-term future of Los Pelambres. 

At Centinela, we approved the Second Concentrator Project, which 
will be another transformational project for the Company, adding 
an additional 170,000 tonnes of copper-equivalent production by 2027.1 

In December, we announced the expansion of our footprint outside 
Chile through an investment in Compañía de Minas Buenaventura 
S.A.A., Peru’s largest publicly traded mining company. This opportunity 
complements our exploration activities in recent years and significantly 
increases our exposure to Peru’s highly prospective geology. We will 
continue to evaluate opportunities to deliver value to all stakeholders.

Antofagasta plc  Annual Report 2023

JEAN-PAUL LUKSIC
Chairman

Positive outlook in global copper markets

The copper price showed increased stability in 2023, with the energy 
transition helping to drive global demand for copper as a critical 
mineral across a broader range of industries. We remain confident 
in copper’s medium- to long-term fundamentals, with global copper 
supply unlikely to be able to sufficiently increase within the required 
timescale to meet this rising demand.

A focus on responsibly produced copper

The environment, climate change and the energy transition all play 
a critical role in our business model. Water availability affects our 
ability to produce copper consistently, which is the underlying reason 
for investing in desalination. 

Having achieved our targeted emissions reduction in 2022, we have 
set ambitious new goals. We are aiming for a 50% reduction in Scope 
1 and 2 emissions by 2035 – all while continuing to expand production. 
The Board has also approved our first Scope 3 emissions reduction target. 
Collaborating with our suppliers in Chile by incentivising improvements 
to their business practices will be key to achieving this target.

With a safe, responsible and sustainable approach to copper 
production, we believe that we are well positioned to help countries 
and regions around the world in their efforts to pivot towards 
electrification and economies based on low-carbon technologies.

Delivering on our strategy

In growing and developing our business, we remain focused on our 
five strategic pillars, which are outlined below. With a clearly defined 
strategy, we are confident that we can deliver on our purpose of 
developing mining for a better future. While we remain committed 
to copper, and we are positive on its long-term outlook, a prudent 
and consistent approach to capital allocation is required to generate 
shareholder returns. 

STRATEGIC REPORTWith our business model, which also focuses on sustainability, 
prioritising strong safety standards, collaboration with local 
communities, and efforts to limit our environmental footprint – 
we aim to deliver value for all stakeholders. This is an integral 
part of our purpose and will help us operate with the support of 
communities, governments and other stakeholders for the duration 
of our long-life assets. 

Safety and sustainability 

Safety is at the heart of our culture, and we are pleased to look back 
on a year of strong safety performance, with another year without 
fatalities and injury frequency rates falling by 25% to 0.63 lost time 
injuries occurring per 1 million hours worked, which is a new record 
for our business. To build a safety-first culture, a clear understanding 
of the risks and how to mitigate them is essential. 

I am particularly proud of the safety performance of the expansion 
project at Los Pelambres, a project that required more than 39 million 
hours of work and several thousand contractors. In addition, we are 
proud of the progress made in our Transport division, where injury 
frequency rates fell by more than half during 2023 following the 
implementation of several safety initiatives.

Sustainability is an integral part of our strategy and is a fundamental 
driver behind demand for critical minerals, which will continue to be 
the case going forward. As a result, it is integrated into our business 
model and capital allocation framework. 

People and culture

We have a workforce of over 29,000 people, spread across our 
four mines, Transport division, corporate offices and projects under 
construction. We couldn’t achieve our goals without an engaged 
and diverse workforce operating in a safe and inclusive environment. 
I am pleased we are continuing to develop and invest in our 
employees, increasing diversity and maintaining high levels of training.

The level of gender diversity across our business is progressing 
towards our goal of 30% by 2025, as our initiatives continue to 
increase female employment at each of our operations. We remain 
committed to diversity because of the benefits that this brings 
to our culture and leadership team.

Competitiveness

Our success depends on being competitive and continuing to maintain 
our margins to deliver strong shareholder returns. Los Pelambres 
is a large, low-cost operation, and the construction of the Centinela 
Second Concentrator will improve Centinela’s competitiveness on the 
global cash cost curve. With these two large low-cost mining districts, 
which allow us to continue to grow into the future with an increased 
share of lower-cost concentrate volume in our portfolio, we are well 
placed to continue to deliver consistently strong financial performance 
and value to all our stakeholders.

Innovation

In order to maintain or grow our output, we will continue to invest 
according to evolving social expectations and environmental standards. 
With the inauguration of our second Integrated Remote Operations 
Centre in 2023 in Santiago for Los Pelambres, following the opening 
of the Centinela facility in Antofagasta in 2021, we have seen 
productivity benefits while offering opportunities for personal 
development in the next generation of roles in mining.

Primary sulphide leaching continues to be a key focus area for the 
industry, with the potential to add new supply at lower capital intensity 
for lower grade ores. We continued to progress our proprietary 
Cuprochlor®-T technology, and we are pleased to report positive 
results in 2023.

Growth

With the investment in the Centinela Second Concentrator Project 
mentioned above, we will add 170,000 tonnes of copper-equivalent 
production to our portfolio. Through this project, the desalination plant 
and fourth concentrator line at Los Pelambres, we continue to develop 
our large resource base towards our target of producing up to 
900,000 tonnes of copper per year in the near future. 

These investments will provide a strong platform for growth in the 
coming years. The mining industry has a limited ability to meet rising 
copper demand from industries such as the energy, infrastructure 
and automotive sectors, among others. As a pure-play copper 
producer, we are well positioned thanks to our high-quality assets, 
track record of performance, and our pipeline of medium to long-term 
growth projects. 

Our capital allocation framework guides all of our decisions. 
The capital needed for the investments planned at Centinela and 
Los Pelambres will see an increase in capital spend, peaking in 2025 
and falling thereafter. 

Board changes 

In 2023, we saw several changes to the Board of Directors and Board 
Committees, which continued to refresh our thinking and bring new 
skill sets and perspectives as we embark on a new phase of growth. 
We have rotated the role of Senior Independent Director, which has 
been taken up by Francisca Castro, a member of our Board since 2016. 
I would like to thank Tony Jensen, who continues to be a valuable 
member of our Board, for his tenure in this role. 

We have also welcomed two new Independent Non-Executive 
Directors. Heather Lawrence joined the Board in April 2023, 
and Tracey Kerr joined the Board in January 2024. Heather is 
qualified as a Chartered Accountant and has strong financial 
experience and Tracey brings extensive global mining experience in 
areas including safety, sustainability, operations and exploration. Both 
Heather and Tracey have London listed company Board experience. 
Following these appointments, female representation at Board level 
increased to 45%. 

I would like to thank Jorge Bande, who retired from the Board at the 
end of 2023 after serving for nine years, the tenure for independence 
recommended by the UK Corporate Governance Code, during which 
time he contributed significantly to the Company’s success.

Chile’s economic, social and political environment 

Over the year, Chile concluded key debates on amendments to Chile’s 
mining royalty tax and a second proposal for a new constitution. 

The new mining royalty has increased the tax burden for mining 
companies operating in Chile at a time when the mining industry 
requires additional capital to tackle declining grades and rising 
ore hardness, making it less attractive for companies to develop 
opportunities in Chile’s mining sector. 

In December 2023, the people of Chile voted against the second 
proposal for a new Constitution. The government has said that 
they will not be seeking a third process to change the Constitution. 
Throughout this process, the population continued to focus on 
key concerns such as public order and safety, economic growth 
and employment. 

We hope that having completed these two processes, Chile will take 
this opportunity to enter an era of common understanding and political 
consensus to achieve higher levels of economic and social prosperity 
that will allow for the advancement of important social reforms, such 
as those relating to pensions, health and education.

Antofagasta has the track record of performance and creating value 
for all our stakeholders. We have two world class mining districts, 
a strong balance sheet and a dedicated workforce, which are all 
key enablers for achieving our purpose of developing mining for 
a better future.

JEAN-PAUL LUKSIC

On the economic front, the International Monetary Fund forecasts 
that Chile’s economy will return to growth in 2024, following a 
contraction in 2023.2 Inflation rates appear to have passed the peak 
seen in 2022 and early 2023, which exceeded 13% for several months, 
putting an excessive strain on both individuals and businesses. This 
outlook is consistent with the broader global trend, with increasing signs 
of economic activity across key markets for copper in 2024. 

Outlook 

As a business, we remain optimistic and realistic about the year ahead. 

Significant investment decisions, such as those at Centinela and Los 
Pelambres, bring with them execution risks that naturally accompany 
construction projects of this scale. While we are confident in the level 
of engineering and the studies that have supported these decisions, 
we are mindful of the challenges in the construction of major mining 
projects in Chile. These challenges include lessons learned from the 
recent expansion at Los Pelambres, where we experienced delays 
to critical path works and cost inflation.  Although this was caused 
in part by external events such as the disruption of global supply 
chains relating to the Covid-19 pandemic and the war in Ukraine, 
there are also local challenges including in relation to productivity.

STRATEGIC REPORTLetter from the Chief Executive Officer

Delivering 
performance 
and growth

Our strong financial performance 
in 2023 demonstrated the 
resilience and strength of our 
portfolio of operations.

Dear shareholders,

At Antofagasta, we are building a strong foundation for growth and 
delivering on our purpose of developing mining for a better future. 

In 2023, we made progress on safety, production and cost control, 
which enabled us to deliver a robust set of financial results. We have 
completed the construction of the first phase of the Los Pelambres 
Expansion Project, a $2 billion investment that will not only provide 
operational stability and increased processing capacity, but will help 
us advance towards our medium-term target of achieving 90% of our 
water use from sea water or recirculated water sources. In addition, 
we recently announced the approval of the Centinela Second 
Concentrator Project, which will move us significantly towards our 
ambition of 900,000 tonnes of profitable copper production and push 
the Centinela District as a whole towards the first quartile of the global 
cost curve. At the peak of construction, this $4.4 billion investment will 
create nearly 13,000 jobs in Chile and will generate significant social 
and economic benefits for the country. 

More information on these two key growth projects can be found 
on pages 15 and 29 of this report.

These landmark projects are significant steps along our path to 
creating value for all our stakeholders – including our workforce, 
local communities and investors – and along with our strong 
operational performance, set the stage for our next phase of growth.

Health and safety 

Most importantly, we registered our strongest performance ever 
in terms of safety; the culmination of many years of developing and 
implementing policies to promote a safety-first mindset across our 
workforce. Over the course of the last ten years, our injury frequency 
rates have consistently decreased, and our performance is now ahead 
of many of our global peers in the wider mining industry. 

People and communities 

It is also vital that we have the right culture and working environment. 
We are confident that our talent management programme, training 
initiatives and diversity and inclusion efforts will ensure that we enter 
our next chapter of growth with the best team to deliver our goals. 
We are also proud to reflect on several three-year labour agreements 
signed during the year. In a number of cases, we reached those 
agreements before the previous contracts expired, underscoring 
our proactive engagement with our workforce.

IVÁN ARRIAGADA
Chief Executive Officer

We continue to expand our diversity initiatives, increasing female 
representation in our workforce to 23.6% (2022: 20.4%), and moving 
us closer to our goal of 30% female representation by 2025. 
Furthermore, gender diversity on our Board of Directors has increased 
to 45% as of February 2024 thanks to new appointments in the past 
12 months, broadening the Board’s skill set at a critical time of growth 
for the business.

By recruiting the right people and building dedicated project teams, 
we are successfully ramping up both our desalination plant and fourth 
concentrator line for Los Pelambres. Looking forward, we are now 
well positioned to begin work on our portfolio of future projects, 
at both Los Pelambres and Centinela.

In our engagement with local communities, we continued to develop 
social programmes that support families living near our operations 
in 2023. In the Central region of Chile, close to Los Pelambres, we are 
focused on water, healthcare and education projects. One programme, 
Somos Choapa, helps to promote effective community engagement, 
while another, Confluye, focuses on responsible water use, as this is 
a key topic after more than 12 years of drought in the area. In the 
north of Chile, our focus continues to be on preserving the traditions 
and cultures of indigenous peoples, while also supporting local schools. 
In 2023, we undertook formal assessments of 18 of our social 
programmes and the results confirmed that all yielded a positive social 
return for our communities. It is important to local stakeholders that 
we support businesses and provide jobs in our local communities. 
We are committed to providing opportunities for local stakeholders, 
and we continue to maintain high levels of employment in the regions 
where we operate, with the majority of our personnel based either 
in the Antofagasta or Coquimbo regions of Chile.

In addition, we were proud to be a lead sponsor of the Pan American 
and Parapan American Games in 2023, which were held in Santiago 
for the first time, helping to promote Chile on a global stage and 
providing the copper that sits in the heart of all the medals.

As part of our broader reporting, during the year we published a series 
of standalone reports on our tax contribution, social value creation and

strategy to address climate change, in addition to the Sustainability 
Report that was published alongside this Annual Report (available 
at www.antofagasta.co.uk).

Tailings management and external accreditation 

Ensuring the stability and safety of our tailings storage facilities 
is crucial. In August 2023, we announced full compliance with the 
Global Industry Standard on Tailings Management (GISTM) at our 
main storage facilities. The process was completed at El Mauro 
(Los Pelambres) and Centinela in 2023, while Los Quillayes (Los 
Pelambres) and Zaldívar are expected to be fully compliant by the 
deadline of August 2025. Antucoya does not have a tailings facility, 
since it is a SX-EW operation, and therefore does not have a 
requirement to comply with the GISTM.

As part of the process associated with The Copper Mark, a framework 
to promote responsible practices at mining operations and across 
value chains, both Antucoya and Los Pelambres received accreditation 
in 2023 for the implementation of their action plans. This accreditation 
lasts until 2025 and reaffirms our approach to producing copper 
in accordance with United Nations Sustainable Development Goals 
(SDGs). All companies in our Mining division hold this certification.

Responsible water use 

In line with our purpose of developing mining for a better future, we 
are focused on ensuring that we have a sustainable business model. 
That means active community engagement, responsible water 
sourcing, ambitious emissions reduction targets and the protection 
of habitats and biodiversity.

The successful completion of our desalination plant in 2023 has 
enabled Los Pelambres to reduce the use of continental water 
sources, which have been impacted through the ongoing drought. 
Group-level water extraction from sea water sources increased in 
2023, with water from our new desalination plant already representing 
a third of Los Pelambres’ water supply, despite only commencing 
its ramp up in the middle of the year. Both Centinela and Antucoya 
in the north of Chile operate on 100% sea water or recirculated water, 
following the closure of the Calama wells in 2022. At Zaldívar, with 
the submission of an Environmental Impact Assessment (EIA) in 2023, 
we plan to convert this operation to sea water (or water from third 
parties), after an extension of the water permit for a transitional period 
between 2025 and 2028, which will allow us to extend the mine life 
of this operation to 2051, with a long-term water solution to replace 
the current extraction of continental water. In early 2024, approval 
was received from the authorities for the separate DIA (Declaration 
of Environmental Impact) to extend the mining permit and, therefore, 
align the water and mining permits at Zaldívar. 

The initiatives mentioned previously, driven by our plan to double 
the capacity of our existing desalination plant at Los Pelambres, 
are helping us move towards our medium-term ambition of achieving  
90% of our water from sea water or recirculated water sources.

Climate change: updated targets set 

We continue to make progress in reducing our Scope 1 and 2 
emissions. Having achieved our previous targets in 2022, we have 
focused on developing updated goals for our decarbonisation 
programme. As a result, we were proud to announce in early 2024 
our updated emissions reduction targets, including a 50% target 
to reduce Scope 1 and 2 emissions by 2035, based on absolute tonnes 
of emissions and taking into account our planned increase in production 
during this time.1 We have also taken the important step of publishing 
our first Scope 3 target, with the goal of achieving a 10% reduction 
in emissions by 2030.2 

1.  This is on a combined basis and refers to a reduction in the absolute number of tonnes 

relative to a baseline year of 2020.

2.  Scope 3 emissions target set on a projected basis relative to a baseline year of 2022.

12

Antofagasta plc  Annual Report 2023

A key part of achieving our Scope 1 and 2 emissions reduction targets 
will be to reduce diesel consumption in our haul trucks, which represents 
approximately 60% of our Scope 1 emissions. To do this, we are 
focused on the continuing search for replacement fuel alternatives, 
in combination with the competitive electrification of our mining 
haulage fleet, which contemplates the potential use of trolley-assist 
technology, with initial pilot tests to be implemented at selected sites. 
Following this, we anticipate supplementing this technology with 
battery electric vehicles, as this particular technology develops over 
time and becomes more widely available and cost effective. In parallel, 
we are implementing a range of modern technologies across our 
portfolio, such as fleet automation at our mines, which will serve 
to further enable electrification and decarbonisation in the future. 
Regarding Scope 3, over 50% of these emissions come from our 
suppliers of goods and services. Through positive engagement with 
our suppliers via our Suppliers for a Better Future Programme, which 
was launched in December 2022, we aim to achieve our goal of 
a 10% reduction in Scope 3 emissions by 2030.

Operating results

We recorded a strong year of operational results in 2023, with our 
Mining division producing 660,600 tonnes of copper, representing a 
2% increase year-on-year. Performance improved at our largest mine, 
Los Pelambres, with ore processing rates increasing by 11% and our 
newly completed desalination plant helping to ensure a greater degree 
of water availability. At Centinela, we registered another year of 
consistent concentrate and cathodes plant performance, with 
production and costs broadly in line year-on-year despite industry-
wide cost inflation. At Antucoya, our continued discipline has helped 
manage costs, with this operation demonstrating effectiveness in 
low-grade copper mining. At Zaldívar, costs increased year-on-year 
in 2023, and the Company is continuing to implement its strategy 
of increasing throughput to ensure that this operation performs 
at its design capacity, with an appropriate cost base.

Our Transport division continued to deliver robust performance, with  
a second successive year of shipments in excess of 7 million tonnes, 
marginally beating the record set in 2022. Amid rising forecasts 
for copper and lithium production from the northern region of Chile 
in the coming years, we have a positive outlook for this segment 
of our business.

Net cash costs in 2023 were $1.61/lb, in line with the prior year, 
as increasing production of copper and by-products helped maintain 
our position on the global cost curve. 

With industry-wide inflation in 2023 and perennial challenges related 
to grade decline and ore hardness, effective cost control is essential 
for modern copper producers to remain competitive. Our cost and 
competitiveness programme drives our efforts to control costs, 
delivering a total of $135 million of savings and productivity 
improvements in 2023. This was substantially above our internal 
target of at least $42 million for the year and in light of this progress, 
our ambition for cost savings in 2024 has increased significantly 
to $200 million.

Financial performance 

Our strong financial performance in 2023 demonstrated the resilience 
and strength of our portfolio of operations. We recorded an 8% 
increase in revenues and a 5% increase EBITDA. Through consistent 
investment throughout the cycle, we have maintained our EBITDA 
margins at 49% in 2023 (2022: 50%).

Following the decision in 2022 to exit from our participation in the 
Reko Diq exploration project, proceeds of $946 million were received 
during the year, in line with expectations. 

Finally in our financial position – through our robust margins and 
conservative balance sheet management, we have maintained our 

STRATEGIC REPORTgoals for the next decade while working closely with suppliers and 
customers to tackle the rising threat of climate change. We are also 
optimistic that we have moved into a more stable environment in Chile.

These decisions mean we are strongly positioned to supply the much 
needed copper that plays an integral role in the world’s transition 
to a low-carbon economy. We endeavour to meet that demand in 
a responsible and sustainable way, ensuring that we create value 
not just for our shareholders, but also for our employees, our 
communities, our partners, and our planet as a whole.

on which to enter the next phase of development.

Growth and innovation

We are at an important juncture as we conclude one phase of 
profitable growth and investment, and prepare for the next one. 
Following completion of the first stage of the expansion at Los 
Pelambres, we can look forward to consistent operating performance 
and higher throughput rates. Furthermore, in late 2023, we received 
approval from the environmental authority to double the desalination 
plant at Los Pelambres (to reach 800 litres per second) and develop 
future critical infrastructure. It includes a new concentrate pipeline 
to  replace the existing one, following a route that runs along a less 
populated route, and reduce the risk of unplanned downtime with 
the existing pipeline which as now been in operations for more than 
20 years. Once this expansion of the desalination plant is complete, 
the Company will approach its target of at least 90% of water use 
coming from either the sea or recirculated water, helping to release 
water previously obtained from continental sources, in line with 
our environmental and social commitments.

At Centinela, we announced approval of the Second Concentrator, 
which will add 170,000 tonnes of copper-equivalent production to 
our portfolio. Through this $4.4 billion investment, we will significantly 
expand our utilisation of modern technologies and output of by-
products – helping the Centinela District move towards the first 
quartile on the industry cost curve.

At our leaching operations, we continue to innovate and work towards 
a solution to leaching primary sulphides. Cuprochlor®-T, our in-house, 
patented technology, delivered positive progress in 2023, a successful 
heap heating pilot was conducted at Zaldívar, enhancing its operational 
readiness. We are now evaluating an expansion of this programme 
to incorporate other mining operations, including third parties.

In 2023, we made progress with the Cachorro exploration project, 
where exploration work has continued in the central and main zones 
of the deposit, with this project having a mineral resource estimate 
of 250 million tonnes with a copper grade of 1.27%. Through 
exploration projects like Cachorro, we are working hard to ensure 
the future availability of new mining resources.

During the year, we also announced agreements to acquire 19% 
of Compañía de Minas Buenaventura S.A.A. (Buenaventura), 
Peru’s largest publicly traded precious and base metals company 
with a pipeline of potential copper projects. This investment is 
consistent with our strategy of prioritising investment in the Americas. 
We look forward to developing this relationship, looking to identify 
opportunities to deliver value for all stakeholders.

On innovation, we continue to implement our digital roadmap, 
increasing the use of artificial intelligence and advanced analytics 
in areas such as the leaching of ore at our SX-EW operations, while 
increasing the efficiency of fleet management at Centinela. We also 
inaugurated our Integrated Remote Operations Centre (IROC) for Los 
Pelambres in 2023, alongside Centinela’s IROC, which opened in 2021, 
we are rolling out additional remote-operated equipment at both 
operations to improve both safety and productivity.

Outlook for 2024 

We believe that the strong performance we have achieved and 
the strategic investments we have made over the past year has put 
the Company on a solid platform for the next phase of growth.

The completion of the first phase of expansion at Los Pelambres and 
the start of construction at the Centinela Second Concentrator project 
are significant milestones. But they are only part of the story. Our 
exploration programme in Chile is advancing as we develop further 
copper resources, and we are building a footprint in Peru. In addition, 
we have updated our emissions reduction targets, setting ambitious

Centinela Second Concentrator

A new phase of growth 

In December 2023, the Company announced 
the approval of the Centinela Second 
Concentrator Project, which will add 170,000 
tonnes of copper-equivalent production, 
comprising 144,000 tonnes of annual 
copper production and associated gold 
and molybdenum by-products.1 Through 
a brownfield expansion of an existing copper 
mine in the Company’s portfolio, it is expected 
that this project will increase Antofagasta’s 
copper production. Through this expansion, 
it is expected that the Centinela District as 
a whole will move towards the first quartile 
on the global cash cost curve for copper 
production, through an increased focus 
on concentrator capacity that incorporates 
modern technologies, increased by-products 
and greater economies of scale. 

The scope of the project is to construct 
a second concentrator to process sulphide 
ores using modern technologies, overseen 
by Centinela’s existing management team, 
which has more than 20 years of handling 
copper ores in the Centinela District. Through 
developing a brownfield project, the Company 
intends to reduce the execution risk typically 
associated with major greenfield construction 
projects, and the project has all the relevant 
permits approved by the authorities in Chile 
for the project to proceed into the 
construction phase.

The Centinela Second Concentrator has 
an associated capital cost of $4.4 billion2, 
and comprises of a number of workstreams 
to mine sufficient ore to supply a new 95,000 
tonne per day concentrator plant, in addition 
to ancillary infrastructure to supply water 
and electricity to the project, as well as port 
handling facilities. In addition, the project 
includes a new tailings storage facility, the 
expansion of outbound logistics networks, 
such as the concentrate transport system 
and additional loading equipment, autonomous 
hauling equipment and a truck shop for the 
mine expansion at Esperanza Sur. Also 
included are camps, and ancillary civil 
infrastructure, which have been designed 
to fully integrate into the existing Centinela 
operation, to avoid any redundancy. 

The project is to be financed by Centinela 
through a combination of direct funding from 
Centinela’s shareholders (Antofagasta plc 
and Marubeni Corporation representing 
approximately 40% of total funding), and 
project finance provided by lenders. 

The timeline for development is three years, 
with first copper production expected 
in 2027. Critical path works commenced 
immediately following announcement, 
with full construction activities commencing 
following the execution of definitive project 
finance documents in Q1 2024. 

Ore for the new concentrator will be sourced 
from two existing open pit mining operations 
– the Esperanza Sur mine, and an expansion 
into higher-grade sulphide ores that lie below 
the Encuentro Oxides ore reserves. 

In parallel to the announcement to construct 
the Centinela Second Concentrator, 
the Company announced a review of the 
opportunity to outsource Centinela’s water 
supply through a third party acquiring the 
existing water supply system and building 
the new water pipeline expansion, and 
an agreement to proceed with this process 
was announced in March 2024.

Further details of the Centinela Second 
Concentrator Project and the process 
to review outsourcing of Centinela’s water 
sourcing are available in the Company’s 
announcement dated 20 December 2023 
(www.antofagasta.co.uk).

The copper market

Copper:  
Essential for electrification

There was greater market stability in copper prices in 2023, with rising demand from 
industries associated with the energy transition. 

Global copper demand in 2023

Global refined copper demand is estimated to have been approximately 
25 million tonnes in 2023, representing a 3% increase year on year. 
China continues to be the main consumer, representing 55% of the 
total with nearly 14 million tonnes.2 To put this in perspective, the 
second largest source of copper demand is Europe, with a 12% market 
share of approximately three million tonnes.3 Another major end-user 
of copper is the United States, which has remained stable at 1.8–1.9 
million tonnes of copper demand for the past five years, according 
to the United States Geological Survey. 

Key factor: China

Given China’s prominence in global copper demand, its economic 
outlook is a key predictor for the overall global balance of supply and 
demand. Data from the International Monetary Fund (IMF) published 
in Q4 2023 indicated an expectation that the Chinese economy grew 
by 5.4% in 2023, slowing to 4.6% in 2024.4 Drivers for this growth 
in 2023 are cited by the IMF as an initial rebound in economic activity 
following the easing of post Covid-19 measures in early 2023, followed 
by a series of broad-based and pro-market structural reforms aimed 
at boosting productivity, which helped to accelerate growth from the 
2–3% seen in 2022.5 However, a key factor for the expected slowing 
of the Chinese economy going into 2024 is the property sector, 
with several large-scale domestic property developers facing financial 
constraints, reduced local demand and distressed balance sheets. 
This continues to be a factor to monitor in 2024, as well as the efforts 
made by the Chinese government to manage this risk and promote 
economic growth. 

As a result of continued economic growth, copper demand in China 
is also expected to increase by a further 2% in 2024.2

While copper prices remained relatively stable in 2023 compared with 
2022, the global market is seeing significant change both in the supply 
of copper and in demand from key industries. Factors such as grade 
decline and rising ore hardness are affecting production from existing 
mines and for various reasons a number of the world’s largest copper 
producers cut guidance during the year. In China, several factors have 
created a market in transition in 2023, including a slower than 
expected post-Covid recovery, with decreased demand from traditional 
sectors such as property, and emerging demand for sectors linked 
to decarbonisation.

Why is copper essential?

Copper is a widely used metal for carrying electricity, due to its high 
conductivity, and is generally the most economical metal for use 
in electrical components. As modern technology is heavily dependent 
on electricity and its associated infrastructure, copper is essential 
for modern living and in particular for the ongoing energy transition 
to low-carbon economies. Copper also benefits from being a metal 
resistant to corrosion and with high malleability, meaning it can 
be crafted into a range of forms for manufacturing different types 
of products, such as wires, rods, tubes and bars. Thanks to these 
properties, copper is used in a broad range of industries, including 
construction, infrastructure, transport and consumer goods.

Global copper consumption fits into three main categories: wire, 
other forms – such as tubes, rods and plates – and alloys. Of the 
industries that use copper, 40% of consumption is for electrical 
purposes in construction, infrastructure and industry, followed 
by 23% of consumption in the manufacturing of white goods and 
other appliances.1

Given the wide range of industries using copper, it has traditionally 
been seen as a barometer of health for the global economy: when 
global economic activity grows, manufacturing output tends to increase 
and demand for key inputs (such as copper) rises. The copper price 
has long been a leading economic indicator, preceding lagging 
indicators, such as employment and inflation data. The copper price is 
influenced by other factors, including the global mine supply of primary 
copper, the recycling rates of scrap copper, and artificial impacts such 
as trade tariffs. In recent years, demand shifting towards sectors 
associated with the energy transition has bolstered the copper price, 
lowering the correlation with phases of economic growth.

STRATEGIC REPORTCopper cathodes awaiting shipment.

Key factor: Decarbonisation and emerging technologies

Global copper supply in 2023

The energy transition and other technological advances continue 
to spur changes in copper demand in both China and the rest of the 
world. Examples of emerging technologies that are heavily dependent 
on copper are battery electric vehicles (BEVs), which can require two 
to three times as much copper as a typical combustion engine vehicle.1 
Copper is also key to renewable power generation, with solar power 
units using copper in thermal heat exchange units and electrical wiring, 
with a requirement of approximately 5.5 tonnes per megawatt 
generated. Offshore wind installations are even more copper intensive 
due to lengthy cabling requirements, needing approximately 9.5 tonnes 
per megawatt generated.2 

As government legislation encourages decarbonisation, BEVs are 
forecast to represent more than half of global car sales by 2040, an 
industry of more than 100 million units a year. The volume of copper 
required by the automotive industry is expected to rise by 143% 
between 2020 and 2040, growing to six million tonnes of annual 
copper consumption.3

Historically, the property sector has been the major consumer of 
copper in China. However, demand slowed in 2023 for the reasons 
stated previously. Rising investment during 2023 in China’s grid and 
decarbonisation in the automotive sector (with emissions controls in 
major cities, and government incentives promoting sales of BEVs), 
resulted in robust growth for sales of electric vehicles during the year, 
helping to bolster overall demand for copper and keep prices relatively 
stable during the year. 

With governments increasing efforts to decarbonise economies through 
legislation and emerging technologies, it is expected that overall copper 
demand will grow, and across a broader range of sectors than before. 
The dominance of China is a continuing risk to the copper market, 
particularly if its market share increases in the coming years. 
Additional risk factors relating to higher prices are the threat of 
substitution, further technological innovation and falling demand, all 
factors that may limit the potential for demand growth in the medium 
to long term. Research suggests that substitution and miniaturisation 
of copper components has remained stationary at approximately 
400–500kt per annum for the past ten years, and this may moderate 
future copper demand growth and mitigate against substantially higher 
prices in the long-term7. 

Scrap recycling rates are a further factor in respect of the copper 
supply-demand balance, as discussed in the following section. 

The production of copper is not straightforward. Key considerations 
in producing primary copper (mined copper in the form of concentrates 
or cathodes) include the following: the permitting process for new 
and existing mines, capital requirements and other barriers for entry, 
grade decline and rising ore hardness once operational, risks relating 
to ongoing support from local stakeholders, and closure considerations. 

Primary copper supply represents approximately 22 million tonnes per 
annum,4 around 84% of total global refined copper.5 The balance 
comes from secondary copper (recycling and reclaimed copper).

Mine supply (primary copper)

According to the United States Geological Survey, Chile, Peru and the 
Democratic Republic of the Congo (DRC) represented a combined total 
of 46% of the 22 million tonnes of global mined copper supply in 2023, 
with a further 35–40% coming from the next ten countries, including 
Australia, the United States, China, Indonesia and Russia. With such 
a large proportion of primary copper supply concentrated in three 
countries, it is important to understand the trends emerging in these 
three jurisdictions, as well as in other emerging copper supply regions 
and countries.

Chile remains the main global producer, consistently producing 
between five and six million tonnes of primary copper for the past 
20 years, with concentrates representing 74% of the 5.3 million 
tonnes produced in 2023.6 While Chile is home to six of the world's 
top 20 mines by capacity, more than any other country, these mines 
all commenced operations more than 20 years ago and are mature 
assets facing issues such as grade decline and increasing ore hardness.

The copper market continued

In other jurisdictions, Peru has a number of large-scale copper mines, 
and contributed 2.6 million tonnes of copper supply in 2023. While 
Peru's copper supply remained largely flat between 2016 and 2022, 
it has shown increasing output in 2023 following the recent construction 
of a large-scale mining project and the country as a whole has 
a high degree of prospectivity for copper-bearing deposits, with the 
third-highest estimated ore reserves in the world behind Chile and 
Australia. The DRC contains an emerging district for large-scale copper 
production, with several new mines entering production in recent 
years and doubling mined copper output in the five years to 2023.1

Recycling (secondary copper)

The advantage of copper is that it can be recycled without loss 
of quality, therefore secondary copper is an important resource, 
representing a major component of global supply. Unlike those of steel, 
copper’s qualities do not degrade over time, and with the increasing 
lifespan of copper components, the re-use of copper can take decades 
to occur, tying up more copper in global in-use inventories. While recycling 
rates are expected to increase, with designs beginning to incorporate 
circular economy principles, it is expected that primary copper supply 
will continue to meet the majority of long-term global demand.

Smelting and refining

Copper smelting converts copper concentrates to metal. China 
operates approximately 50% of the world’s smelting capacity, with 
recent investments expected to increase this figure. The refining 
process produces high grade copper cathodes. Treatment charges 
and refining charges (TC/RCs) represent the costs associated with 
producing refined copper from concentrates, and fluctuations in TC/
RCs are often viewed as a proxy for the global trade balance of copper 
concentrates. Globally reported TC/RCs fell in the second half of 2023 
following a tightening of the global copper concentrate supply, and 
rising smelter capacity in China is expected to put further downward 
pressure on TC/RC pricing in the coming years.

Consensus pricing estimates 

Based on 21 contributing banks, the consensus estimates for copper 
pricing in 2024 and 2025 are $3.90/lb and $4.00/lb.2 In comparison, 
the current spot price of copper was $3.84/lb as of December 2023.3

STRATEGIC REPORTThe year in review

Copper 

Following market tightness in early 2023, when copper prices rose by 12% in 
January to a peak of $4.23 per pound, prices gradually trended down to $3.80/lb 
as of the end of the year. This downwards trend was largely seen in H1 2023.  
A degree of stability was seen in H2 2023, with more than 50% of the daily prices 
seen in H2 2023 sitting between $3.60/lb and $3.80/lb. Over the course of the 
year, the average market copper price was 4% lower year-on-year at $3.85/lb, 
with a minimum price of $3.55/lb (2022 minimum: $3.25/lb) and a maximum price 
of $4.23/lb (2022 maximum: $4.85/lb).

Prices in 2023 reflected a significantly lower level of volatility than in 2022. While 
macro-economic factors saw a decline in global demand during 2023, supply-side 
disruption and guidance cuts have helped to balance the market. 

Copper prices in 2024 will depend on a range of factors, including growth rates  
in the Chinese economy, in particular the continued stabilisation of the property 
sector, as well as the outlook for recently disrupted mine supply and global 
copper inventories.

Average copper market price (2023)

$3.85/lb

(2022: $4.00/lb)

Gold 

The average gold price rose by 8% to $1,942/oz in 2023, reflecting persistently 
high global inflation and geopolitical instability. Prices in early April recorded 
all-time highs, reaching a maximum of $2,050/oz, reflecting concerns at the time 
relating to bond market volatility and instability in the banking and tech sectors. 
Since April, gold prices have largely remained between $1,900/oz and $2,000/oz, 
briefly declining below $1,900/oz during late Q3 and early Q4 as a result of rising 
bond yields and a strengthening dollar, before the outbreak of the conflict in the 
Middle East pushed prices back up during Q4.

Average gold market price (2023)

$1,942/oz

(2022: $1,800/oz)

Molybdenum 

Molybdenum prices started the year at approximately $30/lb, rising to exceed 
$38/lb during Q1, the highest level seen since 2005. Prices subsequently retreated 
to $17/lb by mid-April and have remained between $15 and $25/lb since April. 
The market volatility and record pricing seen in early 2023 is attributable to 
a market that has been in deficit since 2022, with low existing stockpiles, resulting 
in relatively small transactions having a strong effect on global pricing. A delay 
to additional production from new projects in Chile in 2023, in addition to delays 
in Chinese supply, helped to contribute to the spike in pricing seen in early 2023.

Whilst these factors stabilised in the second half of the year, with more consistent 
pricing, it is expected that the overall market for molybdenum will remain constrained, 
which is expected to provide pricing support going forward.

Description

Description

Description

We aim to create value and growth 
throughout the mining lifecycle, from 
exploration to mine closure. Our goal is to be 
a Company known for its ethical and 
transparent conduct, respectful of human 
rights and the law. To achieve this, we are 
determined to continue to develop a 
comprehensive and long-term commitment to 
all our stakeholders, particularly our 
communities and workers.

We align ourselves with the UN Sustainable 
Development Goals (SDG), developing 
responsible mining practices that are certified 
by the Copper Mark and ICMM’s Performance 
Expectations. We prioritise the efficient use of 
renewable natural resources and the 
reduction of our greenhouse gas (GHG) 
emissions by using sea water and energy 
from cleaner sources.

All of this is done while ensuring the 
occupational health and safety of all our 
employees and contractors. We do this 
through the active leadership of our workers, 
who by their responsible behaviour and 
proactive management of risks and critical 
controls ensure a safe and healthy working 
environment for all.

Our goal is to create and nurture a working 
environment that incorporates new ways of 
thinking, with innovation at the forefront, to 
tackle current and future challenges. We 
strive to inspire people to tackle more 
complex and dynamic problems, and to 
develop new management approaches to 
solve them. The demands of today’s and 
tomorrow’s adaptive challenges require us to 
collaborate and excel while developing new 
skills.

We aim to truly understand what our people 
value, to treat them fairly, and to engage and 
inspire them based on their personal 
motivations and unique qualities as individuals. 
This is a challenge that requires us to change 
the understanding of the traditional 
employment relationship with the Company.

We will continue to drive forward our cultural 
transformation, promoting the organisation as 
a safe and supportive space that actively 
listens, empathises, connects and builds 
strong relationships with our people.

Competitiveness is essential as it ensures 
resilience and makes the business viable. 
By producing copper efficiently we are able to 
grow and contribute to the development of 
mining while promoting the energy transition.

We aim to maintain our strong financial 
position through efficient capital allocation, 
the proper execution of our projects and the 
renewal of our asset portfolio, allowing us 
to continue operating and growing as we 
address increasingly complex challenges.

We strive to be one of the most cost-
competitive companies in the industry, and 
towards that end, we are dedicated to 
achieving excellence in our work and seeking 
new and efficient ways to manage our 
operations.

Additionally, we are undergoing a process of 
operational transformation that allows us to 
integrate technology and innovation, utilise 
data analytics and promote efficient resource 
management by strengthening key operational 
processes that will enable us to achieve the 
full potential of our assets’ performance.

Growth to continue contributing 
to the development of a better future.

Description

Description

We aim to create new ways of operating and 
using existing technology more effectively, 
incorporating our own and others’ learning 
to improve performance. 

Growth enables us to maintain our viability 
and fulfil our purpose. It allows us to realise 
the full potential of our resources and assets, 
creating additional value and diversifying risk.

We further aim to discover new ways of 
advancing our operations through the early 
adoption of modern technology. With our 
experience we are convinced that we can 
contribute to the development of new 
solutions, such as Cuprochlor®-T, integrated 
remote operations centres (IROCs), 
autonomous haulage and drilling, advanced 
analytics and data management for decision-
making, robotics for tailings and water 
management, decarbonisation of our 
processes and dust suppression.

Our Innovation Roadmap serves as a guide 
for the Group to achieve our operational 
vision for the future. This allows our 
operations to become smart, integrated and 
sustainable, optimising the use of strategic 
resources such as water and energy.

To accomplish this, we aim to:

•  Expand and increase the Group’s 

production capabilities by building projects 
such as Los Pelambres Expansion Phase 1 
and the Centinela Second Concentrator 
project.
Increase our mineral resource base 
through the exploration for new resources 
and/or the development of new ore 
deposits.

• 

Our strategy for growth beyond our existing 
operations is focused on producing copper 
and its by-products in the Americas 
(particularly Chile, Peru, the United States and 
Canada), a region that is highly attractive due 
to its geological potential, mining activity, 
relative proximity to our existing portfolio of 
operating assets, political and administrative 
similarities, culture and language.

Copper is our main product and largest 
source of revenue.

This is a key indicator of operating 
efficiency and profitability.

Our mineral resource base supports our 
strong organic growth pipeline.

Copper production increased by 2% to 
660,600 tonnes, with an increasing 
contribution from Los Pelambres, as the 
Phase 1 Expansion Project ramps up.

Net cash costs for 2023 were $1.61/lb, in line 
with 2022 and ahead of guidance for the 
year, reflecting a balance of higher underlying 
cash costs before by-products, alongside 
higher production and pricing for by-products.

Total mineral resources increased by 345 
million tonnes during the year, following work 
at Los Pelambres.

SECURING THE FUTURE OF LOS PELAMBRES

Operator at the Los Pelambres desalination plant, 
located on the Pacific Coast at Los Vilos.

The positive impacts 
are already being 
seen through the 
completion of 
construction of the 
desalination plant 
mid-year, increasing 
ore processing rates 
and helping to reduce 
our reliance on 
continental sources of 
water. We will see 
further benefits in 
2024 as the fourth 
concentrator line adds 
additional capacity.

Antofagasta plc  Annual Report 2023

STRATEGIC REPORTLos Pelambres Phase 1: 
Construction completed

Desalination plant: An investment in 
sustainable copper production

to maintain the progress made in reducing 
the Company’s carbon footprint. 

Fourth concentrator line: Developing 
processing capacity

In 2023, the Company completed construction 
of its first desalination plant for the supply of 
water to Los Pelambres in the Central Region 
of Chile. Representing a major investment in 
the future of Los Pelambres, and reinforcing 
our commitment to Chile, the desalination 
plant will help to reduce continental water 
consumption in a region that has experienced 
a severe shortage of rainfall for more than a 
decade. This positive impact has already 
begun, with Los Pelambres able to increase 
ore throughput rates by 11% in 2023 as a 
result of increased water availability. In 2023, 
the desalination plant contributed 
approximately a third of this operation’s total 
water withdrawals during the year, despite 
only commencing its commissioning and ramp 
up in the middle of the year.

The desalination plant sources water from 
the Pacific Ocean and producing desalinated 
water through a dedicated facility. A series 
of pumps then transfer water from the coast 
to the location of the mine, for a continuous 
supply of water. As is the case with all of 
the Company’s operations within its Mining 
division, the desalination plant is contracted 
to operate with renewable power, helping 

Mechanical construction of the desalination 
plant was completed in Q2 2023, with the 
plant approaching a successful completion 
of its ramp up to design capacity as of the end 
of the year. Water availability is an important 
consideration in the local communities where 
Los Pelambres is located, with many farms 
operating in the same low-rainfall conditions 
that the Company has experienced for many 
years. Through the newly completed 
desalination plant and a reduced reliance by 
Los Pelambres on continental water sources, 
it is expected that water availability will 
improve as a result, benefiting a wide range 
of local stakeholders. 

Following construction of the first phase of 
the desalination plant, approval has already 
been granted for an expansion of this facility 
to 800 litres per second, which would largely 
cover the current water requirement for 
Los Pelambres. Following completion of this 
project, construction of which is envisaged to 
take approximately three years, the Company 
aims to achieve its target of increasing water 
use from sea water or recirculated sources 
to more than 90%.

The fourth concentrator line at the Los 
Pelambres processing plant increases the ore 
processing capacity to 190,000 tonnes per 
day, which will serve to mitigate the effects of 
ore hardness as mining operations progress 
towards lower sections of the orebody. The 
geology of porphyry copper deposits typically 
exhibits increasing ore hardness with depth, 
as the ores being mined are further from the 
surface and less exposed to weathering and 
faulting that might weaken the rock over time. 

Through an investment to increase the ore 
processing capacity of Los Pelambres, the 
Company is able to mitigate this impact and 
maintain production levels in line with 
historical levels of output. This brownfield 
expansion utilises existing knowledge and 
understanding of the orebody characteristics 
to help reduce project execution risk. 

Over time, a further expansion of processing 
capacity to 205,000 tonnes per day is 
envisaged to secure the long-term future of 
Los Pelambres, which has sufficient 
resources to maintain production for many 
years to come.

The Company’s management team reports to the Sustainability  
and Stakeholder Management Committee every time it convenes 
(six or more times a year), and as required by the Audit and Risk 
Committee, with a minimum of two meetings a year. 

Risk management
Risks associated with sustainability – which, with health and safety,  
is one of our five strategic pillars – are monitored to identify degrees 
of uncertainty and allow us to adopt measures in a timely fashion. 
Growing levels of risk, particularly in relation to climate change, 
impose new challenges that require an integrated approach. In 2023, 
we updated our sustainability and safety risks matrix, incorporating 
relevant changes according to the new challenges.

At Antofagasta, we conduct rigorous evaluations of the possible risks

STRATEGIC IMPORTANCE FOR THE GROUP

As an essential part of our sustainability targets and policy, we conduct 
a materiality assessment every two years to identify and prioritise 
relevant topics that might have an impact on our strategy and 
stakeholders. Based on this analysis, we also define risks to our 
strategic business planning and practices for the new term. In 2024, 
we will conduct a double materiality assessment, reporting not only 
on sustainability issues that are material to the Company’s financial 
performance, but also on those that impact the wider world.

Following the application of a four-stage methodology in 2022, 
we identified 28 material topics, four of which were new to our matrix. 

These four topics are industrial protection, wellbeing, cyber security, 
and soil remediation (Transport division). Material topics were 
organised according to their potential impact on Antofagasta’s strategic 
topics and issues relating to our stakeholders. 

Six topics were of the highest importance for both Antofagasta’s 
strategy and the stakeholders: corporate governance; new regulations, 
regulatory uncertainty and permits; transparency, communications  
and trust; health and safety culture; dialogue and engagement with 
community and indigenous peoples; and social contribution and 
skills development.

Our approach to sustainability continued

Our 2023 analysis required inputs from internal and external stakeholders and was conducted in four stages.

Identifying actual and 
potential material topics

We used the information 
obtained to define a 
preliminary list of relevant 
topics and the actual 
and potential impacts 
of each topic.

Diagnosing the 
organisation’s context

We carried out a 
comprehensive review 
of internal and external 
information and conducted 
interviews with senior 
management and external 
experts regarding existing, 
new and emerging 
sustainability topics for 
the copper mining industry, 
both in Chile and abroad.

Assessing the significance 
of the impacts

Prioritising and defining 
material topics

We evaluated the qualitative 
and quantitative impacts 
of each topic based on the 
severity and likelihood of 
actual and potential impacts. 
The severity assessment 
was based on the scale, 
scope and remediable 
nature of the impacts.

Within the framework 
of the European Financial 
Reporting Advisory Group’s 
scales, we defined each 
topic’s materiality level. 
The most significant impacts 
were grouped into material 
topics under the economic, 
governance, environmental 
and social categories. 
Antofagasta’s sustainability 
performance team reviewed 
each topic.

STRATEGIC REPORTPrioritisation of Sustainable 
Development Goals

The United Nations Sustainable Development Goals (SDGs) are at the core of our sustainability 
policy. We seek to create long-term value for our stakeholders, and are therefore committed 
to achieving targets and operating programmes that contribute to the sustainable goals in 
our regions of operation.

Approved in 2015, the 2030 UN Agenda consists of 17 SDGs covering 
a range of interrelated aspects and seeks to support the development 
of a sustainable society in areas such as economic growth, social 
inclusion and environmental protection. At Antofagasta, we have been 
working on these targets since 2018 as part of our strategic vision.

In 2023, we identified 13 SDGs to which our Company makes 
a relevant contribution. We also assessed the scope and applicability 
of each SDG from a strategic perspective and in terms of our level 
of influence regarding capacity and resources.

How we engage with our stakeholders

Our approach to sustainability

Sustainability is one of the five strategic pillars that support our purpose. We aim to manage 
all aspects of sustainability through a holistic approach aligned with our strategy and with 
a permanent dialogue with our stakeholders, to analyse, define and manage priorities in the 
short, medium and long term.

In 2023, we hosted strategic communications initiatives and meetings with executives, employees and communities, in order to share relevant 
information and future projects with our stakeholders, and to listen to their concerns. We keep our stakeholders informed through regular reports 
on our operational, sustainable and financial performance (which are available on our website, www.antofagasta.co.uk).

As part of our approach, we are continually working to develop strong, long-term relationships with stakeholders, through mechanisms that 
foster proximity and constant dialogue with each of the six main stakeholders involved in what we do. This relationship requires a comprehensive 
approach in which we integrate the vision of the different corporate areas.

Likewise, we address issues that are material to our organisation, such as climate change, responsible production, the protection of biodiversity, 
and the development of a culture of occupational safety, among others.

Our people

Our people are the essence of our 
achievements and the key to a 
sustainable business. We promote 
diversity and, in particular, the 
participation of women throughout 
our Company. We strive to create 
a working environment aligned with 
our organisational purpose, fostering 
wellbeing, skills development and 
talent retention.

In 2023, we focused on mapping the profile of our personnel 
in terms of their interests, work purpose, understanding and 
needs, in order to design new policies and programmes 
accordingly. This is a continuation of the plan we defined in 
2022 for Organisational Effectiveness Management and is 
aligned with decisions made by the Board to strengthen our 
pillars and drive towards cultural change. The People and 
Organisation managers at all our companies are deploying 
our initiatives to evaluate and measure indicators accordingly.

In order to solicit the opinions of our personnel, we promote 
their participation in engagement surveys, psychosocial risk 
surveys and opinion surveys on activities in which they have 
participated. This allows us to collect feedback, review our 
communication tools, and revise and update our programmes 
to maintain an appropriate and effective level of workforce 
engagement. 

The following are the supporting pillars of our

Wellbeing: our priority
Workplace wellbeing is one of our priorities. Beyond the salaries paid, 
we safeguard the physical, emotional, financial and social wellbeing 
of our workforce through an array of initiatives. Our goal is to maintain 
a healthy working environment that explicitly recognises the value of 
work, generating a positive impact on families and their social 
wellbeing.

In 2023, we maintained a hybrid system of remote and in-person 
working, designed in accordance with the Company’s operational 
needs. We kept in force our Work-Life Balance Guidelines, which 
are tailored to each mining site and designed to improve the division 
of employees’ time between work, family and recreational activities.

In addition to these benefits, we operate a remote support channel 
focused on the comprehensive wellbeing of personnel, offering a 24/7 
telemedicine programme, health guidance, medical advice for parents 

of newborns, clinical guidance on sleep disorders, emotional support, 
nutritional guidance, sports advice and a veterinary programme.

The Invest in Yourself (Invierte en ti) programme at Antucoya has 
benefitted more than 500 people, including employees, contractors 
and subcontractors, and is aimed at improving quality of life through 
healthy eating, exercise, and balanced living both inside and outside 
work. Additionally, we provide legal consultancy in matters relating 
to family, inheritance, contracts and municipal permits, while the 
benefits programme offers significant discounts on banking services. 

7,753

employees (as at 31.12.2023), 
comprising of 1,827 women and 5,926 men.

How we engage with our stakeholders / Social continued

In 2023, we prioritised initiatives to boost our female talent retention, 
including the women maintenance apprentices programme to train 
young mining maintenance operatives, and specific programmes to 
strengthen the skills of female supervisors. 

People with disabilities

In 2023, people with disabilities accounted for 1.4% of our employees 
(2022: 1.3%) – above the minimum figure of 1% required by Chile’s 
Workplace Inclusion Law.

Prioritising training and internal mobility
In 2023, we reorganised our learning and development structure 
with the aim of strengthening our leadership, diversity and inclusion, 
maintenance, and data decision-making academies.

124

We offer a formal Career Development process to boost our operator’s 
training, focusing on the technical, behavioural, management and other 
skills required for their current roles, and with future development in 
mind. The process varies according to the requirements of each position. 

Operators progress by achieving accreditation for the minimum skills 
required to perform their job function adequately and in alignment with 
the needs of the business and the qualification framework established 
by the Consejo de Competencias Mineras (CCM) or Mining Skills 
Council. The Competence Accreditation process is a periodic 
assessment during which the operator is evaluated and accredited 
at a development level relevant for their role. This tool supports 
internal mobility.

At Antofagasta, we always seek to develop our internal talent.  
Through the various stages of our Apprenticeship Programme, 
we aim to develop skills for people with limited industry experience. 
This guarantees operational continuity and encourages internal 
mobility, ensuring that future vacancies are filled swiftly and effectively.

Collective bargain agreements and labour 
relations
At Antofagasta, we promote a relationship with the Company’s unions 
based on constant dialogue and mutual trust. We recognise and 
respect the unionisation and collective bargaining rights of our direct 
employees and contractors.

In 2023, we agreed 13 additional three-year collective contracts, 
negotiated in a respectful environment and without disruptions. 
Agreements were reached with the Centinela’s workers and 
supervisors unions, workers’ unions at Zaldívar and Los Pelambres, 
and a number of unions within the Transport division. 

For further information on labour practices, please refer to our 
Sustainability Databook for 2023, which is available on our website 
(www.antofagasta.co.uk).

Our programmes

•  Women’s mentoring
•  Training supervisors and Shift leaders: both involve attracting, 
training and mentoring women until they are fully installed 
in their role

•  Respectful environment workshops deployed in all companies 

(1,500+ participants)

We operate long-term partnerships with universities that are strong 
on science, technology, engineering and mathematics (STEM), 
in order to increase female participation through our scholarship 
programmes. In addition, we attract women from local communities 
through our apprentices programmes and encourage them to obtain 
technical qualifications. In most cases, this training leads 
to a permanent position.

In 2023, our Transport division (FCAB) achieved the greatest 
increase in the number of female employees within the Group, 
with women accounting for 17% of maintenance operatives, and 
38% of executives.

FCAB’s efforts to boost female inclusion in the sector saw them 
awarded third place in the transportation category in the IMAD – 
Women in Senior Management 2023 ranking. In addition, the General 
Manager of FCAB, Katharina Jenny, received the Women in Mining 
(WIM) Inspiring Women 2023 award for her achievements and 
leadership. Furthermore, the Company was recognised by WIM as 
a leading company in gender parity, and the third Women Railway 
Apprentices programme was launched to incorporate more women 
into operational roles and maintenance of wagons, locomotives, track, 
and water resources.

As part of our D&I strategy, a total of 75 women, including executives, 
supervisors and operators, continued to participate in professional 
development initiatives and in our Female Leadership Programme 
during 2023. This programme focuses on management enhancement, 
communication, and empowerment to promote effective female 
leadership and improve team performance.

Case study

Relevos Mining Shift programme

The Relevos Programme gives the women of the town of 
María Elena in the Antofagasta Region and the Choapa Valley 
the chance to work part-time and return home daily, enabling 
them to balance work and family life. This initiative, set up in 
conjunction with the Municipality of María Elena, does not 
require previous mining experience, reinforcing our 
commitment to employability and improving the quality of life 
of people in neighbouring communities.

Our 
occupational 
health 
and safety 
culture

Safe production based on a sustainable 
internal culture is our main asset.  
We have been making steady progress 
in spreading this approach at our 
Company’s grassroots level, supported 
by trust, planning and the principles of 
roles and responsibilities. As one of our 
five strategic pillars, health and safety 
is at the centre of our daily activities.

Case study

Innovation supports our safety 
– an example from Antucoya

With the acquisition of exoskeletons, technology 
and innovation are helping our personnel to mitigate 
potential musculoskeletal injuries. The equipment, 
made of carbon fibre, provides support to staff in 
the Haul Truck Maintenance area, when loading, 
and in tasks associated with the upper body. 

The units are harness-like structures fitted to people’s 
backs, arms, waist, hips and legs. Exoskeletons support 
personnel as they handle heavy loads and reduce their 
exposure to possible musculoskeletal disorders of the 
upper extremities.

The test plan operates with the support of the 
Company’s Innovation and Occupational Health and 
Safety teams.

STRATEGIC REPORTThe four pillars of our Occupational Health and Safety Strategy
At Antofagasta, we strive to be a leader in occupational health and safety, where our own employees and collaborators promote and maintain 
a safe and healthy working environment. Robust health and safety management provides the foundations for our activities, and we are committed 
to continuous improvement through risk control and performance monitoring.

In 2023, we advanced the consolidation of our management system by incorporating occupational health and safety planning into our operational 
model, with the aim of ensuring the implementation of controls to prevent unwanted events. This framework is applicable to 100% of operations 
and to both our internal workforce and contractors.

Reporting, investigating 
and learning from our 
accidents

To prevent the repetition of 
unwanted health and safety 
events, the “Learning from 
Accidents” tool promotes 
collective learning from 
accident investigations and 
preventive implementation 
of crosscutting corrective 
actions. In 2023, we 
updated the parameters 
for the reportability of 
health events. 

Leadership

The "Visible Leadership" 
initiative has continued, 
where the Executive 
Committee visits the 
different sites to observe 
the health and safety 
performance of its workers 
and contractors.

During 2023, three activities 
were carried out and more 
than 20 Antofagasta 
Minerals executives 
participated.

Contractor management

Our health and safety 
performance data includes 
contractors and 
subcontractors, who must 
all comply fully with our 
standards and procedures. 
In 2023, we implemented 
a digital platform to evaluate 
compliance on the part of 
our Special Regulations for 
Contractor Companies and 
Subcontractors (RECSS).

Occupational health and 
safety risk management

There are four interrelated 
layers:

a. baseline definition 
(WRAC): identifies, 
analyses and evaluates 
occupational health 
and safety risks 

b. control strategy: 

evaluates high- and 
critical-risk activities 
using the BowTie 
analysis tool

c. Planned Task Risk 

Assessment (PTRA): 
assesses tasks involved 
in high- and critical-risk 
activities.

d. “I say No”: a slogan 

that promotes refusal  
to execute a task based 
on the PTRA.

Occupational health and safety: Our action plan
In 2023, we continued with our five-year working plan, which was launched in 2022 and focused on boosting a health and safety supervisory 
leadership programme. We prioritised planning and effective supervision by standardising high-risk task working practices using our Planned 
Task Risk Assessment tool (levels 3 and 4), integrating them into our Operating Model and ultimately making them part of our operational 
excellence management system.

We intend to combine planning-based production and safety according to deadlines and allocated resources. Planning is becoming a key part 
of this framework, and we are integrating health and safety into our operational excellence. 

The objective is to standardise working practices at all our mining sites. Minera Antucoya in Antofagasta has become a leading example of 
implementing this process through the health and safety supervisory leadership programme. Antucoya’s high levels of production in 2023 are 
the result of appropriate and timely risk management based on planning and empowered supervision. This achievement promotes safer jobs 
and operational stability, enabling sustained improvement in all dimensions of our mining business.

In addition, we designed a four-tool culture transformation programme to enhance supervisor skills: 

•  Planned task risk assessment incorporated into the operating model.
•  Working shift change to ensure effective transfer of information.
•  Role confirmation to shape expected practices or behaviours.
•  Process confirmation to identify opportunities for improvement in key areas of occupational health and safety, and to ensure the closure 

of the task execution process.

In addition, we made significant progress with occupational health risk management processes, isolating or eliminating exposure of our personnel 
to occupational health risks in 2023. Each operation presented and implemented a project that contributed to a reduction in the exposure of 
personnel to health risks.

Antofagasta plc  Annual Report 2023

STRATEGIC REPORTHealth and safety training
We have developed training courses on occupational health and safety 
for our employees, contractors and subcontractors, covering potential 
risks associated with particular working environments or the execution 
of certain tasks, and other issues. As part of the training cycle, we 
identify the needs of supervisors and executives through the DNA 
process (Learning Needs Detection).

Alignment and definition of the training plan is carried out by the 
appropriate area in conjunction with the organisation’s various 
management bodies, based on legal and regulatory requirements,  
and on local challenges in occupational health and safety issues.

In parallel with this model, we provided our employees with in-person 
training in control strategies, drawing on knowledge available for all 
companies, including our collaborating entities. Other topics that we 
have taught both in-person and remotely are the ODI (Obligation to 
Inform) specific to each area, and the New Person Induction, available 
for all internal staff and collaborators.

Health and safety Indicators

Within the framework of the OHS Leadership Programme for 
Supervision, we imparted training on the Planned Task Risk 
Assessment (PTRA) tool. This deployment was carried out in all 
companies during 2023 through in-person training conducted on site 
and in virtual classrooms. 

We then worked on digitising the content on our platforms to make 
it available to the entire organisation. This digital training material is 
part of the Training Plan on mandatory transversal topics, which were 
defined by the Mining Group as a whole. 

In line with our continuous improvement process at Antofagasta, 
we have implemented Collision Avoidance Systems (CAS) in all mobile 
equipment at our mines. CAS is capable of detecting objects in a 
defined collision risk zone and warns equipment operators to avoid 
unwanted interactions.

Our focus on security issues
The real and potential negative impacts of external criminality perpetrated against our facilities, possibly with the threat of violence, can affect 
personnel both physically and psychologically. Strengthening the protection of our personnel will help to mitigate or prevent any serious impact.

At the administrative level, our recently created Industrial Protection Deputy Management team has had a productive year. Following stringent 
diagnosis of risks at each mining site and on our railways, we have begun to apply a range of measures focused on protecting our personnel and 
infrastructure.

How we engage with our stakeholders / Social continued

Fostering 
communities

Shared social value is key to our 
sustainable approach. We seek to 
contribute to social and economic 
development in the local communities 
in which we operate through  
proactive engagement based on  
trust, transparency, respect and 
diversity, and in collaboration with 
local organisations and authorities.

In 2023, we focused on defining a 2024 strategy that marks 
a new cycle of community relations programmes at Los 
Pelambres, Somos Choapa (We are Choapa), and across our 
three companies in the Antofagasta region, Diálogos para el 
Desarrollo (Dialogues for Development), in order to ensure 
compliance with the standards we defined as a Group for the 
development of a productive and long-term relationship with 
the neighbouring communities..

Social investment
We use a multi-stakeholder, open dialogue engagement 
approach to ensure that local communities participate in the 
selection of our social investment projects through our Somos 
Choapa (We are Choapa) and Diálogos para el Desarrollo 
(Dialogues for Development) engagement mechanisms in 
the Choapa Province and the Antofagasta Region respectively. 
Projects and programmes are usually implemented in alliance 
with third parties, such as organisations and state institutions. 

We have two relationship programmes. Somos Choapa (We 
are Choapa) is a public-private strategic partnership between 
Los Pelambres and the Choapa province’s four municipal 
districts – Salamanca, Illapel, Canela and Los Vilos – through 
which we seek to contribute to the area’s sustainable 
development. The programme focuses on four main areas 
of social investment: water management, education and 
culture, economic development, and community infrastructure. 
Diálogos para el Desarrollo (Dialogues for Development) is 
the engagement framework to work with the communities 
and local authorities of María Elena, Sierra Gorda and Michilla, 
the neighbours’ communities of Antucoya and Centinela, 
respectively, and other strategic partners to foster local 
peoples’ social and economic quality of life. Community 
members actively participate in the selection of initiatives 
to develop jointly between companies and neighbours, as well 
as in working groups to oversee their implementation.

STRATEGIC REPORTOur relationship with indigenous peoples
Our relationship with the communities of the Salar de Atacama, 
in the Antofagasta region, applies the methodology of dialogue and 
participation established by ILO Convention 169 on Indigenous and 
Tribal Peoples. Based on this, we signed social investment agreements 
with the communities in the Salar de Atacama (Peine, Socaire, Camar 
and Talabre) in 2023, and these are currently being implemented.

We apply an Indigenous Peoples Engagement Standard to ensure 
that all of Antofagasta Minerals’ operations and projects consistently 
employ development processes and practices that fully respect the 
human rights of indigenous peoples. At Zaldívar, we are working 
with communities around the Salar de Atacama, within the extension 
project’s EIA module, which aims to replace our use of continental 
water with other sources by 2028.

In 2023, we strengthened the Los Pelambres community relations 
team with professionals experienced in indigenous community 
relations, bolstering our commitment to respecting these communities’ 
identity, traditions and interests. Los Pelambres has been working 
closely with indigenous communities to settle formal joint working 
agreements, primarily with the Chango people, but also with other 
communities in the Choapa Valley, such as the Diaguita Taucán 
and Mapuche peoples.

In 2023, the ICMM updated its Human Rights Due Diligence Guidance, 
an important resource that helps member mining companies to better 
integrate human rights into existing risk management approaches. 
The guide stresses the fact that every person deserves to be treated 
with dignity and respect, and that all businesses, regardless of where 
they operate, have a responsibility to respect human rights.

Our main input for development of our human rights policy hinges 
on the first Due Diligence exercise implemented in 2018 at all our 
companies. We are currently working on our second Due Diligence 
exercise, which we expect to complete in 2024, in order to bridge the 
gaps we identified in our first process and establish new action plans.

Grievance mechanism
In 2023, we worked on an improvement plan for management of the 
Community Grievances Channel, its investigation process, governance 
and external disclosure. The channel was updated in 2022 for the 
reporting of concerns, complaints and grievances linked to our 
operations in neighbouring communities. Grievances can be presented 
confidentially and are monitored until a resolution is reached, usually 
within a 30-day period.

Community members without internet access can submit their 
complaints by letter or in person to the operation in question or to the 
local community relations co-ordinator. Complaints are then entered 
into the complaints system to allow follow-up and progress monitoring.

The mechanism was designed in line with the United Nations Guiding 
Principles on Business and Human Rights (UNGP) and the ICMM’s 
Good Practice Guide for the Handling and Resolving Local-level 
Concerns and Grievances.

Measuring our social investment programmes
Since 2018, as part of our Impact Ecosystem, we have regularly 
measured the impact of our social programmes in our territories of 
operation in the Antofagasta Region and Choapa Province. For this, 
we use tools from the Theory of Change and the Social Return on 
Investment (SROI).1 At the Group level, we have so far measured 
the impact of 18 initiatives and three relationship processes.

During 2023, we carried out impact evaluations for the APRoxima 
(water for human consumption in Choapa) and Minera Los Pelambres 
scholarship programmes. In the northern zone, we measured the 
community relationship process, evaluating the Dialogues for 
Development (Diálogos para el Desarrollo, the main mechanism 
for dialogue and participation) programme in the towns of María 
Elena and Sierra Gorda. In all cases, we identified a positive SROI, 
meaning `that the social return on investment was greater than 1, 
thus qualifying interventions as successful. In addition, based on the 
results obtained from the Theory of Change and the SROI evaluation, 
improvement plans have been developed for each programme 
that will allow us to monitor and continuously improve the initiatives 
deployed in the territories examined.

Case study

Recovering Lickanantay heritage 

In June 2023, the school in the town of Peine in the Antofagasta Region became the focus 
of an unprecedented initiative to recover the heritage and native language of the Lickanantay 
people (atacameños). 

Titled “Let’s talk in Ckunsa”, the project seeks to highlight the efforts that the educational 
community of this town in the Salar de Atacama is making to bring about a revival of their 
traditions and mother tongue through art.

This project, one of the key activities led by Minera Zaldívar in relation to local identity, took 
place over the course of five months and was captured through the painting of a mural by the 
students in conjunction with the New York-based Chilean artist, Sebastián Gross. The artwork 
was included in a retrospective exhibition of his work at the Centro Cultural Gabriela Mistral 
(GAM) in Santiago.

Improving water stewardship
Climate change adaptation is key to what we do with respect to 
water stewardship. In line with our Climate Change Strategy and our 
Water Policy,1 we support our neighbouring communities in adjusting 
to climate change through water stewardship. Water has become 
critical not only operationally but in terms of its key social value.

In 2023, we further expanded our efforts through our APRoxima and 
Confluye programmes to ensure continuous availability of water for 
human consumption and irrigation in the severely drought-hit Choapa 
Province. Managed by Minera Los Pelambres and its Foundation, 
and with technical support from Universidad de La Serena, APRoxima 
seeks to contribute to the development of rural drinking water systems.

Confluye looks to promote projects with the Water Users’ Boards of 
towns and public services in Choapa. The programme has supported 
the improvement of 102.23 km of irrigation canals that ensure the 
availability of over 200,000 m3 of water to irrigate 508 productive 
hectares, benefitting over 4,300 farmers.

STRATEGIC REPORTComprehensive agricultural support
Focused on peasant family farming, the Apoyo Integral a la Agricultura 
or Comprehensive Support for Agriculture programme, launched in 
the municipality of Salamanca in 2014, has contributed to the financing 
of 504 agricultural input projects and works to achieve efficient use 
of available irrigation water (accumulation and distribution) in 2023. 

The Programa de Fortalecimiento Agrícola (PFA) or Agricultural 
Strengthening Programme has been focused on water efficiency 
(technology-based irrigation, photovoltaic drive and intra-farm dams) 
and the Cooperativa Tres Ríos production chain. This initiative has 
enabled the modernisation of more than 145 hectares, including the 
collection of over 75m3 of water. 

Boosting local economic development
Minera Los Pelambres, through its Foundation in Choapa province, 
runs the Cosecha and Emprende local economic development 
programmes to improve the productive conditions of small-scale 
entrepreneurs and rural producers, helping to reduce gaps in relation 
to the quality of products and services and highlighting the productive 
tradition of the territory.

Land reconversion in Antofagasta

In November, Ferrocarril de Antofagasta (FCAB), our Transport 
division, began the first stage of a 48-hectare land reconversion 
plan. The scheme will focus on the rail yards in central 
Antofagasta and consist of three projects: Land Rehabilitation, 
Progressive Relocation of Operations and Urban Development. 

The plan will improve connectivity, create new residential and 
commercial spaces, enhance railway heritage and generate 
more safe, public spaces for the community.

These initiatives provide financial and training support to improve 
business management, and we have created partnerships with 
regional universities, public services and the four local governments 
to implement these programmes effectively.

Additional efforts have been made during 2022 and 2023 to 
strengthen female entrepreneurship, with initiatives focused on 
boosting capabilities and the creation of collaboration networks and 
marketing programmes that have allowed us to open new growth 
spaces for the territory.

Supporting the Pan American 
and Parapan American Games

In line with our values and the community’s participation 
in sport, we were proud to become sponsors of the Pan 
American and Parapan American Games, which were 
held for the first time in Chile. This is one of the largest 
multidisciplinary international sporting events in which 
athletes from all over the Americas participate, second 
only to the Olympic Games.

We supplied 3,000 medals, each with a solid core of 
copper from our mining sites, representing this key 
element of our Chilean identity. The medals were 
unveiled at Centinela last August. 

As a sponsor of the Pan American and Parapan 
American Games, Antofagasta Minerals was given the 
opportunity to bring the flame to Antucoya, Los 
Pelambres and the towns of María Elena and 
Salamanca in an open community activity that became 
a milestone in the localities and in our companies.

How we engage with our stakeholders / Social continued

Our suppliers

Our suppliers are at the heart of our 
sustainable business. They are a driver 
of continuous improvement to our high-
quality service and products. We support 
them collaboratively through mechanisms 
that comply with the highest standards 
in relation to their performance and 
respect for human rights.

At Antofagasta, we have a close relationship with a wide 
range of suppliers. We interact with local suppliers from 
our communities, global suppliers, banks (in relation to our 
asset development strategy), investors, and many others. 

Prior to signing contracts, we conduct due diligence on all 
potential suppliers in areas such as company ownership, 
involvement of politically exposed persons, antitrust issues, 
commercial behaviour, legal cases, conflicts of interest, 
compliance models and procedures for the prevention 
of slavery and human trafficking. 

All contracts include clauses relating to ethics, bribery, 
asset laundering, and compliance with Chilean Law No. 
20,393 on the criminal liabilities of legal entities, and with 
the UK’s Bribery Act and Modern Slavery Act. Continuing 
with the process initiated in 2022, we carried out an audit 
to verify compliance with minimum and general standards 
on the part of contractor companies. The results will be 
available in 2024.

Since 2022, we have applied sustainability criteria to 
evaluate bids for contracts with a value in excess of $10 
million, complementing our existing energy efficiency and 
safety standards. Higher scores are awarded to companies 
with clear carbon emission reduction strategies and 
targets, robust governance, local recruitment, and diversity 
and inclusion. 

At Antofagasta, we have been developing specific strategies, 
consistent with our Climate Change Strategy, to support our 
larger suppliers in tackling, for example, Scope 3 emissions 
reduction (indirect carbon emissions that occur within 
a company’s value chain), in line with the ICMM Scope 3 
Emissions Accounting and Reporting Guidance, published 
in September 2023.

We launched the sustainability criteria application guide 
for tenders made to our Mining division, consolidating the 
application guidelines on energy efficiency, internal carbon 
price and sustainability performance evaluation. The guide 
also expands the scope of application to new categories 
and amounts.

Additionally, as climate-related risks and opportunities have 
impacted our supply chain and with the increasing severity 
of sea swells, which have delayed the delivery of some 
critical resources, Antofagasta has decided to strengthen 
its resilience by increasing its storage capacity and revising 
some of its supply chain strategies, particularly for diesel 
and acid.

STRATEGIC REPORTSuppliers for a Better Future programme 
progress
In 2023, we implemented our Suppliers for a Better Future 
programme. Launched in December 2022, the initiative seeks to 
align contractor best practices with our main purpose and standards. 
This is a collaborative project with a focus on the development of 
people, communities, sustainability, competitiveness and innovation.

Our programme’s priorities

•  Promote local 

employability and 
hiring of women, 
enhance diversity 
and inclusion 
(D&I) and respect 
of human and 
labour rights.

•  Reduce carbon 
footprint and 
promote circular 
economy 
solutions.

•  Strengthen 
the culture 
of productivity 
and integrity 
in our suppliers’ 
processes.

The programme has given suppliers the tools to become world-class 
companies, to increase competitiveness and their capacity of 
growth, and to incorporate themselves into the industry in an 
effective and efficient manner. This is particularly the case for local 
small and medium-sized companies (SMEs) in the Antofagasta and 
Coquimbo regions.

those with a “high” or “very high” sustainability risk to complete a 360° 
evaluation of categories, such as water, biodiversity, local pollution, 
materials, chemical products and waste, safety, energy consumption, 
GHG emissions, diversity and inclusion, and corruption.

As part of our strategy, and before sharing any compliance goals 
with our suppliers, we approach entrepreneurial organisations in 
the Coquimbo and Antofagasta Regions, such as the Asociación de 
Industriales de Antofagasta (AIA) or Antofagasta Industrial Association 
and the Sistema de Calificación de Empresas Proveedoras de Bienes 
y Servicios (SICEP) or Supplier Qualification System, in order 
to evaluate the feasibility of our programmes, particularly at 
regional level.

In 2023, we required contractors to pay their employees an ethical 
gross monthly minimum wage of $741.4, 35% higher than the 
minimum wage established by Chilean law, and to provide them 
with health and life insurance. Los Pelambres and Centinela also 
support the further education of contractors’ children.

For further information on suppliers, please refer to our Sustainability 
Databook for 2023, available on our website (www.antofagasta.co.uk).

Case study

Collaborative emission reduction 
initiatives with our suppliers

•  New explosives contract, which made available 25,000 
tonnes of certified blue ammonium nitrate in 2023. 
This material undergoes an additional manufacturing step 
that internalises the CO2 emitted in gas wells, generating 
a reduction of carbon emissions in the raw material and 
in the final product (explosives).

•  Operation of electric vans and electrical auxiliary equipment 

for soil movement.

•  Within the framework of the agreement signed with OEM 
in 2022, a formal assessment of the model required for 
the decarbonisation transformation at Minera Los Pelambres 
was carried out in 2023.

Case study

Our tools

•  A supplier academy to explain the relevance of sustainability 

through training and skills development.

•  Aprende En Red: a digital learning platform where local suppliers 
can access training on general and company-specific topics 
to enhance their skills and expand their knowledge to become 
more competitive when participating in bids.

•  Business roundtables to connect supply and demand between 

our Mining division and potential suppliers.

•  Forums to present our Group initiatives and improvement 

opportunities for suppliers.

•  Regional supplier development project Suppliers for

How we engage with our stakeholders / Environmental

Sustainable 
production

We strive to produce in a sustainable way 
based on a long-term vision. Our priority 
is to prevent, minimise and mitigate any 
impact on the environment in which we 
operate. Through regular reports and 
reviews, we periodically evaluate our 
performance and make improvements as 
required. Our four operations meet all the 
criteria of The Copper Mark and the 
ICMM Performance Expectations 
standards for responsible mining.

We seek to support each of our operations in the effective 
implementation of the Environmental Management Model, 
with a focus on the identification and mitigation of risks, and 
in order to ensure compliance with the relevant 
environmental regulations across the Group, including our 
current operations, development and exploration projects. As 
part of this process, the Company aims to identify learning 
opportunities centrally, which are shared across the Group.

In addition, we work towards standardising the process to 
initiate each project’s design, to deliver environmental and 
sustainability improvements, particularly regarding early 
dialogue with local communities close to each project. 
Through this approach, the Company aims to facilitate the 
processes to apply for environmental permits. 

Finally, we have a focus on biodiversity and the circular 
economy. 

Our environmental performance is reported on a monthly 
basis to the Executive Committee, and twice a year to the 
Sustainability and Stakeholder Management Committee. 
Based on an Annual Audit Plan, the Company’s Internal Audit 
function performed environmental audits on all of our 
operations in 2023 to verify the effectiveness of our internal 
controls and governance, compliance with environmental 
requirements, and the measures committed to by our 
operations within the framework of their environmental 
permits. No significant audit findings were reported during 
2023.

STRATEGIC REPORTTailings management
Tailings deposits are a key factor in our environmental policy, and 
accountability for them lies at the highest levels of the Company’s 
management. We have four main tailings storage facilities (TSFs): the 
El Mauro and Los Quillayes conventional dams at Los Pelambres, a 
thickened tailings deposit at Centinela, and a small thickened tailings 
deposit at Zaldívar.

Our Tailings Policy is aligned with the Global Industry Standard on 
Tailings Management (GISTM), and we prioritise the health and safety 
of our personnel, our neighbouring communities and the environment. 
In August 2023, we announced compliance with the GISTM at our 
main tailings storage facilities. The process was completed at El Mauro 
(Los Pelambres) and Centinela in 2023. The remaining facilities – Los 
Quillayes (Los Pelambres) and Zaldívar, will be finished within the 
August 2025 compliance deadline. 

GISTM framework

Areas covered

The GISTM provides a framework 
for safe management of tailings 
facilities. The standard is 
classified by topic, covering 
various areas that together 
require assignment of 
responsibilities and prioritisation 
of the safety of each tailings 
facility throughout all phases of 
the project lifecycle, including 
closure and post-closure.

•  communities
•  knowledge base
•  design
•  construction, operation, 
monitoring and closure

•  management and 

governance

•  emergency response
•  public disclosure
•  principles and criteria

Implementation of the standard requires collaboration between various 
areas of the companies, which must conduct studies and update 
information on each tailings facility, as well as stronger relationships 
with communities through the transparency and sharing of 
information. Currently, the El Mauro dam and the Centinela thickened 
tailings deposit comply with the GISTM based on a self-assessment, 
which will undergo third-party validation as soon as reasonably 
practicable.

Centinela has also worked on a preventive emergency plan with the 
community of Sierra Gorda, the first municipality to engage in a natural 
hazard emergency simulation.

Environmental compliance in Chile
In Chile, large-scale projects must be assessed by the Servicio de

awarded an environmental permit called a Resolución de Calificación 
Ambiental (RCA) or Resolution of Environmental Qualification. These 
RCAs include legally binding commitments on matters relating to the 
prevention and mitigation of the projects on any significant impacts 
on the environment and communities, and if applicable any necessary 
compensation actions.

Operational incidents with environmental consequences are classified 
as Actual (high, medium or low) or Potential (high or low) according 
to the specific features of each. A dedicated internal committee 
investigates actual high- or medium-severity incidents. According 
to the criteria established in the environmental assessment of each 
operation or project, we had zero operational incidents with significant 
environmental consequences. A total of 28 incidents with no severe 
environmental consequences were reported to the SMA.

In 2023, the Transport division (FCAB) obtained a new environmental 
permit to move part of its operations from the city of Antofagasta to the 
nearby port of Mejillones. The work, which commenced in November, 
includes the development of a 48-hectare urbanisation project in the 
city. This is an important step in the Transport division’s plans to 
update its facilities, increase its capacity, and boost quality of life in the 
city (see the Fostering Communities chapter).

Responsible Mining Standard

At Antofagasta, we have worked to achieve the highest 
sustainability standards by consistently updating our policies, 
strategies and practices. We address transparency and reliability 
through third-party accreditation of responsible copper 
production at our four mining sites. 

In 2023, for example, Antucoya and Los Pelambres received 
accreditation for implementation of the action plans to which 
they committed in 2022 and obtained The Copper Mark 
validation seal. The latter lasts until 2025, demonstrating and 
reaffirming our approach to producing copper in accordance 
with the UN’s sustainable development criteria. All our 
companies hold this certification. The Copper Mark is an 
independent external assurance of mining site compliance with 
strict and internationally recognised standards of sustainable 
production. Sites must partially meet all criteria and commit to 
tackling any existing gaps within 12 months. As participants, we 
are committed to conducting a third-party review every three 
years. Centinela and Zaldívar must carry out the assurance 
process again in 2024.

As members of the International Council on Mining and Metals 
(ICMM), our four mining sites also underwent independent 
audits on compliance with the ICMM’s Performance 
Expectations. All our sites complied with the ICMM’s 
Performance Expectations. 

In 2023, we also submitted updated information to renew our 
registration with LMEpassport, the sustainability credentials 
register at the London Metal Exchange (LME), including an 
executive summary of The Copper Mark, which is recognised by 
the LME. Our subsidiaries Minera Centinela and Minera Zaldívar 
are registered with the LME.

Monitoring air quality
Each of our mines operates comprehensive programmes to control 
dust emissions (PM10 and 2.5). These emissions are subject to 
periodic surveillance, in some cases involving the local community. Air 
quality data is regularly reported to the regional authorities to ensure 
compliance with environmental regulations.

Los Pelambres is under way with a project to plant 96,000 native 
trees and shrubs on a 300-hectare site at the Los Quillayes tailings 
storage facility. So far 120 hectares have been planted, with vegetation 
selected on the basis that it requires little irrigation, can easily adapt to 
extreme environments, and serves to control particulate material 
events while blending the dam with its surroundings.

initiatives in progress

In 2023, each operation within the Mining division was requested to 
share solutions and proposals to co-ordinate the environmental, supply 
and innovation areas within the Company, with a goal of increasing the 
visibility of what we do and promoting new initiatives within the 
circular economy. Through this initiative, the Company’s aim is to 
facilitate the implementation of solutions, projects and partnerships 
according to the features and capabilities of our operations.

For further information on sustainable production, please refer to the 
Environmental Excel sheet in the Company’s Sustainability Databook.

Circular economy initiatives

•  Los Pelambres recovers steel from haul truck tyres for recycling 

into grinding balls that are reintroduced into the mine’s 
production process. This initiative – carried out in conjunction 
with tyre disposal company Atlas Morgan and grinding ball 
supplier Magotteaux – aims to produce 97 tonnes of steel balls 
from 156 haul truck tyres during the test project.

•  Antucoya is working on the recovery of lead waste (anodes) and 
in 2023 recovered 309 tonnes of material. The company also 
signed a contract for the recovery of 600 tonnes of rubber 
waste (conveyor belts) and is working with mining tyre suppliers 
to manage end-of-use tyres, recycling around 150 tonnes of this 
waste. The three initiatives together captured more than 1,000 
tonnes of waste in 2023.

•  FCAB sold 1,794 tonnes of parts and pieces of locomotives, 
engines, bogies, and rails as scrap in 2023. In addition, they 
donated wooden sleepers that have reached the end of their 
lifecycle for reuse in parks, urban squares and social venues in 
Antofagasta, Calama and Ollagüe, and installed 25 recycling 
points for the collection and recycling of plastic bottles, 
aluminium cans and office paper.

REMUNERATION AND TALENT 
MANAGEMENT COMMITTEE

Climate change is an intrinsic element of our risk management and decision-making. Our Board of Directors has ultimate responsibility 
for our climate-related goals and strategy. 

As one of the main threats facing the Company, there is greater and more profound awareness of the need to compensate for its 
ramifications in our decision-making processes. 

Our corporate Climate Change Committee, formed in 2021, is responsible for supporting the implementation, monitoring and continuous 
improvement of the Strategy. One of the Committee’s objectives is to maximise the participation of the different areas and levels of the 
organisation.

At the executive level, Climate Change Strategy responsibilities are assigned to specific positions. The Chief Executive Officer (CEO) 
is responsible for approving targets and monitoring their progress. The Vice President of Corporate Affairs and Sustainability, 
the Chief Financial Officer (CFO), and the Vice President of Strategy and Innovation are responsible for proposing targets and reporting 
on adaptation and mitigation issues.

The Board’s Remuneration and Talent Management Committee, among other functions, ensures that the Group’s remuneration 
provisions are aligned with its strategic priorities. Using the Climate Change Strategy as a framework, it evaluates the short- and 
long-term incentive scorecards of the Group’s employee bonus plans, among which the Key Performance Indicators (KPIs) related to 
climate change have had greater weight in recent years. In 2023, climate-related KPIs for the Short Term Incentive at the Group level 
had a weight of 7.5%. In the case of the CEO, the environment category – which includes climate change – has a weighting of 10% in 
the annual bonus.

At Antofagasta, in line with the objectives of the Paris Agreement, 
we have the ambition of reducing our Greenhouse Gas (GHG) emissions 
in the short- and medium-term and to achieving carbon neutrality 
in Scope 1 & 2 emissions by 2050 (or sooner, if technology allows).

Since 2019, we have been implementing the recommendations of the 
Task Force on Climate-related Financial Disclosures (TCFD) and 
aligning our metrics and targets with the TCFD’s seven cross-industry 

climate-related metric categories, including GHG emissions and 
internal carbon prices. 

We give special priority to the potential financial impact of the transition 
and the physical risks involved, as well as to mitigation and adaptation 
measures, such as the opening of a desalination plant at Los 
Pelambres, which has become the first mining operation in central 
Chile to use sea water.

At Antofagasta, our holistic approach to decarbonisation involves both 
our mining site operational teams and our corporate teams, who 
together deploy measures that aim to reduce GHG emissions from our 
productive processes.

Given the importance and relevance of our decarbonisation approach, 
in July 2023 we created the Decarbonisation Project Management 
area within the Vice Presidency of Strategy and Innovation. 

In accordance with our Energy Policy framework, implemented in 
2022, we have incorporated the role of Energy Administrator at each 
mining site. The role consists of leading and ensuring the 

implementation and improvement of the Energy Management System 
according to Chilean Law No. 21,305 on Energy Efficiency. In addition, 
Energy Administrators supervise the achievement of decarbonisation 
and energy targets through energy efficiency plans and GHG 
reduction. 

Since April 2022, all our mining operations have operated exclusively 
under renewable energy power supply contracts, reducing our 
Scope 2 emissions to zero.

During 2023, we have worked with the Communication and Supply 
teams to incorporate suppliers into our decarbonisation target 
(Scope 3) with the aim of formulating a joint emissions mitigation plan.2

In 2023, we continued work to incorporate carbon emission indicators 
into our large project decisions, thus integrating the entire organisation 
into our decarbonisation plan. We conduct thorough analyses to 
establish whether a given purchase may have a positive or negative 
impact on our path to decarbonisation or in relation to bank credits. 
Decarbonisation initiatives are becoming an increasingly relevant 
aspect of financial evaluation packages.

We strive to reduce our carbon footprint. As part of these efforts, we 
have worked with: 

 − Equipment manufacturers to incorporate technology solutions 

within the Group, targeting a reduction in our direct emissions; 
and

 − Our suppliers within Scope 3 to include sustainability and carbon 

footprint reduction in their processes.

2.  Information available in our Second Climate Change Report, p. 42, including a breakdown of 15 categories of this type of emissions.

A pioneering joint effort to measure Scope 3 
emissions

In August 2023, our Mining division, together with other major mining companies operating 
in Chile, formed the first Scope 3 Emissions Traceability Roundtable. This is a pioneering 
initiative in the mining industry in Chile and seeks to unify efforts concerning the 
measurement of emissions within the value chain.

One of the main objectives of this initiative is to advance the homologation of existing 
standards and methodologies and to promote capacity building through collaborative work 
between mining companies and their suppliers.

During 2023, the Mining division has been reviewing the suitability of 
our four companies’ energy nodes for electrification of our vehicles 
and distribution centres, in an attempt to establish whether network 
and distribution points in northern Chile are prepared for this 
simultaneous demand. At the national level, infrastructure availability is 
critical to a timely energy transition.

Even though we do have the capacity for energy transition at 
Antofagasta, energy cost in the mining industry is becoming an issue. 
Within the Latin American region, we have very competitive costs that 
combine the price of the energy itself with capacity and transmission. 

In 2023, following the three-fold drop in the cost of green energy over 
the past decade, we began the manufacturing and pilot implementation 
of electric-powered trolleys, and will commence testing dynamic 
charging solutions for haul trucks at Los Pelambres. The initiative was 
approved by the Board, and consequently, we have begun to 
implement this project.

Electromobility for decarbonisation
In 2023, we made progress in one of the next five years’ most 
innovative decarbonisation projects: electromobility at mining sites and 
our haul truck replacement plan. 

In June 2023, Centinela put into operation the largest fleet of electric 
pickup trucks in Chile. A total of 50 vehicles began work on the site 
using energy from 100% renewable sources1. In addition, we acquired 
eight units of electric mining equipment for ancillary activity, which will 
operate in the Esperanza Sur autonomous pit. This equipment will 
reduce emissions by a further 5,200 tonnes of CO2 annually.
The initiative is part of Centinela and Antofagasta’s Climate Change 
Strategy, which has contributed to a 30% reduction in total direct and 
indirect GHG emissions (combined basis) ahead of the original deadline 
of 2025, and has become a driver to achieve the new 2035 goal of a 
50% reduction in scope 1 and 2 emissions. Implementation of this 
electric fleet involves the construction of 12 electric charging stations, 
with more than 50 fast charging points.

In addition, FCAB incorporated a new fleet of 100% electric vehicles as 
part of their strategy to reduce the environmental footprint. These 
vehicles, which will operate under lease, are more compact and 
efficient, considerably quieter, and can be charged via a household 
socket or wall charger at the company’s premises. 

1.  Centinela is contracted to receive 100% renewable energy.

Scope 3 Emissions
In November 2023, the Company published its Second Climate Change Report, covering 2022, which included an inaugural estimate of Scope 3 
emissions. This report includes a breakdown of the 15 categories of Scope 3 emissions and is available on the Company’s website at the 
following location:

www.antofagasta.co.uk/media/4601/climate-change-report_fv3-1.pdf

As detailed on page 42 of the above report, total Scope 3 emissions for 2022 were 5,692,874 tonnes CO2e (2021: 5,242,777 tonnes CO2e). A full 
breakdown of these totals is provided on the same page of this report. The Scope 3 totals include all material/relevant categories of emissions.

An estimated Scope 3 emissions in 2023 is not available as of the date of this report due to the complexity of data collection, validation and 
analysis required for this category of emissions. The Company expects to be able to publish an estimate for Scope 3 emissions for 2023 later in 
2024, once the relevant data is available and fully validated.

Our TCFD progress
The Group’s Task Force on Climate-related Financial Disclosures 
(TCFD) recommendations are integrated into this report in accordance 
with the Financial Conduct Authority Listing Rule LR.9.8.6(8). Progress 
against the recommendations is summarised below, together with an 
index showing where more detailed disclosures can be found. In 2023 
our disclosures are fully consistent with all the TCFD recommended 
disclosures, following progress on Strategy and Metrics & Targets, 
which has meant that the Group is consistent with the TCFD 
recommendations in all areas, including the following areas where we 
completed the recommendations during the year: 

•  Strategy, impact on business – Decarbonisation Plan: We 
have assessed and reported in our Climate Change Report for 
2022 which was published in November 2023, how our 
emission reduction plans aim to achieve our decarbonisation 

targets at our operations. In addition, our climate action plan 
considers our path towards decarbonisation. 

•  Metrics and Targets, climate-related metrics – Climate Metrics 
& Targets: We have estimated the capital expenditure we expect  
will be required to mitigate and adapt to climate change. As part of 
the necessary engineering studies, this figure will be refined 
throughout the cycle until final investment decision.

•  Metrics and Targets, GHG emissions and related risks – 

Scope 3: We disclosed in our Climate Change Report for 2022, 
which was published in November 2023, our Scope 3 emissions 
and breakdown split in 15 categories and the main areas of work 
to achieve our goal of a 10% reduction by 2030 (against a 
baseline year of 2022). Our Climate Change Report and Climate 
Action Plan also outlines key ways in which we aim to work with 
suppliers. The 2023 Scope 3 emissions figure is not yet available 
due to the time delay in collecting data/updating the estimate.

This report integrates the Group’s Task Force on Climate-related Financial Disclosures (TCFD) recommendations in accordance with  
the Financial Conduct Authority Listing Rule LR.9.8.6(8). The Company has provided a summary of its decarbonisation plan in this Annual Report, 
and the Climate Change Report for 2022 is complementary to this summary.

•  We created the Decarbonisation Project Management area as part of the Vice Presidency of Strategy and Innovation.
•  Climate change scenario analysis (scenarios SSP5-8.51 “fossil-fuelled development” for physical risk analysis and IEA’s NZE 
by 20502 for transition risk analysis) was presented to the Board and the results of this analysis informed the annual long-term 
financial planning process. We have separately reported on Board members’ experience relating to climate change issues.
•  Since the establishment of the corporate Climate Change Committee in 2021, it has continued to enhance the understanding and 

appreciation of the importance of our Climate Change Strategy within the organisation and provide advice to our Executive Committee.

Progress
•  Minera Los Pelambres: Los Vilos desalination plant operation start (400 l/s water capacity) and environmental approval to double 

its capacity to 800 l/s). 

•  Communities’ activities related to resilience have been in place during 2023, mainly working in an infrastructure plan and 

• 

emergency programme.
In transition risk analysis this year, we incorporated the valuation of a new decarbonisation plan, and the analysis of energy 
efficiency measures. An improvement in the analysis was to explore the potential benefit brought by a higher copper price driven 
by the energy transition.

•  We reviewed the impact of climate change risks and opportunities as part of our 2023 long-term financial planning process 

allowing us to assess the impact of climate change risks during the life-of-mine (LOM) of each operation. 

•  Following our evaluation of climate change issues that could affect our supply chain, we have strengthened the resilience of our 

supply chains for some of our critical resources, such as diesel and acid. 

•  This year, to improve our understanding of the financial impact of the physical risks of climate change, we used the “fossil-fuelled 
development” climate change scenario (SSP5-8.51), rather than the scenario we used in our 2022 analysis (SSP2-4.52). For 
transition risk, we used the “net zero emission by 2050” scenario from the IEA.

Progress
•  Climate change physical risks were assessed using the SSP5-8.5 scenario.1 The estimated financial impact on operating costs 
and capital expenditure was calculated for three situations: no mitigation or adaptation; controls already in place; and plans and 
actions implemented in the future.

•  Climate change transition risks were assessed using the “net zero emission by 2050” scenario. The estimated financial impact on 
operating costs and capital expenditure was calculated for three situations: no mitigation or adaptation; controls already in place; 
and plans and actions implemented in the future.

•  Controls and action plans for transition risks were updated. The risk of carbon tax was assessed using the “net zero emission by 

2050” scenario, considering our decarbonisation plan as an input for this analysis.

•  The impact of physical risks on the communities was reviewed, and action and control plans were established.

Progress
•  During 2023, the Board approved a new Scope 1 and Scope 2 reduction target: To reduce our Scope 1 and 2 emissions by 50% 
by 2035, with the year 2020 as a baseline. Our Scope 3 reduction target, which will be achieved through collaboration with 
industry, is to achieve a 10% reduction in Scope 3 emissions by 2030, with the year 2022 as a baseline.

•  We have estimated the amount of capital that we anticipate will be required to achieve these targets, assuming trolley and battery 

based technologies, understanding these technologies may change and/or evolve before we achieve our decarbonisation goals. As 
part of the necessary engineering studies, this figure will be refined throughout the cycle until final investment decision. In 2024, we 
are planning to complete prefeasibility studies as part of our ongoing evaluation of decarbonisation technologies and key enablers.

Climate change scenario analysis
In 2023, Antofagasta enhanced its understanding of the financial 
impact of the physical risks of climate change by considering a 
“fossil-fuelled development” climate change scenario (SSP5-8.5). 
This scenario takes advantage of the latest generation climate models 
(CMIP-6) and is considered an extreme scenario , leading to warming 
by 2100 of 3.6 to 6.2 °C compared to pre-industrial temperatures. 
To better understand how physical climate changes could impact 
our business, we have focused on particular climate change vectors, 
such as higher temperatures, water stress, extreme rainfall events, 
conditions that generate particulate matter, storm surges and wave 
events. Each of our operations analysed the potential effect of these 
factors on their production, cost performance, and the cost of 
adaptation measures and control options.

To understand the financial impact of transition risks, we used the new 
International Energy Agency’s “Net Zero Emission by 2050” or IEA’s 
NZE scenario (2 degrees or lower scenario), an ambitious and widely 
recognised scenario that provides a global view and context on a 
low-carbon transition. In the IEA’s NZE , fossil fuel prices decline due 
to low demand and lower costs are offset by the introduction of carbon 
taxes to encourage the low-carbon transition. In alignment with this 
scenario, we have quantified the potential financial impact of the 
introduction of a carbon tax, including an analysis of our decarbonisation 
plan and identifying opportunities such as higher copper price. 

To align the potential impact of both physical and transition risks to the 
lifetime and planning cycle of our mining operations, we defined short 
term as 0–5 years, medium term as 5–15 years and long term as 
15–50 years. Once the risks and opportunities were identified, the 
most material risks and opportunities were screened and quantified at 
an operational level, and their financial impact was estimated using 
assumptions from these scenarios. We also assessed the financial 
impact of climate change across the lifetime of each mine and for a 
25-year period for the Transport division (see page 98). Climate 
scenario analysis was used to better understand and assess the 
likelihood and impact of risks and opportunities and was integrated into 
our risk assessment processes using ISO 31000 and best practice 
methodology (Bow Tie which considers cause, consequences and 

controls). The estimated financial impact on operating costs and capital 
expenditure was calculated against three views: 1) no mitigation or 
adaptation, 2) controls already in place, and 3) plans and actions 
implemented in the future. We will continue to improve our maturity 
through the studies necessary to refine capital deployments in 
mitigation and adaptation. For further information regarding Climate 
Change risk descriptions, please see pages 24 and 25 of our Climate 
Change Report for 2022, which was published in November 2023 and 
in the Company’s Climate Action Plan.

Results of climate scenario analysis, excluding 
copper market benefit

Impact calculated over operations’ Life-of-Mines (LOMs) 

To improve our understanding of how climate risks may develop and 
impact our operations, we carried out a new climate scenario analysis 
exercise in 2023. This also helped us develop our investment plans 
and enhance our prevention and recovery control measures.

In general, our 2023 analysis showed that the potential exposure 
of our business under the physical risks scenario does not have major 
changes compared to the analysis done in 2022, despite carrying out 
the 2023 analysis using the more extreme scenario. The changes 
in relation to the 2022 analysis are based on a better understanding 
of the impacts of climate change, and the absence of major differences 
between the scenarios can be explained by the fact that the changes 
in the climate variables occur after the end of the LOM of each 
operation. In addition, the investments in the closure works already 
consider potential impacts due to adverse weather conditions. 

To analyse the potential financial impact of transition risks we have 
considered the following factors: Carbon Tax to be paid if investment 
in mitigation is not made, then investment in mitigation necessary 
to meet our targets (aligned with our Climate Action Plan), Change 
in the price of Diesel delivered by the NZE by 2050 transition 
scenario (2 degrees or lower scenario), Change of Energy Source 
due to investments in mitigation, Carbon Tax avoided that represents 
one of the benefits after investing in mitigation measures and finally 
operational costs associated with the different operational costs

that green technologies bring. Finally, a higher copper price 
opportunity, associated with the energy transition is analysed, 
and energy efficiency considerations were also included. 

The change in the financial impact of transition risk, compared with 
2022, is mainly due to the better-quality information used in the 2023 
analysis and the longer LOM plans incorporated into the modelling. 
Although the likelihood of value-at-risk is uncertain, the analysis 
provides a useful reference point against which to assess and 
prioritise the mitigation and adaptation measures we need to reduce 
our exposure and strengthen our resilience. This year we included 
concepts of operating costs to reflect the positive benefits of the use 
of new technologies and the analysis of energy efficiency measures. 
Currently, long-term investment in mitigations is estimated in the range 
of $1,000 – 1,500 million, including the decarbonisation plan, and the 

investment required to support the energy transition, however, we 
expect that as technologies develop and our understanding of their 
implementation grows with trials, this estimate will evolve. Investment 
in decarbonisation will be part of our sustaining capex as we move 
forward with our plan. The estimated impact reflects incremental costs 
of enabling technologies to be evaluated as part of the normal renewal 
cycle of our fleets of haul trucks, and potential improvements to the 
in-pit electrical systems, among others.

It is anticipated that some of the actions and investments envisaged 
by the Climate Action Plan may in future lead to cost savings. 
For example, a potential reduction in operational costs, such as diesel 
consumption and maintenance costs, may offset some or all 
of the investments, as well.

Water 
stewardship

As part of the third pillar of our Climate 
Change Strategy, water stewardship has 
become a critical aspect of our 
operations due to the nature and 
geographical location of our mining 
activities. Three of our four mining 
operations are in the Atacama Desert, 
and the fourth, Los Pelambres is located 
in the Choapa Valley. 

With the aim of safeguarding the availability of water 
resources across our operations, communities and the 
environment, we apply practices aligned with the Water 
Stewardship Framework of the International Council on 
Mining and Metals (ICMM). The creation of dedicated roles for 
the management of water use at each company was in 
response to a steady development of skills and governance 
over the last two years. 

In 2023, in acknowledgement of the strategic value of water 
for our Company, we created the Water Resources 
Management area within the Vice Presidency of Planning and 
Technical Services to improve technical advice and our role 
in planning. We assigned a water lead at each mining site to 
increase water efficiency.

Considered a milestone in our water management policy, this 
new structure allows the incorporation of decisions on water 
use into new projects and the standardisation of processes. 
Our water leads are promoting a cultural change based on 
water stewardship at each company. Improving upon our 
annual water report, we now report monthly with the support 
of skilled professionals and in accordance with regulations. 
Our objective is to keep working to strengthen the Group’s 
expertise in water management.

We promote transparency through quantitative information in 
our Sustainability Databook, sustainable and responsible 
environmental water management, and the water safety of 
our communities. As a company, we are intensifying efforts 
to protect limited freshwater resources in the communities in 
which we operate. We work hard alongside the community 
and the authorities to define the future use of their water 
rights with the objective of sustainability (see Fostering 
Communities section).

Strengthen the 
strategy for 
reducing use of 
continental water in 
areas where water 
is scarce, 
establishing targets 
and actions based 
on climate scenario 
analysis results.

Efficiency, 
recirculation and

efficiency in the use 
of water and other 
strategic resources, 
improving their 
recirculation, 
recovery, reuse 
and protection in 
the Company’s 
areas of influence.

Guidance for 
compliance with the 
Water Policy’s 
commitments and 
the requirements 
established in the 
Water Management 
Standard.

According to our Water Policy and Climate Change Strategy, each 
Company must have a Water Efficiency and Implementation of New 
Technologies Plan in place. The objective is to promote the efficient 
use of water resources from continental sources, sea water or other 
alternative sources, analysing water use indicators and promoting the 
implementation of industry best practices. Since 2022, all of our 
mining sites have a water efficiency plan.

In 2023, we set a policy that all Group companies should achieve at 
least 70% of the water management standard goals. By the end of 
2023, the Mining division’s progress in implementing the standard had 
reached 80%. 

In addition, two water efficiency projects were approved to increase 
water recovery from tailings. We understand that protection of the 
environment and biodiversity is an essential element of climate action. 
As such, we focus on the role of nature-based solutions in climate 
change mitigation and adaptation to its impacts.

STRATEGIC REPORTLeading sea water use
Our 2023 achievement
60%
2023 represented the year when sea water use has overtaken 
continental sources of water for the Company, a first in our history.

Our goal
+90%
of the water used by our operations should be sea water or 
recirculated once our desalination plant at Los Pelambres reaches its 
expanded capacity of 800 l/s.

We are moving away from dependence on continental water 
sources and increasing sea water use. In 2023, we achieved 
two milestones: completion of the Los Pelambres desalination 
plant as the first of its type in central Chile, and operations at 
Centinela are now using 100% sea water.

The Los Pelambres desalination plant has a production capacity of 
400 l/s of industrial-quality desalinated water. The plant is located at 
the Los Pelambres industrial facilities at the Port of Punta Chungo in 
Los Vilos district, Coquimbo Region. It includes marine works for 
capturing sea water and discharging brine, and an underground 
system stretching approximately 61 km to convey desalinated water 
between the pumping station and the existing recirculation station at 
the El Mauro Tailings industrial area, before continuing to the mining 
site in Chacay.

The EIA to expand the Los Pelambres desalination plant to 800 l/s, in 
addition to the replacement of the concentrate pipeline and enclosures 
at the El Mauro tailings dam, was approved by the environmental 
authority in October 2023.

At Centinela, following two years of work, operations began to function 
with 100% sea water in 2023, following the closure of the water wells 
in Calama. It was the result of various projects, investment in which 
totalled approximately $130 million. In a challenging operation, the 
water is transported along a 145-kilometre aqueduct to the mining site, 
located at 2,200 metres above sea level in the Sierra Gorda district, 
Antofagasta Region. In total, Centinela requires approximately 900 l/s 
of water supply, which is now sourced entirely from sea water.

For further information on operational water extraction by source (2019-23), Mining division, please refer to our Sustainability Databook (2023).

Biodiversity 
protection

Biodiversity protection is part of our 
long-term sustainability approach and 
policy. In accordance with our 
Biodiversity Standard and aligned with 
the ICMM’s position statement on Mining 
and Protected Areas, we seek to protect 
wildlife around our mining sites. We 
ensure a net zero loss of biodiversity by 
minimising our impact and mitigating and 
compensating for any potential negative 
effects. We operate in accordance with 
the mitigation hierarchy established by 
The Copper Mark.

Both Centinela and Los Pelambres monitor the marine 
environment near their port facilities, regularly analysing the 
water column, sediments and marine fauna. Los Pelambres 
supports R&D projects to repopulate the area near its marine 
facilities with sea urchins, abalones, red kingklip and other 
species. In addition, we periodically implement programmes 
to protect animal, bird and plant species. 

Centinela operates an initiative to safeguard the Gaviotín 
Chico, a species endemic to Chile and Peru and classified as 
endangered. Zaldívar is developing the Desierto Verde project 
to increase knowledge of species that might be adaptable to 
desert living conditions. 

Our Climate Change Strategy’s fourth pillar defines two 
priorities in relation to biodiversity: nature-based solutions for 
CO2 capture and to address adaptation to acute and chronic 
physical risks. Nature-based solutions seek to use nature’s 
own resources to address environmental challenges such as 
the protection and replanting of woodland and the restoration 
of wetlands.

In 2023, we began to implement the first stage of our 
biodiversity standard. Its primary objective is to provide the 
necessary guidelines for the proper management of 
biodiversity throughout the different phases of the mining 
cycle (exploration, projects, operations and closure) and in 
relation to transport.

STRATEGIC REPORTAs part of our initial implementation efforts, we conducted a 
comprehensive site coverage analysis, along with spatial 
mapping to delineate operational zones and identify areas of 
high biodiversity value, along with their principal conservation 
attributes. To safeguard this vital biodiversity value, we are 
committed to specific courses of action, including ongoing 
monitoring, verification and reporting activities.

We focused on the analysis of a base line across the Group as a whole, 
in order to make the necessary adjustments and move forward in 
2024. We also continued to define our conceptual nature-based 
solution framework, in addition to identifying potential tests to be 
implemented in the short and medium term.

Only Los Pelambres has mining operations near nature sanctuaries. 
Laguna Conchalí and Quebrada Llau-Llau have specific management 
plans in place. The sustainable closure plan for the Los Quillayes 

1.  Phytostabilisation is the use of plant species that help to immobilise contaminants in soil, 
sediments and sludge; prevent and reduce the mobility and migration of contaminants 
through erosion; and reduce the bioavailability of metals.

tailings dam at Los Pelambres includes a process of phytostabilisation1 
through the planting of native trees and shrubs over an area of  
300 hectares. 

120 hectares are already planted with more than 20 native species, 
which are closely monitored to review their behaviour and survival. In 
2023, we planted 96,000 individual shrubs and native trees. The 
phytostabilisation process is a pioneering initiative in the large-scale 
mining industry in Chile. We plan to continue planting different species 
on the tailings wall during 2024.

In addition to our work on species and ecosystem protection, we 
conduct research and provide education. In northern Chile, we have 
worked on the educational potential of the Morro Moreno National Park 
near Mejillones, in a joint initiative with Universidad Católica del Norte 
(UCN) and the National Forest Corporation (CONAF).

How we engage with our stakeholders / Governance

Governments  
and regulators

Mining is a long-term business in which 
timescales can run into decades. Political 
cycles are typically far shorter and material 
developments and changes to policy, 
legislation or regulations can have a major 
impact on our business.

View of our operations at Centinela.

Our operations, projects and exploration are mainly located in Chile, 
where we interact with both the central government and the 
governments of the Antofagasta and Coquimbo Regions, as well as 
with the municipalities that are part of our areas of direct influence.

The relationship with governments and regulators is subject to their 
strict engagement mechanisms, which in Chile are clearly defined 
under Lobby Law No. 20.730. This law seeks to regulate the activity of 
lobbying and other efforts to represent particular interests, in order to 
strengthen transparency and honesty. It applies to the officials of 
central and local administrations who regulate activities such as the 
issue, modification and repeal of administrative acts and laws, and the 
decisions of the authorities and officials.

Outside Chile, we comply with our own policies and with the laws and 
regulations of the host countries, at all times maintaining high 
standards of engagement.

Payments to governments
Antofagasta makes payments to governments relating to our activities 
involving the exploration, discovery, development and extraction of 
minerals, and our Transport division. These payments are primarily 
taxes paid to the Chilean government and mineral licence fees, which 
in 2023 totalled $538 million, of which over 99% was paid in Chile.

Chilean law allows political donations to be made subject to certain 
requirements, but Antofagasta made no political donations in 2023. 
However, we often contribute towards the financing of projects 
benefitting local communities, in alliance with local municipalities and 
the government. These contributions are regulated by specific laws 
and are reviewed by the Chilean Internal Revenue Service (SII).

Public-private alliances
Since mining is a long-term business, we seek to contribute to Chile’s 
development and prosperity, including through public-private alliances 
with local government. Examples include our active participation in a 
workshop jointly organised by the Mining Ministry and the Women and 
Gender Equality Ministry to encourage female participation in the 
mining industry, and our commitment to the Mining Cluster in northern 
Chile, a public-private alliance to promote local employment, 
technology and skills development.

70

Antofagasta plc  Annual Report 2023

Another example of our active participation in a public-private alliance 
is the Provincial Water Working Group, organised by the Coquimbo 
Region government to identify and implement collective solutions that 
can contribute to the area’s water security in the short, medium and 
long term.

Chilean constitutional reform process
In December 2023, Chileans voted to reject a proposed constitution, 
and as a result the country will now continue with the existing 
constitution, which has been in place for several decades.

Mining royalty
In May 2023, both the Chilean Senate and lower house of Congress 
approved the proposed revision to Chile’s mining royalty bill, with 
Presidential approval confirmed in August 2023. The terms include a 
1% ad valorem royalty on copper sales, and a royalty ranging from 8% 
to 26% on operating profits depending on each mining operation’s 
level of profitability, combined with a provision establishing that total 
taxation (including corporate income, the new royalty tax and tax on 
dividends) should not exceed 46.5% of profitability.

This new law came into effect at the beginning of 2024. Since 
Centinela and Antucoya have tax stability agreements, the new royalty 
rates will only apply from 2030. As a result of the approval of the new 
mining royalty, a one-off adjustment has been recognised to the 
deferred tax balances of the Group’s mining operations, resulting in an 
increase in the deferred tax liability balance of $34.3 million, with a 
corresponding deferred tax expense.

Customers

Successful management of our relationships 
with our customers contributes to our long-
term success

Most copper and molybdenum sales are made under annual contracts 
or longer-term framework agreements, with sales volumes agreed  
for the coming year. Gold and silver are contained in the copper 
concentrates and are therefore part of copper concentrates sales.

In the case of copper cathode transactions, a premium, or in some 
cases a discount, on the LME price is negotiated to reflect differences 
in quality, logistics and financing compared with the metal exchange’s 
standard copper contract specifications.

Most sales are to industrial customers who further process the 
copper into more value-added products – smelters, in the case of 
copper concentrate production, and copper fabricators and trading 
companies in the case of cathode production. We build long-term 
relationships with these key smelters and fabricators, while ensuring 
customer diversification. We also maintain relationships with trading 
companies that participate in shorter-term sales agreements, or in the 
spot market.

About 70% of our mining sales are under contracts of a year or longer 
and metals sales pricing is generally based on prevailing market prices. 

Structure of sales contracts
Typically, our sales contracts set out the annual volumes to be supplied 
and the main terms for the sale of each payable metal, with the pricing 
of the contained copper in line with LME prices. In the case of 
concentrates, a deduction is made from LME prices to reflect TC/RCs, 
the smelting and refining costs to process the concentrate into refined 
copper. These TC/RCs are typically determined annually, in line with 
market developments and the parties’ assessments of the copper 
concentrate market at the time of the negotiation of the terms.

Similarly, our molybdenum contracts are made under medium- and 
long-term framework agreements, with pricing usually based on Platts’ 
average prices for Technical Molybdenum Oxide, with a deduction to 
reflect the cost of converting molybdenum sulphide concentrate into 
molybdenum oxide.

Across the industry, neither copper producers nor consumers tend to 
make annual commitments for 100% of their respective sales or 
purchases, and normally retain a portion to be sold or purchased on 
the spot market during the year.

In line with industry practice, our sales agreements generally provide 
for provisional pricing at the time of shipment, with final pricing based 
on the average market price in the month in which settlement takes 
place.

For copper concentrates, the final price remains open until settlement 
occurs, on average four months from the shipment month. Settlement 
for the gold and silver contained in the copper concentrates occurs 
approximately one month after shipment. Copper cathode sales remain 
open for an average of one month from the month of shipment.

Settlement for copper in concentrate sales is later than for copper 
cathode sales, as copper in concentrate requires more processing to 
produce refined copper for sale. Molybdenum sales generally remain 
open for two or three months after the month of shipment.

Risk management framework

Effective risk management is an essential part of our culture and strategy.

The accurate and timely identification, assessment and management of principal risks give 
us a clear understanding of the actions required to achieve our objectives.

Key elements of integrated risk management 

We recognise that risks are inherent to our business 

Only through adequate risk management can internal stakeholders be 
supported in making key decisions and implementing our strategy. 

Exposure to risks must be consistent with our risk appetite 

The Board defines and regularly reviews the acceptable level of exposure 
to emerging and principal risks. Risks are aligned with our risk appetite, 
taking into consideration the balance between threats and opportunities. 

We are all responsible for managing risks 

Each business activity carries out risk evaluations, to ensure the sound 
identification, management, monitoring and reporting of risks that 
could impact the achievement of our goals. 

Risk is analysed using a consistent framework 

Our risk management methodology is applied to all of our operating 
companies, projects, exploration activities and support areas, so that 
we have a comprehensive view of the uncertainties that could affect 
the achievement of our strategic goals. The framework is based on 
ISO 31000 and COSO ERM.1 

•  Continuation of on-site risk reviews of selected risk areas whilst 

accompanied by senior management, increasing the Company’s risk 
maturity level.

•  Co-coordinated Contingency Committees in line with our risk 

management process.

•  Updated the Company’s risk appetite statement, including the sections 

relating to Environmental Management, Corruption and Political, Legal and 
Regulatory. The updated statement was approved by the Board in November, 
with the level of risk appetite for all risk areas remaining unchanged.
•  Reported monthly to both the Company’s Executive Committee and 
individual risk owners, in order to identify and manage any deviation 
from expected performance.

•  Updated the Business Continuity Plan for each operating company, 

with considerations made for any new challenges encountered during 
2023, and ensuring the incorporation of the lessons learned.

•  Continued monitoring of controls identified during the assessment of 
the impact of the conflict in Ukraine, with additional monitoring of the 
conflict in the Middle East. 

•  Participated in the review of the FQAR (Functional Quality Assurance 

Review) project.

We are committed to continuous improvement 

Lessons learned and best practices are incorporated into our 
procedures to protect and unlock value sustainably. 

•  Continued training of risk owners and main users. 
•  Updated and monitored critical controls and action plans.
•  Prepared new action plans to maintain risk exposure within 

Areas of focus and development during 2023 

Our main focus in 2023 was on the sociopolitical environment, 
monitoring conflicts in Europe and the Middle East, as well as the 
political situation in Chile. Following the rejection of the proposed draft 
constitution in December 2023, it is understood that the Government 
of Chile will not seek a third process to draft a revised Constitution, 
providing a greater degree of certainty in the short term.

The war in Ukraine has affected the sourcing of some of our strategic 
supplies, which remains a concern, although our risk analysis of the 
war allowed us to mitigate the impact of this factor on our business.

During the year, the Chilean mining royalty bill was approved; through 
continuous monitoring of this process, we have been sufficiently 
informed to be able to make strategic decisions.

In August, the “Ley de Delitos Económicos” (Economic Crimes Law) 
was published in Chile. This new legislation, which will come into force 
in September 2024, establishes a new legal regime applicable to natural 
persons (individuals) and another to legal entities (companies). Although 
we are confident that we have robust controls in place, we have reassessed 
and are updating our risk matrix in order to identify any improvement 
in our controls with a greater focus on the environmental areas whereby 
new offences have been included in the updated legislation. 

We have maintained our commitment to review and update our principal 
risks according to our risk methodology. The following represent 
a number of the actions that our Risk and Compliance Management 
Department undertook during 2023:

•  Defined the methodology for identifying and updating our emerging 
risks, which will assist with the continuous monitoring process.

acceptable limits.

•  Embedded timely and comprehensive risk analysis into each relevant 

decision-making process.

•  Shared best practices across our operating companies.

Governance 

The Board has overall responsibility for risk management and 
determines the nature and extent of the principal and emerging risks 
that we will accept to achieve our strategic objectives.

The Board receives a detailed analysis of each key matter in advance of 
Board meetings. This includes reports on our operating performance 
including health and safety, financial, environmental, legal and social 
matters; key developments in our exploration, project and business 
development activities; and information on the commodity markets, 
updates on talent management and analysis of financial investments.

The provision of this information allows for the early identification of 
potential issues and the assessment of any necessary preventive and 
mitigating actions.

The Audit and Risk Committee assists the Board by reviewing the 
effectiveness of the risk management process and monitoring principal 
and emerging risks, preventive and mitigation procedures, and action 
plans. The Chair of the Committee reports to the Board following each 
Committee meeting and, if necessary, the Board discusses the matters 
raised in more detail.

These processes allow the Board to effectively monitor Antofagasta’s major 
risks, any preventive and mitigating procedures, and to assess whether the 
level of actual risk exposure is consistent with the Company’s defined risk 
appetite. If a gap is identified, an action plan is prepared to fill it.

Antofagasta plc  Annual Report 2023

STRATEGIC REPORTThe Risk and Compliance Management Department is responsible 
for the Company’s risk management systems. It implements the 
Company’s risk management policy, vision and purpose, to ensure 
there is a strong risk management culture at all levels of the 
organisation. 

The Risk and Compliance Management Department supports business 
areas in analysing their risks, identifying existing preventive and 
mitigating controls and defining further action plans. It maintains and 
regularly updates the Company’s risk register.

The General Manager, with the Risk and Compliance Management 
Department support, reports twice a year to the Audit and Risk 
Committee on the overall risk management process, with detailed 
updates on principal risks, mitigation activities and actions taken in 
each subsidiary of the Company.

The General Manager of each operation has overall responsibility for 
leading and supporting risk management. Risk owners within each 
operation have direct responsibility for the risk management processes 
and for regularly updating individual business risk registers, including 
relevant mitigation activities. The individual owners of the risks and 
controls at each business unit are identified, in order to provide 
effective and direct risk management. 

Each operation holds an annual workshop on risk, at which the 
business unit’s risks and mitigation activities are reviewed in detail and 
updated as necessary. Workshops are used to assess principal risks 
that may affect relationships with stakeholders, limit resources, 
interrupt operations and/or negatively affect potential future growth.

Mitigation techniques for significant strategic and business unit risks 
are reviewed quarterly by the Risk and Compliance Management 
Department.

We promote a consistent risk management process across our 
different business units, ensuring risk is considered at all levels of the 
organisation. Risk information flows from the business units to the 
centre and from the Board back to the business units. 

Risk Management Cycle 

Risk appetite is the expression of the acceptable exposure to 
uncertainties that the organisation is willing to assume in the pursuit 
of its objectives. Our risk management cycle has four stages, and 
is designed to identify, assess, manage and follow up our risks.

Risk management 

We are aware that not all risks can be eliminated and that exposure 
to some risk is necessary in the pursuit of our corporate objectives.

Mining is a long-term business and, as part of the principal risks 
update and evaluation process, we identify new or emerging risks 
which could impact the Company’s sustainability in the long run, even 
if there is only limited information available at the time of the 
evaluation.

Any identified new or emerging risks that could impact our long-term 
strategic objectives are included in the principal risk analysis and are 
reviewed and monitored periodically by the Board. As new information 
becomes available, based on research, expert analysis and internal 
investigations, suitable controls and action plans are defined and 
incorporated into the Company’s risk matrix. 

We identify, assess and manage the risks critical to the Company’s 
success. Overseeing such risks protects our business, people and 
reputation. The risk management process provides reasonable 
assurance that the relevant risks are recognised and monitored, 
allowing the Company to achieve its strategic objectives and create 
value.

Because risks are periodically re-evaluated, the risk map shown here 
represents the position and controls in place at a specific point in time, 
as well as showing the changes that have taken place since 2022.

Throughout the year, the Board carried out an assessment of the 
Company’s emerging and principal risks, which are set out on the 
following pages with related preventive and mitigation measures.

During 2023, the probability of the Health and Safety principal risk (3) 
was lowered from “Likely” to “Possible” following the decrease in the 
probability of occurrence of a fatal event in relation to the history of 
the last five years. The impact of the Strategic Resources principal risk 
(11) was reduced from “Severe” to “Significant” following the 
commissioning of the Los Pelambres desalination plant, which came 
into operation in 2023. The probability of the Political, Legal and 
Regulatory principal risk (7) was reduced from “Likely” to “Unlikely” 
following reduced uncertainty of the constitutional process, compared 
to last year. Furthermore, the impact of this risk was increased in 
2023 from “Moderate” to “Significant” following significant adverse 
effects that could result from decisions by administrative or judicial 
authorities due to the new “Ley de Delitos Económicos” (Economic 
Crimes Law).

Risk management continued

Defining risk appetite is key in embedding the risk management system into our organisational 
culture. 

The Company’s risk appetite statement helps to align our strategy with the objectives of each 
business unit, clarifying which risk levels are, or are not, acceptable. It promotes consistent 
decision-making on risk, allied to the strategic focus and risk/reward balance approved by  
the Board.

The principal risks, together with related prevention and mitigation 
measures, have been presented to the Board and are grouped in line 
with our strategic pillars: People and Culture, Safety and Sustainability, 
Competitiveness, Growth and Innovation. These pillars are supported  
by our corporate governance structures. 

The principal risks are outlined in the risk heat map and table on 
the previous two pages, and in more detail below.

Description

Preventive and mitigation measures

Highlights

1. TALENT MANAGEMENT

Managing talent and 
maintaining a high-quality 
labour force in a fast-
changing technological  
and cultural environment 
is a key priority for us.  
Any failures could have  
a negative impact on the 
performance of our 
existing operations and 
prospects for growth.

We develop the talents of our employees through 
training and career development, invest in initiatives  
to widen the talent pool and are committed to our 
diversity and inclusion policy. 

Through these actions we aim to increase employee 
retention and add to the number of women, people with 
disabilities and employees with international experience 
in the workplace.

Our Employee Performance Management System  
is designed to attract and retain key employees by 
creating suitable and competitive reward and 
remuneration structures and providing personal 
development opportunities. We have a talent 
management system to identify and develop internal 
candidates for key management positions, as well as 
selecting suitable external candidates when 
appropriate.

2. LABOUR RELATIONS

Our highly-skilled workforce 
and experienced 
management team are 
critical to our current 
operations, implementing 
development projects and 
achieving long-term growth 
without major disruption.

We maintain good relations with our employees and 
unions, founded on trust, regular dialogue and good 
working conditions. We are committed to safety, 
non-discrimination, diversity and inclusion, and comply 
with Chile’s strict labour regulations. There are 
long-term labour agreements (usually three years) in 
place with all the unions at our operations, which helps 
ensure labour stability. We seek to identify and address 
any labour issues that may arise during the period 
covered by the labour agreements and to anticipate any 
potential issues in good time. Employees of our 
contractor companies are an important part of our 
workforce, and under Chilean law fulfil the same duties 
and are subject to the same responsibilities as our own 
employees. We treat contractors as strategic associates 
and build long-term, mutually beneficial relationships 
with them. We maintain constructive relationships with 
our employees and their unions through regular 
communication and consultation. Union representatives 
are regularly involved in discussions about the future  
of the workforce.

Outlook 

Difficulties in finding and retaining talent have 
become a challenge and a cross-cutting risk, which 
is increasing as companies adopt new technologies 
and growth strategies are affected by these new 
competencies, as is the case of Antofagasta.

Therefore, our strategic talent identification and 
management methodology is designed to identify the 
key competencies essential for ensuring the 
sustainability of our business. By identifying and 
developing people, we are empowered to fortify our 
workforce, ensuring they are well-equipped to meet 
and exceed our business goals.

Due to the “40 hours” approval, to understand the 
effect of the reduced working hours on the 
organisation, a pilot was launched to evaluate the 
effectiveness of tasks and processes, team 
experience, workload and work dynamics. Based on 
the lessons learned from the pilot, change 
management will be defined for the organisation.

This year, our Diversity and Inclusion Strategy has 
increased the proportion of our female employees to 
23.6%, 3.2 percentage points higher than in 2022.

Outlook 

Three-year labour agreements were successfully 
negotiated with a supervisor union at Centinela,  
a workers union at Zaldívar, two workers unions at 
Los Pelambres and two workers unions at 
Centinela, all of them in a climate of mutual respect. 
In the case of contractor companies, the settlement 
of collective bargaining agreements were also 
carried out within the expected agreements and 
without conflict or impact for the Antofagasta 
Minerals companies, except for a contractor 
company in Antucoya who held a brief strike but it 
had no impact on operational continuity. In 2023, 
the psychosocial risks survey was carried out in all 
the companies, which is a legal obligation and is 
applied by the Superintendency of Social Security 
of the Ministry of Health. In all companies the 
survey result was “low risk”, which corresponds to 
the best evaluation category of  
the survey.

Outlook 

We had no fatalities during 2023. 

Our lagging indicators continue to fall and were 
below our targets for the year.

This year we began the implementation of the 
"Leadership Programme for Supervisors" with the 
objective of strengthening leadership 
competencies, emphasising the planning process 
and standardisation of critical tasks.

We developed more than 500 Planned Job Safety 
Analyses for our main high risk activities.

Based on our Occupational Health Strategy, we 
strengthened our medical surveillance programme 
with a rigorous follow-up of workers exposed to 
health risk agents and also implemented 
engineering projects to reduce the exposure of 
workers to these agents.

Outlook 

We have continued to strengthen the environmental 
management model, with a deployment plan that 
considers engagement, learning and recognition 
activities for prominent workers or groups within 
the organisation, highlighting the execution of 
three cycles of cross-visible leadership. They 
review the strategic environmental risk among 
operations and the learning cycles established after 
environmental operational events, in order to 
articulate preventive environmental management.

3. HEALTH AND SAFETY

Health and safety incidents 
could result in harm to our 
employees, contractors and 
local communities. Ensuring 
their safety and wellbeing is 
our ethical obligation, and 
one of our core values. 

A poor safety record or a 
serious accident could have 
a long-term impact on 
morale and on our 
reputation and productivity.

Our Safety and Occupational Health Strategy is based 
on four pillars: 

1.  Health and safety risk management: workers at all 

levels are trained to identify hazards and controls, so 
that all jobs are carried out safely.

2. Leadership: all employees and contractors are health 

and safety leaders and we demonstrate our 
commitment through each individual’s responsible 
behaviour.

3. Contractor management: our contractors are an 

integral part of our safety team and safety culture, 
which we work together to improve.

4. Reporting, research and learning from our accidents: 

we share good practices and learn from our 
mistakes.

The Strategy strives to achieve our four main goals: 
zero fatalities, zero occupational illnesses, the 
development of a resilient culture; and the automation 
of hazardous processes.

Leadership visibility and strong use of Job Safety 
Analysis and Yo Digo No (I Say No) tools are part of 
our safety performance.

Critical controls and verification tools are constantly 
strengthened through the verification programme and 
regular audits of critical controls for potential high-risk 
activities.

4. ENVIRONMENTAL MANAGEMENT

An operating incident that 
impacts the environment 
could affect our relationship 
with local stakeholders and 
our reputation, reducing the 
social value we generate. 
We operate in challenging 
environments, including the 
largely agricultural Choapa 
Valley and the Atacama 
Desert, where water 
scarcity is a key issue. 
Environmental issues 
directly related to climate 
change are considered 
under our specific Climate 
Change principal risk.

We have a comprehensive approach to incident 
prevention, aligned with the environmental 
management model applied by our operations and 
projects in progress. Risks are assessed, monitored 
and controlled to achieve our goal of zero events with 
significant environmental impact. We work to raise 
awareness in our employees and contractors by 
providing training to promote operating excellence 
related to the environment in which we operate.  
The potential environmental impact of a project is a 
key consideration when assessing its viability, and we 
encourage the integration of innovative technology  
in the project design to mitigate such impacts.

We prioritise the efficient use of natural resources  
by using sea water, favouring the use of renewable 
power, and achieving higher rates of reuse and 
recovery of water by using thickened tailings 
technology. 

We recognise that environmental performance is key 
to our ability to generate social value and we perform 
regular risk assessments to identify our potential 
impact and develop preventive and mitigating 
strategies. 

Each site regularly updates their environmental 
emergency preparedness and detailed closure plans, 
complying with current legislation and applicable 
international guidelines. In the event of an 
environmental operational event, all appropriate 
control, containment or corrective measures shall  
be taken immediately.

5. CLIMATE CHANGE

The effects of climate 
change have had an 
increasing impact on our 
operations. The drought in 
central Chile is affecting 
water availability at Los 
Pelambres, while higher 
than expected rainfall in the 
northern part of the country 
is impacting the 
infrastructure in the region. 
In addition, the increasing 
severity of sea swells leads 
to delays in the delivery of 
key supply materials and 
the export of our 
concentrates and cathodes.

The Chilean government’s 
increased climate ambitions 
may result in higher 
requirements for 
compliance and operating 
costs.

We are committed to 
contributing to the reduction 
of greenhouse gas 
emissions and water 
scarcity. We do this by 
increasing the amount of 
power and water we obtain 
from renewable and 
sustainable sources.

We recognise that climate change is a threat to human 
life and the planet as we know it today.

We measure and report our Scope 1, 2 and 3 
greenhouse gas emissions and have committed to 
realistic reduction targets through a cost-effective 
decarbonisation roadmap. We continue to seek ways to 
decarbonise our operations and this requires greater 
investment in innovative solutions, including developing 
low-carbon technology, which can increase operating 
costs.

Recognising water scarcity, we are reducing our 
dependence on continental water through more 
efficient water use and the increased use of sea water 
as a proportion of our total water consumption. As 
each phase of the Los Pelambres desalination plant 
construction is completed, the proportion of continental 
water used will decrease, particularly after Phase 2 of 
the project, significantly lowering the potential impact of 
water scarcity on the Group while freeing up water for 
local communities.

We constantly seek to identify risks associated with 
climate change and to implement actions to adapt to 
and mitigate their potential impact, such as increasing 
our stocks of strategic resources. For each risk 
evaluated as “High” or “Extreme” we produce specific 
action plans and strategies.

As part of our regular communication with local 
stakeholders, we discuss the material risks and our 
controls, action plans and related strategies.

6. COMMUNITY RELATIONS

Failure to identify and 
manage local concerns and 
expectations could 
negatively impact the 
Company. Relations with 
local communities and 
stakeholders affect our 
reputation and impede our 
ability to grow and generate 
social value.

We have a dedicated team that establishes and 
maintains relations with local communities. These 
relationships are based on trust and mutual benefit 
throughout the mining lifecycle, from exploration to final 
remediation on closure. We seek to anticipate any 
potentially negative operating impacts and minimise 
these through responsible behaviour. This means 
acting transparently and ethically, prioritising the health 
and safety of our employees and contractors, avoiding 
environmental incidents, promoting dialogue, complying 
with our commitments to stakeholders and establishing 
mechanisms to prevent or address a crisis. These 
steps are undertaken in the early stages of each project 
and continue throughout the life of each operation.

We contribute to the development of communities in 
the areas in which we operate, starting with an 
assessment, undertaken together with the 
communities, of the existing situation and their specific 
needs, while looking to develop long-term, sustainable 
relations and evaluating the impact of our 
contributions. We also focus on developing the 
potential of members of local communities through 
education, training and employment.

We work to communicate clearly and transparently 
with local communities in line with our Community 
Relations Plan. This includes a grievance management 
process, local perception surveys, and local media and 
community engagement.

Outlook 

Our Climate Change Strategy seeks to strengthen 
our capacity to adapt to and mitigate climate 
change. This enables us to take early action to 
manage the resulting risks and opportunities in 
such a way as to mitigate the effects of climate 
change and adapt to new scenarios.

Since April 2022, all our power supply contracts for 
our mining operations are from renewable sources. 
This allowed us to meet the target early of reducing 
Scope 1 and 2 emissions by 30% by 2025 
compared with 2020, equivalent to 730,000 tCO2e.
We also have an ambition of achieving carbon 
neutrality by 2050, or sooner if technology permits. 

In 2023, we established new targets: reducing 
Scope 1 and 2 emissions by 50% by 2035 
compared with 2020, and engaging with the 
industry to achieve a 10% reduction in Scope 3 
emissions by 2030.

Risk level 

Outlook 

We reinforced community programmes related to 
water for human consumption and irrigation to 
mitigate the impact of the drought in the Province 
of Choapa. We seek to stimulate the generation of 
economic, social and human capital in the regions 
where we operate by promoting local employment, 
fostering local suppliers and offering education and 
training opportunities. We run various programmes 
to support local entrepreneurs and micro and small 
businesses. We have launched a community 
grievance mechanism management system to 
report any issues caused by our operations on 
neighbouring communities. Concerns can be made 
confidentially and are tracked to monitor their 
progress. We made progress in measuring the 
impact of our social programmes deployed in the 
territory. With the measurements carried out, we 
have addressed the most relevant projects and 
programmes of all the Group's companies, which 
has allowed us to develop improvement plans 
aimed at optimising the performance of the 
initiatives and the social value of our operations  
in the territory.

7. POLITICAL, LEGAL AND REGULATORY

Political instability could 
affect our operations, 
projects and exploration 
activities in the countries in 
which we operate. Issues 
regarding the granting of 
permits, or amendments to 
permits already granted, 
and changes to the legal 
environment or regulations, 
could also adversely affect 
our operations and 
development projects.

We constantly monitor political, legal and regulatory 
developments affecting our operations and projects. 

We comply fully with existing laws, regulations, 
licences, permits and rights in each of the countries  
in which we operate.

We assess political risk as part of our evaluation of 
potential projects, including the nature of any foreign 
investment agreements.

We monitor proposed changes in government policies 
and regulations, particularly in Chile, and belong to 
several associations that engage with governments  
on these matters. This helps to improve our internal 
processes and means that we are prepared to meet 
any new regulatory requirements.

8. CORRUPTION

Our operations or projects 
around the world could be 
affected by risks related to 
corruption or bribery, 
including operating 
disruptions or delays 
resulting from a refusal to 
make “facilitation 
payments”. The level of 
such risks depends, in part, 
on the economic or political 
stability of the country in 
which we are operating.

We have zero tolerance for any activity that would 
contravene anti-bribery and corruption legislation.  
We maintain a robust governance regime, open 
channels of communication, Group-wide training 
programmes, and multiple layers of controls at all our 
operations, projects and exploration activities, as well 
as in our third-party relationships using enhanced due 
diligence procedures. 

A strong, appropriate culture is one of the key aspects 
of the Group’s strategic framework. This is 
emphasised by messaging from the Board downwards 
that inappropriate, corrupt, illegal or unethical 
behaviour is totally unacceptable. The Group’s Code 
of Ethics sets out the Group’s commitment to 
conducting business in a responsible and sustainable 
manner. The Code requires honesty, integrity and 
accountability from all employees and contractors.  
Our Compliance Model is set to prevent actions which 
may involve us directly or indirectly in any potential 
irregularities (including any kind of bribery), detect 
possible risks in a timely fashion and respond to any 
misconduct in an adequate manner. Internal policies, 
procedures and controls have been implemented 
to prevent corruption. 

An anonymous whistleblowing hotline is available 
to employees and external parties to report 
compliance-related concerns, which are investigated 
and followed-up by an expert team and reviewed 
by a senior management Ethics Committee.

Risk appetite 

Risk level 

Outlook 

We see a lower degree of political uncertainty in 
Chile. After the rejection of the new constitution 
draft proposed last December, the current 
constitution will remain in force. Government has 
announced that it will not pursue new constitutional 
reform within its term.

During 2023, the new Chilean mining royalty bill 
was enacted, providing certainty on the new royalty 
tax framework. Companies without tax stability 
agreements start their new royalty payments 
during 2024. Those payments will increase the 
Group’s consolidated effective tax rate by c.5 
percentage points.

In August, a new “Ley de Delitos Económicos” 
(Economic Crimes Law) was enacted in Chile. This 
new law establishes a new legal regime applicable 
to individuals and legal entities (companies); 
however, changes applicable to legal entities will 
come into force in September 2024. Although we 
are confident that we have robust controls in place 
we have reassessed and are updating our risk 
matrix, in order to identify any improvement we 
can make in our controls, with the main focus 
being on new environmental crimes.

The Group continues supporting some Chilean 
industry associations, particularly the Consejo 
Minero (Mining Council) and SONAMI in its 
representation of the mining industry and its 
responses to proposed new regulations. 

Risk appetite 

Risk level 

Outlook 

The Group’s Compliance Model applies to both 
employees and contractors. It is clearly defined and 
is communicated regularly through internal 
channels, as well as being available on the Group’s 
website. New employees are trained in the 
Compliance Model as part of their induction 
programme. The Group’s Crime Prevention Model 
ensures compliance with anti-bribery and 
anti-corruption laws in the United Kingdom and 
Chile and is certified by an external entity. In 
August, a new "Ley de Delitos Económicos" 
(Economic Crimes Law) was enacted and will 
come into force in September 2024. Although we 
are confident that we have effective controls in 
place, we have reassessed our risk matrix and the 
Compliance Model and they are being updated 
considering the new risk matrix.

Description

Preventive and mitigation measures

Highlights

9. OPERATIONS

Our operations are subject 
to a number of 
circumstances not wholly 
within our control. These 
include damage to or 
breakdown of equipment 
or infrastructure, 
unexpected geological 
variations, or technical 
issues, any of which could 
adversely affect production 
and/or costs.

10. TAILINGS STORAGE

Ensuring the stability of our 
tailings storage facilities 
(TSFs) during their entire 
lifecycle is central to how 
we operate. A failure or 
collapse of any of our TSFs 
could result in fatalities, 
damage to the environment, 
regulatory violations, 
reputational damage and 
disruption of the quality of 
life of neighbouring 
communities, as well as the 
running of our operations.

Principal risks relating to each operation are identified as 
part of the regular risk review processes they undertake. 
This process also identifies mitigation measures for such 
risks. Monthly reports to the Board provide variance 
analysis of operating and financial performance, allowing 
potential issues to be identified in good time and any 
necessary monitoring or control activities to be 
implemented to prevent unplanned downtime. Our focus is 
on maximising the availability of equipment and 
infrastructure and ensuring the effective use of our assets 
in line with their design capability and technical limits. We 
keep the variation of processes within defined tolerance 
limits, and we have Business Continuity and Disaster 
Recovery Plans for all key processes within our operations 
to mitigate the consequences of a crisis or natural disaster. 
We also have property damage and business interruption 
insurance to provide protection from some, although not 
all, of the costs that may arise from such events.

We manage our TSFs to allow the effectiveness of their 
design, operation and closure to be monitored at the 
highest level of the Company. All our TSFs are built using 
the downstream construction method and are designed 
to withstand earthquakes and extreme weather.

Catastrophic failures of TSFs are unacceptable. Their 
potential for failure is evaluated and addressed 
throughout the life of each facility. Our TSFs are 
constantly monitored, and all relevant information is 
provided to the authorities, regulating bodies and the 
communities that could be affected. We manage our TSFs 
using data, modelling, and construction and operating 
methods validated and recorded by qualified technical 
teams and reviewed by independent international experts, 
whose recommendations we implement to strengthen the 
control environment. Risk management includes timely 
risk identification, control definition and verification. Our 
controls are based on the consequences of the potential 
failure of the tailings facilities.

11. STRATEGIC RESOURCES

Disruption or restriction  
of the supply of any of our 
key strategic inputs, such 
as electricity, water, fuel, 
sulphuric acid or mining 
equipment, could 
negatively impact 
production. 

In the longer term, 
restrictions to the 
availability of key strategic 
resources, such as water 
and electricity could also 
affect our growth 
opportunities.

Contingency plans are in place to address any short-term 
disruptions to strategic resources and maintain our 
security of supply. We negotiate early with suppliers of 
key inputs to ensure continuity. Certain key supplies are 
purchased from several sources to mitigate potential 
disruption arising from exposure to a single supplier.

To achieve cost competitiveness, we endeavour to buy 
the highest possible proportion of our key inputs, such as 
fuel and tyres, on as variable a price basis as possible and 
to link costs to underlying commodity indices where this 
option exists.

We maintain a rigorous, risk-based supplier management 
framework to ensure that we engage solely with 
reputable product and service providers, keeping in place 
the controls necessary to ensure the traceability of all 
supplies (including the avoidance of any conduct related 
to modern slavery).

We are committed to incorporating sustainable 
technological and innovative solutions, such as the use of 
sea water and renewable power when economically 
viable, to mitigate exposure to potentially scarce 
resources.

Outlook 

Lessons learned from previous cases of community 
concern have improved the resilience of our 
operations and minimised the impact of incidents this 
year. Many years of drought at Los Pelambres has 
reduced production in recent years. This climate 
change impact is being mitigated with the 
desalination plant in Los Pelambres, which came into 
operation with its commissioning during 2023. The 
fourth concentrator line at Los Pelambres is 
successfully completing its commissioning phase, 
with an additional two million tonnes of ore 
processed as of the end of the year.

Risk level 

Outlook 

The Global Industry Standard on Tailings 
Management (GISTM) was published in 2020. We 
are implementing this standard at all our 
operations. Our El Mauro and Centinela TSFs are 
in compliance with this standard (based on 
self-assessment) since August 2023. Our 2021 
tailings policy sets out the guiding principles for 
the management of our TSFs and any potential or 
actual impact on the environment, using sound 
governance and open communication with 
stakeholders. In accordance with this standard, we 
continue to update our risk assessment methods, 
focusing on more detailed risk identification, 
failure modes and controls, in order to avoid 
catastrophic failures.

Risk appetite 

Risk level 

Outlook 

The war in Ukraine is an issue that currently has 
no material impact on the supply of our key inputs, 
however, it is something that must continue to be 
monitored.

Thanks to our stock policy and that of our suppliers, 
the impact of the issues in the navigation channels 
(“Canal de Panamá” and “Canal de Suez”) was 
prevented or mitigated, resulting in almost no impact.

The exposure related to water scarcity at Los 
Pelambres due to the drought is being mitigated with 
the desalination plant that came into operation with 
its commissioning during 2023.

We worked closely with the Vigilance Board for the 
Choapa River to establish a water redistribution 
agreement that is now awaiting approval by the 
General Directorate of Water of the Ministry of Public 
Works. Our joint approach has focused on avoiding 
disputes and conflicts around this vital resource.

Minera Zaldívar submitted an EIA application that 
includes a plan to change the mine’s water source 
from the local aquifer to either sea water or water 
provided by third parties by 2028.

Preventive and mitigation measures

Highlights

Our Information Security Management Model provides 
defensive structural controls to prevent cyber risks and 
mitigate their effects. It employs a set of rules and 
procedures, including a Disaster Recovery Plan, to 
restore critical IT functions in the event of an attack. 

Our systems are regularly audited to identify any 
potential weaknesses or threats to our assets, and 
specific systems are in place to protect them and our 
data.

Risk appetite 

Risk level 

Outlook 

We have further strengthened our protective 
controls and regularly communicate with users to 
prevent cyber attacks. 

To reinforce our controls we organised “ethical 
phishing” and “ethical hacking” exercises during 
the year. A cyber security e-learning was launched 
for all employees, and some prevention activities 
were also implemented in operating companies.

12. CYBER SECURITY

Breaches in, or failures of, 
our information security 
management could 
adversely impact our 
business activities. 
Malicious interventions 
(hacking) of our information 
or operations’ networks 
could affect our reputation 
and/or operational 
continuity.

13. LIQUIDITY

Restrictions in financing 
sources available for future 
growth could prevent us 
from taking advantage of 
growth or other 
opportunities in the market.

Security, liquidity and return are the order of priorities 
for our treasury investment strategy. We maintain a 
strong and flexible balance sheet, consistently returning 
capital to shareholders while leaving sufficient funds to 
progress our short-, medium- and long-term growth 
plans. This gives us the financial flexibility to take 
advantage of opportunities as they may arise.

We have a risk-averse investment strategy, managing 
our liquidity by maintaining adequate cash reserves and 
a revolving credit facilities through the periodic review 
of forecast and actual cash flows. We choose to hold 
surplus cash in demand or term deposits or highly 
liquid investments.

14. COMMODITY PRICES AND EXCHANGE RATES

Our results are heavily 
dependent on commodity 
prices – principally those of 
copper and, to a lesser 
extent, gold and 
molybdenum. The prices of 
these commodities are 
influenced by many external 
factors, including world 
economic growth, inventory 
balances, industry supply 
and demand, possible 
substitution, etc. Our sales 
are mainly denominated in 
US dollars, although some 
of our operating costs are 
in Chilean pesos, and any 
strengthening of the Chilean 
peso may negatively affect 
our financial results.

We consider exposure to commodity price fluctuations 
an integral part of our business and our usual policy is 
to sell our products at prevailing market prices. We 
monitor commodity markets closely to determine the 
effect of price fluctuations on earnings, capital 
expenditure and cash flows. Very occasionally, when 
we feel it is appropriate, we use derivative instruments 
to manage our exposure to commodity price 
fluctuations. 

We run our business plans under various commodity 
price scenarios and develop contingency plans as 
required. As copper exports account for near 50% of 
Chile’s exports, there is a strong correlation between 
the copper price and the US dollar/Chilean peso 
exchange rate. This natural hedge partly mitigates our 
foreign exchange exposure. However, we monitor the 
foreign exchange markets and the macroeconomic 
variables that affect them and occasionally implement a 
focused currency-hedging programme to reduce short-
term exposure to fluctuations in the US dollar against 
the Chilean peso.

Risk appetite 

Risk level 

Outlook 

We maintained our solid balance sheet and 
financing ratios, safeguarding our capability to raise 
debt. 

We have focused on diversifying our sources of 
funding, retaining a high level of interest from 
financial institutions offering to provide finance on 
competitive terms. 

During 2023, we executed debt transactions and 
included new lenders, diversifying the sources and 
term of our debt financing.

Risk appetite 

Risk level 

Outlook 

The divergence in the management of monetary 
policies between Chile and the US during the year, 
as well as the expectation of interest rate 
differentials between the two countries, often 
outweighed the typical correlation between the 
copper price and the US dollar/Chilean peso 
exchange rate. 

No new hedging positions were entered into during 
2023.

15. GROWTH OF MINERAL RESOURCE BASE AND OPPORTUNITIES

Risk appetite 

Risk level 

Outlook 

Our exploration activities continued to be focused 
on the Americas and our risk exposure level was 
unchanged. During 2023, three new exploration 
joint ventures with companies with interests 
in Peru were signed. 

The Company announced in December 2023 that, 
through a wholly owned subsidiary, it had entered 
into transactions in the secondary market to 
acquire beneficial ownership of approximately 19% 
of the outstanding shares of Compañía de Minas 
Buenaventura S.A.A. (“Buenaventura”). 
Buenaventura is Peru’s largest, publicly traded 
precious and base metals company and a major 
holder of mining rights in Peru.

Twin Metals’ exploration plan obtained all 
necessary state approvals in October 2023. 
The goal of this exploration activity is to better 
understand our mineral resources and our 
potential to contribute critical minerals to support 
the transition to a clean energy future. For further 
information on Twin Metals, please see page 101 
of this report.

Risk appetite 

Risk level 

Outlook 

Our projects are developed in accordance with 
the practices set out in our Asset Delivery 
System (ADS), including the Functional Quality 
Assurance Review (FQAR), and are reviewed by 
external experts.

Project risks are proactively managed and 
frequently evaluated to minimise their impact on 
costs. 

Project estimates include a contingency provision, 
calculated using a probability-based method that 
considers the systemic and specific risks of each 
project.

The risks associated with converting mineral 
resources to reserves are properly identified and 
managed by the teams to ensure accurate 
conversion.

Our exploration and investment strategy prioritises 
exploration and investment in the Americas. To reduce 
our risk exposure, we focus on growth opportunities 
in stable and secure countries. 

Our rigorous assessment processes evaluate and 
determine the risks associated with all potential 
business acquisitions and exploration opportunities, 
including stress-test scenarios conducted for sensitivity 
analysis. Each assessment includes a country risk 
analysis (including corruption) and analysis of our 
ability to operate in a new jurisdiction. 

At the very least, all joint ventures must operate in line 
with, or to the equivalent level of, our policies and 
technical standards. 

Our Business Development Committee reviews 
potential opportunities and transactions, approving or 
recommending them within authority levels set by the 
Board.

We need to identify new 
mineral resources to 
ensure continued future 
growth. We do this through 
exploration and acquisition.
We may fail to identify 
attractive acquisition 
opportunities or select 
inappropriate targets. The 
long-term commodity price 
forecast, and other 
assumptions used when 
assessing potential projects 
and other investment 
opportunities, will influence 
the forecast return of 
investments. Incorrect 
estimates could cause poor 
decision-making. Regarding 
exploration, there is a risk 
that we may not identify 
sufficient viable mineral 
resources.

16. PROJECT DEVELOPMENT AND EXECUTION

Failure to effectively 
manage our development 
projects or transform our 
resources into reserves 
could result in delays to the 
start of production and cost 
overruns. 

Delays on information 
capture and/or not 
achieving required enablers 
could limit the conversion of 
resources into reserves.

We have a project management system to ensure that 
best practices are applied at each phase of a project’s 
development. The project management system 
provides a common language and standards to support 
the decision-making process by balancing risk with the 
benefits of growth. In addition, all geometallurgical 
models are reviewed by independent experts.

During the project development lifecycle, quality checks 
for each of the standards applied are carried out by a 
panel of experts from within the Company. This panel 
reviews each completed feasibility study to assess the 
technical and commercial viability of the project. It also 
assesses how the project can be developed safely and 
considers any relevant risks or opportunities that could 
potentially impact the schedule, cost or future 
performance of the project.

Detailed progress reports on current projects are 
regularly reviewed and include assessments of 
progress against key project milestones and 
performance against budget.

Project robustness is stress-tested under a range of 
copper price scenarios. Joint project/operation teams 
are established early in a project’s development to 
ensure a smooth transition into the operating phase 
once construction is completed.

All new reserves and growth projects must comply 
with our internal procedures and all applicable 
environmental and social laws and regulations.

17. INNOVATION AND DIGITALISATION

Our ability to deliver on our 
strategy and our 
performance targets may 
be undermined by missed 
opportunities or delays in 
adopting new technologies 
or innovations.

We seek value-capturing innovations that realise cost 
savings and/or improve the efficiency, reliability and 
safety of our processes while supporting our corporate 
strategic pillars. We evaluate the potential of all ideas 
using our stage-gate approval process and Innovation 
Board. 

We maintain partnerships with academic institutions 
and companies specialising in technology and 
engineering – including peers, when there is no 
competitive barrier – to maximise the potential for 
improvements in our processes and systems. A 
dedicated team monitors, identifies and analyses 
external innovation trends that have potential 
applications in our business, including those in 
non-operational areas such as product sales and 
purchasing. The team also maintains and manages a 
portfolio of ongoing innovation projects. 

We have a recognition and incentives programme to 
encourage all staff to suggest innovative improvements 
to our day-to-day operating systems. We also dedicate 
resources to evaluating and implementing innovations 
which have the potential to positively impact our 
business and growth options.

18. EXTERNAL RISKS

We must develop the ability 
to manage external threats 
that are complex to predict 
and can significantly impact 
the Group’s strategic 
objectives and its 
operational continuity.

Changes in the global or Chilean economic or political 
environment can impact the Group’s strategy.

We maintain good practices and adopt lessons learned 
during periods of crisis.

We recognise the volatility of the markets and proactively 
seek new business models and work to expand our 
client base.

We regularly review our Business Continuity Plan.

We use scenario analysis to challenge the principles on 
which we base our financial planning, identifying 
potential risks, costs and benefits of feasible action plans.

Outlook 

As part of our Remote Operating and Autonomy 
Roadmap, Antucoya has successfully concluded the 
execution phase and deployed into production the 
remote operation of their spreader, currently 
operating the system. In Zaldívar, the last testing 
stage was concluded for the teleoperation in Line of 
Sight mode of their drilling rigs, and we are 
currently processing the permit to operate with 
Sernageomin. Los Pelambres will deploy a robotic 
solution in performing the liner replacement of their 
SAG mill, with the corresponding equipment 
expected to be on site by March next year.

Centinela's Integrated Remote Operations Centre 
(IROC) in the city of Antofagasta has run effectively 
in its second year of operation. It enables 
management of the plant and the mine remotely, 
with real-time information and optimisation of all 
processes. Los Pelambres' IROC is located in 
Santiago and has been operating for one year, 
completing critical milestones for remote and 
integrated operation along the entire value chain.

A successful heap heating pilot was conducted 
during 2023 in Zaldívar, enhancing the operational 
readiness of our Cuprochlor®-T technology.

We are currently engaged in a range of operational 
recommendation and optimisation initiatives, 
complementing previously developed and 
successfully deployed solutions across the 
production value chain, as part of our SIRO 
programme, to enable better and data driven 
automated decision making. Some of the tools 
developed to date cover Flotation Optimisers, Milling 
Recommendations, Mineral Tracking and Advanced 
Maintenance.

Risk level 

Outlook 

The controls for this risk were updated to 
incorporate lessons learned during the year, such as 
the geographical diversification of our suppliers, and 
the increase in our stocks of strategic resources, 
where the contingencies we had during 2023 were 
mitigated without having major impacts on the 
operation.

During 2023, our Business Continuity Plan was 
updated in the Mining and Transport division.

Emerging Risks
In addition to our principal risks, we are constantly on the lookout for emerging risks that may become new principal risks in the future. 
Current emerging risks are:

Emerging risk

Geoeconomic confrontation

Commodity substitution

Widespread cyber crime and cyber security

Impact

Geoeconomic confrontation with impact on the logistics chain and Commodities market.

Lower demand for copper producing sustained oversupply in the medium-long term 
due, to a substitute product impacting the business strategy to date.

Global or regional cyber crime with critical infrastructure breakdown impacting 
operational continuity.

The above risks are closely monitored and actively managed to minimise their threat.

Areas of focus and development during 2023

• 

In August, the “Ley de Delitos Económicos” (Economic Crimes Law) 
was published. This legislation, which establishes a new legal 
regime applicable to natural persons (individuals) and another to 
legal entities (companies), will come into force in September 2024. 
Although we have robust controls in place, we will reassess the 
group risk matrix in order to identify the need for any new controls 
or adjustments in current controls, with more focus on 
environmental areas.

•  A proven due diligence process is in place, based on a risk analysis 

approach.

•  The Company’s Crime Prevention Model was recertified by an 

independent expert. 

•  As part of the “Suppliers for a Better Future” initiative, the 
Compliance team trained 150+ supplier representatives on 
respectful workplaces and sound compliance practices.

•  Whistleblowing investigations, undertaken by a group of experts, 
were centralised and standardised, guaranteeing an independent 
process.

•  The consultation process for revisions to the UK Corporate 

Governance Code was closely monitored. The updated Code, which 
was published in January 2024, introduces a new requirement 
(applicable from 2026 onwards) for the Board to make an annual 
declaration as to the effectiveness of the Group’s material internal 
controls. A readiness assessment was undertaken and action plans 
were established in respect of the anticipated changes.

•  Employees in high-risk areas completed additional in-depth training 

Code of Ethics

on ethics and compliance.

•  New employees were trained in the Compliance Model and Code of 

Ethics as part of their induction programme.

•  All employees updated their conflict-of-interest disclosures.
•  A campaign “let’s talk about integrity” was launched with a 

large-scale communication related to respect, health and safety, and 
environmental management.

•  Anti-corruption events took place at all our operations to reinforce 

compliance with our integrity values.

•  The Compliance team have been part of the approval process for 
social contributions, to strengthen monitoring and governance. 
•  The Compliance and Supply teams have started to invite their 
vendors to self-assess on the external platform and identify 
improvement opportunities from a sustainability perspective.

•  A communication campaign was carried out as part of our focus on 

Prevention in our Compliance Model.

This sets out our commitment to conducting business in a responsible 
and sustainable manner. The Code requires honesty, integrity and 
accountability from all employees and contractors, and includes 
guidelines for identifying and managing potential conflicts of interest. 
It is at the core of our Compliance Model and supports the 
implementation of all related activities.

Our Code of Ethics is available on our website.

Compliance Model

The Compliance Model applies to both our employees and our 
contractors. It is clearly defined and is communicated regularly 
through internal channels as well as being available on our website. All 
contracts include clauses relating to ethics, modern slavery and crime 
prevention to ensure contractors’ adherence to our Compliance Model.

We actively promote open communication with all our employees, 
contractors and local communities. This helps ensure that our 
corporate and value creation objectives are achieved in an ethical and 
honest way.

86

Antofagasta plc  Annual Report 2023

STRATEGIC REPORTThe Compliance Model is reviewed regularly, both internally and by 
third parties, and on corruption-related matters it is certified in 
accordance with Chilean anti-corruption legislation.

The Model has three pillars:

Prevention: Its main focus is to prevent the occurrence of any 
irregular or illegal situations. We provide a series of tools and training 
opportunities to all employees and contractors to support appropriate 
behaviour through:

• 

Internal policies and procedures

•  Anti-trust guidelines
•  The management and update of our Compliance Risk Matrix
•  Our robust due diligence processes
•  Anti-corruption clauses in suppliers’ and employees’ contracts
•  Compliance training and communication
•  Access Control and Governance, Risk and Compliance (GRC) tools 

are used as part of our segregation of duties controls

Detection: Detection of any potentially irregular or illegal situation is 
boosted by:

•  Robust and open whistleblowing channels where individuals can 

present complaints and grievances anonymously in a context of our 
non-retaliation policy

•  Data analysis
•  Anti-corruption internal controls
•  Normative instruments, such as internal policies, procedures or 

guidelines, which are continually reviewed
Internal audit

• 

Action: Immediate action is taken if an irregular or illegal situation is 
detected, and we investigate according to our internal procedures 
using fact-based, objective and professional standards. An Ethics 
Committee, which includes members of the senior management team, 
reviews the findings of every investigation and suggests remediation 
plans. The performance of the compliance programme is reported 
twice a year to the Audit and Risk Committee and to the Board. The 
anonymity of the whistleblowing channels is guaranteed to safeguard 
individuals and so achieve greater transparency and bolster our 
non-retaliation policy.

During the year, we received 609 allegations. Of these, 186 (31%) 
were ethics related and 423 (69%) were non-ethical concerns. The 
ethical allegations were classified as: 77.5% (144) fraud; conflicts of 
interest, and other misconduct; 22% (41) workplace and sexual 
harassment; 0.5% (1) regulatory non-compliance; and 0% (0) modern 
slavery. Remediation actions were defined and implemented for all 
substantiated allegations.

Our Crime Prevention Model ensures compliance with anti-bribery 
and anti-corruption laws in the United Kingdom and Chile, and is 
certified by an external entity.

Due diligence highlights

During the year, 6,110 suppliers were reviewed, of which 1.3% were 
rejected. Of these 97% were Chilean suppliers and 3% were 
international. The reasons for rejection were mainly due to high 
financial or tax risk, non-compliance with Group guidelines or 
non-compliance with Law 20.393 (Criminal Responsibility 
of Legal Entities).

Viability statement

To address the requirements of provision 31 of the 2018 UK Corporate Governance Code, 
the Directors have assessed the prospects of the Group over a period of five years. 

Mining is a long-term business and timescales can run into decades. 
The Group maintains Life-of-Mine models covering the full 
remaining mine life for each mining operation. More detailed 
medium-term planning is completed for a five-year time horizon 
(as well as very detailed annual budgets). Accordingly, five years 
has been selected as the appropriate period over which to assess 
the prospects of  the Group. 

The Directors have assessed the principal risks which could impact 
the prospects of the Group over this period, and consider the most 
relevant to be risks to the copper price outlook, as this is the factor 
most likely to result in significant volatility in earnings and cash 
generation. Robust down-side sensitivity analyses have been 
performed in relation to the scenarios described above, assessing 
the standalone impact of each of:

When taking account of the impact of the Group’s current position 
on this viability assessment, the Directors have considered in particular 
its financial position, including its significant balance of cash, cash 
equivalents and liquid investments and the terms and remaining 
durations of the borrowing facilities in place. The Group had a strong 
financial position as at 31 December 2023, with combined cash, cash 
equivalents and liquid investments of $2,919.4 million. Total borrowings 
were $4,079.2 million, resulting in a net debt position of $1,159.8 
million. Of the total borrowings, only 22% is repayable within one year, 
and 16% repayable between one and two years. 25% of the 
borrowings are repayable after more than five years, beyond the 
viability review period.

When assessing the prospects of the Group, the Directors have 
considered the Group’s copper price forecasts, the Group’s expected 
production levels, operating cost profile and capital expenditure. These 
forecasts are based on the Group’s budgets and Life-of-Mine models, 
which are also used when assessing relevant accounting estimates, 
including depreciation, deferred stripping and closure provisions, and 
accounting judgements including potential indicators of impairment. 
The copper price forecasts are based on consensus analyst forecasts, 
and include a long-term copper price forecast of $3.70/lb.

One scenario analysed as part of this assessment has only considered 
existing committed borrowing facilities in place as of 31 December 
2023, and has not assumed that any new borrowing facilities will be 
put in place. Given the planned financing for the Centinela Second 
Concentrator project was not in place as at 31 December 2023, we 
have not included the planned development of that project within this 
scenario. As an additional scenario, we have forecast the impact of the 
development of this project, which assumes a typical financing 
environment which allows us to put in place our planned financing for 
the project. In addition, we have also modelled sensitivities reflecting 
the impact of potential overruns in the project costs.

The forecasts have assumed distributions in line with the Group’s 
policy that the total annual dividend for each year would represent 
a payout ratio based on underlying net earnings (as defined in the 
Alternative Performance Measures section) for that year of at 
least 35%.

•  A significant deterioration in the future copper price forecasts by  
an average of approximately 15% throughout the five-year period.

•  An even more pronounced short-term reduction of 50 c/lb in  
the copper price for a period of three months, in addition to the 
above general deterioration in the copper price throughout the 
review period.

•  The potential impact of the Group’s most significant individual 

operational risks materialising.

•  A shutdown of any one of the Group’s operations for a period of 
three months, or a shutdown of all of the Group’s operations for  
a period of one month.

The stability of tailings storage facilities represents a potentially 
significant operational risk for mining operations globally. The Group’s 
tailings storage facilities are designed to international standards, 
constructed using downstream methods, subject to rigorous 
monitoring and reporting, and reviewed regularly by an international 
panel of independent experts. Given these standards of design, 
development, operations and review, the impact of a potential tailings 
dam failure has not been included in the sensitivity analysis.

The above downside sensitivity analyses indicated results which could 
be managed in the normal course of business, including the aggregate 
impact of a number of the above sensitivities occurring at the same 
time. The analysis indicated that the Group is expected to remain in 
compliance with all of the covenant requirements of its borrowings 
throughout the review period and retain sufficient liquidity. Based on 
their assessment of the Group’s prospects and viability, the Directors 
confirm that they have a reasonable expectation that the Group will be 
able to continue in operation and meet its liabilities as they fall due over 
the next five years.

STRATEGIC REPORTCapital expenditure

Capital expenditure was $897 million, including $193 million of mine 
development, $361 million of sustaining capital expenditure and $344 
million of development capital expenditure.

Outlook for 2024
The forecast production for 2024 is 335–350,000 tonnes of copper, 
8,5–9,500 tonnes of molybdenum and 45–55,000 ounces of gold. 
Higher production is expected due to higher throughput, with 
increased water availability and ore processing capacity with the Los 
Pelambres Phase 1 Expansion ramping up. 

Cash costs before by-product credits are forecast to be approximately 
$2.05/lb and net cash costs $1.35/lb, reflecting higher production, 
offset by lower expected grades.

2023 Performance

Operating performance

Production at Los Pelambres increased in 2023 as a result of 
increased water availability following the completion of construction of 
the Company’s desalination plant during the year, and subsequent 
ramp up. 

EBITDA was $1,725 million, compared with $1,473 million in 2022, 
reflecting higher production and sales volumes, and higher realised 
prices for copper and by-products. 

Production 

Copper production for 2023 was 300,300 tonnes, 9% higher than the 
prior year. This increase was driven by increased throughput rates in 
2023, which resulted from increasing availability of water from the 
Company’s desalination plant as it successfully progresses its ramp up, 
and additional ore processing capacity provided by the fourth 
concentrator line. Molybdenum production in 2023 was 8,100 tonnes, 
representing a 13% increase year-on-year, which was the result of 
higher throughput rates. Gold production in 2023 rose by 0.5%, 
reflecting a balance of lower gold grades and higher ore processing 
rates.

Cash costs

For the full year, cash costs before by-product credits were $1.92/lb, 
4% higher than in 2022. The key drivers behind this increase in 2023 
are appreciation of the Chilean peso, local inflation, and the conclusion 
of 3-year labour agreements, partially offset by higher production and 
lower input costs. 

Net cash costs were $1.14/lb for the full year, 4% higher than in 2022, 
reflecting a similar increase in the underlying cash costs and higher 
production and pricing for molybdenum.

STRATEGIC REPORTCapital expenditure

Capital expenditure was $1,045 million, including $569 million of mine 
development, $310 million of sustaining capital expenditure and $166 
million of development capital expenditure.

Outlook for 2024
Production is forecast at 225–240,000 tonnes of copper, 150–
160,000 ounces of gold and 2.5–3,000 tonnes of molybdenum. Copper 
production is expected to decrease compared with 2023 as a result of 
lower grades at Centinela Concentrates during the year. 

Cash costs before by-product credits are forecast to be approximately 
$2.30/lb, with net cash costs of $1.45/lb.

2023 Performance

Operating performance

Ore throughput remained consistent in 2023 with levels seen in the 
previous year, with operations maintaining a strong level of operational 
performance in line with the plant’s design capacity for the entire year. 
Higher production at Centinela Concentrates, driven by improved ore 
grade, was counterbalanced by lower ore grades at Centinela 
Cathodes.

EBITDA at Centinela was $1,219 million in 2023, compared with $1,157 
million in 2022, on higher copper, molybdenum and gold sales volumes 
and higher molybdenum and gold realised prices partially offset by 
higher unit costs.

Production 

In 2023, copper production was 242,000 tonnes, 2% lower than last 
year. This reduction in output reflects lower ore grades at Centinela 
Cathodes, which was partially offset by higher ore grades at Centinela 
Concentrates.

Production of copper in concentrate was 162,700 tonnes, 9% higher 
than in 2022, reflecting a combination of higher ore grades and copper 
recoveries, with the concentrator operating in line with its design 
capacity. Copper cathode production was 79,300 tonnes, 19% lower 
than in 2022 due to lower copper grades, offset by higher throughput 
rates. Gold production during the year was 165,800 ounces, 24% 
higher than in 2022 due to higher gold grades (which are positively 
correlated to copper grades). Molybdenum production in 2023 reached 
2,900 tonnes – a record for Centinela, with this year-on-year increase 
of 21% reflecting higher molybdenum recoveries during the year.

Cash costs

Cash costs before by-product credits in 2023 were $2.57/lb, 5.3% 
higher than in 2022 due to lower copper production, the conclusion of 
3-year labour agreements and higher contractor costs related to 
mining.

By-product credits were $0.94/lb, 25c/lb higher than in 2022 due to 
higher production and pricing of both gold and molybdenum.

During the full year, net cash costs were $1.63/lb, 12c/lb lower than 
2022 due to higher by-product credits.

Operating performance

Antucoya continues to operate in line with its design throughput, 
sustaining the consistent performance and improved reliability that 
was achieved in the previous period. 

EBITDA was $215 million in 2023, compared with $261 million in 
2022, reflecting higher operating costs and the lower realised copper 
price.

Production 

Production for the full year was 77,800 tonnes, 1.8% lower than last 
year due to a combination of marginally lower ore grades and 
recoveries. 

Cash costs

Costs during the full year were 5% higher at $2.63/lb, reflecting local 
inflation, appreciation of the Chilean peso, higher consumption rates of 
sulphuric acid in line with expectations, with lower input costs serving 
to partially offset these effects.

Capital expenditure

Capital expenditure was $122 million, including $88 million on

2023 Performance

Operating performance

During the year, a range of operational initiatives continued to be 
implemented, in light of the operational challenges faced in 2022, with an 
improvement in copper recoveries seen during 2023 as a result. The 
Company’s operating teams are implementing an operational improvement 
programme aimed at increasing productivity and throughput rates at 
Zaldívar, given throughput levels were lower than expected in 2023, 
which are expected to lower cash costs over time. Attributable EBITDA1 
was $87 million compared with $147 million in 2022. 

Production 

Attributable copper production for the year was 40,500 tonnes, 9% 
lower than in 2022 mainly due to lower ore processing rates, which 
were partially mitigated by improved recoveries during the year. 

Cash costs

Cash costs for the full year were $2.95/lb, 23% higher than the 
previous year’s costs due to lower production, local inflation, increased 
costs for maintenance and utilisation of stocks from the prior period. 

Capital expenditure

Attributable capital expenditure in 2023 was $46 million, of which 
$34 million was sustaining capital expenditure. 

1.  Attributable EBITDA reflects the Company’s 50% ownership

Outlook for 2024
Attributable copper production is forecast to be 35–40,000 tonnes 
at a cash cost of approximately $2.95/lb.

Other matters

In June 2023, Zaldívar submitted an EIA application to extend its mining 
and water environmental permits through to 2051. This includes a 
proposal to develop the primary sulphide ore deposit and extend the 
current life-of-mine at an estimated investment over the mine life of $1.2 
billion. It also includes a plan to change the mine’s water source from 
the local aquifer to either sea water or water provided by third parties. 
This is proposed to follow a transition period during which the current 
continental water extraction permit is extended from 2025 to 2028.

In early 2024, approval was received from the authorities for the separate 
DIA (Declaration of Environmental Impact) to extend the mining permit 
and, therefore, align the water and mining permits at Zaldívar. This approval 
ensures that this operation has rights to mine ore and extract water until 
2025. The mine life after 2025 is, therefore, subject to the approval of the EIA.

Zaldívar’s final pit phase, which represents approximately 20% of 
current ore reserves, impacts a portion of Minera Escondida’s mine 
property, as well as infrastructure owned by third parties. Mining of the 
phase will be subject to agreements or easements to access these areas 
and relocate the infrastructure, and related permits. In 2023, Zaldívar 
reached an agreement with Escondida in respect to mining matters and 
certain cost sharing. The current mine plan assumes that the additional 
necessary agreements, easements and permits will be obtained to allow 
the mining of the final pit phase.

Sustainability

The Transport division made significant progress 
in its safety performance in 2023, reducing the 
Lost Time Injury Frequency rate across its 
operations by more than half to 0.9 in 2023 
(2022: 2.2).

In respect of diversity and inclusion, the 
Transport division made further progress in 
2024, with gender diversity in the workforce 
increasing to 23.1% (2022: 19.9%), and the 
percentage of people with disabilities employed 
continues to exceed the legislative requirement 
for 1%, with a figure of 1.4% in 2023 (2022: 
1.4%).

Outlook for 2024
In 2024, the division intends to maintain the 
progress made in 2023, when a number of 
contracts were either awarded or renewed. 
Looking ahead, the division has a robust portfolio 
of projects that we expect will facilitate an 
increase in bulk material transportation volumes. 

Concurrently, the division continues to advance 
its strategy to transform its lands, located in the 
centre of Antofagasta city, from industrial to 
urban use. Remediation works began at the end 
of 2023, marking a significant milestone in this 
development process. Another important 
milestone for 2024 is the arrival of the first 
hydrogen locomotive, which will allow for a 
reduction in CO2 emissions in the coming years.

2023 Performance
The Transport division has continued to refine 
its operational activities through the 
implementation of its Management Model, 
based on five fundamental pillars: operational 
excellence, growth, transformation, 
community, and urban development.

Operating performance

Total transportation volumes in 2023 
remained broadly consistent with those of 
2022, with the 7.1 million tonnes of 
transported material marginally ahead of the 
record set in 2022. EBITDA reached $82 
million, a 2% increase versus 2022, primarily 
due to improvements in the pricing of some 
contracts.

Costs and operating efficiency

The division has implemented various 
operational efficiency improvements, 
optimising costs to ensure long-term 
competitiveness with a continuation of the 
Transport division’s Cost and Competitiveness 
Programme. Through this, we achieved 
significant improvements in cost structure, 
cash flow, and operational standards, with 
cumulative benefits of approximately $6.6 
million over the year.

Growth projects  
and opportunities

Our approach to considered growth means that we focus on value, controlling capital costs and 
optimising production at our existing operations and developing new mining operations to deliver 
production in the future. We achieve this through careful project management and constant 
monitoring of the efficiency of our mines, plants and transport infrastructure.

The Los Pelambres desalination plant and concentrator expansion 
were completed in 2023 and moved forward to operational ramp up, 
contributing to water supply and ore treatment. After an extensive 
review, the construction of the Centinela Second Concentrator Project 
was approved by the end of 2023. Critical path works began 
immediately after announcement, with full construction commencing 
after the execution of definitive project finance documentation during 
Q1 2024.

Los Pelambres Expansion Phase 1

This phase of work was designed to optimise throughput within the 
limits of the existing operating, environmental and water extraction 
permits.

As mining progresses at Los Pelambres, ore hardness will increase. 
The expansion aims to compensate for this, increasing plant 
throughput from its current capacity of 175,000 tonnes of ore per day 
to an average of 190,000 tonnes of ore per day. The Phase 1 
Expansion was divided into two sub-projects: the construction of a 
desalination plant and water pipeline from the coast to the El Mauro 
tailings storage facility, and the expansion of the concentrator plant, 
which includes the installation of an additional SAG mill and ball mill 
and six additional flotation cells.

As of the end of 2023, the desalination plant and the water pipeline 
continued to successfully ramp up, with four million cubic metres 
delivered to the Company’s operations at Los Pelambres. At the 
processing plant, mechanical completion of the concentrator plant 
expansion was successfully achieved in October 2023. As at year end, 
commissioning work is under way with results being consistently 
ahead of schedule and with two million tonnes of additional material 
processed.

Los Pelambres Expansion – Desalination plant expansion

The desalination plant expansion to 800l/s, which is part of the Los 
Pelambres water strategy, required a separate Environmental Impact 
Assessment (EIA). 

This project is designed to contribute to enhancing the resilience 
of Los Pelambres from the future impact of climate change and the 
deteriorating availability of water in the region. The project includes 
the expansion of the desalination plant and the construction of a new 
water pipeline from the El Mauro tailings storage facility to the 
concentrator plant. The project cost will be reported as part of the 
Group’s sustaining capital expenditure. Construction is due to start 
in early 2024 and is expected to be completed in 2027. 

In 2021, Los Pelambres submitted the EIA required for this project, 
which includes the desalination plant expansion and two other 
sustaining capital infrastructure projects: 

1.  The replacement of the concentrate pipeline. The new pipeline will 

follow the route taken by the existing water pipeline from the 
desalination plant to the mine. This revised route for the concentrate 
pipeline will avoid interactions with communities along the Choapa 
Valley, and reduce the risk of unplanned downtime from the existing 
pipeline which has been in operations over 20 years, and is planned 
to be in operation from 2027; and

2. Construction of certain planned enclosures at the El Mauro tailings 

storage facility. 

The Company received approval of the EIA for the above projects in 
late 2023.

The sustaining capital infrastructure projects indicated above will 
commence construction in 2024, which will provide a platform for the 
Phase 2 projects that are outlined below. 

Los Pelambres Expansion Phase 2 – Mine life extension

The current mine life of Los Pelambres is limited by the capacity of the 
El Mauro tailings storage facility, with sufficient storage capacity for a 
further 12 years. This project will require an EIA, with a scope that will 
include increasing the capacity of the El Mauro tailings storage facility, 
additional storage capacity for mine waste at Los Pelambres and any 
water requirement for the enlarged capacity of this operation. This will 
extend the mine’s life by a minimum of 15 additional years, accessing a 
larger portion of Los Pelambres’ six billion tonnes of mineral 
resources. This EIA will also provide for the option to increase 
throughput to 205,000 tonnes of ore per day (from the current 
capacity of 190,000 tonnes of ore per day). 

Key studies on tailings and waste storage capacity have advanced and 
a community consultation is under way. The environmental and social 
studies associated with this project are being prepared, including the 
voluntary public consultation with communities and informative 
engagement with key authorities, which should be submitted to 
evaluation by the relevant authorities in Chile during 2024 as part of 
the EIA application.

activities will further enable Centinela to achieve the development 
potential of its extensive mineral resource base.

Detailed terms and conditions have been substantially completed for 
the option to provide water for Centinela's current and future 
operations, with a third party potentially acquiring the existing water 
supply system and building the new water pipeline expansion.  
A decision to proceed with the planned outsourcing of the water 
supply was announced alongside the execution of definitive project 
finance documents during Q1 2024, subject to the acquiring 
consortium closing its financing.

Twin Metals Minnesota

Twin Metals Minnesota (Twin Metals) is a wholly owned copper, nickel, 
and platinum group metals (PGM) underground mining project, which 
holds copper, nickel/cobalt, and PGM deposits in north-eastern 
Minnesota, United States (US). The planned project is over a portion of 
the total resource and envisages mining and processing 18,000 tonnes 
of ore per day for 25 years to produce three separate concentrates –
copper, nickel/cobalt and PGM. However, further development of the 
current project, as configured, is on hold while litigation takes place to 
challenge several actions taken by the US federal government to deter 
its development.

In 2022, Twin Metals filed a lawsuit in the US District Court for the 
District of Columbia (District Court) challenging the administrative 
actions resulting in the rejection of Twin Metals’ preference right lease 
applications (PRLAs), the cancellation of its federal mining leases 1352 
and 1353, the rejection of its Mine Plan of Operation (MPO), and the 
dismissal of the administrative appeal of the MPO rejection. 
Twin Metals claimed that the government’s actions were arbitrary and 
capricious, contrary to the law, and in violation of its rights. In 
September 2023, following a motion to dismiss filed by the 
government, the District Court dismissed Twin Metals’ claims. In 
November 2023, Twin Metals appealed the District Court’s order to the 
US Court of Appeals for the District of Columbia Circuit. This action is 
pending.

Centinela Second Concentrator

After an extensive review, approval of the construction of the Centinela 
Second Concentrator Project was announced at the end of 2023. 
Following announcement, critical path works began immediately, with 
full construction commencing after the execution of definitive project 
finance documents during Q1 2024.

The project includes the construction of a second concentrator and 
tailings deposit, approximately 7 km from the existing concentrator, to 
take place in two phases. The EIA for both phases was approved by 
the authorities in 2016. Detailed engineering plans and costings were 
updated for Phase 1 of the project and key contracts finalised. 

Following Phase 1, the capacity of the new concentrator will be 95,000 
tonnes of ore per day, producing on average approximately 170,000 
tonnes of copper equivalent (copper, gold and molybdenum) a year 
over the first ten years of operation. This is expected to move 
Centinela towards the first cost quartile of global producers.

The Phase 1 capital cost is $4.4 billion, including the cost of the new 
water supply system. This updated and approved capital cost estimate 
(previously $3.7 billion – announced in August 2022) is based on 
advanced detailed engineering and includes escalation for inflation 
during construction, the estimate of a stronger local currency against 
the US dollar, updates to local labour regulations and additional 
contingency provisions. The phasing of the project’s capital 
expenditure is expected to be weighted towards 2025, with similar 
expenditures in adjacent years. The estimate includes a concentrator 
plant, capitalised stripping, mining equipment, a new tailings storage 
facility, a water pipeline and other infrastructure, pre-commercial 
production operating costs, and owner’s and other costs.

Phase 2 is an optional growth step and work on this phase will only 
start once construction of Phase 1 is completed and it is operating 
successfully. 

The second concentrator (and its potential Phase 2 expansion to 
150,000 tonnes of ore per day) will source ore initially from the 
recently opened Esperanza Sur pit and later also from the Encuentro 
pit. The sulphide ore in the Encuentro pit lies under the Encuentro 
Oxides reserves. Fully exposing the sulphide ore in the optimal 
sequence required to initiate feed to the second concentrator from the 
Encuentro Pit is expected to require separate investments in 
infrastructure, mining equipment and mine development activities, 
which will materially commence half-way through the construction 
phase of the second concentrator and will span a period of 3-4 years. 
As announced in December 2023, the combined investment in mine 
development and sustaining capital for the expansion of the Encuentro 
pit is estimated to be approximately $1 billion. This expansion in mining

Exploration activities

Our aim is at least to replace the mineral resources mined at our operations each year, and to 
help provide a platform for Antofagasta’s sustainable and long-term growth. In 2023, we 
continued our efforts to make progress in consolidating our latest discoveries and adding new 
targets to our portfolio, maintaining our pipeline of exploration opportunities for the coming years.

Exploration remains a key contributor to the sustainable and long-term 
embedded growth of the Group´s copper business.

This year all exploration activities have been executed as normal. We 
remain focused on favourable jurisdictions in the Americas, particularly 
in Chile, Peru, Canada and the USA.

In Chile, we are pursuing brownfield and greenfield projects, and in the 
other countries we have generative programmes, identifying early-
stage projects, while remaining open to M&A opportunities.

The Global Exploration Management (GEM) team, which is based in 
Santiago, Chile, leads all of the Group’s exploration activities with the 
local offices in Lima (Peru) and Toronto (Canada) reporting to the GEM 
team on progress in Peru and North America respectively.

Exploration was conducted using in-house teams, with work 
completed on a well-balanced portfolio of land holdings in Chile, Peru 
and Canada, while also pursuing third-party opportunities in the rest of 
the Americas, with the aim of building a portfolio of long-term copper 
projects.

The Group’s exploration and evaluation expenditure, which includes 
expenditure on pre-feasibility studies, increased by $28 million to $141 
million, reflecting geotechnical drilling at Centinela and evaluation work 
at Los Pelambres. Overall expenditures across the Company’s 
exploration projects remained in line year-on-year.

Chile

Our exploration programme in Chile remains focused on highly 
prospective areas in northern and central Chile, mainly in metallogenic 
belts hosting porphyry, manto and IOCG (Iron Oxide Copper Gold) 
deposit types.

During the year, the Company completed a total of 77,000 metres of 
drilling, 3% less than in 2022, with work primarily focused at two 
advanced projects: Cachorro and Encierro.

The Cachorro project is located in the western Atacama Desert in 
northern Chile, 100 km north-east of the city of Antofagasta and 
1,100 km north of Santiago. Work at Cachorro in 2023 has enabled the 
Company to report a second inferred mineral resource estimate, 
increasing by 8% to 250 Mt, with a copper grade of 1.26% (using an 
unchanged cut-off grade of 0.5% copper). This increase in size and 
grade is attributable to an increase in the number of holes drilled, with 
work in 2023 being a combination of step out and infill drilling. The 
results reported to date by the Company make this project one of the 
most important manto-type deposits in the northern coastal belt in 
Chile. Cachorro lies between Antucoya and Centinela, which may 
enable the project to benefit from the use of existing facilities.

The Encierro project is in the Chilean High Andes, 100 km east of the 
city of Vallenar and 600 km north of Santiago. The deposit is a 
complex Cu-Au-Mo Miocene porphyry copper, and the Company 
announced an inaugural inferred mineral resource estimate in June 
2022 of 522 Mt at 0.65% copper, 0.22 g/t gold and 74 ppm 
molybdenum (using a cut-off grade of 0.5% copper). During the year, 
new targets were identified within the property, along with additional 
drilling of potential new targets located close to the main ore body, 
with preparatory administrative work completed ahead of the next 
phase of exploration at Encierro.

Americas

In line with our strategy to focus on exploration within the Americas 
during 2023, additional joint venture exploration agreements were 
signed with a Peruvian company. These agreements will provide 
access to properties with high exploration potential, with exploration 
work to be controlled and led by the GEM team, starting in 2024.

STRATEGIC REPORTKey costs

Our mining operations depend on a number of key inputs, including energy, labour, sulphuric acid 
and fuel, the most important of which are reviewed below. 

Contractor services, maintenance and spare parts account for 44% of 
the Mining division’s total production costs, and energy and labour are 
the largest direct costs, each accounting for 11%. As concentrate 
producers, Los Pelambres and Centinela require reagents and grinding 
media. As cathode producers, Centinela, Antucoya and Zaldívar use 
the SX-EW process that requires the consumption of sulphuric acid. 
The availability, cost and supply reliability of these inputs are central to 
our cost management strategy, which focuses on cost control 
and security of supply. 

Energy 

Energy is a strategic resource for our Group and supply is maintained 
through a strategy that considers four factors: safety, cost, efficiency 
and source. For this reason, in addition to reducing the cost of our 
electricity, we are working on improving our energy consumption 
efficiency and reducing our emissions. 

All of our operations are on the country’s main grid, the National 
Electrical System (Sistema Eléctrico Nacional, SEN), and source 
power under medium- and long-term contracts called Power 
Purchase Agreements (PPAs). 

In recent years, renewable technologies have significantly reduced in 
cost and many renewable power plants are being built in Chile, mainly 
in the north of the country, alongside a significant improvement in 
Chile’s transmission network. The cost of renewable power is 
significantly lower than power from conventional sources. 

The transition to using solely renewable power was completed in 
2022, with lower costs and emissions, and has been important for 
both the Company’s carbon footprint and its costs. Energy accounted 
for 11% of our total production costs in 2023. 

In accordance with our Energy Policy framework that was 
implemented in 2022, as of 2023 we have now incorporated the role 
of Energy Administrator at each mining site. The role consists of 
leading and ensuring the implementation and improvement of the 
Energy Management System according to Chilean Law No. 21,305 on 
Energy Efficiency.

Labour 

Accessing a diverse and talented workforce is key to our success.

Our employees accounted for 11% of our production costs in 2023. 
Labour agreements are in place with each of the unions at our 
operations and generally last for a period of three years, at the end of 
which they are renegotiated. 

Our employees’ wages are adjusted quarterly for inflation. As a result, 
labour costs typically increase by more than inflation (once labour 
agreements are considered), but we aim to compensate for this with 
productivity improvements. 

Service contracts and key supplies 

For key commercial contracts, such as mining equipment, fuels, 
lubricants, tyres, grinding balls, explosives and mine maintenance, 
negotiations are managed centrally to generate synergies and 
economies of scale. The significant savings achieved allow us to 
implement new controls that improve competitiveness and productivity 
from our contractor companies. We have linked our supply prices to 
the respective underlying commodity, to minimise the impact on our 
margins. 

We have an optimisation programme that aims to improve the 
administration, control, and risk management of our service contracts. 
The procurement team, using standardised work methods and 
considerable technical knowledge, has developed effective approaches 
to managing the purchase of goods and services. Depending on the 
strategic position of the supplier, these range from pure price 
competition with e-auctions to long-term Group-wide agreements with 
mechanisms and incentives that provide benefits for both parties. 

The successful management of supplier relationships contributes to 
our long-term success, which is why we hold strategic meetings with 
our key suppliers to address operational challenges, while also taking a 
long-term view.

Operating review continued

In 2023, we continued to implement plans to maintain the quality and 
timely delivery of spare parts and materials, thus ensuring operational 
continuity and cost containment. As disruptions continue as a result of 
the war in Ukraine, we have strengthened the control of our supply 
chains by adopting new technologies for the continuous monitoring of 
our sources of supply. 

In 2023, we had approximately 3,700 different suppliers of goods and 
services, of which 93% are based in Chile. 

Fuel and lubricants 

Fuel and lubricants represent approximately 9% of our production costs 
and are used mainly by mine haulage trucks. Oil prices depend on 
international market prices, based on supply and demand, and affect other 
oil-based products, such as freight, the cost of rubber and chemicals.

Due to the Russia-Ukraine war, diesel prices rose in 2022 and brought 
the annual WTI average to $95 per barrel and diesel prices even higher 
than in other periods with similar WTI values. This situation has 
stabilised during the second quarter of 2023, reaching a WTI 2023 of 
$78 per barrel, representing a price level 17.5% lower than in 2022, 
which includes lower refining costs and other diesel import factors 
that directly impact the diesel price. 

Explosives 

Prices for explosives primarily depend on international market prices 
for ammonia and overall availability. Ammonia is produced by natural 
gas, and therefore the Russia-Ukraine war significantly impacted 
prices in 2022, whereby ammonia pricing reached historically high 
levels. During 2023, prices have trended lower, reaching a low of 
$287 per tonne in June 2023, before returning to a level of around 
$600 per tonne, similar to the average price seen in 2021.

A modified form of ammonia – blue ammonia – which includes an 
extra process to capture CO2 emissions in gas wells, is being 
introduced into the global market, but with an added associated cost. 

Ongoing assessments are under way for the feasibility of HyEx, a 
project led by a multinational energy company and a Chilean explosives 
company, aimed at producing green ammonia in northern Chile. This is 
intended to be a low-carbon approach to ammonia production, using 
renewable energy to source nitrogen from air.

Grinding balls and mill liners 

Steel is used in the manufacture of grinding balls and of some mill 
liners, which accounts for approximately 7% of a concentrator plant’s 
costs and 2% of the Group’s production costs. Steel prices showed a 
downward trend during 2023, after the peak that was reached in 
2022. The market for mill liners is moving from steel to steel-rubber 
mill liners, which will provide incremental benefits in the form of 
increased safety, diminished maintenance hours and increased 
availability of mills. 

The Group continues to work on the implementation of circular 
economy initiatives, with a focus on steel recycling, in order to mitigate 
rising costs and reduce carbon emissions.

Tyres

Tyre prices depend on international market prices and are based on 
the supply and demand of key input materials such as natural rubber, 
synthetic rubber, steel and black carbon. During the second half of 
2023, prices rose by 4% compared to the second half of 2022.

104

Antofagasta plc  Annual Report 2023

Sulphuric acid 

Sulphuric acid is one of the main inputs for the SX-EW leaching 
process used to produce copper cathodes, and in 2023, this cost 
accounted for approximately 6% of the Company’s overall production 
costs. 

Each year, Centinela, Antucoya and Zaldívar use a combined total of 
approximately 1.5 million tonnes of sulphuric acid, mainly contracted 
under one-year agreements to secure supply.

During 2023, the annual acid price was approximately $183 per tonne, 
while spot prices ranged from $90 to $148 per tonne, compared to an 
annual price $245 per tonne in 2022 and spot range of between $115 
and $290 per tonne. 

Mining equipment

During 2023, we signed important agreements with Caterpillar and 
Finning, which will enable us to remain competitive during the coming 
years.

Exchange rate 

The Chilean peso/US dollar exchange rate generally has a strong 
correlation with the copper price as copper exports generate nearly 
50% of Chile´s foreign currency earnings, therefore if the copper 
price strengthens so does the Chilean peso, and vice-versa, providing 
a natural hedge for the Company. During 2023, the market price for 
copper price weakened, and the US dollar strengthened, largely 
explained by decreases in the Chilean interest rate by Central Bank in 
response to lower inflation, decreasing the spread with the US Fed 
Fund Rate. The Chilean peso weakened 2.5% over the US dollar, 
closing the year at Ch$877/$1, in part explained by the decrease in 
copper price, offset by less political uncertainty in Chile than the 
previous year.

Cost and Competitiveness

The Cost and Competitiveness Programme (CCP) was introduced in 
2014 to capture the gains from initiatives introduced to reduce our 
cost base and improve our competitiveness. The programme focuses 
on five areas designed to deliver sustainable cost reductions and 
productivity increases: streamlining goods and services procurement; 
improving operating efficiency and asset reliability; energy efficiency; 
corporate and organisational effectiveness; and working capital, capital 
expenditure and services efficiency. During 2023, we achieved 
benefits of $135 million, equivalent to $9c/lb for the year.

In 2023, the Company has developed an expanded approach to costs 
and competitiveness, with the Competitiveness Programme being an 
evolution of the existing CCP. Through the application of an Operational 
Excellence Management System (OEMS), in tandem with lean 
management principals, the Competitiveness Programme is expected 
to deliver our next phase of savings and efficiencies. The 
Competitiveness Programme is based on multiple improvement 
initiatives with a focus on continuous improvement, process 
automation and new technologies implementation, covering areas of 
the business such as labour productivity, mining and processing. 
Through a focus on production, costs and adding value, the 
Competitiveness Programme is designed to competitively position the 
Company on the global cash cost curve.

STRATEGIC REPORTOperating excellence 
and innovation

Innovation is one of our five strategic pillars, designed to create and add value across the Group 
by constantly challenging ourselves to develop new techniques and a more effective 
operating model. 
Our innovation programme remains focused on two key objectives. 
The first is to achieve the full potential of our operations by seeking 
new ways of using the best digital technology. We are doing this 
through the integration of data with advanced analytics and by 
improving operational performance with automation and robotics. 
The second objective is longer-term: to enable business growth and 
to develop the next generation of mining practices, including modern 
technologies and advances to reduce our environmental footprint. 

Finally, on the subject of autonomy, the recently approved Centinela 
Second Concentrator Project includes a 100% autonomous operation, 
with the newly built concentrator expected to be receiving ore feed 
from 2027.

Operational innovation 

Digital roadmap

Our digital roadmap covers the adoption of new technologies to 
improve safety and productivity, with focus on the advanced analytics 
and transformational initiatives needed to progress with our integrated 
managed operations and automation programme.

During 2023, the use of advanced analytics solutions added $12.7 
million in incremental value by developing the required vision and 
strategy and a corporate roadmap tailored to each mine's operational 
challenges.

Achievements to date with respect to our Digital Roadmap include the 
successful deployment of an Agile Decision Assistant (ADA) in our 
operations at Los Pelambres, AI-assisted fleet management at 
Centinela (referred to as Project Octopus), and mineral tracking to 
optimise acid consumption management at Antucoya. The Agile 
Decision Assistant (ADA) is an analytical solution integration system 
designed to identify and resolve operational bottlenecks. It aids 
decision-making by offering recommendations for efficient problem-
solving, enhancing productivity and managing day-to-day challenges in 
various operational scenarios. 

Future efforts on advanced analytics will be focused mainly on 
deploying existing and new technologies, such as the Integrated 
System of Operational Recommendations (SIRO), Agile Decision 
Assistant (ADA) and Predictive Maintenance tools into each of our 
operations, reinforcing our leading position in the integration of 
advanced data analytics in the mining industry. At one of our 2024 
automation projects, Los Pelambres will employ a robotic solution to 
perform the replacement of a SAG mill liner, improving safety by 
eliminating workers' exposure to this hazardous task.

In Remote Operations, Centinela’s Integrated Remote Operations 
Centre (IROC), which is located in the city of Antofagasta, had a 
successful second year of operation. The work at Centinela’s IROC 
allows the remote management of the plant and the mine, with 
real-time information and optimisation of all processes. As of 2023, 
Los Pelambres also now has an IROC, which is located in Santiago. 
Since inauguration in early 2023, this facility has achieved several 
critical milestones for remote and integrated operation throughout Los 
Pelambres’ value chain. Finally, Antucoya has initiated a feasibility 
study to review the options for remote operations at this mine.

In 2023, we continued to execute our “Teleoperation Roadmap”, 
designed to assess the implementation of this technology in auxiliary 
mining equipment, which is set to take place between 2023 and 2025. 
Also, with the safety of our operators in mind, we installed anti-

Our open innovation model enables our employees, contractors, and 
external parties, such as suppliers, to understand our main operational 
challenges. They can propose ideas and solutions promoting effective 
connection with the ecosystem through the online collaborative 
platform Innovaminerals and events, such as our “Supplier Pitch 
Days”. 

During 2023, as part of our participation in the MIT Industrial Liaison 
Program, we held the first international Innovation Symposium with 
sessions in Santiago and Antofagasta. Attendees participated both in 
person and online, showcasing 20 technology startups that have 
scaled and implemented their solutions to work with the Company’s 
Mining division.

Initiatives previously implemented from this portfolio provided an 
impact of $19.4 million in incremental value during 2023.

Further recognition of our continuous efforts to develop mining for a 
better future came during 2023, when we were named “Most 
Innovative Mining Company” for our outstanding effectiveness for 
incremental value creation from innovation projects, recognised as 
part of Chile's “Circulo Da Vinci” by the ESE Business School at the 
Universidad de los Andes.

Strategic innovation

Our strategic innovation programme remains focused on adding 
alternative technologies to existing methods of tailings management, 
material handling, dust management and primary sulphide leaching, 
and gradually progressing towards the electrification of our operations. 
This strategic programme supports the adoption of new technologies 
to improve safety and productivity. A number of projects within the 
Company’s Strategic Innovation work stream are presented below. 

Tailings management

As part of our commitment to learning from previous industry 
experience and contributing to more sustainable mining practices, we 
began laboratory-scale testing of filtered tailings technologies in 2023. 
During 2024, we intend to conduct studies on the best approach to 
final disposal of filtered material.

Material handling

Innovation is a driver for competitiveness and sustainable production, 
and through this, we are incorporating new technologies to make the 
movement of materials more efficient and taking advantage of existing 
infrastructure by developing satellite deposits. This is particularly the 
case at Centinela, where testing of the first prioritised technology to 
improve ore sorting (as part of the material handling programme) is 
expected to complete by Q2 2024.

Decarbonisation

In line with our 2035 decarbonisation targets and ambition to achieve 
carbon neutrality by 2050, we are preparing to conduct a pre-
feasibility study for the electrification of our main pits (Los Pelambres, 
Centinela, and Antucoya) during 2024. 

We are also pleased to report that we have attained the ISO 50001 
Energy Efficiency standards at all sites.

Cuprochlor®-T – our patented primary sulphide leaching 
technology 

Cuprochlor®-T is our proprietary technology, designed to extract 
copper from primary sulphides, with recoveries of 70% or more after 
approximately 220 days. It has the potential to unlock value from 
previously uneconomic mineral resources and its technical maturity 
level indicates that it is ready to deploy in an operational environment. 
Thus, Cuprochlor®-T is included in our long-term planning as the best 
solution to extending the life of our SX-EW plants.

As part of this programme, a pilot project to study heap heating was 
carried out during 2023 at Zaldívar, with promising results, further 
strengthening the operational readiness of the Cuprochlor®-T 
technology.

Patents have been granted to Antofagasta Minerals, a subsidiary of 
Antofagasta plc, in all jurisdictions of interest in 2023. During 2024, 
we will continue with an exploration phase with a view to also 
commercially validating Cuprochlor®-T in the wider market.

Los Pelambres

Project Octopus

Centinela

In 2023, Los Pelambres achieved notable success through the use of 
advanced analytics. Key accomplishments included the implementation 
of predictive maintenance for SAG mills, enhancing equipment 
availability, and the successful deployment of the Agile Decision 
Assistant (ADA) in the production environment – an analytical solution 
integration system specifically designed to identify and resolve dynamic 
operational bottlenecks. This transition to productive environments 
marks a significant step in ensuring higher reliability, cyber security, 
quality, and support, reinforcing Los Pelambres’ commitment to 
operational excellence and technological innovation in mining. It is 
anticipated that the ADA's transfer will streamline operations, enhance 
efficiency, and provide robust support in operational decision-making 
processes.

A standout project at Centinela in 2023 was 'Project Octopus', which 
is an innovative optimisation model for shovel assignments. This model 
notably increased the material movement efficiency within the mine. 
Following its success, 'Project Octopus' has now been approved to be 
transferred for testing at our other mining operations, demonstrating 
our commitment to expanding and applying successful innovations 
across different operations.

Artificial intelligence applications

Antucoya

Machine learning algorithms to optimise mineral 
recoveries 

In 2023, Antucoya made good progress in intelligent leaching 
operations by developing technology to provide advanced mineral 
tracking, a stacking module, and initiating tests for optimising acid 
consumption. Future plans include the fine-tuning of the mineral 
tracker to align with new plant configurations and developing the 
Integrated System of Operational Recommendations (SIRO) for the 
recovery process. These efforts showcase Antucoya's commitment to 
enhancing operational efficiency and advancing sustainable, 
technologically-driven mining practices.

Zaldívar

A key finding at Zaldívar in 2023 was the impact of heap height on 
recovery rates. Building on technical advances made through work at 
Antucoya, Zaldívar’s management team initiated the development of 
the Integrated System of Operational Recommendations (SIRO) for its 
leaching process, starting with the traceability of minerals from the 
mine to the crushers. Looking ahead to 2024, the focus at Zaldívar will 
be on using this data to improve our understanding and processing of 
minerals in the leaching process, in order to develop better methods, 
including advancements in the stacking module, acid consumption, and 
a recovery recommendation system, showcasing Zaldívar's 
commitment to innovation and efficiency through advanced data 
analytics.

Revenue from the Mining division 

Revenue from the Mining division increased by $460.0 million, or 8%, 
to $6,128.6 million, compared with $5,668.6 million in 2022. The 
increase reflected a $241.9 million increase in copper sales and a 
$218.1 million increase in by-product revenue.

Revenue from copper sales

Revenue from copper concentrate and copper cathode sales increased 
by $241.9 million, or 5%, to $5,147.4 million, compared with $4,905.5 
million in 2022. The increase reflected the impact of $230.7 million 
from higher sales volumes and $69.0 million from higher realised 
prices, partly offset by $57.8 million due to the impact of higher 
treatment and refining charges on the prices invoiced. 

(i) Copper volumes

Copper sales volumes reflected within revenue increased by 4.5% 
from 598,100 tonnes in 2022 to 625,300 tonnes in 2023, increasing 
revenue by $230.7 million. This increase was due to higher copper 
sales volumes at Los Pelambres (27,800 tonnes increase), reflecting 
higher throughput in the current year, which resulted from increasing 
availability of water from the operation’s desalination plant as it 
successfully completes its ramp up, and additional ore processing 
capacity provided by the fourth concentrator line that is nearing the 
end of its commissioning phase.

(ii) Realised copper price

The average realised copper price increased by 1.3% to $3.89/lb in 
2023 (2022 – $3.84/lb), resulting in a $69.0 million increase in 
revenue. The LME average market price decreased by 3.8% to 
$3.85/lb in 2023 (2022 – $4.00/lb). In 2023, there was a $81.3 million 

positive impact from provisional pricing adjustments, mainly as a result 
of a positive net impact in the settlement of sales invoiced and by the 
increase in the period end mark to market price to $3.87/lb at 31 
December 2023, compared with $3.80/lb at 31 December 2022. 
Conversely, there had been a $169.7 million negative impact from 
provisional pricing adjustments in 2022, which mainly reflected the 
decrease in the year-end mark-to-market copper price to $3.80/lb at 
31 December 2022, compared with $4.42/lb at 31 December 2021.

Realised copper prices are determined by comparing revenue (after 
adding back treatment and refining charges for concentrate sales) with 
sales volumes in the period. Realised copper prices differ from market 
prices mainly because, in line with industry practice, concentrate and 
cathode sales agreements generally provide for provisional pricing at 
the time of shipment with final pricing based on the average market 
price in future periods (normally around one month after delivery to 
the customer in the case of cathode sales and four months after 
delivery to the customer in the case of concentrate sales).

Further details of provisional pricing adjustments are given in Note 7 to 
the financial statements.

(iii) Treatment and refining charges

Treatment and refining charges (TC/RCs) for copper concentrate 
increased by $57.8 million to $213.6 million in 2023, compared with 
$155.8 million in 2022 reflecting higher average TC/RC rates and the 
increase in concentrate sales volumes mainly at Los Pelambres. 

With sales of concentrates at Los Pelambres and Centinela, which are 
sold to smelters and roasting plants for further processing into fully 
refined metal, the price of the concentrate invoiced to the customer 
reflects the market value of the fully refined metal less a “treatment 
and refining charge” deduction, to reflect the lower value of this 
partially processed material compared with the fully refined metal. For 
accounting purposes, the revenue amount reflects the invoiced price 
(which reflects the net of the market value of fully refined metal less 
the treatment and refining charges). However, under the standard 
industry definition of unit cash costs, treatment and refining charges 
are regarded as part of cash costs.

Accordingly, the increase in these charges has had a negative impact 
on revenue in the year.

Revenue from molybdenum, gold and other by-product sales

Revenue from by-product sales at Los Pelambres and Centinela relate 
mainly to molybdenum and gold and, to a lesser extent, silver. Revenue 
from by-products increased by $218.0 million or 28.6% to $981.2 
million in 2023, compared with $763.2 million in 2022. This increase 
was mainly due to the higher molybdenum and gold sales volumes and 
realised prices.

Financial Review continued

Revenue from molybdenum sales (net of roasting charges) was 
$504.2 million (2022 – $392.2 million), an increase of $112.0 million. 
The increase was due to both the higher sales volumes of 11,100 
tonnes (2022 – 9,200 tonnes) reflecting the higher production 
volumes mainly at Los Pelambres, as well as the 5.8% higher realised 
price of $22.0/lb (2022 – $20.8/lb).

Revenue from gold sales (net of treatment and refining charges) was 
$406.9 million (2022 – $313.8 million), an increase of $93.1 million 
which reflected an increase in volumes and a higher realised price. 
Gold sales volumes increased by 17.3% from 174,700 ounces in 2022 
to 204,900 ounces in 2023, mainly due to higher gold grades at 
Centinela. The realised gold price was $1,989.5/oz in 2023 compared 
with $1,800.4/oz in 2022, reflecting the average market price for 
2023 of $1,943.1/oz (2022 – $1,800.4/oz) and a positive provisional 
pricing adjustment of $9.2 million.

Revenue from silver sales increased by $12.9 million to $70.1 million 
(2022 – $57.2 million). The increase was due to higher sales volumes 
of 3.0 million ounces (2022 – 2.7 million ounces) and a 13.2% higher 
realised silver price of $24.0/oz (2022 – $21.2/oz).

Revenue from the Transport division

Revenue from the Transport division (FCAB) increased by $2.6 million 
or 1.3% to $195.9 million (2022 – $193.4 million), mainly due to 
increased pricing in some contracts.

Total operating costs 

The $314.0 million increase in total operating costs from $4,227.7 
million in 2022 to $4,541.7 million in the current year reflected the 
following factors:

(All figures $, millions)

187.4

5.1

28.1

23.7

1.6

68.1

4,541.7 

4,227.7

On a unit cost basis, weighted average cash costs excluding 
treatment and refining charges and by-product revenues increased 
from $2.05/lb in 2022 to $2.14/lb in 2023. As detailed in the 
alternative performance measures section on page 239, for accounting 
purposes by-product credits and treatment and refining charges both 
impact revenue and don’t therefore affect operating expenses. This 
increase largely reflected general inflation and the stronger Chilean 
peso, partially offset by the cost savings from the Group’s Cost and 
Competitiveness Programme and lower key input prices and shipping 
costs.

The Cost and Competitiveness Programme was implemented to 
reduce the Group’s cost base and improve its competitiveness within 
the industry. During 2023, the programme achieved benefits of $134.7 
million in the Mining division, of which $106.5 million reflected cost 
savings and $28.2 million reflected the value of productivity 
improvements. Of the $106.5 million of cost savings, $101.2 million 
related to Los Pelambres, Centinela and Antucoya, and therefore 
impacted the Group’s operating costs, and $5.4 million related to 
Zaldívar (on a 100% basis) and therefore impacted the share of results 
from associates and joint ventures.

Closure provisions and other mining expenses increased by $5.1 
million. Exploration and evaluation costs increased by $28.1 million to 
$141.1 million (2022 – $113.0 million), principally in respect of 
geotechnical drilling at Centinela and evaluation expenditure at Los 
Pelambres.

Operating costs (excluding depreciation, amortisation and loss 
on disposals) at the Transport division

Operating costs (excluding depreciation, amortisation and loss on 
disposals) at the Transport division increased by $1.6 million to $120.7 
million (2022 – $119.1 million), mainly due to general inflation and the 
stronger Chilean peso.

Depreciation, amortisation and disposals

The expense for depreciation, amortisation and loss on disposals 
increased by $68.1 million from $1,143.2 million in 2022 to $1,211.3 
million. This increase is mainly due to higher depreciation of new 
assets at Centinela and Los Pelambres.

Operating costs (excluding depreciation, amortisation and 
disposals) at the Mining division

Operating costs (excluding depreciation, amortisation, loss on disposals 
and impairments) at the Mining division increased by $244.3 million to 
$3,209.7 million in 2023, an increase of 8.2%. 

Of this increase, $187.4 million was attributable to higher mine-site 
operating costs, reflecting higher unit costs and increased sales 
volumes.

Share of results from associates and joint ventures (excluding 
exceptional items)

The Group’s share of results from associates and joint ventures 
(excluding exceptional items) decreased by $61.6 million to a loss of 
$13.5 million in 2023, compared with a profit of $48.1 million in 2022. 
Of this decrease, $62.7 million was due to the lower profit from 
Zaldívar, reflecting decreased copper sales volumes, due to lower 
copper production (reflecting lower ore processing rates, which were 
partially mitigated by improved recoveries during the year), a lower 
realised copper price and higher cash costs.

EBITDA 

EBITDA (earnings before interest, tax, depreciation and amortisation, and impairments) increased by $157.5 million or 5.4% to $3,087.2 million 
(2022 – $2,929.7 million). EBITDA includes the Group’s proportional share of EBITDA from associates and joint ventures.

EBITDA from the Mining division increased by $156.0 million or 5.5% from $2,849.7 million in 2022 to $3,005.7 million this year. This reflected 
the higher revenue, partially offset by the higher mine-site costs, exploration and evaluation expenditure, and corporate costs, as well as lower 
EBITDA from associates and joint ventures. 

EBITDA at the Transport division increased by $1.5 million to $81.5 million in 2023 ($80.0 million – 2022), reflecting the higher revenue and 
slightly increased EBITDA from associates, partly offset by the higher operating costs.

Commodity price and exchange rate sensitivities

The following sensitivities show the estimated approximate impact on EBITDA for 2023 of a 10% movement in the average copper, molybdenum 
and gold prices and a 10% movement in the average US dollar/Chilean peso exchange rate.

The impact of the movement in the average commodity prices reflects the estimated impact on the relevant revenues during 2023, and the 
impact of the movement in the average exchange rate reflects the estimated impact on Chilean peso denominated operating costs during the 
year. These estimates do not reflect any impact in respect of provisional pricing or hedging instruments, any potential inter-relationship between 
commodity price and exchange rate movements, or any impact from the retranslation or changes in valuations of assets or liabilities held on the 
balance sheet at the year-end.

Investment income increased from $40.2 million in 2022 to $138.1 million in 2023, largely due to an increase in average interest rates.

Interest expense increased from $78.6 million in 2022 to $105.6 million in 2023, again mainly reflecting an increase in average interest rates and 
an increase in the average relevant borrowing balances (after taking account of borrowings where the interest is capitalised).

Other finance items were a net loss of $3.4 million, compared with a net loss of $29.8 million in 2022, a variance of $26.4 million. This was 
mainly due to the foreign exchange impact of the retranslation of Chilean peso denominated assets and liabilities, which resulted in a $12.5 million 
gain in 2023 compared with a $12.8 million loss in 2022. In addition, there was an expense of $15.8 million in respect of the unwinding of the 
discounting of provisions (2022 – expense of $16.9 million).

Profit before tax (excluding exceptional items)

As a result of the factors set out above, profit before tax (excluding exceptional items) increased by 11.4% to $1,798.4 million (2022 –  
$1,614.2 million).

Income tax expense

The tax charge for 2023 excluding exceptional items increased by $20.7 million to $624.3 million (2022 – $603.6 million) and the effective tax 
rate for the year was 34.7% (2022 – 37.4%). Including exceptional items, the tax charge for 2023 was $666.1 million and the effective tax rate 
was 33.9%. 

As a result of the approval of the new mining royalty during 2023, a one-off adjustment has been recognised to the deferred tax balances of the 
Group’s mining operations, resulting in an increase in the deferred tax liability balance of $34.3 million, with a corresponding deferred tax 
expense. Also, the withholding tax charge in the current period reflected a one-off adjustment to the provision for deferred withholding tax, as a 
result of an intra-group restructuring of intercompany balances, reducing the provision balance by $34.7 million, with a corresponding reduction 
in the deferred tax expense. The net impact of these two one-off items was therefore a reduction in the tax expense of $0.4 million.

Compañia de Minas Buenaventura S.A.A.

As detailed in Note 22, during 2023 the Group entered into an 
agreement to acquire up to an additional 30 million shares in Compañia 
de Minas Buenaventura S.A.A. Subsequent to the year-end, in March 
2024, the agreement completed. An exceptional fair value pre-tax gain 
of $167.1 million ($125.3 million post tax) has been recognised during 
2023 in respect of this agreement.

Disposal of investment in Tethyan joint venture

On 15 December 2022, Antofagasta entered into definitive agreements 
to exit its interest in the Tethyan joint venture. As a result, Antofagasta 
recognised a gain on disposal of its investment in the joint venture as 
at 15 December 2022 of $944.7 million. Full details of the agreements 
and gain on disposal are set out in Note 17 to the financial statements.

Non-controlling interests

Profit for 2023 attributable to non-controlling interests was $464.3 
million, compared with $422.3 million in 2022, an increase of $42.0 
million. This reflected the increase in earnings analysed above.

The effective tax rate (excluding exceptional items) of 34.7% varied 
from the statutory rate principally due to the mining tax (royalty) (net 
impact of $80.2 million/4.5% including the deduction of the mining tax 
(royalty) as an allowable expense in the determination of first category 
tax), the one-off effect of the increase in future royalty tax rates on 
deferred tax balances (impact of $34.3 million/1.9%), items not 
deductible for Chilean corporate tax purposes, principally the funding 
of expenses outside of Chile (impact of $21.4 million/1.2%), the impact 
of the recognition of the Group’s share of results from associates and 
joint ventures, which are included in the Group’s profit before tax net 
of their respective tax charges (impact of $3.6 million/0.2%), the 
impact of unrecognised tax losses (impact of $2.3 million/0.1%) and 
the withholding tax relating to the remittance of profits from Chile 
(impact of $1.4 million/0.1%), partly offset by adjustments in respect of 
prior years (impact of $4.5 million/0.3%).

Exceptional items

Exceptional items are material items of income and expense which are 
non-regular or non-operating and typically non-cash, including 
impairments and profits or losses on disposals. The classification of 
these types of items as exceptional is considered to be useful as it 
provides an indication of the earnings generated by the ongoing 
businesses of the Group.

As a result of the factors set out above, the underlying profit attributable to equity shareholders of the Company (excluding exceptional items) 
was $709.8 million compared with $588.3 million in 2022, giving underlying earnings per share of 72.0 cents per share (2022 – 59.7 cents per 
share). The profit attributable to equity shareholders (including exceptional items) was $835.1 million (2022 – $1,533.0 million), resulting in 
earnings per share of 84.7 cents per share (2022 – 155.5 cents per share).

The Board determines the appropriate dividend each year based on consideration of the Group’s cash balance, the level of free cash flow and 
underlying earnings generated during the year and significant known or expected funding commitments. It is expected that the total annual 
dividend for each year would represent a payout ratio based on underlying net earnings for that year of at least 35%.

The Board has recommended a final dividend for 2023 of 24.3 cents per ordinary share, which amounts to $239.6 million and will be paid on 10 
May 2024 to shareholders on the share register at the close of business on 19 April 2024.

The Board declared an interim dividend for the first half of 2023 of 11.7 cents per ordinary share, which amounted to $115.3 million.

This gives total dividends proposed in relation to 2023 (including the interim dividend) of 36.0 cents per share or $354.9 million (2022 – 59.7 
cents per ordinary share or $588.3 million in total) equivalent to a payout ratio of 50% of underlying earnings.

Capital expenditure

Capital expenditure increased by $250.0 million from $1,879.2 million in 2022 to $2,129.2 million in the current year, mainly due to increased 
mine development at Centinela, Los Pelambres and Antucoya, and higher sustaining capex at Los Pelambres and Centinela, partly offset by lower 
expenditure on the INCO project at Los Pelambres.

NB: capital expenditure figures quoted in this report are on a cash flow basis, unless stated otherwise.

Derivative financial instruments

The Group periodically uses derivative financial instruments to reduce its exposure to commodity price, foreign exchange and interest rate 
movements. The Group does not use such derivative instruments for speculative trading purposes. At 31 December 2023, there were no 
derivative financial instruments in place (2022 – nil).

Cash flows from continuing operations were $3,027.1 million in 2023 compared with $2,738.3 million in 2022. This reflected EBITDA from 
subsidiaries for the year of $2,994.1 million (2022 – $2,777.5 million) adjusted for the positive impact of a net working capital decrease of 
$14.3 million (2022 – working capital increase of $12.7 million) and a non-cash increase in provisions of $18.7 million (2022 – decrease of 
$26.5 million). 

The net cash outflow in respect of tax in 2023 was $528.1 million (2022 – $787.1 million). This amount differs from the current tax charge in the 
consolidated income statement (including exceptional items) of $586.8 million (2022 – $448.8 million) as the cash tax payments reflect payments 
on account for the current year based on prior periods’ profit levels of $544.3 million (2022 – $435.6 million), the settlement of outstanding 
balances in respect of the previous year’s tax charge of $14.7 million (2022 – $332.1 million) and withholding tax payments of $2.1 million 
(2022 – $24.5 million), partly offset by the recovery of $33.0 million relating to prior years (2022 – $5.1 million).

Contributions and loans to associates and joint ventures were $0.7 million (2022 – nil).

Capital expenditure in 2023 was $2,129.2 million compared with $1,879.2 million in 2022. This included expenditure of $1,044.6 million at 
Centinela (2022 – $857.0 million), $897.1 million at Los Pelambres (2022 – $889.7 million), $121.6 million at Antucoya (2022 – $66.9 million), 
$15.5 million at the corporate centre (2022 – $10.8 million) and $50.4 million at the Transport division (2022 – $54.8 million). The higher total 
capex compared with the prior year reflects increased mine development at Centinela, Los Pelambres and Antucoya, and higher sustaining capex 
at Los Pelambres and Centinela, partly offset by lower expenditure on the INCO project at Los Pelambres.

As detailed in Note 17, in December 2022 Antofagasta completed its disposal of its 50% interest in the Tethyan joint venture. It was agreed that 
the disposal proceeds would be distributed to Antofagasta during 2023. In May 2023, the disposal proceeds of $944.7 million, plus interest of 
$11.6 million, were received by the Group.

There was a cash outflow of $290.1 million in respect of investment in other financial assets in 2023 (2022 – nil).

Acquisitions of equity investments were $60.7 million in 2023 (2022 – $66.5 million). 

Dividends paid to equity holders of the Company were $613.2 million (2022 – $1,262.9 million) of which $497.9 million related to the payment of 
the previous year’s final dividend and $115.3 million to the interim dividend declared in respect of the current year. 

Dividends paid by subsidiaries to non-controlling shareholders were $388.0 million (2022 – $80.0 million). 

Dividends received from associates and joint ventures were nil for 2023 (2022 – $50.0 million).

STRATEGIC REPORT 
At 31 December 2023, the Group had combined cash, cash equivalents 
and liquid investments of $2,919.4 million (31 December 2022 – 
$2,391.2 million). Excluding the non-controlling interest share in each 
partly-owned operation, the Group’s attributable share of cash, cash 
equivalents and liquid investments was $2,490.5 million (31 December 
2022 – $1,991.0 million).

Total Group borrowings and other financial liabilities at 31 December 
2023 were $4,079.2 million, an increase of $802.2 million on the prior 
year (31 December 2022 – $3,277.0 million). The increase was mainly 
due to $1,062.2 million of additional senior loans at Los Pelambres 
($797.2 million) and Centinela ($265.0 million) and $178.6 million of 
new finance leases, partly offset by a $381.7 million repayment of the 
senior loans at Los Pelambres ($210.3 million), Centinela ($111.1 
million), Antucoya ($50.0 million), and the Transport division ($10.3 
million). Excluding the non-controlling interest share in each partly-
owned operation, the Group’s attributable share of the borrowings was 
$2,948.3 million (31 December 2022 – $2,449.7 million).

These movements resulted in net debt at 31 December 2023 of 
$1,159.8 million (31 December 2022 – net debt $885.8 million). 
Excluding the non-controlling interest share in each partly-owned 
operation, the Group had an attributable net debt position of $457.8 
million (31 December 2022 – net cash $458.7 million).

Going concern

The consolidated financial information contained in the financial 
statements has been prepared on the going concern basis. Details of 
the factors which have been taken into account in assessing the 
Group’s going concern status are set out in Note 1 to the financial 
statements.

Cautionary statement about forward-looking statements

This Annual Report contains certain forward-looking statements. All 
statements other than historical facts are forward-looking statements. 
Examples of forward-looking statements include those regarding the 
Group’s strategy, plans, objectives or future operating or financial 
performance, reserve and resource estimates, commodity demand and 
trends in commodity prices, growth opportunities, and any 
assumptions underlying or relating to any of the foregoing. Words such 
as “intend”, “aim”, “project”, “anticipate”, “estimate”, “plan”, “believe”, 
“expect”, “may”, “should”, “will”, “continue” and similar expressions 
identify forward-looking statements. 

Forward-looking statements involve known and unknown risks, 
uncertainties, assumptions and other factors that are beyond the 
Group’s control. Given these risks, uncertainties and assumptions, 
actual results could differ materially from any future results expressed 
or implied by these forward-looking statements, which apply only as at 
the date of this report. Important factors that could cause actual 
results to differ from those in the forward-looking statements include: 
global economic conditions, demand, supply and prices for copper and 
other long-term commodity price assumptions (as they materially 
affect the timing and feasibility of future projects and developments), 
trends in the copper mining industry and conditions of the international 
copper markets, the effect of currency exchange rates on commodity 
prices and operating costs, the availability and costs associated with 
mining inputs and labour, operating or technical difficulties in 
connection with mining or development activities, employee relations, 
litigation, and actions and activities of governmental authorities, 
including changes in laws, regulations or taxation. Except as required 
by applicable law, rule or regulation, the Group does not undertake any 
obligation to publicly update or revise any forward-looking statements, 
whether as a result of new information, future events or otherwise. 

Past performance cannot be relied on as a guide to future 
performance.

Applying the Code in 2023

How we apply the Code

UK Corporate Governance Code compliance 
statement
The UK Corporate Governance Code issued by the Financial Reporting 
Council in July 2018 sets out the governance principles and provisions 
that applied to the Company during 2023.

The Code is not a rigid set of rules, it consists of principles and 
provisions. The Listing Rules require companies to apply the principles 
and report to shareholders on how they have done so. This Corporate 
Governance Report shows how these principles have been considered 
and applied to the Company’s specific circumstances.

The Company complied with all the principles and detailed provisions 
of the Code in 2023 except for Code Provisions 9 and 19. Code 
Provision 9 recommends that the Chairman should be independent on 
appointment when assessed against the circumstances set out in 
Provision 10 and Code Provision 19 recommends that the Chairman 
should not remain in post beyond nine years from the date of first 
appointment to the Board. 

The Company’s Chairman, Jean-Paul Luksic, was appointed to the 
Board in 1990. He served as CEO of the Group’s Mining division from 
1998 until 2004 and was appointed Executive Chairman in 2004. In 
2014, he stepped back from executive responsibilities to become 
Non-Executive Chairman, a role he has continued to hold since then. 
Mr Luksic’s longstanding UK corporate governance and Chilean mining 
and business experience, coupled with his knowledge of the Group’s 
businesses have been for many years, and continue to be, a 
cornerstone of the Company’s continuing growth and success. 

Mr Luksic is also a member of the family that is interested in the 
E. Abaroa Foundation, a controlling shareholder of the Company for the 
purposes of the UK Listing Rules and is therefore uniquely positioned 
to ensure that the interests of shareholders, together with the interests 
of other stakeholders (many of whom are based in Chile), are taken 
into account to promote the long-term sustainable success of the 
Company and to promote governance that the Board is convinced 
is best for the Company’s particular circumstances in the long term. 

Mr Luksic is committed to wider succession and diversity planning and, 
in his roles as Chairman of the Board and Chair of the Nomination and 
Governance Committee, he has overseen the design and 
implementation of succession plans to increase diversity, including 
gender, and continually refresh the Board. The Board and its 
Committees meet or exceed the Code’s recommendations for 
independent composition and the Company complies with the new 
UK Listing Rules regarding diversity with 45% of the Board comprising 
women and a female Senior Independent Director. There is a Board 
approved succession plan for the Chairman in the event of an 
unforeseen departure.

The Board considers that Mr Luksic continues to demonstrate 
objective judgement and provide constructive challenge and leadership, 
and believes that his continued appointment is appropriate without 
fixing a limit to his length of service. The Company’s major 
shareholders are regularly consulted on this subject, and in meetings 
with the Senior Independent Director in November 2023, continued to 
unanimously express their support for Mr Luksic’s continued service 
as Chairman of the Board. 

The composition of the Board and its Committees is entirely in line 
with the Code provisions and the Chairman is fully supported by the 
Board, the Nomination and Governance Committee and the Senior 
Independent Director in ensuring that, despite non-compliance with 
Code Provisions 9 and 19, good governance is maintained.

Antofagasta plc  Annual Report 2023

Further details on the composition of the Board and its Committees 
are set out on page 132 and further details of the role of the Senior 
Independent Director are set out on pages 122 and 135.

The UK Corporate Governance Code is available on the Financial 
Reporting Council website at www.frc.org.uk.

The Board has been monitoring developments culminating in the 
revised UK Corporate Governance Code issued by the Financial 
Reporting Council in January 2024, and plans to report against the 
relevant Principles and Provisions of this new version of the Code 
from 1 January 2025.

How the Code principles were applied in 2023

Board leadership and Company purpose

The role of the Board

•  The Company is led by an effective and entrepreneurial Board, 
which is collectively responsible for promoting the Company’s 
long-term sustainable success, generating value for shareholders 
and contributing to wider society as shown throughout this 
Corporate Governance Report.

•  The Board has adopted and actively promotes the Group’s purpose, 
vision, values and strategy, and has satisfied itself that they are 
aligned with its culture – pages 22-25 and 126.

•  The Board has ensured that the necessary resources are in place 
for the Company to meet its objectives and measure performance 
against them. It has established both its risk appetite and a 
framework of prudent and effective controls, which enable risk  
to be appropriately assessed and managed – pages 74-85.

•  The Board ensures effective engagement with, and encourages 

participation from, shareholders and other stakeholders to ensure 
that its responsibilities are met – pages 30-73, 120, 122, 128-129, 
135, 157 and 174.

•  The Board ensures that workforce policies and practices are consistent 

with the Company’s purpose, vision and values and supports its 
long-term sustainable success. The workforce can raise any matters

Chairman’s introduction 

Effective Board 
leadership

Dear shareholders

Welcome to the Corporate Governance section of our 2023 Annual 
Report. 

My introductory letter on pages 8-10 of this Annual Report sets out 
some of the Group’s key challenges and achievements in 2023 and my 
reflections on the outlook for 2024 and illustrates the Board’s ability to 
navigate these scenarios supported by our strong and effective 
governance framework. 

Reflecting on our 40th year of operating copper mines, we are proud 
of our strong performance during the year, which included record 
safety performance and the successful delivery of key development 
projects and key investment decisions that will secure the long-term 
future of our business.

Shareholder engagement

We were pleased to engage with shareholders at our AGM in 2023, 
with a return to normality following the pandemic years. 

As the year progressed, our Senior Independent Director and Chair of 
the Remuneration and Talent Management Committee, Francisca 
Castro, met with shareholders and proxy advisers in a mix of 
in-person and virtual meetings. In the meetings, discussions centred 
on our approach to corporate governance and provided an opportunity 
for shareholders and proxy advisers to share their perspectives on the 
Company, with a particular focus on corporate governance. 

Details of these meetings can be found in the Senior Independent 
Director’s introduction on page 122 and the Remuneration and Talent 
Management Committee Chair’s introduction on page 156.

Diversity and Inclusion

An issue that was discussed with shareholders, which is important to 
our Board, was diversity – particularly gender diversity. Since 2014, 
more than half of our appointments to the Board have been female and 
women now make up 45% of our Board. We were delighted that 
Francisca Castro took on the role of Senior Independent Director 
during the year. Francisca has been a Director since 2016 and has 
Chaired the Remuneration and Talent Management Committee since 
2017. She has a strong understanding of shareholder corporate 
governance expectations and close connection with the Group’s 
businesses in Chile. We aim to continue to meet the UK’s targets on 
gender diversity, while also continuing to build a pipeline of female 
talent across the organisation, particularly at the Group’s mining 
operations where the recruitment of female talent has historically been 
particularly difficult. 

Further information on the Board’s diversity policy can be found in the 
Nomination and Governance Committee Report on page 140.

Audit and Risk Management

Deloitte will take over the external audit from PwC for the 2024 financial 
year onwards and shareholders will be asked to confirm this 
appointment at the 2024 AGM. The Board, led by the Audit and Risk 
Committee, conducted a tender process for the appointment of the 
Group’s auditor in 2022 and has continued to oversee the transition 
plans and progress during 2023. I would like to thank Simon Morley and 
the PwC teams in the UK and Chile for their excellent performance over 
the last nine years and we look forward to working with Chris Thomas 
and the Deloitte teams in the UK and Chile in the coming years.

Our Commitment to Sustainability Issues 

Our efforts on climate change are an integral part of our Sustainability 
strategy, but far from the only ones. The copper we produce has a key role to 
play in a net-zero world: our responsibility is to produce it sustainably, 
efficiently, and with respect for local communities and the environment. 

Having achieved our emissions reduction target in 2022, efforts in 2023 
were focused on developing a detailed decarbonisation strategy and 
associated emissions reduction targets that would guide the next phase of 
our development. Following this work, we were able to publish updated 
targets covering Scope 1, 2 and 3 emissions in early 2024. 

Stakeholder engagement

Our Directors visited our operations, including the desalination plant and 
concentrator plant expansion projects throughout the year. The insights 
from these visits were shared at Board and Committee meetings, deepening 
the Directors’ understanding of our activities and providing direct feedback 
to the Board from our stakeholders at site. These insights were particularly 
important in monitoring progress towards completion of the Los 
Pelambres expansion project and the integration between project and 
operations teams and relations with our stakeholders in the Choapa Valley. 

Board evaluation

We always seek continuous improvement in all that we do, and the Board 
and its governance are no exception. During 2023, we carried out an 
internal evaluation of the Board and Committees which followed on from 
the 2022 external comprehensive independent Board evaluation.

Further details regarding the evaluation and our progress can be found 
on page 143. 

Board changes and succession planning

Jorge Bande reached nine years of service in December 2023 and has 
retired from the Board. We appreciate Jorge’s contribution to the Company 
over these years and thank him for his continued support of our vision. 
Heather Lawrence and Tracey Kerr joined the Board in April 2023 and 
January 2024, respectively. We are delighted with the skills, experience and 
additional diversity of perspective that they bring to the Board. Heather is a 
qualified chartered accountant with corporate finance and investment banking 
experience and Tracey brings extensive experience in safety, sustainability, 
operations and exploration in global mining businesses. Both Heather 
and Tracey have strong governance experience in UK listed companies.

At its core, Antofagasta is a long-term business. Our mines operate on 
decades-long timelines, and our governance structures and processes 
are designed to help us achieve long-term sustainable success. 

Thank you for your ongoing engagement. I look forward to having 
the opportunity to meet with you at our AGM.

JEAN-PAUL LUKSIC
Chairman

CORPORATE GOVERNANCEWinter at Los Pelambres.

Board oversight of climate-related risks 
and opportunities
The Board has ultimate responsibility for the Group’s climate-
related objectives and strategy. The Board’s oversight of climate-
related risks and opportunities is fully integrated within our 
governance structures. This responsibility and oversight includes 
specific climate related activities such as approving the Group’s 
Climate Change Strategy, approving emission reduction targets, 
monitoring implementation of the Climate Change Strategy and 
approving the Company’s TCFD disclosures. This also includes 
more general approval and oversight responsibilities which 
incorporate climate-related risks and opportunities such as 
reviewing and approving the Group’s capital allocation framework 
which includes criteria relating to climate resilience and an internal 
carbon price, reviewing and approving the Group’s base and 
development case models which include adjustments for physical 
and transition risks associated with climate change, approving the 
Group’s annual budget, reviewing the Group’s principal and 
emerging risks which include climate change and approving KPIs in 
the Group’s remuneration structures that reward our employees 
for progress in achieving the Group’s climate-related objectives.

In 2023, the Board allocated time to specifically review the financial 
implications of climate change on the Group using the TCFD 
framework, considering a detailed and updated evaluation of the 
costs of mitigation and adaptation as well as opportunities. Further 
details are set out on page 144.

During 2023, the Board approved the Company’s second climate 
change report which provided a detailed overview of the 
Company’s efforts and progress in addressing climate change and 
reducing its environmental footprint. The report includes the 
Company’s inaugural summary of Scope 3 emissions which was 
reviewed by the Board and which followed a two-year process to 
improve the understanding of the emissions that relate to the 
Company’s value chain. The report is available on the Company’s 
website at www.antofagasta.co.uk. 

The Board also approved new carbon emissions reduction targets 
to: (1) reduce the Group’s Scope 1 and Scope 2 emissions by 50% 
by 2035 considering 2020 emissions as a baseline; and (2) engage 

with the industry to achieve a 10% reduction in Scope 3 emissions 
by 2030. The Board also agreed that decarbonisation targets will 
be revisited in 2025.

The Board is supported by all of the Board’s committees in 
ensuring that climate-related considerations are fully integrated into 
the Board’s governance structures. For example:

•  As shown on pages 140-143, the Nomination and Governance 
Committee considers the Board’s skills matrix when making 
appointments to the Board. This matrix includes sustainability 
experience (which includes competence on climate-related 
issues) as a key skill and the Board ensures that there is an 
adequate depth of climate change knowledge and awareness on 
the Board when making new appointments. 

•  As shown on pages 144-149, the Audit and Risk Committee 

assists the Board in overseeing the Group’s risk management 
framework, including climate change risk and the financial 
implications of climate change.

•  As shown on pages 151-153, the Sustainability and Stakeholder 

Management Committee considers climate change when 
reviewing and monitoring relevant strategy, policies and 
performance matters. In 2023, this included reviewing a 
progress report on the development of an inventory of Scope 3 
emissions and next steps and reviewing a proposal that was 
approved by the Board to incorporate all of the Group’s operating 
companies to the UN Global Compact, reviewing the Group’s 
environmental Management Model and Organisation, including in 
relation to climate change and reviewing the water situation in 
the Choapa Valley after 14 years of lower-than-normal rainfall 
and Los Pelambres’ water strategy.

•  As shown on page 154-155, the Projects Committee considers 
climate change when reviewing and monitoring the Group’s 
major capital projects. 

•  As shown on page 156-177, the Remuneration and Talent 

Management Committee monitors executives and managers’ 
short- and long-term incentive plans which include KPIs relating 
to climate change such as the implementation of the Company’s 
Decarbonisation Plan, which was created following studies 
completed during 2023.

Senior Independent Director’s introduction 

Board balance

“The feedback I received from 
shareholders was reported to the 
Board and is reflected in the 
decisions that have been made in 
the preparation of this Corporate 
Governance report.”

Q. What are your responsibilities as Senior Independent 
Director?

I am delighted to have taken on the role of Senior Independent Director 
following my appointment in August 2023. 

I have three main responsibilities as Senior Independent Director. First, 
I must be available to shareholders to ensure that the Board considers 
their views, interests and concerns. Second, I provide support to the 
Chairman, ranging from advice on corporate governance matters to 
presiding over potential conflict of interest decisions by the Board, and 
making sure that the views of the other Directors are conveyed to him 
and reflected in Board discussions. Third, I lead the annual review of 
the Chairman’s performance and oversee the closure of any gaps 
identified by internal and externally facilitated reviews of the Board’s 
and the Committees’ performance.

I discharge these responsibilities through close co-ordination with the 
Chairman, Directors, Company Secretary and the management team. I 
met with various shareholders and proxy advisers during the year to 
understand their views of the Company. This has helped me ensure 
that the Chairman, the Board and the management team receive a 
balanced view of issues that are relevant and important for our 
shareholders. 

Q. Why did you meet with shareholders and proxy advisers 
during the year and what issues were discussed?

As Senior Independent Director and Chair of the Remuneration and 
Talent Management Committee, I aim to meet with shareholders every 
year to gain a first-hand understanding of the subjects that matter to 
them. This year I invited the Company’s 20 largest investors as well as 
the Investment Association, Glass Lewis and Institutional Shareholder 
Services to meet to discuss Corporate Governance matters and to 
allow shareholders to raise any concerns that they would like to 
discuss without the presence of the senior management team. The 
feedback I received was very positive and no major concerns were 
raised. We engaged in discussions relating to the Board’s 
independence and the role of the controlling shareholder in the 
Board’s governance arrangements, the key issues and risks 
considered by the Board to be relevant, the Board’s diversity policy 
and progress towards achieving the new targets set out in the Listing 
Rules, and the Board’s oversight of other sustainability matters, such 
as carbon emission reduction targets. The feedback I received from

Antofagasta plc  Annual Report 2023

FRANCISCA CASTRO
Senior Independent Director

shareholders was reported to the Board and is reflected in the 
decisions that have been made in the preparation of this Corporate 
Governance report. 

Q. What impact does the controlling shareholding have on 
Company decisions?

Members of the Luksic family have been involved in the Company for 
over 40 years. During this time, the Company has demonstrated an 
excellent track record in terms of safety, operational performance and 
financial strength.

I have discussed the role of the controlling shareholders with 
shareholders. The widely held view is that the substantial controlling 
interest is positive, with shareholders satisfied that the interests of the 
controlling shareholders are aligned with theirs, many having invested 
based on this interest. They have expressed their appreciation of the 
members of the Luksic family who serve on the Board, commending 
their long-term vision, which has contributed to the Company’s 
prudent operating, financial and growth strategy, as well as its stability.

Shareholder support is, of course, conditional on the strength of the 
current corporate governance framework, which rigorously protects 
the interests of all shareholders equally.

I, and all the other Independent Directors, guard our independence and 
place a strong emphasis on maintaining this governance and protection 
regime. We are supported and encouraged by the other Directors who 
– like the Independent Directors – bring their own perspectives and 
opinions and are committed to the long-term sustainable success of 
the Company.

The controlling shareholders and the members of the Luksic family 
who serve on the Board (including the Chairman), actively support this 
framework and encourage the Independent Directors to provide the 
independent input and challenge that, we are convinced, proves 
invaluable in Board decision-making.

FRANCISCA CASTRO
Senior Independent Director

CORPORATE GOVERNANCERelationship agreement

The E. Abaroa Foundation is a controlling shareholder of the Company 
for the purposes of the Listing Rules and certain other shareholders of 
the Company (including Aureberg Establishment) are also treated as 
controlling shareholders. Details of the Company’s substantial 
shareholders are set out on page 180.

In 2014, the Company entered into relationship agreements with each 
controlling shareholder, which contain the mandatory independence 
provisions required by the Listing Rules. The Company complied with 
and, so far as the Directors are aware, each controlling shareholder 
and its associates (including Metalinvest Establishment and Kupferberg 
Establishment) also complied with the mandatory independence 
provisions throughout 2023.

Related party transactions

Certain related party transactions outside the ordinary course of 
business must be subject to independent assessment and approval. 
The Company has for many years presented all such related party 

transactions between the Company and the controlling shareholders or 
their related entities to a committee of Directors independent from the 
controlling shareholders, to assess whether the Company should enter 
into such transactions and, if so, to oversee the negotiation process. In 
most cases, transactions of this nature will also be subject to 
independent review by third-party shareholders in each of the Group’s 
mining operations.

Any proposed related party transaction over $40 million, whether or 
not in the ordinary course of business, is also tabled for Board 
approval. Any Director with a potential conflict or connection with the 
related party does not take part in the decision on that transaction.

Related party governance in practice

There are several checks and balances to ensure that there is full 
transparency in the handling of related party transactions by the 
Board. The following table summarises the approach taken to identify 
and manage related party transactions and actual or potential conflicts 
of interest.

Identifying Directors’ interests

Process

How this is managed

Monitoring  
of directors’ interests

If a Director has an interest in any other entity, the Board will normally 
consider that interest under its arrangements for authorising potential 
conflicts of interest under section 175 of the Companies Act. See page 180 
for more information.

Independent Directors

The Executive Committee seeks to ensure that the best possible terms are 
achieved for a proposed transaction and that, where appropriate or 
necessary, they are verified by industry benchmarking reports or 
independent third-party valuation or assessment.

If the potential transaction is between the Group and a controlling 
shareholder or its associates and is a transaction to which the UK Listing 
Rules related party transaction rules apply, a committee of Directors 
independent from the controlling shareholder and its associates is formed to 
oversee and support management with this process and to ensure 
compliance with the corresponding Relationship Agreement.

Potential related party transactions outside the ordinary course of business 
that involve a controlling shareholder, or its associates, are reviewed and if 
appropriate, approved by Directors independent from the controlling 
shareholders.

All potential related party transactions over $40 million, whether or not in the 
ordinary course of business, are approved by the Board. Any Director with a 
potential conflict or connection with the related party will not take part in that 
decision. Transactions within the ordinary course of business that are below 
$40 million require approval by the relevant operating Company Board. All 
the operating company boards in the Mining division have Directors 
representing third-party shareholders.

Board activities

Board oversight in 2023

During 2023, the Board provided oversight on the pursuit of the Group’s strategy, addressed 
critical issues in a timely manner and advised management on the development of strategic 
priorities and plans, while seeking to align these with the values of the Group and stakeholders’ 
best interests.

Our strategic framework
The Board has strengthened our commitment to Developing Mining for a Better Future as the purpose that mobilises us and gives meaning to 
everything we do.

Antofagasta plc  Annual Report 2023

CORPORATE GOVERNANCEOur strategy is designed to enable us to achieve our purpose. It is supported by five pillars: safety 
and sustainability, people, competitiveness, innovation and growth and each has defined short- 
and medium-term goals.

 Safety and Sustainability

The health and safety of our employees and contractors is our first priority. We are committed to achieving zero fatalities at our operations

Stakeholder engagement

Stakeholder engagement to 
ensure delivery of our purpose

The Group maintains ongoing dialogue with stakeholders to understand their expectations and 
concerns, and their views are carefully considered in the Board’s deliberations. A description of 
the Group’s key stakeholders, their importance to the Group’s long-term sustainable success and 
the key initiatives that are in place to recognise their interests and concerns, is set out in detail 
within the Strategic Report on pages 1-117.

Further details on the Board’s workforce engagement mechanisms are set out on pages 130-131.

Examples of key Board decisions in 2023 are provided here as 
examples of how stakeholder considerations, and the factors set out  
in section 172(1) of the Companies Act 2006, were central to the 
decision-making processes. The Board took into account the different 
interests of stakeholders but with an overarching focus, as required by 
section 172(1), on acting in a way that would be most likely to promote 
the success of the Company for the benefit of its members as a whole. 
The likely long-term consequences of each decision were, among 
other things, key considerations for the Board.

•  The Board also had regard to the impact of the project on the 
community and the environment, securing a long term power 
contract that ensures 100% electricity supply from renewable 
sources, committing to the use of raw sea water and overseeing 
the decision to use high-pressure grinding rolls which are 
expected to reduce energy consumption. The project will leverage 
more than 20 years of operational experience, utilizing existing 
infrastructure and building on long-established relationships with 
Centinela’s local communities.

Centinela Second Concentrator Project
The Board has ultimate responsibility for the Group’s growth strategy 
and objectives. The pursuit of robust economic growth options 
embedded in the large mineral resources of our first-tier sites is a key 
pillar of this strategy. In December 2023, after extensive review, the 
Board approved the Company’s investment in the Centinela Second 
Concentrator Project.

This brownfield expansion project is an investment of $4.4 billion to 
construct an additional concentrator at Centinela, which will effectively 
double the sulphide ore processing capacity at this operation, adding 
an average of 170,000 tonnes of copper-equivalent production to the 
Company’s portfolio.1 It is envisaged that construction will take 
approximately three years, and the Board has overseen the 
arrangement of a financing package that comprises a direct funding 
component from the project’s shareholders (being Antofagasta plc  
and Marubeni Corporation) and project finance provided by lenders.

Critical path activities commenced following the project’s approval, 
with full construction commencing after the execution of definitive 
project finance documents during Q1 2024.

How the Board considered, and had regard to, the interests  
of key stakeholders and the requirements of section 172(1)

The Board has monitored closely the advancement of this project, 
considering the likely consequences of this decision on the long-term 
interests of the Company’s shareholders and the Group’s employees 
and contractors, suppliers, customers and other business partners.

• 

In making this decision, the Board had regard to the need to foster 
the Group’s business relationships with the workforce that will work 
to construct the project, the local and international suppliers from 
who will deliver the products required for construction, customers, 
including off-takers who have committed to acquire the copper 
concentrate that will be produced once the project has been 
completed and the group of international lenders who have signed 
a $2.5bn term loan to facilitate the construction of this project.

Antofagasta plc  Annual Report 2023

Updated decarbonisation strategy and emissions 
reduction targets
The Company met its previous emissions reduction target in 2022. 
This was predominantly achieved by contracting renewable power  
at all of the Group’s operations and facilitating a material reduction  
in Scope 2 emissions. Following this achievement, the Board oversaw 
work to develop a detailed decarbonisation pathway in 2023.  
This work included the establishment of the relevant team within  
the organisation, to review the Group’s existing emissions footprint, 
understand modern technologies that may be relevant in reducing 
emissions, and mapping a pathway to carbon neutrality.

As a result of the work carried out in 2023, the Board approved new 
carbon emission reduction targets that were published in February 
2024, with the Company’s detailed decarbonisation plan expected to 
be announced in the first half of 2024.

The new targets set cover Scope 1, 2 and 3 emissions of greenhouse 
gases, and the publication of updated targets follows the publication of 
the Company’s inaugural Scope 3 emissions estimate in 2023. For 
Scope 1 and 2 emissions combined, the Company is targeting a 50% 
reduction in its absolute emissions by 2035, which factor into account 
the Company’s planned increase in production during this time and 
using 2020 as the baseline year. In relation to Scope 3 emissions, the 
Company has set a target of a 10% reduction by 2030, with this 
reduction on a projected basis.

How the Board considered, and had regard to, the interests of key 
stakeholders and the requirements of section 172(1)

Combatting climate change is an integrated part of Antofagasta’s 
strategy and the decision to approve new emissions reduction targets 
considered the broad impact that climate change could have on the 
long-term success of the Company. The effects of climate change on 
the environment in Chile are clear, with changing environmental 
conditions and water availability key concerns, and therefore the Board 
understands the need to continue to build climate resilience into its 
business model and activities.

CORPORATE GOVERNANCEInvestment in Compañía de Minas Buenaventura 
S.A.A. (“Buenaventura”)
During 2023, the Board oversaw the approval by a wholly owned 
subsidiary of the acquisition of a 19% interest in Compañía de Minas 
Buenaventura S.A.A. (“Buenaventura”). Buenaventura is Peru’s 
largest, publicly traded precious and base metals company and a major 
holder of mining rights in Peru. 

This investment, which complements the Group’s exploration 
activities in recent years and significantly increases the Company’s 
exposure to Peru’s highly prospective geology, was made in line with 
the Company’s strategy of prioritising exploration and investment in 
the Americas.

How the Board considered, and had regard to, the interests  
of key stakeholders and the requirements of section 172(1)

The Board has ultimate responsibility for the Group’s growth strategy 
and objectives. This strategy considers both organic and inorganic 
growth opportunities. Growth is understood to be a key priority of  
a number of stakeholders, with value accretive growth an enabler  
for the Company to achieve its purpose.

Inorganic growth, which is growth in the Company’s asset base through 
investments outside of the existing portfolio of assets, is considered on 
a case by case basis as to whether it would provide additional value, 
either financial or strategic, over the cost of acquisition.

The Company’s strategy has been to consider opportunities focused 
on copper (and its by-products) in the Americas, with a particular 
focus on Chile, Peru, the United States and Canada, as these are 
locations that are highly attractive due to their geological potential, 
mining activity, relative proximity, political and administrative 
similarities, culture and language. The Board’s oversight of this 
decision involved a close consideration of the likely consequences in 
the long term. It was considered that this investment would help 
deliver value to the Company’s stakeholders through geographical 
diversification, an increase in the Company’s footprint in Peru’s 
prospective geology, and exposure to a range of prospective projects 
at different development stages.

The Board will continue to evaluate opportunities to deliver value  
to all stakeholders.

• 

In developing these targets, the Board was regularly updated on the 
views, expectations and challenges facing the local communities 
near our operations, suppliers and customers to understand the 
current and future impact of climate change on these stakeholders 
and their own capabilities, objectives, capacity and and ambitions  
to address this global challenge.

•  The Board considered the specific actions that would allow these 
emissions reduction targets to be achieved and the impact on 
stakeholders including suppliers. 

• 

•  The Senior Independent Director (SID) of the Company hosts a 
roadshow on an annual basis to understand the key concerns 
relating to the governance and strategy of the Company. In 2023, 
the Company’s SID, Francisca Castro, hosted a series of meetings  
in both the United Kingdom and the Republic of Ireland, with 
shareholders and proxy advisers. Feedback from these meetings 
included a clear interest in the Company’s decarbonisation strategy 
and future emissions targets, which was duly reported to the Board.
In setting the strategy of the Company relating to climate change, 
and therefore the scale and scope of emissions targets that are 
selected, the Board considers the expectations of different 
stakeholder groups, with different levels of ambition shown by 
individuals and groups. This is assessed against the practical 
aspects of delivering emissions reduction targets, such as the 
associated costs, availability (and affordability) of relevant 
technologies and relevance in the settings where the Company’s 
operations are located, with a suitable balance required to ensure 
that the Company is responding appropriately to climate change,  
but while also setting itself deliverable goals.

Board oversight of mining royalty and tax reform 
bills in Chile
The Board continued to monitor government proposals relating to the 
mining royalty in Chile, which concluded in August 2023 following 
Presidential approval.

As announced by the Company in August 2023, the terms of the 
revised royalty include a 1% ad valorem royalty on copper sales, and  
a royalty ranging from 8% to 26% on operating profits depending on 
each mining operation’s level of profitability, combined with a provision 
establishing that total taxation (including corporate income, the new 
royalty tax and tax on dividends) should not exceed 46.5% of 
profitability. This new law came into effect at the beginning of 2024. 
Since Centinela and Antucoya have tax stability agreements, the new 
royalty rates will only apply to those operations from 2030.

How the Board considered, and had regard to, the interests  
of key stakeholders and the requirements of section 172(1)

Throughout the process to review and amend the mining royalty  
in Chile, the Board has closely monitored the progress of each 
legislative proposal, with consideration of the likely consequences  
of each proposal on the decisions that the Board makes for the  
long term on the interests of the Company’s shareholders and the 
Group’s employees and contractors, suppliers, customers and other 
business partners.

Following the implementation of the new mining royalty in 2024, and 
the associated increase in the financial burden imposed on mining 
companies in Chile, the Board is continuing to review the fiscal impacts 
of this legislation on the business environment in Chile.

The Board will continue to take the potential impacts on stakeholders 
into account in its broader decision-making.

Workforce engagement 

Fostering a positive culture

Mining is a long-term business with decades-long timescales. Our relationships with our 
stakeholders are central to our long-term success and to our purpose of developing mining for 
a better future. The Group’s governance structures ensure that the views and interests of 
stakeholders, including our employees and contractors, are discussed in the boardroom and 
considered as part of the Board’s deliberations.

•  The CEO, the Chief Operations Officer, Vice President of Los 

Pelambres, Vice President of Human Resources, and the General 
Managers and HR Managers of each relevant operation meet with 
union representatives during the year to share relevant information 
and listen to concerns and suggestions, the results of which are 
shared with the Remuneration and Talent Management Committee 
and the Board. 

•  The CEO met with union representatives during 2023, enabling the 
CEO to share business performance and challenges associated with 
the Group’s strategic framework, reinforce shared culture and 
values and listen to concerns and ideas. The purpose of these 
meetings is to foster a collaborative dialogue and working 
environment.

•  Group-wide employee engagement surveys are conducted every 
two or three years. These surveys are conducted by independent 
third parties on behalf of the Group, and the results are reported to 
the Remuneration and Talent Management Committee and the 
Board. Engagement surveys were conducted across the Mining 
Division in 2022, and the results were reviewed with the 
Remuneration and Talent Management Committee and the Board. 
During 2023, the Group conducted a psychosocial survey for all 
employees and the results were reviewed with the Remuneration 
and Talent Management Committee, and in general the risks 
reported for Group employees were considered to be low. The 
results of these activities are overseen by the Executive Committee 
and reported to the Remuneration and Talent Management 
Committee and the Board.

•  The Group’s workforce is encouraged to report any concerns to the 
Ethics Committee through the confidential whistleblowing hotline. 
Reports may be made anonymously. All reports are investigated and 
reported to the Audit and Risk Committee and the Board.

During 2023, the Board applied feedback received from the workforce 
to decisions related to talent retention initiatives, the oversight of 
labour negotiations and the development of the Group’s Diversity and 
Inclusion Strategy.

The Group maintains strong relations with its workforce, based on 
trust, continuous dialogue and favourable working conditions. The 
Board has carefully considered and reviewed the mechanisms in place 
to allow the Board to understand the views of the Group’s workforce. 
Ultimately, the Board has decided not to adopt any of the three 
workforce engagement mechanisms recommended in the UK 
Corporate Governance Code (a Director appointed from the workforce, 
a formal workforce advisory panel or a designated non-executive 
director). The Board considers that adopting any of these mechanisms 
would interfere with the effective, structured and formal combination 
of mechanisms already in place with a highly unionised workforce.

The Group’s workforce comprises 29,705 people, including employees, 
permanent contractors and temporary contractors associated with 
projects. Approximately 25% of the workforce are Group employees 
and 75% are employees of contractor companies. More than 99% of 
the Group’s employees are in Chile, and approximately 61% are based 
in the Antofagasta and Coquimbo Regions of Chile, where the Group’s 
operating companies are located.

Approximately 79% of the Group’s employees are unionised. This 
number is close to 100% at the operator level. The Group maintains 
ongoing dialogue with labour unions and key issues are raised with, 
and discussed by, the Remuneration and Talent Management 
Committee and the Board.

The Group has established control mechanisms to ensure that 
contractor companies’, whose employees are often members of their 
own labour unions, meet the Group’s standards and guidelines on 
labour, environmental and social and ethical matters and adopt good 
practices with regard to safe workplaces and the quality of 
employment. Contractors’ employees receive the same minimum 
protections as the Group’s employees under Chilean labour law and 
the Group requires contractors to pay their employees ethical wages 
– which as of December 2023 were 35% higher than the Chilean 
legal minimum – and to provide other basic benefits, including life 
and health insurance. These protections are subject to regular audits 
by independent third parties to ensure full compliance with these 
standards.

Below is a selection of the workforce engagement mechanisms that 
the Board currently has in place:

•  Directors regularly visit the Group’s operations either individually or 
in small groups throughout the year and engage informally with the 
workforce and other parties to gauge overall workforce culture. 
Impressions and views arising from these visits are reported to the 
Board and its Committees, and related questions are raised with the 
management team. 

•  Labour relations matters, proposed labour negotiation limits and 
feedback from labour negotiations are reported directly to the 
Remuneration and Talent Management Committee and the Board 
throughout the year as a key part of the CEO’s general updates to 
the Board.

1.  The Board reviews the independence of Directors annually. The Board has carefully 
considered the independence of all Directors and is satisfied that Francisca Castro, 
Michael Anglin, Tony Jensen, Eugenia Parot, Heather Lawrence and Tracey Kerr 
continue to be independent in character and judgement and that there are no 
relationships or circumstances that are likely to affect, or could appear to affect, their 
judgement. Further details are provided on page 135.

2.  Further details on the Board’s diversity policy can be found on pages 141-143.

3.  The Company has met the Parker Review target and in 2023 more than half the Board 
identified as being from an ethnic minority background according to the criteria in the 
Parker Review survey, as shown on page 143. As noted throughout this Annual Report, 
the Group’s footprint is primarily in Chile, where ethnicity profiles and representation in 
society differ significantly from those in the UK. Nevertheless, the Board recognises that 
the mining industry is international, and therefore the Board includes several Directors 
from outside Chile in support of its vision and strategy.

Roles in the boardroom

Board and senior management’s 
roles and responsibilities

The Group’s CEO, Iván Arriagada, is not a Director, reflecting the law and practice in Chile.1 Despite this, interaction between the 
Board and executive management is as you would expect between Non-Executive Directors and management in a typical UK-listed 
Company. The Board considers that there are considerable benefits associated with having a Board of exclusively Non-Executive 
Directors; it provides a broad range of perspectives and encourages robust debate with, and independent oversight of, the Group’s 
executive management.

Non-Executive Chairman

Jean-Paul Luksic

Leads the Board and ensures its 
effectiveness overall.

•  Promotes the highest standards of integrity, 

probity and corporate governance.
•  Sets the agenda for Board meetings in 

consultation with the Senior Independent 
Director, CEO and the Company Secretary.
•  Chairs meetings and ensures that there is 
adequate time for discussion of all agenda 
items, focusing on strategic, rather than 
routine, issues.

•  Promotes a culture of openness and debate 
within the Board by facilitating constructive 
Board relations and the effective 
contribution of all Directors.

•  Oversees Director induction, development 

and performance reviews.

•  Leads relations with shareholders, including 

the Group’s controlling shareholders.

Ramón Jara
Juan Claro
Andrónico Luksic C
Vivianne Blanlot4

Provide a range of outside perspectives to 
the Group and encourage robust debate 
with, and challenge of, the Group’s 
executive management.

•  The Board does not consider these 

Directors to be independent because they 
do not meet one or more of the 
independence criteria set out in the UK 
Corporate Governance Code.

•  Ensure that no individual or small group of 

individuals can dominate the Board’s 
decision-making.

Independent Non-Executive 
Directors2

CEO

Iván Arriagada

Francisca Castro 
Michael Anglin
Tony Jensen
Eugenia Parot
Heather Lawrence
Tracey Kerr

Ensure that no individual or small group of 
individuals can dominate the Board’s 
decision-making.

•  Meet the independence criteria set out in 
the UK Corporate Governance Code.2 
•  Have no connection with the Group or any 
other Director which could be perceived to 
compromise independence.

•  Provide a range of outside perspectives to 
the Group and encourage robust debate 
with, and challenge of, the Group’s 
executive management.

Leads the implementation of the Group’s 
strategy set by the Board.

•  Manages the overall operations and 

resources of the Group.

•  Leads the Executive Committee and 

ensures its effectiveness in all aspects 
of its duties.

•  Provides information and makes 

recommendations to the Board regarding 
the Group’s day-to-day activities and 
long-term plans.

Executive Committee members
Present proposals, recommendations and 
information to the Board within their areas 
of responsibility.

•  Support the CEO in the implementation of 
the Group’s strategy set by the Board.

Company Secretary

Julian Anderson

Provides a sounding Board for the Chairman 
and supports the Chairman in the delivery of 
his objectives as required.

Ensures that Directors have access to the 
information they need to perform their 
roles.

•  Where necessary, acts as an intermediary 
between the Chairman and the other 
members of the Board or the CEO.

•  Acts as an additional point of contact for 
shareholders, focusing on the Group’s 
governance and strategy, and gives 
shareholders an alternative means of 
raising concerns other than with the 
Chairman or senior management. 

•  Provides a conduit between Board and its 
Committees and a link between the Board 
and management.

•  Advises the Board on corporate 

governance and supports the Board in 
applying the UK Corporate Governance 
Code and complying with the UK listing 
regime and obligations.

Non-Executive Directors3

Senior Independent Director

Francisca Castro

The division of responsibilities between the Chairman, the CEO, and the Senior Independent Director is available on the Company’s website at antofagasta.co.uk.

1.  Chilean law prohibits CEOs of listed companies from being Directors of those companies. 
The CEO and CFO attend all Board meetings. The CEO also attends all Board Committee 
meetings and there is regular formal and informal dialogue between management and 
the Board.

2.  The Board reviews the independence of Directors annually. The Board has carefully 
considered the independence of all Directors and is satisfied that Francisca Castro, 
Mike Anglin, Tony Jensen, Eugenia Parot, Heather Lawrence and Tracey Kerr continue 
to be independent in character and judgement and that there are no relationships 
or circumstances that are likely to affect, or could appear to affect, their judgement.

3.  Ramón Jara provides advisory services to the Group. Andrónico Luksic C is the brother 
of Jean-Paul Luksic, the Chairman of the Company, and until 31 December 2023 served 
as Chairman of Quiñenco SA and Chairman or Director of certain of Quiñenco’s other 
listed subsidiaries. Jean-Paul Luksic is a Non-Executive Director of Quiñenco and some 
of its listed subsidiaries. Like Antofagasta plc, Quiñenco is controlled by a foundation in 
which members of the Luksic family are interested. Ramón Jara, Juan Claro and Vivianne 
Blanlot have served on the Board for more than nine years from the date of their first 
election. 

4.  Vivianne Blanlot was an independent Non-Executive Director until 27 March 2023, the 

ninth anniversary of her appointment to the Board.

CORPORATE GOVERNANCEDiversity, inclusion and succession 
planning

Q.What is the Committee’s role in relation to succession planning?

The Committee oversees and develops succession plans for the 
Board and the CEO. Succession planning for the Executive 
Committee (excluding the CEO) and broader employee talent 
management is overseen by the Remuneration and Talent 
Management Committee.

The activities of the Remuneration and Talent Management 
Committee are set out on page 156-178.

During 2023, the Committee reviewed the Board’s succession plan 
and recommended changes to Committee memberships, the 
appointment of independent Non-Executive Director Heather 
Lawrence, the appointment of Francisca Castro to the position of 
Senior Independent Director and advanced with the process for the 
selection of Tracey Kerr to be appointed as an independent 
Non-Executive Director in 2024. 

Q.How does the Committee address the process of CEO 

succession?

The Committee regularly reviews succession plans for the CEO in 
the case of either a planned or unplanned departure. This involves 
defining the character, skills, experience and expertise required to 
fulfil the role, as well as the assessment of potential internal 
candidates and their development needs. The consideration of both 
external and internal candidates for the role of CEO ensures a clear 
assessment of relative strengths and weaknesses and provides a 
useful international benchmark.

Q.What is the scope of the Board’s succession planning?

The Board’s succession plan is reviewed formally at least once a 
year and addresses Board size, Committee structure and 
composition, skills on the Board, Board and Committee members’ 
tenure, independence of Directors, diversity (including gender), 
Board roles, Board policies and individual succession plans for all 
Board and Committee positions. Succession plans include 
contingency plans in the event of an unexpected departure, medium-
term plans for orderly replacement of current Board members and 
long-term plans linking strategy with the skills needed on the Board 
in the future.

There is a Board approved succession plan for my Board roles in 
the event of an unexpected departure.

Q.How does the Board identify the appropriate skills for new Board 

candidates?

The Board maintains a Board skills matrix and the Committee 
reviews the balance of skills, experience and expertise on the Board 
at least annually. This process enables the Board and the Committee 
to identify the skills required when making new appointments to the 
Board and to instruct search firms to identify candidates who fit 
these criteria.

Q.What steps does the Committee take to identify and appoint new 

Directors?

The Committee discusses relevant profiles for future appointments 
and potential candidates, taking into account the results of Board 
effectiveness reviews, as shown on page 143, the Group’s purpose, 
vision, values and strategy, as shown on page 126-127, the Board’s 
diversity policy (below) and the core competencies and areas of 
expertise on the Board, as shown on page 134.

To assist with making new appointments to the Board, the 
Committee appoints independent external search consultancies with 
no connection to the Group. In 2023, the Committee appointed 
Spencer Stuart, a signatory to the voluntary code of conduct for 
executive search firms to address gender diversity on corporate 
practices for related search processes, to assist with the searches 
that resulted in the appointment of independent Non-Executive 
Directors Heather Lawrence and Tracey Kerr.

Spencer Stuart were briefed on the skills and experience of the 
existing Directors and asked to identify potential candidates who 
would best meet the required criteria including their relevant 
experience, skills, leadership capabilities, contribution to Board 
diversity and whether they had sufficient time to devote to the role. 
Also important for overall Board effectiveness is that potential 
candidates are proficient in Spanish and, preferably, have relevant 
mining or extractive industry experience. 

The searches that resulted in these appointments aimed to identify 
candidates with UK market experience, recent and relevant financial 
experience, mining experience and sustainability experience. The 
external search consultancy was instructed to access the widest 
possible talent pool and, as has been the case for many years, to 
specifically identify potential female candidates. 

Q.What support does the Company provide to facilitate induction 

and assist with professional development?

Induction 
New Directors receive a thorough induction on joining the Board. 
This includes meetings with the Chairman, other Directors, the CEO 
and Executive Committee members; briefings on the Group’s 
strategy, UK corporate governance, operations, projects and 
exploration activities; and visits to the Group’s operations.

Continuing personal development 
Directors receive an annual briefing on governance, legal, regulatory 
and market developments that are relevant to Directors of UK-listed 
companies, complemented by discussions on Board-related matters.

Directors have access to, and are encouraged to regularly attend, 
round-table discussions, seminars and other events that cover 
topics relevant to the Group and their roles.

Resources 
The Company provides Directors with the necessary resources to 
maintain and enhance their knowledge and capabilities.

All Directors have access to management and to such information 
as they need to discharge their duties and responsibilities fully and 
effectively.

Directors are also entitled to seek independent professional advice 
concerning the affairs of the Group at the Company’s expense.

Q.What is the Board’s position in relation to diversity?

The Company’s Diversity and Inclusion Policy reflects the Board’s 
belief in the benefits of diversity and its conviction that more diverse 
companies attract and maintain the best talent and achieve stronger 
overall performance. The Board considers a broad definition of 
diversity when setting policies, and appointing Directors and staffing 
its Committees (including the Nomination and Governance, Audit and 
Risk and Remuneration and Talent Management Committees), 
including gender, disability, nationality, educational and professional 
experience, personality type, culture and perspective.

Nomination and Governance Committee report continued

>40%

of Board members 
are women

100%

of our operating companies  
have female Board members

>50%

of our Board members identify as being  
from an ethnic minority background

The Committee has worked hard to ensure that the Board and its 
Committees are suitably diverse according to these criteria. The 
Board reviews its effectiveness in meeting diversity goals each year 
as part of the annual Board and Committees’ evaluation process.

The Company has met the Parker Review target and more than half 
the Board members identify as being from an ethnic minority 
background according to the Parker Review and UK Listing Rules 
criteria as shown in the diversity tables on page 143. As noted 
throughout this Annual Report, the Group’s activities are focused in 
Chile where ethnicity profiles and representation in society differ 
significantly from those in the UK. Nevertheless, the Board 
recognises that the mining industry is international, and in support of 
its vision and strategy also includes Directors from the United 
Kingdom, United States and Australia.

Gender diversity is a pillar of the Group’s diversity and inclusion 
strategy. The Board supports the important work performed by the 
FTSE Women Leaders’ Review in pursuing a 40% target for women 
on FTSE 350 boards and on executive committees and their direct 
reports and has met the Listing Rule targets for at least 40% of 
women on the Board and of at least one woman in the Chair, Senior 
Independent Director, CEO or CFO roles, as shown in the diversity 
tables on page 143.

Since 2014, five of the eight Board appointees (63%) have been women, 
while ensuring that appointments continue to be made on merit.

At the date of this report, there are five women on our Board of 11 
Directors (45%).

Each of the Nomination and Governance, Audit and Risk and 
Remuneration and Talent Management Committees include female 
Directors and Directors from ethnic minority backgrounds and more 
than 50% of the members of the Audit and Risk and Remuneration 
and Talent Management Committees are female. 

We are committed to promoting the participation of women on our 
Board, as well as in senior management positions and, just as 
importantly, in the Group’s workforce. We believe that such an 
increase will benefit the Group, the industry and Chile. 

Q.What policies are in place to promote a diverse pipeline of talent 

for the future?

The Group is committed to developing a diverse pipeline of talent 
that will widen the pool of female and other diverse candidates for 
Board and leadership positions in the future. In this, the Group is 
leading the way in Chile, particularly with female participation in the 
workforce, where Chile remains behind more developed economies 
despite considerable progress in recent years.

In 2019, we sponsored the creation of a Chilean chapter of the 30% 
Club, the campaign launched in the UK in 2010 to foster gender 
balance on companies’ boards and in senior management positions. 
To further promote diversity at the Executive Committee level and 
below, the current Diversity and Inclusion Policy was approved 
following an in-depth exercise to assess whether the Group’s 
existing diversity and inclusion model was appropriate. This included 
interviews with stakeholders, a benchmarking exercise and a 

142

Antofagasta plc  Annual Report 2023

comprehensive review of the Group’s policies and processes.  
The review identified structural impediments that needed to be 
addressed to achieve a sustained improvement in the Group’s 
diversity and inclusion model and these issues were addressed in 
the first years following approval of the new policy. A Diversity and 
Inclusion roadmap was developed to provide guidelines, best 
practices and objectives, seeking to integrate diversity and inclusion 
principles and values into the Company’s practices. The roadmap 
includes alliances with relevant educational institutions and 
organisations that promote diversity and inclusion. 

Metrics associated with the development of the Diversity and Inclusion 
Policy form part of the Group’s Annual Bonus Plan and formal talent 
management and succession planning exercise, and performance 
is assessed by the Remuneration and Talent Management Committee 
at the end of each year. In 2023, Management recommended, 
the Committee endorsed, and the Board approved that the 
short-term incentive include a key performance indicator on the 
number of women in leadership positions versus a baseline. 

The Remuneration and Talent Management Committee is also 
responsible for succession planning for the Executive Committee, 
which allows for ongoing monitoring of the impact of the Diversity 
and Inclusion Policy on new appointments and their progress within 
the Company, including at the level of those who report to the 
Executive Committee.

As part of the Policy, female members of senior management have 
served on the boards of all our operating companies for many years 
and we have two women on the Executive Committee, the General 
Manager of our Transport division and the Vice President of Human 
Resources.

It is important to acknowledge that culture plays a key role in this 
and we have therefore implemented actions and programmes to 
strengthen an inclusive culture, encompassing unconscious bias 
training, work-life balance measures, sexual harassment and 
domestic violence prevention, and information campaigns. Human 
resources processes, such as recruitment and the individual 
performance management system, have been reviewed and 
adjusted to ensure their inclusiveness and lack of bias.

Since 2017, we have more than doubled female participation to over 
20% and recently set ourselves a goal of reaching 30% female 
participation by 2025. The gender balance at each level of the Group 
is monitored and reported monthly to the Executive Committee.

In 2023, women represent 29% of the executive and supervisory 
workforce; 56% of them are in operational roles. 

The Suppliers for a Better Future Programme, which seeks to align 
contractor companies’ practices with Antofagasta, includes targets 
on hiring women. Currently, only 13% of contractor employees are 
women, with 80% of them concentrated in 25 specific roles within 
the supplier network. 

More detail on programmes we have introduced and the gender 
balance within the Group is given in the Our People section on page 40.

The Board will continue to monitor developments in 2024.

CORPORATE GOVERNANCEBoard effectiveness

Board effectiveness review
In accordance with the Code, the Board undertakes an annual effectiveness 
review which is externally facilitated at least once every three years. 

In 2022, the effectiveness review was facilitated by an external 
consultant, led by Clare Chalmers of Clare Chalmers Ltd, who is 
independent and, apart from also conducting the 2019 effectiveness 
review, has no other connection with the Group.

Ms Chalmers highlighted the Board’s strengths in skills, coverage of 
mining and a good mix of other relevant experience and backgrounds; 
strong engagement from the CEO and good access to the senior team, 
who get airtime in meetings; thorough NED site visits, with high-quality 
feedback to the Board.

In 2023, an internal evaluation of the Board and its Committees was carried 
out to monitor progress against recommendations made in the external 
review and to identify further opportunities for improvement, using thorough 
anonymous questionnaires that were completed by the Directors. The survey 
results demonstrated how recommendations made in the 2022 external 
review had been addressed. Strengths that were highlighted included the 
Chairman’s commitment to the Board, the Board’s effective leadership and 
strong support framework and the effectiveness of, and value added by, the 
Board’s Committees. Further opportunities for improvement centred on 
continuing to focus on balancing strategy and core business oversight 
discussions and continuing to improve presentations and pre-reading materials.

The annual effectiveness review is designed to recognise and raise key 
themes identified collectively by the Directors, along with suggestions 
for improvement and of good practice, and for the Directors to reflect 
on how these themes should be addressed going forward. Based on 
this review, the Directors were satisfied that the Board and its 
Committees operated effectively in 2023. 

JEAN-PAUL LUKSIC
Chair of the Nomination and Governance Committee

Our review process

2022

The external review was a comprehensive assessment of how 
the Board is working, focused on evaluating the following key 
areas:

•  Board composition and culture (composition, succession 

planning, training and inductions, leadership, dynamics and 
decision-making)

•  Board oversight (strategy, performance, risk, people and 
executive succession and purpose, values and culture)
•  Stakeholders (workforce engagement, shareholders, 

customers and suppliers, sustainability)

•  Board efficiency (Board meetings, agendas and minutes and 

secretariat)
•  The Committees
•  Board and Committee papers 

2023

The internal review was based on a thorough anonymous 
questionnaire completed by Directors that included specific 
questions relating to improvement opportunities identified in the 
2022 external review to measure progress as well as 
fundamental questions to assure Directors’ perceptions of the 
Board and Committee’s culture, governance and performance.

processes. At the same time, the Committee reviewed plans 
designed to ensure a smooth transition from PwC to Deloitte as 
external auditor. 

Financial reporting

Q.What were the Committee’s main activities in respect of the 

Group’s financial reporting?

The Committee reviews the year-end financial statements and 
half-year financial reports and ensures that the key accounting 
policies, estimates and judgements applied in those financial 
statements are reasonable. We also monitor the overall financial 
reporting process to ensure that it is robust and well-controlled. 
This includes ensuring that the Group’s accounting and finance 
function is adequately resourced, with the appropriate segregation 
of duties and internal review processes, that the Group’s accounting 
policies and procedures are appropriate and clearly communicated, 
and that the Group’s accounting and consolidation systems operate 
effectively.

The 2023 Annual Report includes the third report under the Task 
Force on Climate-related Financial Disclosures (TCFD) framework, 
with disclosures appropriately reflecting the Group’s position. 

We continued building our capability to prepare for new potential 
regulations regarding the Board’s confirmation of the effectiveness 
of internal controls over financial reporting.

The Committee assists the Board in undertaking its assessment that 
the Annual Report is, when taken as a whole, fair, balanced and 
understandable and that it provides the necessary information to 
allow shareholders to assess the Group’s position and performance, 
business model and strategy. As part of this assessment, we used 
our detailed knowledge of the Company, its financial results and the 
key accounting judgements applied in the financial statements to 
ensure that the tone and content of the narrative fairly reflected the 
financial results for the year.

We also reviewed the ore reserves and mineral resources statement 
included in the Annual Report and the corresponding reserve and 
resource independent audits. 

The Committee reviewed the going concern basis adopted in the 
financial statements, as well as the detailed long-term viability 
statement in the Annual Report.

including the effective tax rate, tax claims, the status of the recovery 
of tax refunds, tax-disallowed expenses and the impact of the new 
mining royalty in Chile.

The main accounting issues we considered were:

external audit process?

•  Asset valuations: The Committee’s analysis did not identify indicators 

of a potential impairment at the 2023 year-end at the Group’s 
operations. Accordingly, we have not performed any impairment 
reviews. Particular focus was placed on Zaldívar, given the 
importance of the ongoing permits renewal process, and the 
operational challenges in 2023. An indicative valuation and 
sensitivity analysis was performed in order to assess the 
sensitivities of the Group’s mining operations to key assumptions 
such as the copper price and the Chilean peso exchange rate, and to 
make appropriate disclosures within the financial statements. As 
part of this analysis, we considered the appropriate copper price 
forecasts to use, with reference to consensus analyst forecasts of 
the long-term copper price. We have also reviewed the key 
operating assumptions in the indicative valuation models. In the case 
of Zaldívar, we considered the importance of the renewal of the 
permits for water extraction and general mining activities to the 
indicative valuation, and the disclosures in respect of these aspects. 
We also reviewed the additional sensitivity disclosures included in 
the financial statements, including in relation to operational 
performance.

The Committee is responsible for overseeing the Company’s 
relationship with PwC, the Group’s external auditor. As the Chair of 
the Audit and Risk Committee, I have established an effective direct 
relationship with Simon Morley, PwC’s lead audit partner.

The Committee reviews and approves the scope of the external 
audit, terms of engagement and fees. The Committee monitors the 
effectiveness of the audit process and is responsible for ensuring 
the independence of the external auditor. The Committee informs 
the Board of the outcome of the external audit and explains how the 
external audit contributes to the integrity of the Group’s financial 
reporting. The Committee formally meets with PwC without 
management present at least once a year. We oversee the 
performance of the external auditor. The Committee makes 
recommendations to the Board in respect of the appointment, 
reappointment, or removal of the external auditor.

Following a tender process, the Committee recommended to the 
Board that, in respect of the 2024 financial year audit, Deloitte 
becomes the external auditor. Plans are well progressed to enable a 
smooth transition from PwC to Deloitte.

Impact of new mining royalty: the new mining royalty was approved 
in August 2023. Los Pelambres and Zaldívar’s tax invariability 
agreements expire in 2023, so the new royalty will apply from 2024 
onwards. The new royalty will apply to Antucoya from 2030 
onwards. Centinela has a number of tax invariability agreements, 
most expiring in 2029, and the Encuentro invariability agreement 
expires in 2031. Accounting regulations require that deferred tax 
balances be calculated using the tax rates which are expected to 
apply in the period in which the temporary differences are expected 
to reverse. This has resulted in an overall increase in the Group’s 
consolidated deferred tax liabilities as at 31 December 2023, with a 
corresponding deferred tax expense reflected in the 2023 results. 
•  Distributable reserves and related withholding tax provisioning: the 
withholding tax charge in the current period reflected a one-off 
adjustment of $34.7 million to the provision for deferred withholding 
tax, as a result of an intra-group restructuring of intercompany 
balances, essentially offsetting the increase in deferred tax liabilities 
resulting from the approval of the new royalty.

•  Going concern and viability: we reviewed the going concern and 
viability assessments and related disclosures. In particular, we 
considered the Group’s current strong financial position, its forecast 
future performance, the key risks which could impact the future 
results and reviewed robust down-side sensitivity analyses which all 
indicated outcomes that could be managed in the normal course of 
business.

process?

We work closely with PwC to ensure that external audit quality is 
maintained throughout the year. PwC incorporates feedback from 
both the Committee and management on the prior audit and 
engages extensively with management to align on critical success 
factors.

The Committee considers the following factors as part of its review 
of the effectiveness of the external audit process during the year:

•  the appropriateness of the proposed audit plan, the significant risk 
areas and areas of focus, and the effective performance of the 
audit

•  the technical skills and industry experience of the audit 

engagement partner and the wider audit team

•  the quality of the external auditor’s reporting to the Committee
•  the effectiveness of the co-ordination between the UK and 

Chilean audit teams

•  the effectiveness of the interaction and relationship between 

the Group’s management and the external auditor

•  feedback from management in respect of the effectiveness 
of the audit processes for the individual operations and the 
Group overall

•  the review of reports from the external auditor detailing its own 

internal quality control procedures, as well as its annual 
transparency report, and

•  the review of the FRC’s annual Quality Inspection Report on PwC.

In light of this assessment, the Committee considered it appropriate 
that PwC be reappointed as external auditor for 2023. However, 
as noted on page 120, Deloitte will take over the external audit from 
PwC for the 2024 financial year onwards and shareholders will 
be asked to confirm this appointment at the 2024 AGM.

Antofagasta plc  Annual Report 2023

CORPORATE GOVERNANCEQ.How do you assess the independence and objectivity of the 

external auditor?

The Committee regularly monitors the external auditor’s 
independence and objectivity in line with the Group’s policy in 
respect of auditor independence and non-audit services.

New regulatory requirements have applied since 2020 in respect of 
non-audit services. The FRC issued a “white list” of specifically-
permitted services, with all other services prohibited. Permitted 
services relate to specific activities required by law or regulation 
and a limited number of types of review or verification work, such 
as half-year reviews, verification of additional information contained 
within the Annual Report or cross-referenced from the Annual 
Report, and work as a reporting accountant on transactions or debt 
issuances. The provision of non-audit services is also subject to a 
cap, so that the total annual fees from non-audit services may not 
exceed 70% of the average audit fee over the prior three years.

A breakdown of the audit and non-audit fees is disclosed in Note 8 
to the financial statements. PwC did not provide any non-audit 
services (excluding audit-related services) during 2023. 

In general, where the external auditor is selected to provide 
non-audit services, it is because it has specific expertise or 
experience in the relevant area and is considered the most suitable 
provider. Pre-approval from the Committee is required before 
non-audit services can be performed by the external auditor, other 
than for services which are considered to be clearly trivial. The 
Committee has reviewed the level of these services over the year 
and is confident that the objectivity and independence of the auditor 
are not impaired by such non-audit work.

The external auditor provides a report to the Committee at least 
once a year, setting out its firm’s policies and procedures for 
maintaining its independence.

The Committee considers that PwC remained independent and 
objective throughout 2023.

The UK regulatory requirements in respect of competitive audit 
tendering and other related audit committee responsibilities in 
respect of the external auditor are set out in the Competition & 
Markets Authority´s “The Statutory Audit Services for Large 
Companies Market Investigation (Mandatory Use of Competitive 
Tender Processes and Audit Committee Responsibilities) Order 
2014” (“the Order”). The Company complied with the provisions of 
the Order during 2023.

Q.How long has PwC been the Group’s auditor?

We carried out a tender process during 2014, which resulted in 
PwC replacing Deloitte, the previous auditor, and being appointed 
with effect from 2015 onwards. Jason Burkitt was the lead audit 
partner at PwC for five years from 2015 to 2019 and, in line with 
normal regulatory requirements rotated off the engagement, with 
Simon Morley assuming the role as lead audit partner from 2020 
onwards.

Q.What are the plans for external auditor rotation?

Under UK regulations the Company’s next mandatory tender would 
have been in respect of the 2025 audit, marking the 10-year 
anniversary of the original audit rotation regulations. Other FTSE 
100 companies are facing similar anniversaries, which could result 
in an increased demand for audit tenders over the coming years. As 
previously disclosed, it was therefore determined that the optimum 
approach was to conduct an audit tender process during the second

with its annual update of the 
Group’s risk appetite assessment 
and evaluation of emerging and 
principal risks.”

half of 2022 in respect of the 2024 audit to allow for a “cooling-in” 
period during 2023 and to provide a significant transition period. 

PwC, Deloitte, EY and BDO participated in the tender process. 
KPMG declined our invitation to participate. BDO met the mid-tier 
“challenger” criteria that UK regulators are seeking to promote. 
Tendering firms held over 50 meetings with management and in my 
role as Chair of the Audit and Risk Committee, I participated in 
meetings with all tendering firms in advance of their formal tender 
presentations. 

The Committee reviewed proposals and recommended Deloitte to 
the Board as first choice, along with a second-choice 
recommendation. The Board selected Deloitte as the next external 
audit firm for the 2024 audit onwards.

Internal audit

Q.What are the Committee’s main activities in relation to internal 

audit?

The Committee monitors and reviews the effectiveness of the 
Group’s internal audit function. The Head of Internal Audit reports 
directly to the Committee and a meeting is held without management 
present at least once a year.

We also monitor succession planning and the resources available to 
the Internal Audit team so that it has an appropriate mix of skills and 
experience for the Group’s businesses. Internal Audit utilises a mix 
of permanent team members, temporary secondees from elsewhere 
in the Group and third parties, particularly for areas such as 
IT-related reviews. The permanent team includes members with 
specific expertise in some of the most relevant areas for the Group, 
including technical mining experience, IT, risk, compliance, internal 
control, sustainability and cyber security.

The Committee reviews and approves Internal Audit’s work plan for 
the coming year, including its focus areas as well as budget, 
headcount, methodology and other resources. Internal Audit takes a 
risk-focused approach when planning its work, using the risk 
registers maintained by each business to monitor and control their 
key risks. We ensure the plan is flexible and has sufficient resources 
to allow for special reviews that may be required during the year. 
During 2023, the Committee stewarded the completion of planned 
audits and approved the 2024 internal audit plan. 

Internal Audit presents to the Committee summaries of the key 
findings from the reviews conducted during the year and any 
actions that have been taken or proposed. All Internal Audit reports, 
when finalised, are distributed to Committee members.

The Committee reviewed actions to co-ordinate internal audit scope 
with PwC to avoid duplication or double testing, to ensure an 
efficient relationship between the internal and external audit 
processes, and achieve the effective and timely sharing of findings.

Audit and Risk Committee report continued

Risk management, compliance and internal control

Q.What are the Committee’s responsibilities in relation to risk 

management and internal control?

The Committee plays an important role in assisting the Board with 
its responsibilities regarding risk management and related controls. 
The Board has ultimate responsibility for overseeing the Group’s 
emerging and principal risks and its risk appetite, as well as 
maintaining adequate control systems which were in place 
throughout the year and up to the date of this report. The 
Committee’s terms of reference incorporate the FRC’s Guidance on 
Risk Management, Internal Control and Related Financial and 
Business Reporting and the Board is satisfied that the Company’s 
risk management and internal control systems accord with this 
guidance. In order to achieve our business objectives, internal 
control systems are designed to identify and manage, rather than 
eliminate, the risk of failure, but can only provide reasonable, not 
absolute, assurance against material misstatement or loss.

Q.What were the Committee’s main activities in 2023 relating to 

risk management?

We continued to monitor actions designed to enhance the maturity 
of our risk management processes. 

We assisted the Board with its annual update of the Group’s risk 
appetite assessment and evaluation of emerging and principal risks. 
Emerging risks are identified through the reporting of events that 
have had an impact on the Group’s operations and budgets during 
the year and whether and by how much the risk has impeded the 
budget for each risk mitigation objective, complemented by a 
benchmarking review of emerging and principal risks that have been 
identified by our peers. During 2023, the Committee and the Board 
reviewed the Group’s 18 key risks, sub-risks, preventative controls 
and action plans. While risk appetite levels have not changed, the 
Committee reviewed and the Board approved updates to the risk 
appetite statements for the principal environmental; political, legal 
and regulatory; and corruption risks and approved a wording 
change on tailings risk.

Active risk identification and management took place. Actions were 
taken during 2023 to strengthen the Group’s risk management 
culture including simplifying the risk management methodology, 
carrying out on-site verification, identifying new risks, updating 
business continuity plans, and implementing a methodology to 
monitor emerging risks. The focus in 2024 will be on the 
effectiveness of critical controls, in partnership with Internal Audit.

The risk, compliance and internal control function presented to the 
Committee several times during the year on developments in the 
Group’s risk management processes and Group-level strategic risks. 
The General Managers of the Group’s operations presented to the 
Committee their assessments of their respective operations’ top 
three risks, risk matrix and residual risks. The meeting served as a 
forum for sharing experiences and action steps. 

The analysis of emerging and principal risks includes an assessment 
of the significance of the risks based on the probability of the risk 
materialising and the potential impact of the risk, as well as an 
evaluation of the quality of the controls in place in respect of those 
specific risks. The evaluation of the potential impact is not limited to 
economic factors but includes issues such as safety, health, 
environmental, regulatory, community and reputational issues. We 
also examine whether those risks have been increasing or 
decreasing in significance and the budget for each risk mitigation 
objective to assist with the identification of emerging risks. The 

148

Antofagasta plc  Annual Report 2023

General Managers present their forecasts of any expected change in 
principal risks over the coming 12 months. If there is a specific issue 
at one of the operations that requires more detailed understanding, 
we ask the General Manager to attend the next meeting to discuss 
that issue. This direct interaction between the Committee and the 
General Managers is extremely valuable – not just in terms of the 
direct insight into each operation it affords the Committee, but in 
allowing us to emphasise the importance we attach to strong risk 
management processes. 

The Committee reviewed climate change and the financial impact of 
physical and transition risks and opportunities.

We reviewed steps taken to ensure that slavery and human 
trafficking are not occurring in any part of the Group’s business 
including its supply chains.

The Committee held a specific review of the latest developments in 
cyber security and updated action plans to enhance the Group’s 
maturity in this key risk area.

Q.How does the Committee interact with the Board and other 

Committees on risk-related matters?

I report to the Board following each Committee meeting, 
summarising the main matters reviewed. These regular reports 
allow Directors to understand the main issues under consideration 
and, when relevant, to discuss them in more detail with the Board.

The Risk Management function presents directly to the Board, 
providing updates of the analysis of the Group’s principal risks and 
mitigating actions. 

We try to ensure that the review of risk by the Board is not 
compartmentalised into isolated sessions but is integrated into 
everything considered by the Board. To this end, the overall report 
provided by the CEO to the Board at each meeting covers any 
significant materialised risks. Each proposal presented to the Board 
incorporates an analysis of its impact on the principal risks.

These processes have assisted the Board in carrying out a robust 
assessment of the emerging and principal risks facing the Company, 
including those that could threaten its business model, future 
performance, solvency, or liquidity and to assess the acceptability of 
the level of risks that arise from the Group’s operations and 
development activities.

The Board, with the support of the Committee, reviews the 
effectiveness of the Group’s risk management and internal control 
systems each year. The review covers all material controls, including 
financial, operating and compliance controls. The 2023 review 
considered a readiness assessment in preparation for changes in the 
UK Corporate Governance Code in respect of risk management and 
internal control processes which included: (1) the control framework 
and systems in place across the Group; (2) the nature of risk and 
control documentation currently in place and the processes for their 
regular review and update; (3) internal testing of the effectiveness of 
the relevant internal controls; and (4) integration of Internal Audit with 
risk management processes. The review concluded that there is a 
robust three line of defence model implemented which ensures 
several layers of internal responsibility and verification; there are 
standardised frameworks and systems used consistently across the 
Group’s operations; there is an appropriate analysis and 
documentation of key risks and controls, with regular reviews and 
updates; internal verification is performed across all areas on a 
regular basis; and Internal Audit is highly integrated into the Group’s 
risk management and internal control processes. Nevertheless, the 
Committee will continue to oversee specific areas of focus so that the 

CORPORATE GOVERNANCEBoard is in a strong position to consider the effectiveness of the 
Group's management and internal control systems in relation to the 
new Code requirements that will apply in 2026.

on the Group’s compliance model, crime prevention model and 
Modern Slavery Policy. We reviewed activities undertaken during the 
year to develop compliance maturity.

Members of the Audit and Risk Committee participate on all the 
other Board Committees, allowing the Committee a good 
understanding of risks being considered by these Committees and 
the full spectrum of risks faced by the Group.

Compliance

Q.What are the Committee’s main responsibilities relating to 

compliance?

The Committee ensures that appropriate compliance policies and 
procedures are observed throughout the Group. The risk, 
compliance and internal control function makes regular 
presentations to the Committee covering developments in the 
Group’s compliance processes and significant compliance issues. 
Chilean law requires the Mining division’s holding Company, 
Antofagasta Minerals SA, and each of the operations, to appoint a 
Crime Prevention Officer. The Committee makes recommendations 
regarding these appointments as well as monitoring and overseeing 
the performance of these roles. The Crime Prevention Officer for 
Antofagasta Minerals SA is currently Patricio Enei, the Vice 
President of Legal. As the compliance function reports to the CFO, 
this arrangement provides for the appropriate segregation of duties.

The Committee receives reports from the risk, compliance and 
internal control function in respect of the Group’s crime prevention 
model, in accordance with Chilean and UK anti-corruption legislation.

The Crime Prevention Officer presents a report directly to the Board 
every six months.

Q.What were the Committee’s main activities in 2023 relating to 

compliance?

The Committee monitored the functioning of the Group’s crime 
prevention model, in accordance with Chilean and UK anti-
corruption legislation. Compliance activities centred on the three 
pillars of prevention, detection and action. The crime prevention 
model was recertified. We reviewed training and communications  

The Committee reviewed the Group’s whistleblowing arrangements, 
which encourage employees and contractors to raise concerns in 
confidence about possible improprieties or non-compliance with the 
Group’s Code of Ethics. We received regular reports on reported 
whistleblowing incidents, detailing the number and type of incidents 
and outlining the most significant issues and the actions resulting 
from their investigation, along with plans to strengthen the function. 
The Committee reviewed the process to identify and manage Group 
employees’ potential conflicts of interest and reviewed the due 
diligence process conducted in respect of the Group’s suppliers.

Q.What were the Committee’s main activities in 2023 relating to 

internal control?

During 2023, the Committee reviewed the Company’s internal 
control framework which consists of three lines of defence. 

First, business units identify and manage risks. Second, the risk 
management function provides oversight and support. Third, Internal 
Audit provides independent assurance. In addition to regular 
reviews, a session was held to review the effectiveness of risk 
management, compliance and internal control, the effectiveness of 
internal controls over financial reporting, and the effectiveness of 
internal audit and the relationship with external audit. We feel 
confident that the reviews undertaken by the Committee during 
2023 have allowed it to perform an appropriate review of the 
effectiveness of the Group’s risk management and internal control 
systems during the year. The reporting of these activities by the 
Committee to the Board supports the Board’s confirmation that it 
has undertaken a review of the effectiveness of the Group’s risk 
management and internal control systems during the year as 
required by the UK Corporate Governance Code.

Q.How was the Group’s safety performance in 2023?

This was a true highlight for 2023. We are very pleased to report 
that the Group recorded its strongest safety performance on record. 
During the year, there were no fatal accidents and the Group 
recorded only 34 High Potential Incidents, 19% fewer than in 2022. 
The Lost Time Injury Frequency Rate also improved by 25% to 0.63. 
The challenge in 2024 is to further improve on these results.

Q.What is the Committee’s role in respect of the Company’s policies 

that relate to sustainability and stakeholder management?

The Committee oversees the development of the Group’s policies 
relating to sustainability and stakeholder management. The 
Committee does not review implementation – this is a matter 
for each individual Operating Company. 

During 2023 the Committee provided input on the policy relating 
to the adoption of the new Global Industry Standard on Tailings 
Management (GISTM) which was published by ICMM in August 2020.

Q.How did the Committee consider climate change during the year?

As noted by the Chairman on pages 120-121, combating climate 
change sits at the centre of Antofagasta’s strategy. In particular, 
lowering emissions and reducing continental water use remain two 
issues for which we have a Group-level strategy, Board-level focus 
and Company-wide initiatives.

The Committee assisted the Board in considering various climate 
change-related initiatives during the year, including those in the 
Board’s assessment of the physical and transition risks of climate 
change and their impact on the net present value of the Group. The 
Group’s Climate Change Strategy, reviewed by the Committee and 
approved by the Board in 2020, takes a multidisciplinary approach 
to the challenges posed by climate change, focusing on the 
development of climate change resilience, the reduction of 
greenhouse gas emissions, the efficient use of strategic resources, 
the management of the environment and biodiversity, and the 
integration of stakeholders. 

The Committee reviewed the community water situation in the 
Choapa Valley, Los Pelambres’ water management strategy and 
operational water management initiatives. 

The Board reviewed the Company’s carbon footprint, approved the 
Company’s decarbonisation plan, set emissions reduction targets 
and committed to revisiting them in 2025.

Q.How does the Committee ensure that the Board considers the 

views and interests of stakeholders?

The Committee does not get involved in the day-to-day management 
and implementation of the Group’s policies and procedures. 
However, meetings provide a forum to discuss key trends and 
issues that matter to local communities, our workforce, national and 
local governments, regulators and other stakeholders. Many of these 
issues are identified as part of each operating companies’ risk 
management and community engagement processes, which are 
submitted by management to the Committee for their information. 

152

Antofagasta plc  Annual Report 2023

Communicating with our stakeholders during difficult times has been 
key to strengthening mutual trust and understanding. We work hard 
to respect their interests and ensure that they understand our 
ambitious safety, occupational health, environmental and social 
commitments. 

As Chair of the Committee, I report to the Board following each 
Committee meeting, summarising the main matters reviewed by the 
Committee.

Q.How does the Committee ensure that the Group’s tailings storage 

facilities are safe?

The stability and safety of our tailings storage facilities (TSFs) is a 
primary concern for us and many of our stakeholders, and the 
Committee and the Board are focused on ensuring that the policies 
and procedures implemented by our operating companies ensure 
that the TSFs continue to be stable and safe.

Chile experiences a significant amount of seismic activity and as a 
consequence there are strict regulations governing the construction 
of TSFs in the country. These regulations apply to all mining and 
other construction, including the storage facilities where tailings are 
deposited. Chilean standards have prohibited the construction of 
TSFs using the upstream method, which is commonly used in other 
countries but can pose significant safety risks. Current Chilean 
legislation also requires a stability analysis of TSFs’ walls, a review 
of safety measures and the development of detailed emergency 
plans in the event of a major incident.

The Group’s governance structures are designed to encourage the 
independent management and monitoring of our TSFs: internal 
teams have reporting lines not linked to the mine operation and an 
independent tailings review board (ITRB) visits our TSFs regularly, 
assessing risks and making recommendations to ensure their 
continued safety. The Committee and the Board review these 
reports and challenge management on their recommendations.

The Committee and the Board also receive regular reports on the 
operation of the Group’s TSFs. Following the Group’s adoption in 
2020 of a tailings management policy aligned with the Global 
Industry Standard on Tailings Management (GISTM), the Committee 
has monitored operating companies’ policies, along with reports 
from management and the ITRB. Operating companies have 
established their own governance structures, plans, tailings 
management systems and implementation timelines.

The Group committed to fulfil GISTM requirements by August 2023 
for its critical tailings’ deposits and by August 2025 for its lower-
risk ones. On 5 August 2023, companies in the Group announced 
that they had complied with GISTM requirements for El Mauro, its 
only critical tailings deposit and for Centinela, classified as 
significant, two years ahead of the commitment. Dam safety 
reviews, required by GISTM, were conducted prior to the GISTM 
fulfilment declaration in August 2023. The Committee reviews 
executives’ reports on an annual basis.

Further information on our TSFs, including the risks and the 
governance measures in place, can be found on page 55.

Q.How are community relations managed throughout the Group?

Dialogue with local communities is crucial for aligning views, 
preventing disputes and addressing concerns. To strengthen this, 
our operating companies use various engagement mechanisms, 
including conversations with members of the community, round 
tables, community meetings, participatory environmental monitoring 

CORPORATE GOVERNANCE“The Committee makes 
recommendations to the Board to 
ensure the views and interests of 
the Group’s stakeholders are 
considered in the Board’s 
deliberations.”

with the community and site visits to our operations, as well as 
communicating through the media and on websites and social 
networks.

The material subjects and results of this engagement are reported 
periodically to the Committee through standalone reports and as 
part of broader Committee discussions.

Q.What are the Committee’s priorities in 2024?

Our number one priority continues to be the health and safety of our 
employees, contractors and local communities. We will continue to 
provide feedback to our mining operations, encouraging them to 
further improve upon the Company’s record safety performance in 
2023 and continue to reinforce the practices that resulted in this 
strong performance.

The Committee will continue to receive feedback from our mining 
operations on the implementation of the Group’s environmental 
management system and we will continue to oversee the 
implementation of our Climate Change Strategy, aimed at meeting 
our greenhouse gas targets for reduced carbon dioxide emissions. 

The Committee will continue to oversee the progress towards 
obtaining material environmental permits for the Group’s major 
development projects during the year and will monitor whether the 
Group’s social programmes and the work done with communities 
close to our operations is in accordance with the Group’s Social 
Management Model.

Key responsibilities

The Projects Committee reviews all aspects of major projects to be 
submitted for Board approval, highlighting key matters for the Board’s 
consideration throughout the project’s development and making 
recommendations to management to ensure that all projects submitted 
to the Board are aligned with the Group’s strategy and risk appetite.

The Committee adds an important level of governance and control to 
the evaluation of the Group’s projects and plays a key role in providing 
the Board with additional oversight of the Group’s projects portfolio. 
This includes overseeing the establishment of project development 
guidelines, drawing from best practice, industry experience and 
lessons learned from other Group projects.

MICHAEL ANGLIN
Chair of the Projects Committee

Key activities in 2023

Policies and commitments

•  Reviewed the Group’s projects portfolio, including budgets and 

schedules.

Project reviews – studies phase

•  Reviewed an update on Los Pelambres’ plans to further expand the 
Company’s desalination plant, in addition to a new concentrate pipeline 
and work to develop enclosures at the El Mauro tailings facility.

•  Reviewed an update on Los Pelambres’ Phase 2 Expansion Project.
•  Monitored steps leading up to the Board’s consideration of the 
Centinela Second Concentrator project investment decision. 

•  Reviewed Centinela’s in-pit tailings deposition project.

Project reviews – execution phase

•  Monitored progress in the execution of the Los Pelambres Phase 1 

Expansion Project. 

Q.What is the Projects Committee’s approval authority?

The Committee is not responsible for approving projects – that is 
for the Board to decide. Our role is to assist the Board by ensuring 
that projects are following a standard, structured process using 
consistent analysis, execution and evaluation practices. The 
Committee oversees the full project development, from the early 
stages to the start of operations, carefully assessing and robustly 
challenging investment proposals prior to submission to the Board, 
monitoring development and construction progress and ensuring 
lessons learned are applied to future proposals. The Committee 
invites management to consider different perspectives, ideas 
and improvements to enhance the value of the Group’s projects, 
enabling focused deliberation when the project is presented 
to the Board.

CORPORATE GOVERNANCEQ.What tools does the Committee use?

Studies – Centinela Second Concentrator project

The Committee provides guidance to each project manager, from 
the early stages of project planning through to completion, to ensure 
that policies, strategies and the Group’s Asset Delivery System 
(ADS) implementation framework are applied.

ADS is a project management system whose processes and 
practices are widely used in the mining industry. ADS sets 
standards and common criteria, including governance by a steering 
committee, functional quality assurance reviews and risk 
management.

In some cases, the Committee may recommend additional 
measures, including independent peer reviews, trade-off studies or 
further analysis in relation to the incorporation of potential new 
technologies or processes.

Q.What were the Committee’s key activities in 2023?

Execution – Phase 1 of the Los Pelambres Expansion project

The Committee monitored progress in the execution of the Los 
Pelambres Expansion, including a detailed review of issues 
associated with the closing of the project and lessons learned. 

See page 29 for more information on Phase 1 of the Los Pelambres 
Expansion project.

Studies – Future development of Los Pelambres

The Committee reviewed an update on Los Pelambres’ planned 
expansion of its desalination plant, which seeks to fulfil production 
commitments by ensuring water supply through an expansion  
of the desalination plant to 800 l/s, in addition to the construction  
of a new concentrate pipeline. The project was approved at the 
beginning of 2024.

The Committee also reviewed an update on the next phase of 
investment at Los Pelambres which included early community 
participation to enable the submission of the EIA.

See page 100 for more information on further development of Los 
Pelambres.

“The Committee supports the Board 
by ensuring that the Group’s 
projects portfolio follows approved 
and consistent guidelines and that 
project execution decisions have 
been thoroughly reviewed before 
being put forward for Board 
approval.”

The Committee reviewed progress in the commitment phase of 
Centinela’s Second Concentrator project. 

The Committee reviewed the project’s sustainability profile, noting 
that 100% of the power will come from renewable sources, and that 
it will use sea water and thickened tailings. Environmentally, the 
project seeks to avoid and, if necessary, control any environmental 
impact associated with its development, including air quality, 
archaeological preservation and biodiversity. Socially, the project 
seeks to generate positive externalities and benefits in the supply 
chain and manage reputational risks. It has identified all relevant 
stakeholders, established a community relations strategy and is 
developing stakeholder, community and communications plans. With 
respect to climate change, the objective is to facilitate early action 
and adaptation in relation to risks and opportunities. 

The Committee monitored preparation for the Centinela Second 
Concentrator project including reviewing progress on engineering, 
contracting, and financing. The Committee reviewed the partial 
cancellation of mining easements, fulfilling the project’s 
environmental resolution (RCA). The Committee also reviewed the 
awarding of contracts for the project and a potential build-own-
operate-transfer (BOOT) contract for Centinela’s current and future 
water infrastructure. 

The Board approved the investment decision in December 2023.

See page 15 for more information on Centinela’s Second 
Concentrator project.

Studies – In-pit tailings deposition project

The Committee reviewed Centinela’s in-pit tailings deposition 
project, which considers using the Tesoro Central pit to cover 
Centinela’s tailings management needs for 9–10 years; to be 
followed by the Tesoro North East and Esperanza pits, to cover 
Centinela’s tailings management needs for 15 years and possibly for 
the life-of-mine. This project would defer investment in raising the 
height of the walls of the current tailings storage facility.

Q.What are the Committee’s priorities in 2024?

The Committee will continue to monitor the Group’s key projects. 
The Committee will oversee the ramp up of Phase 1 of the Los 
Pelambres Expansion project.
The Committee plans to monitor the progress of Centinela’s Second 
Concentrator project and the next phase of investment at Los 
Pelambres, including monitoring progress of the licencing 
application process for the Los Pelambres’ Phase 2 Expansion 
Project (Mine Life Extension).

Antofagasta plc  Annual Report 2023

FRANCISCA CASTRO
Chair of the Remuneration and  
Talent Management Committee

Dear shareholders

I am pleased to present the Directors’ and CEO’s Remuneration Report 
for the year ended 31 December 2023. 

This report comprises:

•  this letter
•  an ‘at a glance’ section, and 
•  the Annual Report on remuneration. This details the implementation 
of our pay policy in 2023 and the proposed implementation of our 
pay policy for 2024. This section also contains a summary of the 
2023 Directors’ and CEO’s Remuneration Policy as approved by 
shareholders at the AGM in 2023. Details of the full policy are 
available on our website (www.antofagasta.co.uk). 

I would like to thank shareholders for their support at the 2023 AGM 
where our remuneration policy received 94.33% votes in favour, and 
the Directors’ remuneration report received 95.17% votes in favour. 
We continue to seek to engage shareholders for their views and 
feedback on Antofagasta’s remuneration arrangements. 

CEO and Directors’ remuneration in context

The Committee considers a range of factors and KPIs when making 
decisions on remuneration, including the views of stakeholders 
(including shareholders and employees) and the Company’s 
performance. A summary of these factors and KPIs is set out in the 
“at a glance” section on page 160. However, I would like to highlight a 
number of important aspects of this report:

•  Despite challenging headwinds, 2023 was a year of significant 

progress, and we are pleased to be moving forward into the next 
phase of development and growth. Financial performance in 2023 
was solid, revenue was 8% higher than 2022, EBITDA grew 5%, 
cash flow from operations increased 11% and net cash costs were 
consistent year-on-year. Operational performance highlights include 
a 2% increase in Group copper production and finalising the delivery 
of the Phase 1 Expansion Project at Los Pelambres, which will help 
to maintain this asset’s future production. The financial and 
operational performance of the Group was carefully considered 
when reviewing the incentive outturns in respect of 2023. 

CORPORATE GOVERNANCE•  The health and safety of people remains our top priority and our 
Board sets the standard in prioritising the safety and wellbeing of 
our employees and contractors. In 2023, we recorded another 
strong year of safety performance, with no fatalities and a Lost Time 
Injury Frequency Rate of 0.63, a 25% reduction year-on-year. In 
2023 management focused on strengthening risk monitoring and 
targeting safety initiatives in high-risk areas. We also monitored and 
targeted reduction of occupational hazard risks (e.g. excessive 
noise, pollutants), as well as addressing physical and mental 
wellbeing. 

•  We are committed to creating a diverse and inclusive culture that 
fosters wellbeing and supports retention and development of a 
range of talents. In 2023, the proportion of women employed 
increased to 23.6%, exceeding our target for the year. Our 
apprenticeship scheme accepted a total of 247 candidates, mostly 
from local communities, 83% of whom were women. We continue to 
focus on increasing the number of employees with disabilities and in 
2023 disabled employees represented 1.4% of the workforce, a 15% 
increase on last year. 

•  We maintain excellent relations with our workforce and six new 

collective bargaining agreements were successfully concluded by 
the end of December 2023. These agreements are on top of the 
inflation linked increases that are already built into agreements and 
employees' contracts providing financial security in periods of higher 
inflation. 

•  During 2023, in my capacity as the Senior Independent Director 

and Chair of the Remuneration and Talent Management Committee, 
I travelled to our operations at Los Pelambres, Centinela and Zaldívar 
with other members of the Board to speak with employees and 
contractors of the Group to understand their day-to-day experiences 
and to hear their views and ideas. I met with groups of female 
employees to understand the challenges they face, working in a 
predominantly male dominated industry and working environment. 
I am grateful for the valuable insights shared by all those we met 
with and have reported these back to the rest of the Board. The 
Remuneration Committee will keep these insights in mind through 
2024 when decision-making. 

•  During 2023 we developed a decarbonisation strategy, and through 
this work, the Company has been able to publish updated emissions 
reduction targets. 

•  We are strongly positioned to supply the much-needed copper that 

plays an integral role in the world’s transition to a low carbon 
economy. We endeavour to meet that demand in a responsible and 
sustainable way, ensuring we create value not just for our 
shareholders, but also for our employees, our communities, our 
partners, and our planet as a whole. 

CEO’s performance and incentive outcomes 
for the year 

Overall, the Committee is comfortable that the range of incentive 
outcomes described below adequately reflects the performance of the 
Group and CEO and demonstrates the balanced nature of the incentive 
plan measures and targets in operation. 

Annual bonus outcome

The overall bonus for the CEO was 78.7% of the maximum. 

Group performance (70% of bonus)

The result for Core Business targets was 45% of the maximum target, 
recognising the challenging headwinds of higher inflation and input 
costs during the year, as well as water scarcity due to the delay in the 
desalination plant impacting copper production. Despite these 
challenges, copper production increased 2% year-on-year and EBITDA 
results were solid, between target and maximum of our original STI 
(short term incentive) targeted performance supported by the higher 
commodity prices of our secondary metals. The result for the Business 
Development targets was 65% of maximum, and the Sustainability and 
Organisational Capabilities targets was 90% of maximum, with safety 
being met in full. The outcome of 60% of maximum was automatically 
adjusted upwards in line with our remuneration policy, as there were 
no fatal accidents during the year. This safety adjustment to the 
performance score outcome was equal to +10 percentage points.

LTIP outcome

The anticipated vesting level for the 2021 LTIP awards is 81.3% of the 
maximum. The outcome of the relative total shareholder return 
measure of the LTIP performance targets will not be known until after 
the Annual Report is published, but it is anticipated that the 
achievement will be 62.6% of the maximum. 100% of the Mineral 
Resources Increase target was achieved, as well as 100% of the 
Environmental and Social commitments targets and 100% of the 
Projects’ portfolio performance targets. The actual final vesting for the 
LTIP will be included in next year’s report.

Remuneration and Talent Management Committee Chair’s introduction continued

Our approach to the CEO’s remuneration in 2024

Base salary

The CEO’s annual base salary is paid in Chilean pesos, and presented in this report in US dollars. The CEO's annual 
base salary will be $1,284,017 from 1 January 2024. During 2023, the CEO’s base salary was periodically reviewed 
and adjusted for inflation, in line with our remuneration policy and the CEO’s employment contract. The CEO’s base 
salary is also periodically reviewed and adjusted to reflect exchange rate adjustments, however, the exchange rate 
hurdle of 5% was not met in November 2023, therefore no related adjustment was made. The Chilean peso/US dollar 
exchange rate will continue to be monitored during 2024. The Committee continues to monitor the value of the overall 
remuneration package of the CEO in comparison to peers in the FTSE 100 mining industry and our core global copper 
mining peer group.

Annual bonus 

The Committee continues to agree that the annual bonus balanced scorecard works well and focuses on the right 
KPIs for the business. 

The scorecard for 2024 reflects the scorecard for 2023, with some minor changes that are intended to optimise 
performance assessment and focus management on our key goals. Core Business objective weightings have been 
adjusted to allow for the inclusion of Innovation. Innovation was previously part of the Business Development 
objectives; however, the Committee believe that Innovation is key to our day-to-day operations and success, and 
henceforth should be a Core Business focus.

LTIP 

Our fundamental LTIP structure and KPIs remain unchanged with a balanced scorecard measuring relative returns 
to shareholders, focusing on critical aspects of our projects portfolio, environmental and sustainability commitments.

For 2024 we have adjusted the weightings associated with Mineral resources (formerly 25%, reduced to 12.5%) 
and Projects’ performance (formerly 12.5%, increased to 25%) to enhance the focus on, and visibility of, Projects’ 
performance, as we strive to meet the challenges set out in our Group strategy over the next 3 years.

In addition, for 2024, to reflect the importance of safe environmental practices to the Group, we have introduced 
compliance with the Global Industry Standard on Tailings Management as a target in the sustainability commitments. 
Under our remuneration policy the Committee has the ability exceptionally to make an LTI award up to 325% of base 
pay. The Committee has decided to award the CEO an LTIP award of 300% for 2024, to maintain the competitiveness 
of our CEO remuneration package and ensure continued leadership stability of the organisation at this time of growth. 
Our company is a world leading copper company and we have a world leading CEO, recognised in many markets for 
his expertise and experience and we compete for talent on a global stage including companies in the US, UK, Australia 
and local companies in South America and Chile. The Committee is conscious of increasing pressure on levels of pay 
for top talent in the global mining market and recent changes and proposals in the UK FTSE 100 market. Retaining 
our CEO and leadership team is essential to the delivery of our long term goals and delivery of shareholder value. 
Even with this increased exceptional award and the 2024 base pay, the level of total target remuneration, using 2023 
comparative peer pay data, remains below the lower quartile of both the FTSE 100 mining peer group and our global 
copper mining peers.

Directors’ fees

No fee changes are anticipated for Directors in 2024. 

Find out more on page 178.

The remuneration policy operated as intended for 2023 and no changes to the policy are considered necessary for 2024. The implementation of 
the remuneration policy in 2024 will be in line with the remuneration policy approved by shareholders at the AGM in 2023.

Summary of the 2023 Directors’ 
and CEO’s remuneration policy

The tables below set out a summary of the Remuneration Policy that was approved by shareholders at the Company’s AGM that took place 
on 10 May 2023. The full Policy is available on the Company’s website (www.antofagasta.co.uk).

Performance measures

Individual and mining division performance is 
considered when determining base salaries and 
increases.

Base salary

To retain and attract 
high-calibre executives 
by offering globally 
competitive salary 
levels. 

Typically, base salaries 
are reviewed annually.

Base salaries and any 
increases take into 
account:

•  the individual’s role, 
performance and 
experience,
•  the Company’s 

performance, the 
external environment 
and cost,

•  salary increases for 
the wider workforce, 
and

•  salary levels for 

comparable roles at 
relevant comparator 
companies.

There is no prescribed 
maximum, although salary 
increases consider those of the 
wider workforce. Chilean labour 
contracts are adjusted 
periodically to reflect Chilean 
inflation, and adjustments may 
also be made due to union 
labour negotiations.

In addition to the salary 
increases already mentioned, 
there may be additional 
increases when the Committee 
considers it appropriate, 
including (but not limited to): 

• 

•  a significant increase in the 
scale, market comparability 
or responsibilities of the role, 
and
individuals appointed on a 
salary lower than market 
levels, where increases 
above those of the wider 
workforce may be made to 
recognise experience gained 
and performance in the role.

Such increases will be explained 
in the relevant Annual Report.

Benefits

To provide market 
competitive benefits.

Benefits typically include 
life and health insurance. 
Other benefits may be 
offered where 
appropriate, including, 
but not limited to, car 
allowance, pension 
contribution, 
professional fees and 
relocation allowances.

Benefits are reviewed 
periodically.

None

There is no maximum overall.

Maximum opportunity

Performance measures

The bonus is earned 
based on achieving 
one-year performance 
targets. It is paid in cash.

Maximum of 200% of salary 

Purpose and link 
to strategy

Annual Bonus Plan

To focus on delivering 
annual financial and 
non-financial targets 
designed to align 
remuneration with the 
Company’s strategy 
and to create a 
platform for future 
sustainable 
performance.

Maximum of 200% of salary, 
increased to 325% in 
exceptional circumstances.

Long-Term Incentive Plan (LTIP) 

To align with the 
shareholders’ 
experience and focus 
on long-term, 
sustainable 
performance.

Awards under the LTIP 
will typically comprise:

•  Performance Awards 
– performance is 
measured over a 
three-year period with 
vesting, thereafter, 
comprising at least 
70% of the total LTIP 
awards.

•  Restricted Awards 

– vest one-third each 
year over a three-
year period, 
comprising a 
maximum of 30% of 
the total LTIP awards.

Awards will usually be 
made in the form of a 
conditional right to 
receive a cash payment 
by reference to the value 
of a specified number of 
the Company’s shares.

Malus may be applied in 
exceptional 
circumstances, as 
detailed in the notes to 
the Policy table in the 
2022 Annual Report. 

The bonus is based on financial, operational, 
strategic and individual measures.

Performance measures and weightings are 
reviewed annually to ensure they continue to 
reflect the Company’s strategic priorities. At least 
50% of the bonus will be based on the Mining 
division’s financial, operational and strategic 
performance. Other metrics include, but are not 
limited to, business development, organisational 
capabilities, sustainability and safety.

In addition, an automatic adjustment applies to the 
Mining division’s performance score under the 
Annual Bonus Plan, downwards if there is a fatality 
during the year and upwards if there is no fatality. 
This further aligns the Mining division’s incentives 
with the core value of safety and our goal of zero 
fatalities. The Committee will consider whether this 
should continue to apply annually, considering the 
Mining division’s safety culture and performance.

The annual bonus starts accruing at ‘threshold’ 
performance (0% payout), with a payout of 50% of 
the ‘maximum’ when ‘on-target’ performance is 
achieved.

The Committee retains the discretion to adjust 
bonus outcomes to ensure they reflect underlying 
business performance, the impact of the 
commodity price and any other relevant factors. 

Performance Awards will be based on a 
combination of shareholder return and strategic 
performance measures aligned with the business 
priorities. 

The targets, measures and weightings are 
determined by the Committee annually. The 
shareholder return measures are at least 50% of 
the Performance Awards.

Performance Awards begin vesting at ‘threshold’ 
performance, with the amount depending on the 
performance metric. This level is intended across 
all metrics to be 0% at the threshold and an 
aggregate average of approximately 50% of the 
maximum at ‘on-target’ performance.

No performance conditions usually apply to 
Restricted Awards.

The Committee retains the discretion to adjust 
payments to ensure they reflect underlying 
business performance, the impact of the 
commodity price and any other relevant factors.

Our remuneration philosophy

Our remuneration philosophy reflects local 
regulations and market practices while aligning 
with UK best practices and governance. 
Local regulations, market practices and remuneration structures 
available in Chile are a central consideration when structuring the 
CEO’s remuneration. Real share awards have not been part of the 
executive remuneration structure for employees since the LTIP was 
first implemented a decade ago because, until recently, in Chile they 
were taxable in full at the date they were granted. Considering the 
potential future uncertainty on taxation and as the use of real shares 
continues to be uncommon in Chile, all the Company awards continue 
as cash awards linked to a notional number of shares and share price 
performance.

Although our CEO is not a Director of the Company, we have 
voluntarily disclosed his remuneration since 2014 and provided details 
throughout the remuneration report to allow shareholders to 
understand how these structures support the strategy and promote 
long-term sustainable success. Since the implementation of the 
European Shareholders’ Rights Directive II in 2019, these disclosures 
have become mandatory and are included in this report. The final 
decisions in respect of the CEO’s remuneration are always made by 
the Committee and the CEO is not present for this part of the meeting, 
ensuring that the Committee makes independent decisions in the best 
interest of Antofagasta.

The Committee follows the UK Corporate Governance Code. The table 
below summarises how we have considered Code provision 40 when 
developing and implementing our remuneration strategy. 

Factor

Clarity

Remuneration arrangements are 
transparent and promote effective 
engagement with shareholders 
and the workforce.

Predictability

The range of possible values of 
rewards for the CEO is identified 
and explained at the time of 
approving the policy.

How the Committee addresses the factor

Our rationale for operating two long-term (performance and restricted) incentive awards is straightforward 
and well-communicated. The performance measures used in the Annual Bonus Plan and LTIP are used 
internally and externally in tracking and communicating business performance, ensuring that participants 
understand them well. We are careful not to make unnecessary changes to the executive remuneration 
policy; we seek year-on-year consistency which enhances the policy’s simplicity and effectiveness. The 
Committee Chair engages with and seeks the views of our shareholders on material changes to executive 
remuneration. Shareholder views were obtained and are reflected in the current remuneration policy. Views 
of the workforce are considered via the Company’s workforce engagement mechanisms described in more 
detail on page 165. Remuneration-related topics on which employee views are sought include benefits, pay 
fairness, alignment between individual performance and pay and sharing in the Company’s success.

Target ranges and potential payout levels are disclosed in advance, allowing shareholders and participants 
to understand the potential value of the package in different performance scenarios.

The Committee carefully considers the performance measures for the annual bonus and LTIP each year 
and seeks to achieve consistency (when appropriate), with only necessary changes being made so that the 
plans are sufficiently predictable. 

When setting performance targets, the Committee considers the same range of internal and external factors 
each year. This provides consistency in policy implementation.

Simplicity

Each element of pay is clearly communicated. 

Remuneration structures are 
uncomplicated, and their rationale 
and operation are both easy to 
understand and consistent for the 
CEO and, where applicable, those 
below him.

Proportionality

The link between individual 
awards, the delivery of strategy 
and the long-term performance 
of the Company is clear. 

Risk

Reputational and other risks from 
excessive rewards, and 
behavioural risks that can arise 
from target-based incentive plans, 
are identified and mitigated. 

Alignment to culture 

Incentive plans drive behaviours 
consistent with the Company’s 
purpose, values and strategy. 

Our incentive plans are market typical designs, making it easier for participants to understand. 

Where appropriate, incentive arrangements flow down through the organisation to align the interests of 
employees and senior management with those of our shareholders and to encourage and share value 
creation.

Performance conditions in the annual bonus and performance share awards require a minimum level of 
performance before any payment is made to senior management, and performance targets are aligned with 
our business plan and strategy. Remuneration is considered in the context of the wider employee 
population, including pay gap information, to assess its appropriateness. 

Truly stretching performance is required for the maximum to payout under our incentive plans. This 
ensures that executive rewards align with the experience of shareholders. 

There are clearly defined maximum opportunities, as set out in our 2023 Policy. 

Incentive plan performance measures are balanced to promote the right behaviours and appropriate 
safeguards are put in place, including adjustments for safety performance. 

While clawback has not been introduced due to uncertainty around its legal validity in Chile, LTIP awards are 
subject to malus. 

The Committee retains the discretion to adjust outcomes under the plans for variable remuneration.

Our 2023 Policy continues to be aligned with the business objectives to create sustainable value and high 
profitability. We reward strong performance aligned with our business objectives, but only if the methods used 
align with our safety and sustainability objectives. In 2024, all executive and supervisor performance bonuses, 
including the CEO’s, include an assessment of individual performance related to the Group’s Leadership Model 
which defines the behaviours that we require all employees to demonstrate, and is intended to connect and 
enhance our excellence management system and the strength of inclusive leadership.

1.  Mr. Iván Arriagada’s remuneration was calculated based on amounts paid in Chilean pesos each month of the relevant year, converted into US dollars at the closing exchange rate for the 

month it was paid.

2.  As explained in last year’s annual report there were a number of increases to the CEO’s base salary during 2022 and 2023, impacting the 2023 salary figure shown. Firstly in accordance 

with the CEO’s contract there was a 17.6% exchange rate increase, plus a 2.8% inflation increase in 2022. Secondly, at the start of 2023 as disclosed in the 2022 annual report, the 
CEO’s base salary increased by a further 20% from January 2023. During 2023 an inflationary increase of 4.8% has been applied in December 2023. 

3.  Benefits include life and health insurance. Other benefit values are based on what the Company believes would be deemed by HMRC to be taxable benefits in the UK. These principally 

relate to the cost of attending Board and other meetings and the Company’s Annual General Meeting in London (which comprise $93,000 of the total expenses shown above, including the 
related tax effect). The Company also pays the professional fees incurred to complete the CEO’s tax returns and the actual tax incurred by the CEO on these benefits, which are received 
in connection with fulfilling his duties. The Company makes no pension contributions on behalf of the CEO. HMRC has deemed certain services to be taxable in the UK. The Company has 
agreed to compensate the CEO for any double taxation that is not eventually recoverable from the Chilean revenue under the UK/Chile Double tax treaty. This tax equalisation benefit in 
respect of 2023 is a benefit of $9,892 and in 2022 was a benefit of $6,505.

4.  Mr Arriagada's bonus is paid in Chilean pesos and reported in US dollars. The 2022 annual bonus was paid following the date of publication of the 2022 Annual Report and the exchange 
rate used has been updated with the rate applicable at the date the bonus was paid. The exchange rate as of March 2023, which was used to update the 2022 annual bonus, is Ch$/USD 
790.41 vs Ch$/USD 855.86 in January 2023. 

5.  Restricted Award amounts are reported in the year of the grant based on the face value of the awards on the date of the grant. 
6.  Performance Awards are reported in the year the performance period ends. The Total Shareholder Return (TSR) performance is an estimate based on the substantial completion of the 
performance period, determined after this report's publication. The share price used to value these awards is the three-month average share price to the end of the 31 December 2023 
performance period of £14.36/share and USD/GBP 1.24. Performance awards are cash awards linked to a notional number of shares (39,442) and the Company’s share price 
performance. There was no entitlement to dividends or dividend equivalents.

7.  The Performance Awards included in the 2022 total vested on 27 March 2023. 50% of the award was based on the TSR performance, which was determined after the publication of last 
year’s report. The figure included in the table has been updated to reflect the TSR performance outcome that was 100% of the maximum, leading to a total award outcome of 100% of the 
maximum. The increase in the value reported for the 2020 LTIP reflects the change in share price and exchange rate at vesting. The share price and exchange rate used to value this 
award are £15.31/share and USD/GBP 1.23. For the 2020 LTIP, the value attributable to an increase in the Company’s share price is $343,767. The value at the time of the grant reached 
based on $868,000 with a £6.98/share and USD/GBP 1.18 with an increase in the value reported as $1,110,271. The notional number of shares over which the performance awards were 
granted was 105,295. There was no entitlement to dividends or dividend equivalents.

Antofagasta plc  Annual Report 2023

CORPORATE GOVERNANCE1.  The EBITDA targets were adjusted for exchange rate, inflation and copper price 

fluctuations, and explosives price fluctuations, and the effect of one-off bonuses paid on 
conclusion of labour negotiations at Minera Centinela, Los Pelambres, and Zaldívar, which 
were not included in the Group’s budget. 

Performance was between target and maximum for this measure with 90% of objectives 
being met. A 15% negative trigger would apply if the overall target of 1% of people with 
disabilities is not met, however, this target was met during the year and so no negative 
trigger applies. 

•  On-target: implementation of roadmap by April 2023 and 22.0% female direct 

employees.

•  Maximum: meet all implementation objectives and at 23.1% female direct employees. 

9.  Split between compliance with a regulatory requirements action plan (40%), and 

implementation of the Climate Change Roadmap (60%). This metric was met 75%. 

•  Regulatory requirements action plan: This measure was achieved in full with 100% 
payout. Maximum: obtaining the Copper Mark ratification at Antucoya by June 2023 
and at Los Pelambres by August 2023; and the internal evaluation for Centinela and 
Zaldívar by December 2023. 

•  Implementation of the Climate Change Roadmap: This measure was partially achieved 
at 60% of the maximum. Target: (25%) Pillar 1: Implementation of Circular Economy 
Strategy, (25%) Pillar 2: (25%) Comply with the Energy Performance Indicators of the 
2023 budget, (25%) Incorporate into the Climate Change scenario, of the 2023 annual 
planning process, the action to implement energy efficiency measures, for each 
Company, (25%) Incorporation of the 2022 Decarbonisation Plan in the annual 
planning process and incorporation of the scenario in the 2024 Budget and 
development of the Second Stage of the Plan. (25%) Target definition of Scope 3 (% to 
be defined during 2023), (25%) Pillar 3: (34%) Increase the water efficiency of the 
Mining Group by 0.25%, which is equivalent to decreasing the consumption at ~35 l/s 
as a whole for the Group. (33%) Develop a pre-feasibility study of a technological 
initiative in all Mining Group Companies. (33%) Achieve an average of 70% compliance 
with the Water Management Standard by 2023 for the global GM Companies. (25%) 
Pillar 4: Climate Change Standard Approval in H1. Maximum: (25%) Pillar 1: 
Implementation of Circular Economy Strategy, (25%) Pillar 2: (50%) Compensation 
Strategy Definition, (50%) Reduction of 1.5% with the implicit Energy Performance 
Indicators of the 2023 budget, (25%) Pillar 3: (50%) Increase the water efficiency of 
the GM by 0.5%, which is equivalent to reducing consumption at ~70 l/s as a whole for 
the Group. (50%) Achieve by 2023 an average of 75% compliance with the Water 
Management Standard for the global Mining Group Companies, (25%) Pillar 4: 
Definition of Baseline for implementation of the Climate Change Standard (identification 
of gaps and definition of an action plan). 

10. Performance against the planned execution of social initiatives. This metric was met in 

full. Maximum: (40%) 3% savings in Social Initiatives budget, (40%) Minera Los 
Pelambres/North District measurement tools implementation, (20%) Positive results in 
the application of the reputation perception tool defined in 2023. 

11.  A standalone adjustment trigger of 15% of the calculated outcome is applied to the Annual 
Bonus Plan, upwards if there are no fatalities during the year or downwards if there are 
one or more fatalities. As there were no fatalities in 2023, the final Mining division’s 
outcome was increased by 10% (from 60% of maximum to 70% of maximum).

12. The Board did not make any discretionary adjustments to the bonus.
13. For the purposes of calculation of outturn results, one decimal place has been used, 

but for simplicity in reporting, above figures have been shown as rounded to the nearest 
whole figure. Performance objectives are evaluated on a twenty-point scale with the 
minimum (90), target (100) and maximum (110), each point from 90 to 110 corresponding 
to 5% of the maximum objective.

2.  The copper production outturn level (which includes 50% of Zaldívar) reflects the 

stretching targets set at the beginning of the year in line with expectations of greater 
water availability through our desalination plant. As the desalination plant was delayed 
beyond the original schedule this impacted production, but despite this our Mining 
Division successfully produced 660,600 tonnes of copper, representing a 2% increase 
year-on-year. 

3.  The cash cost targets were adjusted for the same factors as the EBITDA targets (except 

for copper price fluctuations, which do not impact this measure). 

4.  Split between: Los Pelambres Phase 1 Expansion Project (4%), Los Pelambres critical 

infrastructure projects, including desalination plant increase, concentrate pipeline and El 
Mauro enclosures (collectively PAO), and Los Pelambres – mine life extension (EVU) 
(2%), Centinela: Second Concentrator Detailed Engineering (5%), Zaldívar: CMZ II 
Enablers (2%) and Permission Strategy Zaldívar (2%). The overall result for this measure 
was 55% of the maximum. The underlying performance targets and outcomes are set out 
below. 

•  Los Pelambres Phase 1 Expansion Project: the result was that the threshold target was 
not achieved. Threshold (50%) beginning production less than 30 days late and (50%) 
beginning production on 400 lt/s less than 60 days late. 

•  PAO/EVU: The result was between threshold and target performance. Threshold 

(100%) presenting the investment for approval within 120 days of approval from the 
PAO EIA. Target (70%) at least 85% progress of the approved PAO programme, (30%) 
finalising the processing strategy for entry to the EVU with reference to the PAO EIA.
•  Centinela Second Concentrator Detailed Engineering: The result was between target and 
maximum performance. Target (100%) progress according to the approved programme 
(investment decision during 2023). Maximum (50%) renegotiation of Purchase Orders 
for critical equipment due to deadline extension to 2023 with no impact on the execution 
of the project, and (50%) negotiations for the term extensions of the vertical packages of 
work not impacting capex by more than 2.5%. 

•  Zaldívar II Enablers: The result was between target and maximum performance. 

Target (50%) documentation is ready to start bidding for the design and construction 
of the Pioneer Camp at Zaldívar in Q4 2023 and (50%) documentation is ready for 
a tender process in Q4 2023 for the Engineering, Procurement and Construction 
(EPC) of Zaldivar’s conversion to either sea water or third party water sources. 
Maximum (100%) all critical milestones met in 2023. 

•  Zaldívar permission strategy: Maximum (100%) approval for the DIA bridge in Q4 

2023. Management completed all works required for approval of the DIA bridge and 
submitted for final approval in Q4 2023. The government finalised this approval in 
January 2024. The Board therefore determined the result was maximum performance. 

5.  Includes targets to assess the progress of exploration programmes and consolidation of 
exploration ownership interests, split between Cachorro deposit (60%), Encierro deposit 
(20%) and international exploration (20%). All the programmes were advanced according 
to the plan. The result was 80% of the maximum.

6.  Split between compliance with the Innovation Roadmap (50%) and Data Analytics (50%). 

Milestones for the Innovation Roadmap measure at target was 50% based on IROC 
Minera Los Pelambres and 50% based on IROC Centinela. The overall result for 
Innovation and digital transformation projects was 95% of maximum, made up of 85% of 
maximum achievement for the Innovation Roadmap measure and 100% of maximum 
achievement for the Data Analytics measure.

•  IROC Minera Los Pelambres: (50%) Operating with a 85% value capture in 2023 and 
(50%) achievement by Q2 of 200l/s then 400l/s at the desalination plant for target 
achievement.

•  IROC Centinela: becoming compliant with Value Levers in Budget for Concentrator 

Plant – copper recovery 85.98%, mineral ore processed 107 Ktpd, and Hydrometallurgy 
Plants – copper recovery 62.31%, for target achievement. 

•  To achieve maximum payout on the Innovation Roadmap measure, milestones were 

25% based on IROC Minera Los Pelambres: (50%) Operating with value capture over 
105% of expected 2023 and (50%) Q3 – 2023 start of fourth milling line from IROC. 
25% based on North Zone: approval to advance to feasibility stage and incorporation into 
2024 budget of next phase. 25% based in IROC Centinela: Fulfilment of Value Levers 
2023 budget: Concentrator Plant (1/3) Cu Recovery: > 85.98%. (1/3) Ore Processed: 
> 107 Ktpd Hydrometallurgy Plants (1/3) Cu Recovery: > 62.31%, and Autonomy Control 
Room transfer to IROC. 25% Standardisation of IROC development model. 

•  Milestones for the Data Analytics measure were related to the level of materialisation 
of active advanced analytics tools, requiring $11.5 million for maximum achievement. 

7.  Split between performance against targets for reducing high potential incidents (50%) 
and decrease in similar exposure group (SEG) of occupational hazards (50%). These 
metrics were met in full, and the Lost Time Injury Frequency Rate (LTIFR) trigger which 
applied for a LTIFR of higher than 1 was not triggered.

•  Reduction in High Potential Incident (HPI) rate targets were: maximum: 0.09. 
•  The SEG targets were: maximum: 10% or more. 

8.  Performance against targets for implementation of the Diversity and Inclusion Policy. 
(50%) of the target was based on the D&I Roadmap implementation and (50%) was 
based on an increase in the percentage of female direct employees by the year's end.

1.  The number of shares and share price used and the impact of vesting % for this award is available in the notes to the single figure table on page 166 and the table setting out long-term 

incentive awards outstanding for the CEO from prior periods on page 172.

2.  The TSR outcome is an estimate as the performance period ends after this report is published. The actual outturn will be included in next year’s Annual Report.
3.  The Los Pelambres pipeline and desalination plant expansion feasibility study is 100% complete. The PAO project had Basic Engineering completed in Nov 2022 for the piping systems and 
made significant progress in engineering and construction works carried out for the 800 lt/s desalination plant by the Los Pelambres Phase 1 Expansion Project. Additionally, in December 
2022 the budget was approved to commence activities of the execution stage, corresponding to detailed engineering, critical purchases (long lead), some early works, bidding of main 
contracts and training of the project team, which has been taking during 2023. Finally, in October 2023, environmental approval was obtained for the project with a favourable RCA,  
a milestone that enables the start of definitive construction, whose request for an investment decision is expected to be submitted to the Board of Directors in the first quarter of 2024. 
Centinela Second Concentrator project was approved on 19 December 2023 with a three-year construction schedule, with critical path works commencing immediately in Q4 2023 and 
full construction to commence after definitive project finance documents have been executed during Q1 2024. The Board approved plan was updated based on the Board’s decision to 
postpone the approval decision until certain national regulatory conditions were met in 2023.

4.  One hundred percent (100%) compliance means agreements reached with the communities near the Company’s operations, CO2 emissions reduction following forecasts set on the grant 

date equivalent to 928,163 tCO2e, 100% compliance with the climate change strategy roadmap and 100% compliance with the internal plan to address regulatory requirements.

5.  The impact of this vesting level on the CEO’s 2023 remuneration is set out in footnote 6 of the CEO single-figure total remuneration table on page 166.

1.  During 2023, $832,582 (2022 – $604,079) was paid to Asesorías Ramón F. Jara Ltda. for providing services. The increase is due to an inflation adjustment, a change in the Chilean 

service provision law and decrease in the Ch$/USD exchange rate. These payments are included in the fees attributable to Ramón Jara shown above.

2.  Amounts for Jean-Paul Luksic include the provision of life and health insurance. Amounts for Ramón Jara include the provision of life insurance. No such insurance is provided for the other Directors.
3.  Except as described in footnote 2, all “benefits” amounts included in this table arose in connection with the fulfilment of Directors’ duties and, in particular, including the cost of attending 
Board and other meetings and the Company’s Annual General Meeting in London (which comprise $189,000 of the total expenses shown above, including the related tax effect, of which 
$92,000 relates to Ramon Jara) . These calculations have been based on what the Company believes would be deemed by HMRC to be taxable benefits in the UK by the Non-Executive 
Directors or would be if the director was resident in the United Kingdom for tax purposes, alongside any personal incidental expenses. Given these expenses are incurred by Directors 
in connection with the fulfilment of their director duties, the Company also pays the professional fees incurred to complete individual tax returns and the actual tax incurred by Directors 
on these expenses. Figures are reported in the year that they are paid, or would be payable, by the Company.
4.  Totals reflect the total fixed remuneration for each Director. Directors did not receive any variable remuneration. 
5.  Notes relevant to single-figure disclosures for 2022 can be found on page 159 of the 2022 annual report. These remain unchanged.

Antofagasta plc  Annual Report 2023

There have been no changes to the Directors’ interests in the shares 
of the Company between 31 December 2023 and the date of this 
report.

The Directors and CEO had no interests in the shares of the Company 
during the year other than those set out on this page. No Director had 
any material interest in any contract (other than a service contract in 
the case of Ramón Jara) with the Company or its subsidiary 
undertakings during the year other than in the ordinary course of 
business.

The Group does not have shareholding guidelines or requirements for 
Directors, all of whom are Non-Executives.

The Chairman, Mr. Jean-Paul Luksic, and Non-Executive Director, Mr. 
Andrónico Luksic C., are members of the Luksic family. Members of 
the Luksic family are interested in the E. Abaroa Foundation, which 
controls Metalinvest Establishment and Kupferberg Establishment, 
which, taken together, hold approximately 60.66% of the Company’s 
ordinary shares and approximately 94.12% of the Company’s 
preference shares. In addition, Mr. Jean-Paul Luksic controls the 
Severe Studere Foundation, which, in turn, controls the Aureberg 
Establishment (which holds approximately 4.26% of the Company’s 
ordinary shares as mentioned above). This creates significant 
alignment between these members of the Board and shareholders.

During the period, no Non-Executive Director was eligible for any 
short-term or long-term incentive awards, and no Non-Executive 
Director owns any shares as a result of the achievement of 
performance conditions.

The Committee set stretching targets which incentivise the CEO and Executive Committee members to deliver exceptional performance and to 
drive sustainable results. The Committee ensures that targets are appropriately stretching in the context of the business plan and prior year 
achievements and that there is an appropriate balance between incentivising the CEO to meet financial targets and to deliver specific non-
financial goals.

1.  The single figure remuneration for the Group’s lead executive in 2014 comprises Jean-Paul Luksic’s remuneration until 1 September 2014 (when he became Non-Executive Chairman) 
and Diego Hernández’s remuneration from 1 September 2014. The Chairman was not eligible for variable remuneration, so the 2014 percentage figures only relate to the 2014 annual 
bonus and LTIP awards vesting to the CEO.

2.  The single figure remuneration for the Group’s lead executive in 2016 comprises Diego Hernández’s remuneration until 8 April 2016 (when he stepped down as CEO) and Iván Arriagada’s 

remuneration from 8 April 2016 (when he became CEO). No Performance Awards were vested to the CEO in 2016. 

3.  Restricted Awards do not have a performance element, so they are not included in these calculations.
4.  2022 figures have been restated to reflect actual 2022 outcomes, as explained in the CEO single-figure remuneration table on page 166.

Relative TSR performance

The chart below sets out the TSR performance of the Company over the past ten years. The FTSE All-Share Index and the Global X Copper 
Miners ETF (CopX Index) have also been shown over the same period. The FTSE All-Share Index has been selected as an appropriate broad 
equity market index benchmark as it is the most broadly-based index to which the Company belongs and relates to the London Stock Exchange, 
where the Company’s ordinary shares are traded. The Global X Copper Miners ETF is also shown because this index has been determined to be 
the most appropriate specific comparator group for the Company, and the Global X Copper Miners is one of the peer groups used in the Group’s 
LTIP as set out on page 171. Previously the Group used the EMIX Global Mining Index.

1.  The fee percentage change for Directors who served for only part of a comparator year has been annualised. Jorge Bande has not been included in the table as he departed 31 December 
2023. Ollie Oliviera has not been included in the table as he left the Board on 31 July 2021. Heather Lawrence has not been included in the table as she was appointed on 18 April 2023.
2.  The parent company, Antofagasta plc, has fewer than ten employees. Reporting these figures is mandatory, and the parent company is not considered to be an appropriate comparator 

group.

3.  Mining division employees are considered a relevant comparator group, partly because the Mining division accounts for more than 97% of the Group’s revenue and partly because the 

Annual Bonus Plan that applies to the Executive Committee is the same plan that applies to the Mining division employees at the management and professional levels. This annual bonus 
figure relates to the percentage change in the average annual bonus for the Mining division employees and does not include any one-off bonuses paid to employees due to the conclusion 
of collective bargaining agreements with labour unions. The reported increases on 2023 are due to a decrease in the Ch$/USD exchange rate, partially offset by an annual adjustment for 
inflation in Chile.

4.  Directors’ benefits for 2020, 2021, 2022 and 2023 are all reported in accordance with footnote 3 at the Directors’ single figure of remuneration on page 170.
5.  Antofagasta has fewer than 10 employees in the UK, and therefore there is not a requirement to disclose a CEO pay ratio.

1.  Employee remuneration includes salaries and social security costs, as set out in Note 9B to the financial statements. The percentage change in employee remuneration reflects several 
factors including exchange rate, inflation and headcount changes. There were significant increases in bonus levels and salary levels (beyond normal inflationary increases). Increased 
bonuses largely reflect the impact of the one-off bonuses paid in respect of the completion of the labour negotiation at Centinela.

2.  Distributions to shareholders represent the dividends proposed and approved for payment in relation to the year as set out in Note 13 to the financial statements.
3.  Tax has been included because it shows the Group’s tax contribution, almost all of which is paid to the Chilean state by the Group’s operations in Chile. The tax expense represents the 

current tax charge regarding corporate tax, mining tax (royalty) and withholding tax, as set out in Note 11 to the financial statements.

Remuneration and Talent Management 
Committee Report

Key responsibilities
•  The Committee ensures that the Group’s remuneration arrangements support both the Group’s purpose and the effective implementation of its 

strategy to enable the recruitment, motivation, reward and retention of talent.

•  The Committee is responsible for setting remuneration for the Chairman, Directors and the CEO and monitoring the compensation strategy, 

level, structure and reward outcomes for Executive Committee members.

•  The Committee actively participates in the Group’s talent management strategy, including reviewing, assessing and implementing succession 

plans for the Executive Committee.

•  The Committee also reviews workforce remuneration and related policies, including the Diversity and Inclusion Policy, the alignment of 
incentives and rewards with the Group’s culture, the terms and limits of collective negotiations with the Company’s unions and the 
implementation of policy changes that affect the workforce as a whole.

As explained in last year’s Annual Report, when the Committee 
reviews the Directors’ and the CEO’s remuneration, it considers pay 
conditions across the Group. This is set in the context of different 
working environments and geographies and therefore is not a 
mechanical process. The Company does not have any executive 
directors, and the executive pay policy that applies to the CEO 
(who is not a Director) is the same as the Group’s broader pay policy. 
This policy includes access to the same benefits and participation in the 
same Annual Bonus Plan. Members of the Executive Committee and 
certain key executives participate in the LTIP, and this plan is the same 
for the CEO as for the other participants. The same principles apply 
to our workforce remuneration plans as to that of the CEO, seeking 
to drive the same aligned culture, values and behaviours across 
the Group.

CORPORATE GOVERNANCEConsideration by the Directors of matters relating to 
Directors’ remuneration

The Committee engages Willis Towers Watson for advice on 
remuneration issues. Willis Towers Watson was selected through an 
independent and competitive process in 2019. Willis Towers Watson’s 
fees for this work were charged in accordance on a time and materials 
basis and amounted to £87,715. The Committee is satisfied that the 
advice provided by Willis Towers Watson was objective and 
independent and that no conflict of interest arose concerning these 
services. Willis Towers Watson also provided advice and support to 
management during the year, primarily on general remuneration 
issues, benchmarking, HR best practices and ad hoc advice on topics 
such as equality and gender related pay disclosures.

In determining that the advice received was independent, the Committee 
took into account the fact that Willis Towers Watson is an independent 
global professional services firm that adheres to the Code of Conduct for 
Remuneration Consultants, to which it is a signatory. The Code of 
Conduct can be found at www.remunerationconsultantsgroup.com.

During 2023, the Committee also received assistance from the 
Chairman, Jean-Paul Luksic, the CEO, Iván Arriagada, the Vice 
President of Human Resources, Georgeanne Barcelo, and the 
Company Secretary, Julian Anderson, none of whom participated in 
discussions relating to their own remuneration. Additionally, part of 
each Committee meeting is held without management present to 
ensure that individual views or areas of concern can be debated 
between Committee members.

The responsibilities of the Committee are defined by its Terms of 
Reference, which can be found on the Company’s website.

Talent management and succession planning

Oversight of talent management and succession planning is integral to 
the Committee’s responsibilities and directly relates to the Group’s 
ability to achieve long-term sustainable success. The talent review is 
carried out annually to update succession planning for key positions, 
identify talent pools, define individual development plans and agree on 
recruitment needs. 

In recent years a new approach has been taken, prioritising 
employees’ overall experience and positioning the Group as a top-tier 
employer capable of attracting and retaining top talent. Talent 
management is critical to ensuring the Group’s ability to meet current 
and future business demands by focusing on the attraction, retention 
and development of high-potential individuals. This approach ensures 
the continuous growth and success of the Company.

Approximately 79% of the Group’s employees are unionised, and the 
number is close to 100% at the operator level. The Committee reviews 
the gender pay gap, CEO pay ratio figures and a range of other internal 
and external remuneration comparison metrics and benchmarks when 
determining the quantum and structure of the CEO’s remuneration. 
This includes feedback from shareholders and more general feedback 
from employees on the Group’s pay policies, including regular 
engagement with union representatives and oversight of the 
parameters for collective bargaining negotiations.

The Committee communicates with and receives feedback from 
employees through various channels, such as employee engagement 
surveys, and the results are reported to the Committee and the Board.

During 2023, in my capacity as the Senior Independent Director 
and Chair of the Remuneration and Talent Management Committee, 
I travelled to our Los Pelambres, Centinela and Zaldívar mine sites with 
other members of the Board to speak with employees and contractors 
of the Group to understand their day-to-day experiences and to hear 
their views and ideas. I met with groups of female employees to 
understand the challenges they face, working in a predominantly 
male-dominated industry and working environment. I am grateful 
for the valuable insights shared by all those we met with and have 
reported these back to the rest of the Board. The Remuneration 
Committee will keep these insights in mind through 2024 when 
decision-making.

In addition to our visits to the mines as noted above, the Directors visit 
Group operations throughout the year, individually or in small groups, 
to listen directly to employees’ views on labour issues, including 
remuneration, culture and values, as well as the application of 
remuneration policy across the Group, including executive pay. The 
Board’s engagement with the workforce is detailed on pages 130 and 
131. 

The Committee is regularly updated on workforce pay and benefits by 
the senior management team, who consult with the workforce on 
issues including the remuneration policy. The workforce receives 
regular communications throughout the year on the Group’s 
performance targets and incentive awards, while the senior 
management team receives regular feedback on the performance of 
workforce roles and regularly engages with employees to understand 
their views on workforce remuneration policy and practices. 

Consequently, the Committee has multiple touchpoints with the 
workforce for feedback on the Group’s workforce remuneration policy, 
including that of senior management and the CEO. At the beginning of 
every Committee meeting, the CEO provides an update to the 
Committee on key workforce issues relating to remuneration and 
talent. The Committee meetings are focused on these subjects. 
Following each Committee meeting, the Committee Chair reports a 
summary of matters considered to the full Board. 

The Committee receives regular feedback on safety performance, 
community relations, the working environment, operations and critical 
projects and ensures that the workforce remuneration policy (including 
senior management and CEO) is fair and transparent, and its outcomes 
reflect the desired culture and ensure alignment with the values and 
behaviours of the organisation. The Committee also ensures that the 
process for setting pay and establishing KPIs and performance 
outcomes across the workforce reflects the governance and outcomes 
for senior management and the CEO. The Committee ensures these 
principles are applied to the whole workforce, including senior 
management and the CEO.

Remuneration Policy in 2024

Base salary

The CEO’s annual base salary is paid in Chilean pesos, and presented in this report in US dollars. The CEO’s annual base salary will be 
$1,284,017 from 1 January 2024, increased from $1,255,552 as at 1 January 2023 as explained in last year´s report. The CEO’s base salary 
continues to be periodically reviewed and adjusted to reflect exchange rate adjustments, however, the exchange rate hurdle of 5% was not met 
in November 2023, and therefore no exchange rate adjustment was made. The Chilean peso/US dollar exchange rate will continue to be 
monitored during 2024. The Committee continues to monitor the overall remuneration package value of the CEO in comparison to peers in the 
FTSE 100 mining industry and our core global copper mining peer group. 

Benefits will be provided in line with the remuneration policy and prior years.

Annual bonus for 2024

The approach to calculating the targets and outcomes will reflect the 2024 bonus plan, with a maximum of 200% of salary.

Chairman

Jean-Paul Luksic’s total fee for 2024 is $1,015,000 (2023 – $1,015,000) comprising:

•  $730,000 per annum for his services as Chairman of the Board;
•  $25,000 per annum for his services as Chairman of the Nomination and Governance Committee; and
•  $260,000 per annum for his services as Chairman of the Antofagasta Minerals board.

This fee level reflects his responsibility, experience and time commitment to the role.

Non-Executive Directors 

There has been no change to Non-Executive Director base fees of $130,000 since 2012. Given the core role which Antofagasta Minerals plays in 
the management of the mining operations and projects, all Directors also serve as directors of Antofagasta Minerals. The annual fee payable to 
directors of Antofagasta Minerals remains $130,000 (as it has since 2012). Therefore, the combined base fees payable to Non-Executive 
Directors amount to $260,000 per annum. The Board periodically reviews both the structure and levels of fees paid to Non-Executive Directors 
and will continue reviewing these fees from time to time, in accordance with the policy. 

Benefits that were reported for 2023 will continue to apply. Directors are not expected to receive any other remuneration in 2024.

Directors’ Report

Directors

Directors who have served during the year and summaries of current 
Directors’ key skills and experience are set out in the Corporate 
Governance Report on pages 132-134.

Post-balance sheet events

During 2023 the Group entered into an agreement to acquire up 
to an additional 30 million shares in Compañía de Minas Buenaventura 
S.A.A. (“Buenaventura”), representing approximately 12% of 
Buenaventura’s issued share capital. Subsequent to the year-end, 
in March 2024, the agreement completed. Further details are set out 
in Note 22 to the financial statements. 

Financial risk management

Details of the Company’s policies on financial risk management are set 
out in Note 26 to the financial statements.

Results and dividends

The consolidated profit before tax has decreased from $2,558.9 million 
in 2022 to $1,965.5 million in 2023.

The Board has recommended a final dividend of 24.3 cents per 
ordinary share (2022 – 50.5 cents). An interim dividend of 11.7 cents 
was paid on 29 September 2023 (2022 interim dividend – 9.2 cents). 
This gives total dividends per share proposed in relation to 2023 of 
36.0 cents (2022 – 59.7 cents) equivalent to a total dividend amount of 
$354.9 million (2022 – $588.3 million).

Preference shares carry the right to a fixed cumulative dividend of 5% 
per annum. The preference shares are classified within borrowings 
and preference dividends are included within finance costs. The total 
cost of dividends paid on preference shares and recognised as an 
expense in the income statement was $0.1 million (2022 –  
$0.1 million). Further information relating to dividends is set out in the 
Financial Review on page 113 and in Note 13 to the financial statements.

Political contributions

The Group did not make any political donations during the year ended  
31 December 2023 (2022 – nil).

Auditor

Following a tender process in 2022, Deloitte LLP has indicated 
its willingness to be appointed as the Company’s auditor from 2024 
and a resolution seeking its appointment will be proposed at the 
Annual General Meeting. 

Disclosure of information to auditors

The Directors in office at the date of this report have each confirmed that:

•  so far as they are aware, there is no relevant audit information 

of which the Group’s auditor is unaware, and

•  they have taken all the steps they ought to have taken as Directors 

in order to make themselves aware of any relevant audit information 
and to establish that the Group’s auditor is aware of that information.

Capital structure

Details of the authorised and issued ordinary share capital are shown 
in Note 31 to the financial statements. The Company has one class 
of ordinary shares, which carry no right to fixed income. Each ordinary 
share carries one vote at any general meeting of the Company.

Details of the preference share capital are shown in Note 24 to the 
financial statements. The preference shares are non-redeemable and are 

entitled to a fixed cumulative dividend of 5% of their nominal value of £1 
per share per annum. Each preference share carries 100 votes on a poll 
at any general meeting of the Company.

When the preference shares were issued, they each carried one vote 
at any general meeting of the Company in parity with the ordinary 
shares in issue at that time. The number of ordinary shares in issue 
has increased since then through stock splits and bonus issues and 
the preference shares were not split at the same time as the ordinary 
shares. Therefore, in order to maintain proportionate voting rights 
attaching to the preference shares, the voting rights attaching to 
preference shares have increased to 100 votes on a poll at any general 
meeting of the Company.

There are no specific restrictions on the transfer of shares or on their 
voting rights beyond those standard provisions set out in the 
Company’s Articles of Association and other provisions of applicable 
laws and regulations (including following a failure to provide the 
Company with information about interests in shares as required by the 
Companies Act 2006). The Company is not aware of any agreements 
between holders of the Company’s shares that may result in 
restrictions on the transfer of securities or on voting rights.

With regard to the appointment and replacement of Directors, the 
Company is governed by, and has regard to, its Articles of Association, 
the UK Corporate Governance Code 2018, the Companies Act 2006 
and related legislation. The Articles of Association may be amended by 
special resolution of the shareholders. There are no significant 
agreements in place that take effect, alter or terminate upon a change 
of control of the Company. Except as permitted by the Company’s 
remuneration policy, there are no agreements in place between the 
Company and its Directors or employees that provide for 
compensation for loss of office or employment resulting from a change 
of control of the Company.

The percentages of the total nominal share capital of the Company 
represented by each class of share are:

Authority to issue shares and authority to purchase  
own shares

At the AGM held on 10 May 2023, authority was given to the Directors 
to allot unissued relevant securities in the Company up to a maximum 
amount equivalent to two-thirds of the ordinary shares in issue (of 
which one-third may only be offered by way of rights issue). This 
authority expires on the date of this year’s AGM, scheduled to be held 
on 8 May 2024. No shares have been issued pursuant to that authority 
as at the date of this report or during the year. The Directors propose 
to seek renewal of this authority at this year’s AGM. However, in line 
with the Investment Association's most recent Share Capital 
Management Guidance, this year's proposed authority will authorise 
the Directors to allot one-third only by way of any fully pre-emptive 
offer (rather than by way of rights issue only).

Further special resolutions passed at the 2023 AGM granted authority 
to the Directors to allot equity securities in the Company for cash up to 
an aggregate nominal amount of £4,929,283 (representing slightly less 
than 10% of its issued ordinary share capital) without regard to the 

Antofagasta plc  Annual Report 2023

Directors’ Report continued

pre-emption provisions of the Companies Act 2006 and for an 
additional aggregate nominal amount of £4,929,283 (representing an 
additional 10% of its issued ordinary share capital) in connection with 
the financing or refinancing of an acquisition or specified capital 
investment (plus, in each case, an additional 2% for the purposes of a 
follow-on offer as described in the Pre-Emption Group's Statement 
of Principles). These authorities also expire on the date of this year’s 
AGM. Accordingly, the Directors will seek to renew these authorities in 
line with the Pre-Emption Group’s Statement of Principles and the 
Investment Association’s guidance. 

The Company was also authorised by a shareholders’ resolution 
passed at the 2023 AGM to purchase up to 10% of its issued ordinary 
share capital. Any shares bought back may be held as treasury shares 
or, if not so held, must be cancelled immediately upon completion of 
the purchase, thereby reducing the amount of the Company’s issued 
and authorised share capital. This authority will expire at this year’s 
AGM and a resolution to renew the authority for a further year will be 
proposed. No shares were purchased by the Company during the year.

Directors’ interests and indemnities

Details of Directors’ contracts and letters of appointment, 
remuneration and emoluments and their interests in the shares of the 
Company as at 31 December 2023, are given in the Directors’ 
Remuneration Report. No Director had any material interest in a 
contract of significance (other than a service contract in respect of 
Ramón Jara – see page 170) with the Company or any subsidiary of 
the Company during the year.

In accordance with the Company’s Articles of Association and to the 
extent permitted by the laws of England and Wales, Directors are 
granted an indemnity from the Company in respect of liabilities 
personally incurred as a result of their office. The Company also 
maintained a Directors’ and Officers’ liability insurance policy 
throughout the financial year. A new policy has been entered into for 
the current financial year.

Each year, the Directors complete a form identifying interests that may 
constitute a conflict of interest, including, for example, directorships in 
other companies. Directors are also required to notify the Company 
during the year of any relevant changes in those positions or situations.

The Board, with assistance from the Nomination and Governance 
Committee, considers potential and actual conflict situations and decides 
the steps, if any, which need to be taken to manage each situation.

The authorisation process is not regarded as a substitute for managing 
an actual conflict of interest if one arises and the monitoring and, if 
appropriate, authorisation of actual and potential conflicts of interest is 
an ongoing process.

CORPORATE GOVERNANCEStatement of Directors’ responsibilities

Statement of Directors’ responsibilities 
in respect of the financial statements

The Directors are responsible for preparing the Annual Report and 
Financial Statements 2023 in accordance with applicable law and 
regulation.

Company law requires the Directors to prepare financial statements 
for each financial year. Under that law the Directors have prepared the 
Group financial statements in accordance with UK-adopted 
international accounting standards and the Parent Company financial 
statements in accordance with United Kingdom Generally Accepted 
Accounting Practice (United Kingdom Accounting Standards, 
comprising FRS 101 “Reduced Disclosure Framework”, and applicable 
law).

Under Company law, Directors must not approve the financial 
statements unless they are satisfied that they give a true and fair view 
of the state of affairs of the Group and Parent Company and of the 
profit or loss of the Group for that period. In preparing the financial 
statements, the Directors are required to:

•  select suitable accounting policies and then apply them consistently;
•  state whether applicable UK-adopted international accounting 

standards have been followed for the Group financial statements 
and United Kingdom Accounting Standards, comprising FRS 101, 
have been followed for the Parent Company financial statements, 
subject to any material departures disclosed and explained in the 
financial statements;

•  make judgements and accounting estimates that are reasonable 

and prudent; and

•  prepare the financial statements on the going concern basis unless 
it is inappropriate to presume that the Group and Parent Company 
will continue in business.

The Directors are responsible for safeguarding the assets of the Group 
and Parent Company and hence for taking reasonable steps for the 
prevention and detection of fraud and other irregularities.

The Directors are also responsible for keeping adequate accounting 
records that are sufficient to show and explain the Group’s and Parent 
Company’s transactions and disclose with reasonable accuracy at any 
time the financial position of the Group and Parent Company and 
enable them to ensure that the financial statements and the Directors’ 
Remuneration Report comply with the Companies Act 2006.

The Directors are responsible for the maintenance and integrity of the 
Parent Company’s website. Legislation in the United Kingdom 
governing the preparation and dissemination of financial statements 
may differ from legislation in other jurisdictions.

Directors’ confirmations

The Directors consider that the Annual Report and Financial 
Statements 2023 and accounts, taken as a whole, is fair, balanced and 
understandable and provides the information necessary for 
shareholders to assess the Group’s and Parent Company’s position 
and performance, business model and strategy.

Each of the Directors, whose names and functions are listed in the 
Corporate Governance Report confirm that, to the best of their 
knowledge:

•  the Group financial statements, which have been prepared in 

accordance with UK-adopted international accounting standards, 
give a true and fair view of the assets, liabilities, financial position 
and profit of the Group;

•  the Parent Company financial statements, which have been 

prepared in accordance with United Kingdom Accounting Standards, 
comprising FRS 101, give a true and fair view of the assets, liabilities 
and financial position of the Parent Company; and

•  the Strategic Report includes a fair review of the development and 
performance of the business and the position of the Group and 
Parent Company, together with a description of the principal risks 
and uncertainties that it faces.

In the case of each director in office at the date the directors’ report 
is approved:

•  so far as the Director is aware, there is no relevant audit information 
of which the Group and Parent Company’s auditors are unaware; 
and

•  they have taken all the steps that they ought to have taken as a 

director in order to make themselves aware of any relevant audit 
information and to establish that the Group and Parent Company’s 
auditors are aware of that information.

Report on the audit of the financial statements

Our audit approach

Opinion

In our opinion:

•  Antofagasta plc’s Group financial statements and Parent Company 
financial statements (the “financial statements”) give a true and fair 
view of the state of the Group’s and of the Parent Company’s affairs 
as at 31 December 2023 and of the Group’s profit and the Group’s 
cash flows for the year then ended;

•  the Group financial statements have been properly prepared in 

accordance with UK-adopted international accounting standards as 
applied in accordance with the provisions of the Companies Act 
2006;

•  the Parent Company financial statements have been properly 

prepared in accordance with United Kingdom Generally Accepted 
Accounting Practice (United Kingdom Accounting Standards, 
including FRS 101 “Reduced Disclosure Framework”, and applicable 
law); and

•  the financial statements have been prepared in accordance with the 

requirements of the Companies Act 2006.

We have audited the financial statements, included within the Annual 
Report and Financial Statements 2023 (the “Annual Report”), which 
comprise: the consolidated and Parent Company balance sheets as at 
31 December 2023; the consolidated income statement, the 
consolidated statement of comprehensive income, the consolidated 
cash flow statement, and the consolidated and Parent Company 
statements of changes in equity for the year then ended; and the notes 
to the financial statements, comprising material accounting policy 
information and other explanatory information.

Our opinion is consistent with our reporting to the Audit and Risk 
Committee.

Basis for opinion

We conducted our audit in accordance with International Standards  
on Auditing (UK) (“ISAs (UK)”) and applicable law. Our responsibilities 
under ISAs (UK) are further described in the Auditors’ responsibilities 
for the audit of the financial statements section of our report.  
We believe that the audit evidence we have obtained is sufficient  
and appropriate to provide a basis for our opinion.

Independence

We remained independent of the Group in accordance with the ethical 
requirements that are relevant to our audit of the financial statements 
in the UK, which includes the FRC’s Ethical Standard, as applicable to 
listed public interest entities, and we have fulfilled our other ethical 
responsibilities in accordance with these requirements.

To the best of our knowledge and belief, we declare that non-audit 
services prohibited by the FRC’s Ethical Standard were not provided.

Other than those disclosed in note 8 to the Group financial statements, 
we have provided no non-audit services to the Parent Company or its 
controlled undertakings in the period under audit.

Overview

Audit scope

•  We identified two components (2022: two) as individually financially 
significant components, which required an audit of their complete 
financial information due to their financial significance to the Group, 
and a further three components (2022: three) where we concluded 
that a full scope audit of the component financial information was 
warranted.

•  Taken together, the components at which audit work was performed 

accounted for 97% of Group revenue.

•  We also determined that specified procedures were necessary in 
respect of certain balances within the corporate segment and 
transport division to ensure that we had sufficient coverage from 
our audit work over each line of the Group’s financial statements.

Key audit matters

•  Assessment of indicators of impairment and impairment reversal for 

property, plant and equipment, in particular in respect of the 
Zaldívar and Antucoya cash generating units (Group) and 
investments in subsidiaries (Parent Company) 

Materiality

•  Overall Group materiality: $117 million (2022: $112 million) based on 

5% of the three year average of profit before tax adjusted for 
one-off items.

•  Overall Parent Company materiality: $21 million (2022: $20 million) 

based on 1% of total assets.

•  Performance materiality: $87.75 million (2022: $84 million) (Group) 

and $15.75 million (2022: $15 million) (Parent Company).

The scope of our audit

As part of designing our audit, we determined materiality and assessed 
the risks of material misstatement in the financial statements.

Key audit matters

Key audit matters are those matters that, in the auditors’ professional 
judgement, were of most significance in the audit of the financial 
statements of the current period and include the most significant 
assessed risks of material misstatement (whether or not due to fraud) 
identified by the auditors, including those which had the greatest effect 
on: the overall audit strategy; the allocation of resources in the audit; 
and directing the efforts of the engagement team. These matters, and 
any comments we make on the results of our procedures thereon, 
were addressed in the context of our audit of the financial statements 
as a whole, and in forming our opinion thereon, and we do not provide 
a separate opinion on these matters.

This is not a complete list of all risks identified by our audit.

The accounting for the disposal of the Group’s interest in the Reko Diq 
project (Group), which was a key audit matter last year, is no longer 
included as a key audit matter because of the fact that the gain on 
disposal was fully recognised within the 2022 financial year, and the 
Group has subsequently, in 2023, received a private ruling from the 
Australian Tax Office to confirm that the disposal proceeds would not 
be subject to Australian tax. Otherwise, the key audit matters below 
are consistent with last year.

FINANCIAL STATEMENTSKey audit matter

How our audit addressed the key audit matter

Assessment of indicators of impairment and impairment reversal for 
property, plant and equipment, in particular in respect of the Zaldívar 
and Antucoya cash generating units (Group) and investments in 
subsidiaries (Parent Company)

In accordance with IAS 36 ‘Impairment of assets’, the Directors are 
required to perform an impairment assessment of long-lived assets at 
any time an indicator of impairment exists. The Directors considered 
various external and internal factors, as set out in IAS 36, in assessing 
whether an indicator of impairment, or in respect of Antucoya, 
impairment reversal, existed as at 31 December 2023 in respect of the 
operating mine cash-generating units (‘CGUs’), such as short- and 
long-term forecast copper prices, the operational performance of 
these mines and indicative estimates of movements in value during the 
year based on the latest Life of Mine plans. This assessment included 
consideration of the impact of climate risks, including scenario analysis, 
as detailed in note 5 to the Group financial statements. The Directors 
concluded that no indicators of impairment or impairment reversal 
existed as at 31 December 2023 in respect of these CGUs and, 
therefore, no detailed impairment tests were performed.

This assessment required judgement on the part of the Directors in 
determining whether an impairment indicator existed and was an area 
which had a significant effect on our overall audit strategy and 
allocation of resources in the planning for, and completion of, our audit. 
It was, therefore, determined to be a key audit matter.

The financial statements set out the key elements of the judgements 
made by the Directors, which include at Zaldívar that the ongoing 
renewal of mining and water permits, currently due to expire in 2025, 
will be successful, and that production issues experienced in the year 
are short-term in nature.

Refer to notes 3 and 5 to the Group financial statements and the Audit 
and Risk Committee’s views set out on page 146.

As at 31 December 2023, the Parent Company holds investments in 
subsidiaries amounting to $938.3 million (2022: $589.1 million), 
comprising shares and long-term funding balances that the Directors 
do not intend to demand repayment of in the foreseeable future.

Judgement is required to assess whether impairment indicators exist 
in relation to the shares held in subsidiaries and, where indicators are 
identified, to determine whether the recoverable amount is no lower 
than the investment carrying value. Judgement is also required in 
determining whether an expected credit loss should be recorded 
against the long-term funding balances.

In assessing for impairment indicators, management considered 
whether the underlying net assets of the investment support the 
carrying amount, the nature of the underlying assets and whether 
other facts and circumstances could also be an indicator of 
impairment. For the loan balances, management considered whether 
the relevant subsidiary could repay the loans if they were demanded  
at the balance sheet date.

Based on management’s assessment, no impairment indicators in 
respect of the carrying value of investments in subsidiaries were 
identified by the Directors at the balance sheet date, and no expected 
credit loss on the long-term funding balances was recognised.

Refer to notes 3 and 5 to the Parent Company’s financial statements.

We, supported by our component team, assessed the Directors’ 
conclusion that there were no indicators of impairment or impairment 
reversal as at 31 December 2023 in respect of the operating mine 
CGUs. In performing this assessment, the following procedures were 
performed by the Group team, or, where appropriate, by our component 
team in Chile with oversight from the Group audit team in the UK. 

Our procedures included evaluating management’s impairment 
indicator assessments, including its completeness by reference to both 
internal and external factors, including but not limited to operational 
performance in the year, macroeconomic factors including forecast 
copper prices, foreign currency exchange rates and market interest 
rates, climate change, and expected future production profiles and 
capital expenditure as included in the latest Life of Mine plan for each 
operation. In the case of Zaldívar, we also assessed the latest 
developments in respect of the permit applications.

As well as considering whether any qualitative indicators of 
impairment existed, we evaluated management’s quantitative 
impairment indicator assessments, and the process by which the 
indicative valuations were determined, including verifying the 
mathematical accuracy of the cash flow models and agreeing future 
capital and operating expenditure to the latest Board approved budgets 
and the latest approved Life of Mine plans. We assessed the 
reasonableness of the expected capital and operating expenses in light 
of their historical levels and recent operational performance, and 
considered the competence and objectivity of management’s internal 
technical experts who prepared the Life of Mine plans. We evaluated 
the appropriateness of key market related assumptions in the indicative 
valuation models, including the copper prices, discount rates and 
foreign currency exchange rates, with the support of our valuation 
experts. We also performed sensitivity analysis around the key 
assumptions within the cash flow forecasts, using both lower 
long-term copper prices and a stronger Chilean peso. In addition, we 
considered management’s impairment indicator assessments in the 
context of the Task Force on Climate-related Financial Disclosures 
(“TCFD”) scenario analyses prepared by management during the year.

In light of the above, we assessed the appropriateness of the related 
disclosures in note 5 to the Group financial statements, including the 
sensitivities provided. Overall, we identified no material issues in  
our work.

In respect of investments in subsidiaries in the Parent Company, we 
evaluated and challenged management’s assessment and judgements 
in relation to the identification of impairment indicators; independently 
performed an assessment of other potential internal and external 
impairment indicators, including considering the market capitalisation 
of the Group with reference to the carrying value in the Parent 
Company of investments in subsidiaries; and evaluated the ability  
of the subsidiaries to repay the loan balances.

Based on the procedures performed, we noted no material issues 
arising from our work.

How we tailored the audit scope

We tailored the scope of our audit to ensure that we performed 
enough work to be able to give an opinion on the financial statements 
as a whole, taking into account the structure of the Group and the 
Parent Company, the accounting processes and controls, and the 
industry in which they operate.

The core mining business comprises four mining operations: Los 
Pelambres; Centinela; Antucoya; and Zaldívar, a joint venture with 
Barrick Gold Corporation operated by the Group. These mines produce 
copper cathodes, copper concentrates and significant volumes of 
by-products.

In addition to mining, the Group has a transport division that provides 
rail and road cargo services in northern Chile, predominantly to mining 
customers, including to the Group’s own mining operations.

All of the above operations are located in Chile. In addition, the Group 
has corporate head offices located in both Santiago, Chile (Antofagasta 
Minerals S.A.) and London, UK (Antofagasta plc). The Group also has 
exploration projects in various countries.

In establishing the overall approach to the Group audit, we determined 
the type of work that needed to be performed at each of the four mine 
sites and the corporate offices in Chile, by us, as the Group 
engagement team and by component auditors from PwC Chile 
operating under our instruction. Los Pelambres and Centinela were 
considered to be financially significant components of the Group, due 
to their contribution towards Group profit before tax, and so required 
audits of their complete financial information. Antucoya and Zaldívar, 
as well as the Parent Company Antofagasta plc, were also subject to 
an audit of their complete financial information. We also requested that 
component auditors perform specified procedures over the corporate 
offices in Chile, and specific line items of other entities within the 
Group (including the transport division) to ensure that we had 
sufficient coverage from our audit work over each line of the Group’s 
financial statements. The Group engagement team also performed 
testing of the Group’s equity investment in Compañía de Minas 
Buenaventura S.A.A. and the related other financial asset, and the 
associated other comprehensive income and profit that has been 
recognised. For all other components, the Group team performed 
analytical review procedures.

Where work was performed by component auditors, we determined 
the level of involvement we needed to have in the audit work to be able 
to conclude whether sufficient appropriate audit evidence had been 
obtained as a basis for our opinion on the Group financial statements 
as a whole. Our oversight procedures included the issuance of formal, 
written instructions to the component auditors setting out the work to 

be performed, regular communication throughout the audit cycle 
including frequent meetings, the review of certain component auditor 
workpapers and participation in certain audit clearance meetings. In 
most cases, communication was performed through video 
conferencing. However, members of the Group team, including the 
senior statutory auditor, also visited Chile on multiple occasions during 
the audit. 

Taken together, the components where we performed our audit work 
accounted for 97% of consolidated revenue, 89% of consolidated profit 
before tax and 88% of consolidated profit before tax adjusted for 
one-off items. This was before considering the contribution to our 
audit evidence from performing audit work at the Group level, including 
disaggregated analytical review procedures, which covers a significant 
portion of the Group’s smaller and lower risk components that were 
not directly included in our Group audit scope.

The Parent Company financial statements are prepared in the 
corporate head office in Santiago, with oversight from the Group 
Financial Controller based in London, and are ultimately reviewed and 
approved by the Directors alongside the Group financial statements. 
The Parent Company financial statements were audited by the Group 
engagement team.

The impact of climate risk on our audit

In planning our work, including identifying areas of audit risk and 
determining an appropriate audit response, we were mindful of the 
increased focus on the impact of climate change risk on companies 
and their financial reporting, and also that the Group has identified 
climate change as a principal risk. As part of our audit, we made 
enquiries of management to understand its processes to assess 
the extent of the potential impact of climate change risks on the Group 
and its financial statements. This included consideration of the Group’s 
Climate Change Strategy and newly published targets to reduce Scope 
1 and 2 emissions by 50% by 2035 relative to the 2020 baseline, 
to reduce Scope 3 emissions by 10% by 2030, and, in the long-term, 
to achieve carbon neutrality.

Materiality

The scope of our audit was influenced by our application of materiality. 
We set certain quantitative thresholds for materiality. These, together 
with qualitative considerations, helped us to determine the scope of 
our audit and the nature, timing and extent of our audit procedures  
on the individual financial statement line items and disclosures and in 
evaluating the effect of misstatements, both individually and in 
aggregate on the financial statements as a whole.

Based on our professional judgement, we determined materiality for the financial statements as a whole as follows:

Overall 
materiality

How we 
determined it

Rationale for 
benchmark 
applied

Financial statements – Group

$117 million (2022: $112 million).

Financial statements – Parent Company

$21 million (2022: $20 million).

5% of the three year average of profit before tax adjusted for 
one-off items

1% of total assets

For the Parent Company materiality, we determined our 
materiality based on total assets, which is considered more 
relevant than a performance-related measure as the 
company is an investment holding company for the Group.

For overall Group materiality, we chose to use an underlying 
earnings measure as the benchmark because an underlying 
measure removes the impact of material items that do not 
recur from year-to-year or otherwise significantly affect the 
underlying trend of performance from continuing operations. 
The adoption of a multi-year average benchmark for 
materiality responds to longer term trends in commodity 
markets and reduces volatility in the measure year-on-year. 
Using our professional judgement, we determined materiality 
for this year at $117 million, which equates to approximately 6.5% 
of the current year’s profit before tax adjusted for one-off items.

186

Antofagasta plc  Annual Report 2023

FINANCIAL STATEMENTS 
For each component in the scope of our Group audit, we allocated 
a materiality that is less than our overall Group materiality. The range 
of materiality allocated across components was between $10 million 
and $94 million.

We use performance materiality to reduce to an appropriately low 
level the probability that the aggregate of uncorrected and undetected 
misstatements exceeds overall materiality. Specifically, we use 
performance materiality in determining the scope of our audit and the 
nature and extent of our testing of account balances, classes of 
transactions and disclosures, for example in determining sample 
sizes. Our performance materiality was 75% (2022: 75%) of overall 
materiality, amounting to $87.75 million (2022: $84 million) for the 
Group financial statements and $15.75 million (2022: $15 million) for 
the Parent Company financial statements.

In determining the performance materiality, we considered a number 
of factors – the history of misstatements, risk assessment and 
aggregation risk and the effectiveness of controls – and concluded that 
an amount at the upper end of our normal range was appropriate.

We agreed with the Audit and Risk Committee that we would report  
to them misstatements identified during our audit above $5.8 million 
(Group audit) (2022: $5.6 million) and $1.05 million (Parent Company 
audit) (2022: $1 million) as well as misstatements below those 
amounts that, in our view, warranted reporting for qualitative reasons.

Conclusions relating to going concern

Our evaluation of the Directors’ assessment of the Group’s and the 
Parent Company’s ability to continue to adopt the going concern basis 
of accounting included:

•  Obtaining and examining management’s base case forecasts and 

downside scenarios, checking that the forecasts had been subject  
to board review and, in the case of the base case, approval;

•  Considering the historical reliability of management forecasting by 

comparing budgeted results with actual performance;

•  Assessing the future cash flows included in the base case to ensure 

that these were consistent with our understanding from work 
performed over other key accounting estimates in the financial 
statements such as the impairment indicator assessment;

•  Confirming that the downside scenarios applied by management 

represent severe but plausible downside scenarios in the context of 
our understanding of the business, and performing our own 
sensitivity analysis to understand the impact of changes in cash 
flows and net debt on the resources available to the Group; and
•  Reading management’s papers to the Audit and Risk Committee in 
respect of going concern, and agreeing the forecasts set out in 
these papers to the underlying base case cash flow model.

Based on the work we have performed, we have not identified any 
material uncertainties relating to events or conditions that, individually 
or collectively, may cast significant doubt on the Group’s and the 
Parent Company’s ability to continue as a going concern for a period of 
at least twelve months from when the financial statements are 
authorised for issue.

In auditing the financial statements, we have concluded that the 
Directors’ use of the going concern basis of accounting in the 
preparation of the financial statements is appropriate.

However, because not all future events or conditions can be predicted, 
this conclusion is not a guarantee as to the Group’s and the Parent 
Company’s ability to continue as a going concern.

In relation to the Directors’ reporting on how they have applied the  
UK Corporate Governance Code, we have nothing material to add or 
draw attention to in relation to the Directors’ statement in the financial 
statements about whether the Directors considered it appropriate to 
adopt the going concern basis of accounting.

Our responsibilities and the responsibilities of the Directors with 
respect to going concern are described in the relevant sections of this 
report.

Reporting on other information

The other information comprises all of the information in the Annual 
Report other than the financial statements and our auditors’ report 
thereon. The Directors are responsible for the other information.  
Our opinion on the financial statements does not cover the other 
information and, accordingly, we do not express an audit opinion or, 
except to the extent otherwise explicitly stated in this report, any form 
of assurance thereon.

In connection with our audit of the financial statements, our 
responsibility is to read the other information and, in doing so, consider 
whether the other information is materially inconsistent with the 
financial statements or our knowledge obtained in the audit, or 
otherwise appears to be materially misstated. If we identify an 
apparent material inconsistency or material misstatement, we are 
required to perform procedures to conclude whether there is a 
material misstatement of the financial statements or a material 
misstatement of the other information. If, based on the work we have 
performed, we conclude that there is a material misstatement of this 
other information, we are required to report that fact. We have nothing 
to report based on these responsibilities.

With respect to the Strategic Report and Directors’ Report, we also 
considered whether the disclosures required by the UK Companies 
Act 2006 have been included.

Based on our work undertaken in the course of the audit, the 
Companies Act 2006 requires us also to report certain opinions  
and matters as described below.

Strategic Report and Directors’ Report

In our opinion, based on the work undertaken in the course of the 
audit, the information given in the Strategic Report and Directors’ 
Report for the year ended 31 December 2023 is consistent with the 
financial statements and has been prepared in accordance with 
applicable legal requirements.

In light of the knowledge and understanding of the Group and Parent 
Company and their environment obtained in the course of the audit, 
we did not identify any material misstatements in the Strategic Report 
and Directors’ Report.

Directors’ Remuneration

In our opinion, the part of the Directors’ and CEO’s Remuneration 
Report to be audited has been properly prepared in accordance with 
the Companies Act 2006.

Responsibilities for the financial statements and the audit

Responsibilities of the Directors for the financial statements

The Listing Rules require us to review the Directors’ statements in 
relation to going concern, longer-term viability and that part of the 
corporate governance statement relating to the Parent Company’s 
compliance with the provisions of the UK Corporate Governance Code 
specified for our review. Our additional responsibilities with respect to

Based on the work undertaken as part of our audit, we have concluded 
that each of the following elements of the corporate governance 
statement is materially consistent with the financial statements and 
our knowledge obtained during the audit, and we have nothing material 
to add or draw attention to in relation to:

•  The Directors’ confirmation that they have carried out a robust 

assessment of the emerging and principal risks;

•  The disclosures in the Annual Report that describe those principal 
risks, what procedures are in place to identify emerging risks and  
an explanation of how these are being managed or mitigated;

•  The Directors’ statement in the financial statements about whether 
they considered it appropriate to adopt the going concern basis of 
accounting in preparing them, and their identification of any material 
uncertainties to the Group’s and Parent Company’s ability to 
continue to do so over a period of at least twelve months from the 
date of approval of the financial statements;

•  The Directors’ explanation as to their assessment of the Group’s 

and Parent Company’s prospects, the period this assessment covers 
and why the period is appropriate; and

•  The Directors’ statement as to whether they have a reasonable 
expectation that the Parent Company will be able to continue in 
operation and meet its liabilities as they fall due over the period of its 
assessment, including any related disclosures drawing attention to 
any necessary qualifications or assumptions.

Our review of the Directors’ statement regarding the longer-term 
viability of the Group and Parent Company was substantially less in 
scope than an audit and only consisted of making inquiries and 
considering the Directors’ process supporting their statement; 
checking that the statement is in alignment with the relevant provisions 
of the UK Corporate Governance Code; and considering whether the 
statement is consistent with the financial statements and our 
knowledge and understanding of the Group and Parent company and 
their environment obtained in the course of the audit.

In addition, based on the work undertaken as part of our audit, we 
have concluded that each of the following elements of the corporate 
governance statement is materially consistent with the financial 
statements and our knowledge obtained during the audit:

•  The Directors’ statement that they consider the Annual Report, 

taken as a whole, is fair, balanced and understandable, and provides 
the information necessary for the members to assess the Group’s 
and Parent Company’s position, performance, business model and 
strategy;

•  The section of the Annual Report that describes the review of 

effectiveness of risk management and internal control systems; and
•  The section of the Annual Report describing the work of the Audit 

and Risk Committee.

We have nothing to report in respect of our responsibility to report 
when the Directors’ statement relating to the Parent Company’s 
compliance with the Code does not properly disclose a departure from 
a relevant provision of the Code specified under the Listing Rules for 
review by the auditors.

As explained more fully in the Statement of Directors’ responsibilities, 
the Directors are responsible for the preparation of the financial 
statements in accordance with the applicable framework and for being 
satisfied that they give a true and fair view. The Directors are also 
responsible for such internal control as they determine is necessary  
to enable the preparation of financial statements that are free from 
material misstatement, whether due to fraud or error.

In preparing the financial statements, the Directors are responsible for 
assessing the Group’s and the Parent Company’s ability to continue as 
a going concern, disclosing, as applicable, matters related to going 
concern and using the going concern basis of accounting unless the 
Directors either intend to liquidate the Group or the Parent Company 
or to cease operations, or have no realistic alternative but to do so.

Auditors’ responsibilities for the audit of the financial statements

Our objectives are to obtain reasonable assurance about whether the 
financial statements as a whole are free from material misstatement, 
whether due to fraud or error, and to issue an auditors’ report that 
includes our opinion. Reasonable assurance is a high level of 
assurance, but is not a guarantee that an audit conducted in 
accordance with ISAs (UK) will always detect a material misstatement 
when it exists. Misstatements can arise from fraud or error and are 
considered material if, individually or in the aggregate, they could 
reasonably be expected to influence the economic decisions of users 
taken on the basis of these financial statements.

Irregularities, including fraud, are instances of non-compliance  
with laws and regulations. We design procedures in line with our 
responsibilities, outlined above, to detect material misstatements  
in respect of irregularities, including fraud. The extent to which our 
procedures are capable of detecting irregularities, including fraud,  
is detailed below.

Based on our understanding of the Group and industry, we identified 
that the principal risks of non-compliance with laws and regulations 
related to breaches of environmental regulations and health and safety 
regulations, and we considered the extent to which non-compliance 
might have a material effect on the financial statements. We also 
considered those laws and regulations that have a direct impact on the 
financial statements such as the Companies Act 2006 and tax law in 
the jurisdictions in which the Group operates. We evaluated 
management’s incentives and opportunities for fraudulent manipulation 
of the financial statements (including the risk of override of controls), 
and determined that the principal risks were related to the posting of 
inappropriate journal entries to increase revenue or reduce 
expenditure, and management bias in accounting estimates. The Group 
engagement team shared this risk assessment with the component 
auditors so that they could include appropriate audit procedures in 
response to such risks in their work. Audit procedures performed by 
the Group engagement team and/or component auditors included:

• 

Inquiries with management, including the Group’s Vice President of 
Legal and the Head of Internal Audit, regarding their consideration 
of known or suspected instances of non-compliance with laws and 
regulation;

•  Obtaining legal letters from the Group’s external legal advisers in 
respect of litigation and claims and other such matters, where 
considered necessary;

•  Evaluation of management’s controls designed to prevent and detect 

irregularities;

•  Challenging assumptions and judgements made by management in 
respect of critical accounting judgements and significant accounting 
estimates; and
Identifying and testing journal entries, in particular any journal 
entries posted with certain unusual account combinations.

FINANCIAL STATEMENTSOther matter
In due course, as required by the Financial Conduct Authority 
Disclosure Guidance and Transparency Rule 4.1.14R, these financial 
statements will form part of the ESEF-prepared annual financial report 
filed on the National Storage Mechanism of the Financial Conduct 
Authority in accordance with the ESEF Regulatory Technical Standard 
(‘ESEF RTS’). This auditors’ report provides no assurance over 
whether the annual financial report will be prepared using the single 
electronic format specified in the ESEF RTS.

SIMON MORLEY (SENIOR STATUTORY AUDITOR)
for and on behalf of PricewaterhouseCoopers LLP 
Chartered Accountants and Statutory Auditors 
London

20 March 2024

There are inherent limitations in the audit procedures described above. 
We are less likely to become aware of instances of non-compliance 
with laws and regulations that are not closely related to events and 
transactions reflected in the financial statements. Also, the risk of not 
detecting a material misstatement due to fraud is higher than the risk 
of not detecting one resulting from error, as fraud may involve 
deliberate concealment by, for example, forgery or intentional 
misrepresentations, or through collusion.

Our audit testing might include testing complete populations of 
certain transactions and balances, possibly using data auditing 
techniques. However, it typically involves selecting a limited number 
of items for testing, rather than testing complete populations. We will 
often seek to target particular items for testing based on their size or 
risk characteristics. In other cases, we will use audit sampling to 
enable us to draw a conclusion about the population from which the 
sample is selected.

A further description of our responsibilities for the audit of the 
financial statements is located on the FRC’s website at: 
www.frc.org.uk/auditorsresponsibilities. This description forms 
part of our auditors’ report.

Use of this report

This report, including the opinions, has been prepared for and only for 
the Parent Company’s members as a body in accordance with Chapter 
3 of Part 16 of the Companies Act 2006 and for no other purpose. We 
do not, in giving these opinions, accept or assume responsibility for 
any other purpose or to any other person to whom this report is 
shown or into whose hands it may come save where expressly agreed 
by our prior consent in writing.

Other required reporting

Companies Act 2006 exception reporting

Under the Companies Act 2006 we are required to report to you if,  
in our opinion:

•  we have not obtained all the information and explanations we 

require for our audit; or

•  adequate accounting records have not been kept by the Parent 

Company, or returns adequate for our audit have not been received 
from branches not visited by us; or

•  certain disclosures of Directors’ remuneration specified by law 

are not made; or

•  the Parent Company financial statements and the part of the 
Directors’ and CEO’s Remuneration Report to be audited are 
not in agreement with the accounting records and returns.

We have no exceptions to report arising from this responsibility.

Appointment

Following the recommendation of the Audit and Risk Committee,  
we were appointed by the members on 20 May 2015 to audit the 
financial statements for the year ended 31 December 2015 and 
subsequent financial periods. The period of total uninterrupted 
engagement is nine years, covering the years ended 31 December 
2015 to 31 December 2023.

1  Basis of preparation 
The consolidated financial statements of the Antofagasta plc Group have 
been prepared in accordance with UK adopted international accounting 
standards and with the requirements of the Companies Act 2006 as 
applicable to companies reporting under those standards. The financial 
statements have been prepared on the going concern basis.  

Going concern 
The Directors have assessed the going concern status of the Group, 
considering the period to 31 December 2025. 

The Group’s business activities, together with those factors likely to affect 
its future performance, are set out in the Strategic Report, and in particular 
within the Operating Review. Details of the cash flows of the Group during 
the period, along with its financial position at the period-end, are set out in 
the Financial Review. The consolidated financial statements include details 
of the Group’s cash, cash equivalents and liquid investment balances in Note 
23, and details of borrowings are set out in Note 24. 

When assessing the going concern status of the Group, the Directors have 
considered in particular its financial position, including its significant balance 
of cash, cash equivalents and liquid investments and the terms and 
remaining durations of the borrowing facilities in place. The Group had a 
strong financial position as at 31 December 2023, with combined cash, cash 
equivalents and liquid investments of $2,919.4 million. Total borrowings 
were $4,079.2 million, resulting in a net debt position of $1,159.8 million. Of 
the total borrowings, only 22% is repayable within one year, and 16% 
repayable between one and two years.  

When assessing the prospects of the Group, the Directors have considered 
the Group’s copper price forecasts, the Group’s expected production levels, 
operating cost profile and capital expenditure. These forecasts are based on 
the Group’s budgets and life-of-mine models, which are also used when 
assessing relevant accounting estimates, including depreciation, deferred 
stripping and closure provisions, and accounting judgements including 
potential indicators of impairment.  

The principal analysis has only considered existing committed borrowing 
facilities in place as of 31 December 2023, and has not assumed that any 
new borrowing facilities will be put in place. Given the planned financing for 
the Centinela Second Concentrator project was not in place as at 31 
December 2023, we have not included the planned development of that 
project within this principal scenario. As an additional scenario we have 
forecast the impact of the development of this project, which assumes a 
typical financing environment which allows us to put in place our planned 
financing for the project. In addition, we have also modelled sensitivities 
reflecting the impact of potential overruns in the project costs. 

The forecasts have assumed distributions in line with the Group’s policy that 
the total annual dividend for each year would represent a payout ratio based 
on underlying net earnings (as defined in the Alternative Performance 
Measures section) for that year of at least 35%. 

The Directors have assessed the key risks which could impact the 
prospects of the Group over the going concern period and consider the 
most relevant to be risks to the copper price outlook, as this is the factor 
most likely to result in significant volatility in earnings and cash generation. 
Robust down-side sensitivity analyses have been performed in relation to 
the principal analysis described above, assessing the standalone impact of 
each of: 

o 

o 

o 

o 

A significant deterioration in the future copper price forecasts, by an 
average of approximately 15% throughout the going concern period. 
An even more pronounced short-term reduction of 50 c/lb in the copper 
price for a period of three months, in addition to the above general 
deterioration in the copper price throughout the review period. 
The potential impact of the Group’s most significant individual operational 
risks. 
A shut-down of any one of the Group’s operations for a period of three 
months, or a shut-down of all of the Group’s operations for a period of 
one month. 

The stability of tailings storage facilities represents a potentially significant 
operational risk for mining operations globally. The Group’s tailings storage 
facilities are designed to international standards, constructed using 
downstream methods, subject to rigorous monitoring and reporting, and 
reviewed regularly by an international panel of independent experts. Given 
these standards of design, development, operations and review, the impact 
of a potential tailings dam failure has not been included in the sensitivity 
analysis.

Antofagasta plc  Annual Report 2023

The above down-side sensitivity analyses indicated results which could be 
managed in the normal course of business, including the aggregate impact 
of a number of the above sensitivities occurring at the same time. The 
analysis indicated that the Group is expected to remain in compliance with 
all of the covenant requirements of its borrowings throughout the review 
period and retain sufficient liquidity. Based on their assessment of the 
Group’s prospects, the Directors have formed a judgement, at the time of 
approving the financial statements, that there are no material uncertainties 
that the Directors are aware of that cast doubt on the Group’s going 
concern status and that there is a reasonable expectation that the Group 
has adequate resources to continue in operational existence for the period 
to 31 December 2025. The Directors therefore consider it appropriate to 
adopt the going concern basis of accounting in preparing the financial 
statements. 

Company structure 
Antofagasta plc is a company limited by shares, incorporated and 
domiciled in the United Kingdom at 103 Mount Street, London W1K 
2TJ.The immediate parent of the Group is Metalinvest Establishment, 
which is controlled by the E. Abaroa Foundation, in which members of the 
Luksic family are interested. 

The nature of the Group’s operations is mining and exploration activities 
and the transport of rail and road cargo.  

A) Adoption of new accounting standards 
The following accounting standards, amendments and interpretations 
became effective in the current reporting period:

o 
2  Material accounting policies 
A) Accounting convention 
These financial statements have been prepared under the historical cost 
convention as modified by the use of fair values to measure certain 
financial instruments, principally provisionally priced sales as explained in 
Note 2(F) and financial derivative contracts as explained in Note 2(V). 

B) Basis of consolidation 
The financial statements comprise the consolidated financial statements  
of Antofagasta plc (‘‘the Company’’ or ‘‘the Parent’’ or ‘‘the Parent 
Company’’) and its subsidiaries (collectively ‘‘the Group’’). 

Subsidiaries -- A subsidiary is an entity over which the Group has control, 
which is the case when the Group is exposed to, or has rights to, variable 
returns from its involvement with the entity and has the ability to affect 
those returns through its power over the entity. The consolidated financial 
statements include all the assets, liabilities, revenues, expenses and cash 
flows of the Company and its subsidiaries after eliminating intercompany 
balances and transactions. For partly-owned subsidiaries, the net assets 
and profit attributable to non-controlling shareholders are presented as 
‘‘Non-controlling interests’’ in the consolidated balance sheet and 
consolidated income statement.

FINANCIAL STATEMENTS 
 
 
Non-controlling interests that are present ownership interests and entitle  
their holders to a proportionate share of the entity’s net assets in the event 
of liquidation may be initially measured either at fair value or at the non-
controlling interests’ proportionate share of the recognised amounts of the 
acquiree’s identifiable net assets. The choice of measurement basis is made 
on an acquisition-by-acquisition basis. Subsequent to acquisition, the 
carrying amount of non-controlling interests is the amount of those 
interests at initial recognition plus the non-controlling interests’ share of 
subsequent changes in equity. Total comprehensive income is attributed to 
non-controlling interests even if this results in the non-controlling interests 
having a deficit balance. 

Changes in the Group’s ownership interests in subsidiaries that do not  
result in the Group losing control over the subsidiaries are accounted for  
as equity transactions. The carrying amounts of the Group’s interests and 
the non-controlling interests are adjusted to reflect the changes in their 
relative interests in the subsidiaries. Any difference between the amount  
by which the non-controlling interests are adjusted and the fair value of  
the consideration paid or received is recognised directly in equity and 
attributed to owners of the Company. 

When the Group loses control of a subsidiary, a gain or loss is recognised  
in profit or loss and is calculated as the difference between (i) the aggregate 
of the fair value of the consideration received and the fair value of any 
retained interest and (ii) the previous carrying amount of the assets 
(including goodwill), and liabilities of the subsidiary and any non-controlling 
interests. When assets of the subsidiary are carried at revalued amounts or 
fair values and the related cumulative gain or loss has been recognised in 
other comprehensive income and accumulated in equity, the amounts 
previously recognised in other comprehensive income and accumulated in 
equity are accounted for as if the Group had directly disposed of the 
relevant assets (i.e. reclassified to profit or loss or transferred directly to 
retained earnings as specified by applicable IFRSs). The fair value of any 
investment retained in the former subsidiary at the date when control is lost 
is regarded as the fair value on initial recognition for subsequent accounting 
under IFRS 9 Financial Instruments: Recognition and Measurement or, 
when applicable, the cost on initial recognition of an investment in an 
associate or a joint venture. 

C) Investments in associates 
An associate is an entity over which the Group is in a position to exercise 
significant influence, but not control or joint control, through the power to 
participate in the financial and operating policy decisions of that entity. The 
results and assets and liabilities of associates are incorporated in these 
consolidated financial statements using the equity method of accounting.  

This requires recording the investment initially at cost to the Group and 
then, in subsequent periods, adjusting the carrying amount of the 
investment to reflect the Group’s share of the associate’s results less any 
impairment and any other changes to the associate’s net assets such as 
dividends. When the Group loses control of a former subsidiary but retains 
an investment in associate in that entity, the initial carrying value of the 
investment in associate is recorded at its fair value at that point. When the 
Group’s share of losses of an associate exceeds the Group’s interest in that 
associate, the Group discontinues recognising its share of further losses. 
Additional losses are recognised only to the extent that the Group has 
incurred legal or constructive obligations or made payments on behalf of the 
associate. 

D) Joint arrangements 
A joint arrangement is an arrangement of which two or more parties have 
joint control. Joint arrangements are accounted for depending on the nature 
of the arrangement. 

(i)  Joint ventures -- are accounted for using the equity method in 

accordance with IAS 28 Investment in Associates and Joint Ventures  
as described in Note 18. 

(ii)  Joint operations -- are accounted for recognising directly the assets, 
obligations, revenues and expenses of the joint operator in the joint 
arrangement. The assets, liabilities, revenues and expenses are  
accounted for in accordance with the relevant IFRS.  

When a Group entity transacts with its joint arrangements, profits and 
losses resulting from the transactions with the joint arrangements 
are recognised in the Group’s consolidated financial statements only 
to the extent of interests in the joint arrangements that are not related 
to the Group. 

E) Currency translation 
The functional currency for each entity in the Group is determined as the 
currency of the primary economic environment in which it operates. 
Transactions in currencies other than the functional currency of the entity 
are translated at the exchange rate ruling at the date of the transaction. 

Monetary assets and liabilities denominated in currencies other than the 
functional currency are retranslated at year end exchange rates. Gains 
and losses on retranslation are included in net profit or loss for the period 
within other finance items. 

The presentational currency of the Group and the functional currency of 
the Company is the US dollar. On consolidation, income statement items 
for entities with a functional currency other than the US dollar are 
translated into US dollars at average rates of exchange. Balance sheet 
items are translated at period-end exchange rates. Exchange differences 
on translation of the net assets of such entities are taken to equity and 
recorded in a separate currency translation reserve. Cumulative 
translation differences arising after the transition date to IFRS are 
recognised as income or as expenses in the income statement in the 
period in which an operation is disposed of. 

On consolidation, exchange gains and losses which arise on balances 
between Group entities are taken to reserves where that balance is, in 
substance, part of the net investment in a foreign operation, i.e. where 
settlement is neither planned nor likely to occur in the foreseeable future. 
All other exchange gains and losses on Group balances are recognised in 
the income statement within other finance items. 

Fair value adjustments and any goodwill arising on the acquisition of a 
foreign entity are treated as assets of the foreign entity and translated  
at the period-end rate. 

F) Revenue recognition and other income 
Revenue represents the value of goods and services supplied to third 
parties during the year. Revenue is measured at the fair value of 
consideration received or receivable, and excludes any applicable sales 
tax.  

Revenue is recognised when the Group satisfies a performance obligation 
by transferring a promised good or service to a customer. An asset is 
transferred when (or as) the customer obtains control of that asset. 

For the Group’s mining products, the customer generally gains control 
over the material when it has been loaded at the port of loading, and so 
this is the point of revenue recognition. The Group sells a significant 
proportion of its products on Cost, Insurance & Freight (CIF) Incoterms, 
which means that the Group is responsible for shipping the product to a 
destination port specified by the customer. In these cases, the customer 
still gains control over the material when it has been loaded at the port of 
loading, and so that remains the point of revenue recognition for the sale 
of material; however, the shipping service represents a separate 
performance obligation, and revenue in relation to such services is 
recognised separately from the sale of the material over time as the 
shipping service is provided, along with the associated costs. Shipping 
revenue is recognised at the contracted price of the shipping service to 
the Group as this reflects the standalone selling price. 

Revenue from mining activities is recorded at the invoiced amounts with 
an adjustment for provisional pricing at each reporting date, as explained 
below. For copper and molybdenum concentrates, which are sold to 
smelters and roasting plants for further processing into fully refined metal, 
the price of the concentrate invoiced to the customer reflects the market 
value of the fully refined metal less a ‘‘treatment and refining charge’’ 
deduction, to reflect the lower value of this partially processed material 
compared with the fully refined metal. Revenue includes amounts from the 
sale of by-products such as gold and silver. 

Copper and molybdenum concentrate sale agreements and copper 
cathode sale agreements generally provide for provisional pricing of sales 
at the time of shipment, with final pricing based on the monthly average 
London Metal Exchange (‘‘LME’’) copper price or the monthly average 
market molybdenum price for specified future periods. This normally 
ranges from one to four months after delivery to the customer. For sales 
contracts which contain provisional pricing mechanisms, the initial invoice 
typically reflects the month-average market price for the metal in the 
month of shipment, with the associated receivable balance subsequently 
measured at fair value through profit or loss. Gains and losses from the 
marking-to-market of the receivable balance in relation to open sales are 
recognised through adjustments to other income presented within 
revenue in the income statement and to trade receivables in the balance 
sheet. The fair value calculations are based on forward prices at the 
period end for copper concentrate and cathode sales, and period-end 
average prices for molybdenum concentrate sales due to the absence 
of a futures market for this product. 

For the Transport division, revenue in respect of its transportation and 
ancillary services are recognised over time in line with the performance 
of those services.

Financial statements continued 

2  Material accounting policies continued 
Interest income 
Interest income is accrued on a time basis, by reference to the principal 
outstanding and the effective interest rate applicable, which is the rate that 
exactly discounts estimated future cash receipts through the expected life of 
the financial asset to that asset’s net carrying amount. 

Interest received is recognised within investing activities in the consolidated 
cash flow statement. 

Dividend income 
Dividend income from equity investments, associates and joint ventures is 
recognised when the shareholders’ right to receive payment has been 
established. For associates and joint ventures, it is recorded as a decrease 
of the investment. 

G) Exploration and evaluation expenditure 
Exploration and evaluation costs, other than those incurred in acquiring 
exploration licences, are expensed in the year in which they are incurred. 
When a mining project is considered to be commercially viable (normally 
when the project has completed a pre-feasibility study, and the start of a 
feasibility study has been approved) all further directly attributable pre-
production expenditure is capitalised. Capitalisation of pre-production 
expenditure ceases when commercial levels of production are achieved.  

Costs incurred in acquiring exploration and mining licences are classified as 
intangible assets when construction of the related mining operation has not 
yet commenced. When construction commences the licences are 
transferred from intangible assets to the mining properties category within 
property, plant and equipment. 

H) Stripping costs 
Pre-stripping and operating stripping costs are incurred in the course of the 
development and operation of open-pit mining operations. 

Pre-stripping costs relate to the removal of waste material as part of the 
initial development of an open-pit, in order to allow access to the ore body. 
The capitalised costs are depreciated once production commences on a unit 
of production basis, in proportion to the volume of ore extracted in the year 
compared with total proven and probable reserves for that pit at the 
beginning of the year.  

Operating stripping costs relate to the costs of extracting waste material as 
part of the ongoing mining process. The ongoing mining and development 
of the Group’s open-pit mines is generally performed via a succession of 
individual phases. The costs of extracting material from an open-pit mine 
are generally allocated between ore and waste stripping in proportion to 
the tonnes of material extracted. The waste stripping costs are generally 
absorbed into inventory and expensed as that inventory is processed and 
sold. Where the stripping costs relate to a significant stripping campaign 
which is expected to provide improved access to an identifiable component 
of the ore body (typically an individual phase within the overall mine plan), 
the costs of removing waste in order to improve access to that part of 
the ore body will be capitalised within property, plant and equipment. 
The capitalised costs will then be amortised on a unit of production basis, 
in proportion to the volume of ore extracted compared with the total 
ore contained in the component of the pit to which the stripping 
campaign relates.  

I) Intangible assets 
Exploration and mining licences are classified as intangible assets when 
construction of the related mining operation has not yet commenced. 
When construction commences, the licences are transferred from 
intangible assets to the mining properties category within property, 
plant and equipment.  

J) Property, plant and equipment 
The costs of mining properties and leases, which include the costs of 
acquiring and developing mining properties and mineral rights, are 
capitalised as property, plant and equipment in the year in which they are 
incurred, when a mining project is considered to be commercially viable 
(normally when the project has completed a pre-feasibility study, and the 
start of a feasibility study has been approved). The cost of property, plant 
and equipment comprises the purchase price and any costs directly 
attributable to bringing the asset to the location and condition necessary 
for it to be capable of operating in the manner intended. Once a project has 
been established as commercially viable, related development expenditure 
is capitalised. This includes costs incurred in preparing the site for mining 
operations, including pre-stripping costs. Capitalisation ceases when 
the mine is capable of commercial production, with the exception of 
development costs which give rise to a future benefit.

AAnnttooffaaggaassttaa  ppllcc  Annual Report 2023 
Antofagasta plc  Annual Report 2023

Interest on borrowings related to the construction or development of 
projects is capitalised as part of the cost of the asset. To the extent that 
borrowings have been put in place specifically to fund the construction of 
the asset, the capitalised amount will reflect the actual interest costs 
incurred on that borrowing. If the construction is funded out of general 
borrowings, the capitalised interest expense will be calculated based on 
the entity’s weighted average interest rate, applied to the expenditure on 
the asset (with the capitalised interest amount not exceeding the entity’s 
total borrowing cost for the period). The interest costs are capitalised, 
until such time as the assets are substantially ready for their intended use 
or sale which, in the case of mining properties, is when they are capable 
of commercial production.  

K) Depreciation of property, plant and equipment  
Depreciation of an asset begins when it is available for use, i.e. when it is 
in the location and condition necessary for it to be capable of operating in 
the manner intended. 

Property, plant and equipment is depreciated over its useful life, or over  
the remaining life of the operation if shorter, to residual value. The major 
categories of property, plant and equipment are depreciated as follows: 

(i) 

Land -- freehold land is not depreciated unless the value of the land 
is considered to relate directly to a particular mining operation, in 
which case the land is depreciated on a straight-line basis over the 
expected mine life. 

(ii)  Mining properties -- mining properties, including capitalised financing 
costs, are depreciated on a unit of production basis, in proportion to 
the volume of ore extracted in the year compared with total proven 
and probable reserves at the beginning of the year. 

(iii)  Buildings and infrastructure -- straight-line basis over 10 to 25 years. 
(iv)  Railway track (including trackside equipment) -- straight-line basis 

over 20 to 25 years. 

(v)  Wagons and rolling stock -- straight-line basis over 10 to 20 years. 
(vi)  Machinery, equipment and other assets -- are depreciated on a  

unit of production basis, in proportion to the volume of ore/material 
processed or hours of equipment usage, or on a straight-line basis 
over 5 to 20 years. 

(vii)  Assets under construction -- no depreciation until asset is available 

for use. 

(viii)  Lease right-of-use assets -- depreciated over the shorter of the 
asset’s useful life and the lease term on a straight-line basis. 

(ix)  Stripping cost -- capitalised costs are amortised on a unit of 

production basis, in proportion to the volume of ore extracted 
compared with the total ore contained in the component of the pit 
to which the stripping campaign relates (Note 15). 

Residual values and useful lives are reviewed, and adjusted if appropriate, 
at least annually, and changes to residual values and useful lives are 
accounted for prospectively. 

L) Impairment of property, plant and equipment and 
intangible assets  
Property, plant and equipment and intangible assets relating to 
exploration and mining licences are reviewed for impairment if there 
is any indication that the carrying amount may not be recoverable. 
In respect of historical impairments recognised in prior years, the Group 
also assesses whether there is any indication that impairment may no 
longer exist or may have decreased.  

If any such indications exist, the recoverable amount of the asset is 
estimated in order to determine the extent of the impairment or reversal 
(if any). Where the asset does not generate cash flows that are largely 
independent from other assets, the Group estimates the recoverable 
amount of the cash-generating unit to which the asset belongs.  

FINANCIAL STATEMENTS 
 
 
  
Recoverable amount is the higher of fair value less costs of disposal and 
value in use. Fair value less costs of disposal reflects the net amount the 
Group would receive from the sale of the asset in an orderly transaction 
between market participants. For mining assets, this would generally be 
determined based on the present value of the estimated future cash flows 
arising from the continued use, further development or eventual disposal of 
the asset. The estimates used in determining the present value of those 
cash flows are those that an independent market participant would consider 
appropriate. Value in use reflects the expected present value of the future 
cash flows which the Group would generate through the operation of the 
asset in its current condition, without taking into account potential 
enhancements or further development of the asset. The fair value less costs 
of disposal valuation will normally be higher than the value in use valuation, 
as realisation of the full potential of the Group’s mining operations typically 
requires further capital expenditure and ongoing mine development, and 
accordingly the Group typically applies this valuation estimate in its 
impairment assessments, unless indicated otherwise. Details of the 
valuations and sensitivities of the Group’s mining operations considered 
as part of the impairment trigger assessment are included in Note 5. 

If the recoverable amount of an asset or cash-generating unit is estimated 
to be less than its carrying amount, the carrying amount is reduced to the 
recoverable amount. An impairment charge is recognised in the income 
statement immediately. Where an impairment subsequently reverses, the 
carrying amount is increased to the revised estimate of recoverable amount, 
but so that the increased carrying amount does not exceed the carrying 
value that would have been determined if no impairment had previously 
been recognised after taking into account the depreciation and/or 
amortisation that would otherwise have been recorded in the intervening 
period. A reversal is recognised in the income statement immediately. 

M) Inventory 
Inventory consists of raw materials and consumables, work-in-progress 
and finished goods. Work-in-progress represents material that is in the 
process of being converted into finished goods. The conversion process for 
mining operations depends on the nature of the copper ore. For sulphide 
ores, processing typically includes milling and concentrating, resulting in the 
production of copper concentrate. For oxide ores, processing includes 
leaching of stockpiles, solvent extraction and electrowinning and results in 
the production of copper cathodes. Finished goods consist of copper 
concentrate containing gold and silver at Los Pelambres and Centinela and 
copper cathodes at Centinela and Antucoya. Los Pelambres and Centinela 
also produce molybdenum as a by-product. 

Inventory is valued at the lower of cost, on a weighted average basis, and 
net realisable value. Net realisable value represents estimated selling price 
less all estimated costs of completion and costs to be incurred in marketing, 
selling and distribution. Cost of finished goods and work-in-progress is 
production cost and for raw materials and consumables it is purchase price. 
Production cost includes: 

o 

o 

labour costs, raw material costs and other costs directly attributable to 
the extraction and processing of ore, 
depreciation of plant, equipment and mining properties directly involved in 
the production process, and 
an appropriate allocation of production overheads. 

o 
Stockpiles represent ore that is extracted and is available for further 
processing. Costs directly attributable to the extraction of ore are generally 
allocated as part of production costs in proportion to the tonnes of material 
extracted. Operating stripping costs are generally absorbed into inventory, 
and therefore expensed as that inventory is processed and sold. If ore is not 
expected to be processed within 12 months of the balance sheet date it is 
included within non-current assets. If there is significant uncertainty as to 
when any stockpiled ore will be processed, it is expensed as incurred. 

N) Taxation 
Tax expense comprises the charges or credits for the year relating to both 
current and deferred tax. 

Current tax is based on taxable profit for the year. Taxable profit may differ 
from net profit as reported in the income statement because it excludes 
items of income or expense that are taxable and deductible in different 
years and also excludes items that are not taxable or deductible. The liability 
for current tax is calculated using tax rates for each entity in the 
consolidated financial statements which have been enacted or substantively 
enacted at the balance sheet date. 

Deferred tax is the tax expected to be payable or recoverable on temporary 
differences (i.e. differences between the carrying amount of assets and 
liabilities in the financial statements and the corresponding tax basis used in 
the computation of taxable profit). Deferred tax is accounted for using the 

balance sheet liability method and is provided on all temporary differences 
with certain limited exceptions as follows: 

(i) 

tax payable on undistributed earnings of subsidiaries, associates and 
joint ventures is provided except where the Group is able to control 
the remittance of profits and it is probable that there will be no 
remittance of past profits earned in the foreseeable future, 

(ii)  deferred tax is not provided on the initial recognition of an asset or 

liability in a transaction that is not a business combination and, at the 
time of the transaction, affects neither accounting or taxable profit 
and does not give rise to equal taxable and deductible temporary 
differences, and 

the initial recognition of any goodwill. 

(iii) 
Deferred tax assets are recognised only to the extent that it is probable 
that they will be recovered through sufficient future taxable profit. The 
carrying amount of deferred tax assets is reviewed at each balance sheet 
date. 

Deferred tax is calculated at the tax rates that are expected to apply in the 
period when the liability is settled or the asset is realised. Deferred tax is 
charged or credited in the income statement, except when it relates to 
items charged or credited directly to equity, in which case the deferred tax 
is also taken directly to equity. 

O) Provisions 
Provisions are recognised when the Group has a present obligation (legal 
or constructive) as a result of a past event, it is probable that the Group 
will be required to settle the obligation and a reliable estimate can be 
made of the amount of the obligation. 

The amount recognised as a provision is the best estimate of the 
consideration required to settle the present obligation at the end of 
the reporting period, taking into account the risks and uncertainties 
surrounding the obligation. When a provision is measured using the cash 
flows estimated to settle the present obligation, its carrying amount is the 
present value of those cash flows (when the effect of the time value of 
money is material). 

When some or all of the economic benefits required to settle a provision 
are expected to be recovered from a third party, a receivable is 
recognised as an asset if it is virtually certain that reimbursement will be 
received and the amount of the receivable can be measured reliably. 

P) Provisions for decommissioning and restoration costs 
Obligations to incur decommissioning and restoration costs can arise as 
a result of the development or ongoing operation of a mining property. 
Costs are estimated on the basis of a formal closure plan and are subject 
to regular formal review. 

Decommissioning obligations arising from the construction of property, 
plant and equipment (including installation of plant and site preparation 
work) are provided for at their net present value as the construction of 
the asset gives rise to the obligation, and included within the property, 
plant and equipment cost. These decommissioning costs are charged 
against profit or loss over the life of the mine, through depreciation of 
the property, plant and equipment balance (recorded within operating 
expenses). The unwinding of the discount on the provision is recorded 
within other finance items. Changes in the measurement of a 
decommissioning provision are added to, or deducted from, the property, 
plant and equipment balance in the current year. 

Restoration obligations, arising from ongoing operating activities, are 
provided for at their net present values and charged against operating 
expenses as the obligation arises. Changes in the measurement of a 
restoration provision which, relate to a change in the estimate of the 
closure costs or a change in the discount rate, are charged against 
operating expenses, and changes relating to foreign exchange are 
recorded within other finance items. 

Q) Share-based payments 
For cash-settled share-based payments, a liability is recognised for the 
goods or services acquired, measured initially at the fair value of the 
liability. At the end of each reporting period until the liability is settled, 
and at the date of settlement, the fair value of the liability is remeasured, 
with any changes in fair value recognised in profit or loss for the year. 
The Group currently does not have any equity settled share-based 
payments to employees or third parties. 

R) Post-employment benefits 
The Group operates defined contribution schemes for a limited number 
of employees. For such schemes, the amount charged to the income

Employment terms may also provide for payment of a severance indemnity 
when an employment contract comes to an end. This is typically at the rate 
of one month for each year of service (subject in most cases to a cap as to 
the number of qualifying years of service) and based on final salary level. 
The severance indemnity obligation is treated as an unfunded defined 
benefit plan, and the calculation is based on valuations performed by an 
independent actuary using the projected unit credit method, which are 
regularly updated.  

V) Other financial instruments 
Financial assets and financial liabilities are recognised on the Group’s 
balance sheet when the Group becomes a party to the contractual 
provisions of the instrument. Financial assets are derecognised when the 
contractual rights to the cash flows from the financial asset expire or the 
Group has transferred the asset to another party. Financial liabilities are 
removed from the Group’s balance sheet when they are extinguished -- 
i.e. when the obligation specified in the contract has been discharged, 
cancelled or expired. 

The obligation recognised in the balance sheet represents the present value 
of the severance indemnity obligation. Actuarial gains and losses are 
immediately recognised in other comprehensive income. 

(i) 

Investments -- Equity investments which are not subsidiaries, 
associates or joint ventures are recognised at fair value. The Group 
generally applies an irrevocable election for each equity investment 
to designate them as Fair Value through Other Comprehensive 
Income (FVOCI). Dividends from equity investments are recognised 
in the income statement when the right to receive payment is 
established. 

(ii)  Trade and other receivables -- As explained above, for sales 

contracts which contain provisional pricing mechanisms the total 
receivable balance is measured at fair value through profit or loss. 
Other receivable balances are recognised at amortised cost. 

(iii)  Trade and other payables -- Trade and other payables are generally 
not interest-bearing and are normally stated at their nominal value. 

(iv)  Other financial assets -- Other financial assets are measured at fair 

value through profit or loss. 

(v)  Borrowings (loans and preference shares) -- Interest-bearing loans 
and bank overdrafts are initially recorded at fair value which is 
typically equal to the proceeds received, net of direct issue costs. 
They are subsequently measured at amortised cost using the 
effective interest method, with interest expense recognised on an 
effective yield basis. The effective interest method is a method of 
calculating the amortised cost of a financial liability and of allocating 
interest expense over the relevant period. The effective interest rate 
is the rate that exactly discounts estimated future cash payments 
through the expected life of the financial liability, or, where 
appropriate, a shorter period. Finance charges, including premiums 
payable on settlement or redemption and direct issue costs, are 
accounted for on an accruals basis using the effective interest rate 
method. Amounts are either recorded as financing costs in profit or 
loss or capitalised in accordance with the accounting policy set out in 
Note 2(J). Finance charges are added to the carrying amount of the 
instrument to the extent that they are not settled in the period in 
which they arise.  

The total amount of interest paid, both in respect of interest 
recognised as an expense in profit or loss or capitalised in 
accordance with IAS 23 Borrowing Costs, is recognised within 
operating activities in the consolidated cash flow statement. 

The Sterling-denominated preference shares issued by the Company 
carry a fixed rate of return without the right to participate in any 
surplus. They are accordingly classified within borrowings and 
translated into US dollars at period-end rates of exchange. 
Preference share dividends are included within other finance items 
within net finance expense in the income statement. 

(vi)  Equity instruments -- Equity instruments issued are recorded at the 
proceeds received, net of direct issue costs. Equity instruments of 
the Company comprise its Sterling-denominated issued ordinary 
share capital and related share premium. As explained in Note 2(E), 
the presentational currency of the Group and the functional currency 
of the Company is US dollars, and ordinary share capital and share 
premium are translated into US dollars at historical rates of 
exchange based on dates of issue. 

(vii)  Impairment of financial assets -- The Group applies the forward-
looking expected credit loss model to its financial assets, other 
than those measured at fair value through profit or loss. The Group 
applies the IFRS 9 ‘‘simplified approach’’ to its trade receivables, 
measuring the loss allowance at the lifetime expected credit loss. 
For other financial assets, where the credit risk has not increased 
significantly since initial recognition, the loss allowance is measured 
at the 12 month expected credit loss. If there has been a significant 
increase in credit risk, the loss allowance is measured at the lifetime 
expected credit loss. Increases or decreases to the credit loss 
allowance are recognised immediately in profit or loss.  

S) Cash and cash equivalents 
Cash and cash equivalents comprise cash on hand, deposits held on call 
with banks, highly liquid investments that are readily convertible into known 
amounts of cash, are subject to insignificant risk of changes in value and 
are held for the purpose of meeting short-term cash commitments rather 
than for investment or other purposes. The cash balance is presented net of 
bank overdrafts which are repayable on demand. Cash and cash equivalents 
have a maturity period of 90 days or less. 

T) Liquid investments 
Liquid investments represent highly liquid current asset investments such 
as term deposits and managed funds invested in high quality fixed income 
instruments. They do not meet the IAS 7 definition of cash and cash 
equivalents, normally because even if readily accessible, the underlying 
investments have an average maturity profile greater than 90 days from the 
date first entered into, or because they are held primarily for investment 
purposes rather than meeting short-term cash commitments. These assets 
are designated as fair value through profit or loss, with the fair value 
movements recorded within investment income. 

U) Leases 
Leases are recognised as a right-of-use asset and a corresponding liability 
at the date at which the leased asset is available for use by the Group. 
Each lease payment is allocated between the liability and finance cost. 
The finance cost is charged to profit or loss over the lease period so as 
to produce a constant periodic rate of interest on the remaining balance of 
the liability for each period. The right-of-use asset is depreciated over the 
shorter of the asset's useful life and the lease term on a straight-line basis. 

Assets and liabilities arising from a lease are initially measured on a present 
value basis. Lease liabilities include the net present value of the following 
lease payments: 

o 

o 
o 

o 

o 

fixed payments (including in-substance fixed payments), less any lease 
incentives receivable 
variable lease payments that are based on an index or a rate 
amounts expected to be payable by the lessee under residual value 
guarantees 
the exercise price of a purchase option if the lessee is reasonably certain 
to exercise that option, and 
payments of penalties for terminating the lease, if the lease term reflects 
the lessee exercising that option. 

The lease payments are discounted using the interest rate implicit in the 
lease. If that rate cannot be readily determined, the lessee’s incremental 
borrowing rate is used, being the rate that the lessee would have to pay to 
borrow the funds necessary to obtain an asset of similar value in a similar 
economic environment with similar terms and conditions. 

Right-of-use assets are measured at cost comprising the following:  

o 
o 

o 
o 

the amount of the initial measurement of the lease liability  
any lease payments made at or before the commencement date less any 
lease incentives received  
any initial direct costs, and 
restoration costs.

Exceptional items are material items of income and expense which are  
non-regular or non-operating and typically non-cash, including impairments 
and profits or losses on disposals. The tax effect of items presented as 
exceptional is also classified as exceptional, as are material deferred tax 
adjustments that relate to more than one reporting period.

All amounts disclosed in the financial statements and notes have been 
rounded to the nearest million dollars unless otherwise stated. 

These policies have been consistently applied to all the years presented, 
unless otherwise stated.  

3  Critical accounting judgements and key sources of 

estimation uncertainty 

Determining many of the amounts included in the financial statements 
involves the use of judgement and/or estimation. These judgements and 
estimates are based on management’s best knowledge of the relevant facts 
and circumstances having regard to prior experience, but actual results may 
differ from the amounts included in the financial statements. Information 
about such judgements and estimates is included in the principal accounting 
policies in Note 2 or the other notes to the financial statements, and the key 
areas are set out below. 

A)  Judgements 
The following are the critical judgements, apart from those involving 
estimations (which are dealt with separately), that have been made in the 
process of applying the Group’s accounting policies and that have the most 
significant effect on the amounts recognised in the financial statements. 

(i)  Non-financial assets impairment 

As explained in Note 2(L), the Group reviews the carrying value of 
its intangible assets and property, plant and equipment, as well as 
the assets of its joint ventures, to determine whether there is any 
indication that those assets are impaired. In performing assessments 
for impairment triggers, assets that do not generate largely 
independent cash inflows are allocated to an appropriate cash 
generating unit (‘‘CGU’’). Details of the valuations and sensitivities 
of the Group’s, and its joint venture Zaldívar’s, mining operations 
considered as part of the impairment trigger assessment are included 
in Note 5, including quantitative sensitivity analyses. Details of the 
value of assets and liabilities for each of the mining operations are 
set out in Note 6.  

When an impairment trigger is identified, an impairment test is 
performed, wherein the recoverable amount of those assets, or the 
CGU, is measured at the higher of their fair value less costs of disposal 
and value in use.  

When an impairment test is performed, management necessarily 
applies its judgement and estimation in allocating assets to CGUs, in 
estimating the probability, timing and value of underlying cash flows 
and in selecting appropriate discount rates to be applied within the fair 
value less costs of disposal calculation. The key assumptions are set 
out in Note 5. Subsequent changes to CGU allocation, licensing status, 
reserves and resources, price assumptions or other estimates and 
assumptions in the fair value less costs of disposal calculation could 
impact the carrying value of the respective assets. 

As explained in Note 5, based on an assessment of both qualitative and 
quantitative factors, there were no indicators of potential impairment, 
or reversal of previous impairments, for the Group’s and its joint 
ventures’ non-current assets associated with its mining operations at 
the 2023 year-end, and accordingly no impairment tests have been 
performed. However, whether or not an impairment indicator exists is 
a critical judgement, in particular as at 31 December 2023 for Zaldívar 
(given the ongoing permitting process and the other factors set out in 
Note 5). 

B)  Estimates 
The Group makes estimates and assumptions concerning the future. 
The resulting accounting estimates will, by definition, seldom equal the 
related actual results. The estimates and assumptions that have a significant 
risk of causing a material adjustment to the carrying amounts of assets and 
liabilities within the next financial year are addressed below. 

(i)  Deferred tax liabilities in respect of undistributed earnings of 

subsidiaries 
No deferred tax liability is recognised in respect of the undistributed 
earnings of subsidiaries where it is not likely that those profits will be 
distributed in the foreseeable future. When determining whether it is 
likely that distributions will be made in the foreseeable future, and 
what is the appropriate foreseeable future period for this purpose, 
the Group considers factors such as the predictability of the likely 
future Group dividends, taking into account the Group’s dividend 
policy and the level of potential volatility of the Group’s future 
earnings and cash generation, as well as the current level of 
distributable reserves at the Antofagasta plc entity level. As set out in 
Note 29, at 31 December 2023 deferred withholding tax liabilities of 
$66.6 million have been recognised (31 December 2022 -- 
$71.6 million), which relate to undistributed earnings of subsidiaries 
where it is considered likely that the corresponding profits will be 
distributed in the foreseeable future. The value of the remaining 
undistributed earnings of subsidiaries, for which deferred tax 
liabilities have not been recognised, because the Group is in a 
position to control the timing of the distributions and it is likely 
that distributions will not be made in the foreseeable future, as 
at 31 December 2023 was $7,101.1 million (31 December 2022 -- 
$6,430.4 million). If deferred withholding tax liabilities were 
recognised in respect of all of these remaining undistributed earnings 
of subsidiaries, this would result in an additional deferred tax liability 
and expense of approximately $1,314.9 million (31 December 2022 -- 
$1,076.5 million), depending on the application of tax credits which 
may be available in particular circumstances. 

In addition to the above estimates and assumptions that have a significant 
risk of causing a material adjustment to the carrying amounts of assets 
and liabilities in the next 12 months, we have also set out the following 
additional estimates and assumptions which have a significant impact on 
the financial statements, but which are not considered to be key sources 
of estimation uncertainty as defined in IAS 1. 

(i) 

Inventory valuation 
The valuation of work in progress inventories involves a number of 
estimates, including the average ore grade, volume and density of 
ore stockpiles, and the recoveries in respect of material on the leach 
piles. Evaluating the net realisable value of the inventories also 
requires an estimate of the likely future copper price for the periods 
when it is expected that the inventories will be completed and sold. 
As set out in Note 20, the value of work in progress inventories 
at 31 December 2023 was $832.4 million (31 December 2022 -- 
$751.9 million). 

If the copper spot price at 31 December 2023 (used for forecasting 
the likely sales price of short-term inventories) had been 10% lower, 
this would have resulted in a net realisable value provision and 
charge to the Income Statement of approximately $45 million. 

The valuation of leachpile inventories can be particularly complex, 
given the required estimates including in respect of the total 
recoveries and the speed of recovery in relation to the material on 
the piles. This is particularly the case for leachpiles with a long 
leaching cycle, where material may remain on the pile for several 
years before it has been fully leached. The operation with the most 
significant long-term leachpile inventory is Zaldívar, with a long-term 
leachpile with a value of approximately $120 million (on a 50% 
attributable basis) at 31 December 2023 (2022 -- $130 million). This 
balance is forecast to be consumed over the operation's remaining 
13 year mine life (2022 -- 14 year) and its recoverability is based on 
the same assumptions about future operational considerations as 
detailed in Note 5. As a simple high-level sensitivity, if this balance 
were reduced by 10% (due to changes in recovery estimates for 
example), this would result in a reduction in Zaldívar’s inventory 
balance of approximately $12 million (on a 50% attributable basis) 
(2022 -- $13 million).

3  Critical accounting judgements and key sources of 

estimation uncertainty continued 

(ii)  Useful economic lives of property, plant and equipment and ore reserves 

estimates 
As explained in Note 2(K), mining properties, including capitalised 
financing costs, are depreciated in proportion to the volume of ore 
extracted in the year compared with total proven and probable 
reserves at the beginning of the year. 

There are numerous uncertainties inherent in estimating ore reserves, 
and assumptions that were valid at the time of estimation may change 
when new information becomes available. These include assumptions 
as to grade estimates and cut-off grades, recovery rates, commodity 
prices, exchange rates, production costs, capital costs, processing and 
reclamation costs and discount rates. The actual volume of ore 
extracted and any changes in these assumptions could affect 
prospective depreciation rates and carrying values. 

Other items of property, plant and equipment are depreciated over 
their useful economic lives, on a unit of production basis, in proportion 
to the volume of ore/material processed or hours of equipment usage, 
or on a straight-line basis. Management reviews the appropriateness 
of useful economic lives at least annually and, again, any changes 
could affect prospective depreciation rates and asset carrying values. 

The operation with the most significant depreciation expense is 
Centinela, with a depreciation expense of $727 million in 2023 
(2022 -- $710 million), representing approximately 61% of the total 
Group depreciation charge. As a simple high-level sensitivity, a 10% 
adjustment to the useful economic lives of Centinela’s property, plant 
and equipment would result in an impact of approximately $73 million 
(2022 -- $71 million) on the annual depreciation charge. 

(iii)  Provisions for decommissioning and site restoration costs 

As explained in Note 2(P), provision is made, based on net present 
values, for decommissioning and site rehabilitation costs as soon as 
the obligation arises following the development or ongoing production 
of a mining property. The provision is based on a closure plan 
prepared with the assistance of external consultants. 

Management uses its judgement and experience to provide for and 
(in the case of capitalised decommissioning costs) amortise these 
estimated costs over the life of the mine. The ultimate cost of 
decommissioning and site rehabilitation is uncertain and cost estimates 
can vary in response to many factors including changes to relevant 
legal requirements, the emergence of new restoration techniques or 
experience at other mine sites. 

The expected timing and extent of expenditure can also change, for 
example in response to changes in ore reserves or processing levels. 
As a result, there could be significant adjustments to the provisions 
established which would affect future financial results. 

Details of the decommissioning and restoration provisions are set 
out in Note 30. The total value of these provisions as at 31 December 
2023 was $441.1 million (2022 -- $488.2 million). As a simple  
high-level sensitivity, a 10% increase in the forecast closure costs 
would increase the provision balance by approximately $44 million 
(2022 -- $49 million), the decommissioning costs asset capitalised 
in the year within property, plant and equipment by approximately 
$3 million (2022 -- $17 million) and the ongoing annual operating 
expenses by approximately $1 million (2022 -- $2 million). 

(iv)  Deferred tax assets in respect of tax losses 

As explained in Note 2(N), deferred tax assets are recognised only 
to the extent that it is probable that they will be recovered through 
sufficient future taxable profits. When assessing the probable future 
taxable profits, the Group considers whether the relevant Group entity 
has sufficient taxable temporary differences which will result in taxable 
amounts against which the unused tax losses can be utilised. 

Generally under Chilean tax law, most tax losses can be carried 
forward indefinitely, and so the expiry of tax losses is not typically an 
issue. The key assumptions to which the forecasts of the probable 
level of future taxable profits are most sensitive are future commodity 
prices, production levels and operating costs.  

As set out in Note 29, the Group has recognised $72.0 million of net 
deferred tax assets as at 31 December 2023 (2022 -- $78.5 million), 
relating to tax losses, provisions and short-term timing differences. 
The deferred tax position includes $141.2 million (2022 -- $124.5 
million) of deferred tax assets in respect of tax losses available for 
offset against future profits. These losses may be carried forward 
indefinitely.

4  Exceptional items 
Exceptional items are material items of income and expense which are non-
regular or non-operating and typically non-cash, including impairments and 
profits or losses on disposals. The classification of these types of items as 
exceptional is considered to be useful as it provides an indication of the 
earnings generated by the ongoing businesses of the Group. 

Compañia de Minas Buenaventura S.A.A. 
As detailed in Notes 22 and 26, during 2023 the Group entered into an 
agreement to acquire up to an additional 30 million shares in Compañía de 
Minas Buenaventura S.A.A. An exceptional fair value gain of $167.1 million 
was recognised during 2023 in respect of this agreement. A deferred tax 
expense of $41.8 million has been recognised in respect of this gain 
(see Note 11), resulting in a post-tax impact of $125.3 million. 

2022 – Disposal of investment in Tethyan joint venture 
(Reko Diq project) 
On 15 December 2022, Antofagasta entered into definitive agreements to 
exit its interest in the Tethyan joint venture, which was a joint venture with 
Barrick Gold Corporation in respect of the Reko Diq project in Pakistan. 
As a result, Antofagasta recognised a gain on disposal of its investment in 
the joint venture as at 15 December 2022 of $944.7 million. The disposal 
proceeds were received by the Group in May 2023. Full details of the 
agreements and gain on disposal are set out in Note 17. 

5  Asset sensitivities 
There were no indicators of potential impairment, or reversal of previous 
impairments, for the Group’s non-current assets associated with its 
mining operations at the 2023 year-end, and accordingly no impairment 
tests have been performed. The impairment indicator assessment included 
consideration of the potential indicators set out in IAS 36, ‘Impairment of 
Assets’, which included quantitative analysis based on the operations’ life-
of-mine models as adjusted for certain assumptions (including potential 
future development opportunities) (‘‘the models’’). These models provide 
indicative valuations and do not represent, or comply with, a formal 
impairment assessment prepared in accordance with IAS 36. Sensitivity 
analyses have been performed on the models to quantify the impact of 
changes in assumptions to which the models are most sensitive and to 
support the overall impairment indicator assessment. 

As noted above, no qualitative indicators of potential impairment or 
potential reversal of impairment were identified. Similarly, no quantitative 
indicators of impairment were identified, with the models used within 
the impairment indicator assessment continuing to indicate positive 
headroom for all of the Group’s mining operations, including the Zaldívar 
joint venture, with the indicated value of the assets in excess of their 
carrying value. 

Relevant aspects of this process are detailed below: 

Copper price outlook 
The assumption to which the value of the assets is most sensitive is the 
future long-term copper price. The copper price forecasts (representing 
the Group’s estimates of the assumptions that would be used by 
independent market participants in valuing the assets) are based on 
consensus analyst forecasts. A long-term copper price of $3.70/lb 
(reflecting 2023 real terms) has been used in the models considered as 
part of the impairment indicator assessment, which has increased from 
$3.50/lb (reflecting 2022 real terms) at the prior year-end. As an 
additional down-side sensitivity an indicative valuation (based on the 
models) was performed with a long-term copper price of $3.33/lb, 
reflecting a 10% reduction in the long-term price forecast. Los Pelambres 
and Centinela still showed positive headroom in their models in this 
alternative down-side scenario. However, the Antucoya indicative 
valuation indicated a potential deficit of $60 million (2022 -- potential 
deficit of $400 million) and the Zaldívar valuation indicated a potential 
deficit of $60 million (on a 50% basis ) (2022 -- potential deficit of $170 
million). This was a simple sensitivity exercise, looking at an illustrative 
change in the forecast long-term copper price in isolation. In reality, a 
deterioration in the long-term copper price environment is likely to result 
in corresponding improvements in a range of input cost factors. In 
particular, given that copper exports account for over 50% of Chile’s 
exports, historically there has often been a correlation between 
movements in the copper price and the US dollar/Chilean peso exchange 
rate, and a decrease in the copper price may therefore result in a 
weakening of the Chilean peso, with a resulting reduction in the Group’s 
operating costs and capital expenditure in US$ terms. These likely cost 
reductions, as well as potential operational changes which could be made 
in a weaker copper price environment, could partly mitigate the impact of 
the lower copper price modelled in these estimated potential sensitivities.

6  Segment information 
The Group’s reportable segments, which are the same as its operating 
segments, are as follows:

For management purposes, the Group is organised into two business 
divisions based on their products -- Mining and Transport. The Mining 
division is split further for management reporting purposes to show 
results by mine and exploration activity.  

Los Pelambres produces primarily copper concentrate containing gold 
and silver as a by-product, and molybdenum concentrate. Centinela 
produces copper concentrate containing gold and silver as a by-product, 
molybdenum concentrates and copper cathodes. Antucoya and Zaldívar 
produce copper cathodes. The Transport division provides rail cargo and 
road cargo transport together with a number of ancillary services. All the 
operations are based in Chile. The Exploration and evaluation segment 
incurs exploration and evaluation expenses. ‘‘Corporate and other items’’ 
comprises costs incurred by the Antofagasta plc, Antofagasta Minerals 
SA, the Group’s mining corporate centre and other entities that are not 
allocated to any individual business segment. Consistent with its internal 
management reporting, the Group’s corporate and other items are 
included within the Mining division.  

The chief operating decision-maker (the Group’s Chief Executive Officer) 
monitors the operating results of the business segments separately for 
the purpose of making decisions about resources to be allocated and 
assessing performance. Segment performance is evaluated based on the 
operating profit of each of the segments. 

The US dollar/Chilean peso exchange rate 
The value of the assets is also sensitive to movements in the US 
dollar/Chilean peso exchange rate. A long-term exchange rate of Ch$785/$1 
has been used in the models considered as part of the impairment indicator 
assessment. This compares with the long-term exchange rate of Ch$850/$1 
used in 2022. As an additional down-side sensitivity an indicative valuation 
was prepared with a 10% stronger long-term Chilean peso exchange rate 
assumption. All of the Group’s mining operations still showed positive 
headroom in their models in this alternative down-side scenario. As noted 
above, historically there has often been a correlation between movements in 
the copper price and the US dollar/Chilean peso exchange rate, and so a 
strengthening of the Chilean peso may often reflect a stronger copper price 
environment, which could mitigate the impact of a stronger exchange rate. 

Discount rate 
A real post-tax discount rate of 8% (2022 -- 8%) calculated using relevant 
market data, has been used in the impairment indicator assessment. 

Climate related impacts 
The assessments reflect the Group’s estimates of potential future climate-
related impacts. The Group disclosures in line with the recommendations 
of the Task Force on Climate-related Financial Disclosures (‘‘TCFD’’). 
This process includes scenario analyses assessing the potential future 
impact of transition and physical risks, as well as potential copper price 
upside (for example, due to increased demand for the construction of 
electric vehicles and renewable power generating capacity). On the basis 
that the potential copper price upside is expected to exceed the downside 
impact of future risks, no specific adjustments have been reflected in these 
assessments in relation to climate-change. 

Other relevant assumptions 
In addition to the impact of the future copper price, the US dollar/Chilean 
peso exchange rate, the discount rate and climate-related impacts, the 
models used in the impairment indicator assessment are sensitive to the 
assumptions in respect of future production levels, operating costs, and 
sustaining and development capital expenditure.  

In the case of Zaldívar, in addition to the assumptions made in respect of 
the factors outlined above, the conclusion that there are no impairment 
indicators reflects certain assumptions about future operational 
considerations the model used as part of the impairment indicator 
assessment is sensitive, to certain assumptions in particular the following: 

o 

o 

o 

The operational performance experienced in 2023, in particular the lower 
than expected throughput levels, is not considered to be indicative of 
future performance levels, with throughput and recovery levels forecast 
to increase over future years. 
Currently, Zaldívar is permitted to extract water and mine until 2025, 
following the approval of the Declaration of Environmental Impact (‘‘DIA’’) 
in early 2024 to align both the permits for mining and water extraction. 
The mine life after 2025 is subject to an EIA application which was filed 
in June 2023 to extend mining and water environmental permits through 
2051 and Zaldívar simultaneously withdrew an earlier EIA application 
filed in 2018 which remained unresolved. This EIA includes a proposal 
to develop the primary sulphide ore deposit, extending the current life of 
mine and requiring investments over the mine life of $1.2 billion, and a 
conversion of the water source for Zaldívar to either seawater or water 
from third parties, following a transition period during which the current 
continental water extraction permit is extended from 2025 to 2028. 
The impairment indicator assessment assumes that the EIA will be 
granted, to enable the continued operation of the mine without 
interruption. However, if this is not the case, this is likely to be considered 
an indicator of a potential impairment, requiring an IAS 36 impairment 
assessment at that point. 
Zaldívar’s final pit phase, which represents approximately 20% of current 
ore reserves, impacts a portion of Minera Escondida’s mine property, as 
well as infrastructure owned by third parties. Mining of the phase will be 
subject to agreements or easements to access these areas and relocate 
the infrastructure, and related permits. In July 2023, Zaldívar reached an 
agreement with Escondida with respect to mining matters and certain 
cost sharing. The impairment indicator assessment assumes that the 
additional necessary agreements, easements and permits will be obtained 
to allow the mining of the final pit phase.  

The carrying value of the Group’s investment in joint venture balance in 
respect of Zaldívar as at 31 December 2023 was $881.3 million (2022 − 
$897.3 million).

and impairment charges to operating profit. This comprises 100% of the EBITDA from the Group´s subsidiaries, and the Group´s proportional share of the EBITDA of its 
associates and joint ventures (Refer to the Alternative Performance Measures section on page 239). 

2.  Operating cash outflow in the exploration and evaluation segment was $98.3 million. 

3.  An exceptional gain of $944.7 million has been recognised in respect of the Group’s disposal of its investment in the Tethyan joint venture (Reko Diq project) (see Notes 3, 4 

and 17). 

Notes to segment revenues and results 

(i) 

Inter-segment revenues are eliminated on consolidation. The only inter-segment revenue related to sales from the Transport division to the mining 
division of $10.3 million (year ended 31 December 2022 -- $9.8 million), has been eliminated and is therefore not reflected in the above figures.  

(ii)  Revenue includes provisionally priced sales of copper, gold and molybdenum concentrates and copper cathodes. Further details of such adjustments 

are given in Note 7. 

(iii)  For sales of concentrates, which are sold to smelters and roasting plants for further processing into fully refined metal, the price of the concentrate 

(which is the amount recorded as revenue) reflects the market value of the fully refined metal less a ‘‘treatment and refining charge’’ deduction, to 
reflect the lower value of this partially processed material compared with the fully refined metal. Treatment and refining charges for copper and 
molybdenum concentrates are detailed in Note 7. 

(iv)  The effects of tax and non-controlling interests on the expenses within the Exploration and evaluation segment are allocated to the mine that the 

exploration work relates to. 

(v)  The assets of the Transport division segment include $9.8 million (31 December 2022 -- $7.3 million) relating to the Group’s 30% interest in 

Antofagasta Terminal International SA (‘‘ATI’’), which operates a concession to manage installations in the port of Antofagasta. Further details of 
these investments are set out in Note 16.

7  Group revenue 
Copper and molybdenum concentrate sale contracts and copper cathode sale contracts generally provide for provisional pricing of sales at the time of 
shipment, with final pricing being based on the monthly average London Metal Exchange copper price or monthly average molybdenum price for specified 
future periods. This normally ranges from one to four months after shipment to the customer. For sales contracts which contain provisional pricing 
mechanisms, the total receivable balance is measured at fair value through profit or loss. Gains and losses from the mark-to-market of open sales are 
recognised through adjustments to revenue in the income statement and to trade receivables in the balance sheet. The Group determines mark-to-market 
prices using forward prices at each period-end for copper concentrate and cathode sales, and period-end month average prices for molybdenum 
concentrate sales due to the absence of a futures market in the market price references for that commodity in the majority of the Group’s contracts. 

With sales of concentrates, which are sold to smelters and roasting plants for further processing into fully refined metal, the price of the concentrate 
(which is the amount recorded as revenue) reflects the market value of the fully refined metal less a ‘‘treatment and refining charge’’ deduction, to reflect 
the lower value of this partially processed material compared with the fully refined metal. 

The Group sells a significant proportion of its products on Cost, Insurance & Freight (CIF) Incoterms, which means that the Group is responsible for 
shipping the product to a destination port specified by the customer. The shipping service represents a separate performance obligation, and is recognised 
separately from the sale of the material over time as the shipping service is provided. 

The total revenue from contracts with customers and the impact of provisional pricing adjustments in respect of concentrate and cathode sales is 
as follows:

1.  The Group sells a significant proportion of its products on Cost, Insurance & Freight (CIF) Incoterms, which means that the Group is responsible for shipping the product to a 
destination port specified by the customer. The shipping service represents a separate performance obligation, and is recognised separately from the sale of the material 
over time as the shipping service is provided. 

2.  The Transport division provides rail and road cargo transport together with a number of ancillary services. 
The categories of revenue which are principally affected by different economic factors are the individual product types. A summary of revenue by product 
is set out in Note 6. 

The following tables set out the impact of provisional pricing adjustments, and treatment and refining charges for the more significant products. 
The revenue from these products, along with the revenue from other products and services, is reconciled to total revenue in Note 6.

The revenue from the individual products shown in the above table excludes revenue from sales of silver and the Transport division, which are presented 
in the revenue by product table in Note 6 to reconcile to Group Revenue. 

With sales of concentrates at Los Pelambres and Centinela, which are sold to smelters and roasting plants for further processing into fully refined metal, 
the price of the concentrate invoiced to the customer reflects the market value of the fully refined metal less a ‘‘treatment and refining charge’’ deduction, 
to reflect the lower value of this partially processed material compared with the fully refined metal. For accounting purposes, the revenue amount is the 
net of the market value of fully refined metal less the treatment and refining charges. Under the standard industry definition of cash costs, treatment and 
refining charges are regarded as an expense and part of the total cash cost figure.

During 2023, amounts capitalised and consequently not included within the above table were as follows: $104.2 million at Los Pelambres (year ended 31 
December 2022 -- $47.0 million) and $7.9 million at Centinela (year ended 31 December 2022 -- $2.0 million). 

The interest expense shown above includes $10.5 million in respect of leases (2022 -- $7.1 million). The interest paid in respect of leases was $9.7 million 
(2022 -- $6.0 million). 

An exceptional fair value gain of $167.1 million has been recognised in respect of an agreement the Group entered into during 2023 to acquire up to an 
additional 30 million shares in Compañía de Minas Buenaventura S.A.A., as detailed in Notes 4 and 22.

In addition to first category tax and the mining tax, the Group incurs withholding taxes on any remittance of profits from Chile. Withholding tax is levied 
on remittances of profits from Chile at 35% less first category (i.e. corporate) tax already paid in respect of the profits to which the remittances relate. 
The withholding tax charge in the current period reflected a one-off adjustment of $34.7 million to the provision for deferred withholding tax, as a result 
of an intra-group restructuring of intercompany balances. 

The Group’s mining operations are also subject to a mining tax (royalty). During 2023, production from Los Pelambres, Antucoya, Encuentro (oxides), the 
Tesoro North East pit and the Run-of-Mine processing at Centinela Cathodes was subject to a rate of between 5--14%, depending on the level of operating 
profit margin, and production from Centinela Concentrates and the Tesoro Central and Mirador pits at Centinela Cathodes was subject to a rate of 5% of 
taxable operating profit.  

New mining royalty  
In August 2023, the new Chilean mining royalty law was approved. The new law has taken effect from 1 January 2024, replacing the existing specific 
mining tax. However, companies with tax stability agreements will continue to be governed by their current terms until those agreements expire. The new 
regime applied to Los Pelambres’ and Zaldívar’s royalty payments from the start of 2024. Centinela and Antucoya had tax stability agreements which 
extend beyond that point, and so the new royalty rates will only impact their royalty payments from 2030 onwards.  

The new royalty terms include a 1% ad valorem royalty on copper sales, as well as a royalty ranging from 8% to 26% applied to the ‘‘Mining Operating 
Margin’’, depending on each mining operation’s level of profitability. The new royalty terms have a cap, establishing that total taxation, which includes 
corporate income tax, the two components of the new mining royalty, and theoretical tax on dividends, should not exceed a rate of 46.5% on Mining 
Operating Margin less the royalty ad-valorem expense. 

The impact on the Group’s royalty payments starting in 2024 will be subject to various factors, including future revenue and earnings, which will be 
influenced by parameters such as copper prices, production volumes, and operating costs. A one-off adjustment has been recognised to the deferred 
tax balances of all of the Group’s mining operations as at 31 December 2023, resulting in an increase in the Group’s deferred tax liability balance of 
$34.3 million, along with a corresponding deferred tax expense. The Chilean tax authority has issued definitive interpretations regarding the methodologies 
for determining and calculating the new royalty amounts. The new administrative interpretation refers to all issues included in the new Royalty Law 
published in August 2023.

The effective tax rate (excluding exceptional items) of 34.7% varied from the statutory rate principally due to the mining tax (royalty) (net impact of 
$80.2 million/4.5% including the deduction of the mining tax (royalty) as an allowable expense in the determination of first category tax), the effect of the 
increase in future royalty tax on deferred tax balances (impact of $34.3 million/1.9%), items not deductible for Chilean corporate tax purposes, principally 
the funding of expenses outside of Chile (impact of $21.4 million/1.2%), the impact of the recognition of the Group’s share of (loss)/profit from associates 
and joint ventures, which are included in the Group’s profit before tax net of their respective tax charges (impact of $3.6 million/0.2%), the impact of 
unrecognised tax losses (impact of $2.3 million/0.1%) and the withholding tax relating to the remittance of profits from Chile (impact of $1.4 million/0.1%), 
partly offset by adjustments in respect of prior years (impact of $4.5 million/0.3%). 

The effective tax rate (including exceptional items) of 33.9% varied from the statutory rate due to the factors outlined above, and also the $3.3 million 
impact of the difference in the overseas tax rate which applied to the exceptional item. 

The main factors which could impact the sustainability of the Group’s existing effective tax rate are: 

• 

• 

The impact of the new Chilean mining royalty as described above.  

The level of future distributions made by the Group’s Chilean subsidiaries out of Chile, which could result in increased withholding tax charges. When 
determining whether it is likely that distributions will be made in the foreseeable future, and what is the appropriate foreseeable future period for this 
purpose, the Group considers factors such as the predictability of the likely future Group dividends, taking into account the Group’s dividend policy and 
the level of potential volatility of the Group’s future earnings, as well as the current level of distributable reserves at the Antofagasta plc entity level. As 
noted above, the withholding tax charge in the current period reflected a one-off adjustment of $34.7 million to the provision for deferred withholding 
tax, as a result of an intra-group restructuring of intercompany balances. 

• 

The impact of expenses which are not deductible for Chilean first category tax. Some of these expenses are fixed costs, and so the relative impact of 
these expenses on the Group’s effective tax rate will vary depending on the Group’s total profit before tax in a particular year.  

OECD Pillar two model rules 
The Group falls within the scope of the OECD Pillar two model rules, which will introduce a minimum effective tax rate of 15% for multinational companies. 
The rules were substantively enacted in the UK in 2023 and will be effective from 1 January 2024. Currently, the Antofagasta Group operates in Chile and 
is subject to the Chilean first category (corporate) tax rate of 27%, plus withholding taxes on any profits distributed from Chile. The Group is evaluating the 
potential future impact of these rules on its tax expense. However, based on the Group's current position, it does not anticipate any effect on its 2024 tax 
expense. This has included analysis of the Group’s detailed financial information in respect of 2021. There have not been changes to the Group’s position 
or results subsequent to that date which would significantly impact that analysis. The Group has applied the amendment to IAS 12, which requires that 
companies do not recognise deferred tax balances in relation to the Pillar two model rules.  

Minera Centinela tax claims and queries 
In the context of an administrative review, the Chilean Internal Revenue Service (IRS) has raised claims and queries with Minera Centinela in respect of 
approximately $85 million of tax deductions recognised in relation to the amortisation of start-up costs relating to the Encuentro pit. The Group considers 
the tax treatment adopted by Minera Centinela to be correct and appropriate, has robust arguments to support its position, and expects its position to be 
upheld by the review processes. If the Group is unsuccessful in supporting its position, this amount (plus potential interest and penalties) would fall due. 
There are no other significant tax uncertainties which would require critical judgements, estimates or potential provisions other than deferred tax 
judgements and estimates as explained in Note 3B.

Basic earnings per share are calculated as profit after tax and non-controlling interests, based on 985,856,695 (2022: 985,856,695) ordinary shares. 

There was no potential dilution of earnings per share in either year set out above, and therefore diluted earnings per share did not differ from basic 
earnings per share as disclosed above.

The intangible asset relates to Twin Metals’ mining licences assets (included within the corporate segment). A full impairment provision was recognised in 
respect of the $150.1 million cost of this asset as at 31 December 2021, as a result of the US federal government’s cancellation of certain of Twin Metals’ 
mining leases. Twin Metals believes it has a valid legal right to the mining leases and a strong case to defend its legal rights. Although the Group is 
pursuing validation of those rights, considering the time and uncertainty related to any legal action to challenge the government decisions, a full 
impairment provision continues to be recognised in respect of the carrying value of the asset.

$978.3 million (2022 -- $845.1 million) of which $579.4 million was related to Los Pelambres and $389.5 million to Centinela. 

The average interest rate for the interest capitalised was 6.0% (2022 -- 2.8%). 

At 31 December 2023, the net book value of assets capitalised relating to the decommissioning provision was $158.6 million (2022 -- $212.1 million). 

Depreciation capitalised in property, plant and equipment of $90.3 million related to the depreciation of assets used in mine development (operating

17  Disposal of investment in Tethyan joint venture (Reko Diq project) 
On 15 December 2022, Antofagasta entered into definitive agreements to exit its 50% interest in the Tethyan joint venture, which was a joint venture with 
Barrick Gold Corporation (‘‘Barrick’’) in respect of the Reko Diq project in Pakistan. Antofagasta recognised a gain on disposal of its investment in the joint 
venture as at 15 December 2022 of $944.7 million. The joint venture project was held via the Australian entity Atacama Copper Pty Limited (‘‘Atacama’’). 
The disposal proceeds, which together with accrued interest up to 15 December 2022 totalled US$946.0 million, were held by Atacama in a segregated 
interest-bearing account. Antofagasta and Barrick agreed that the proceeds of this account, including all further interest received, less any Australian tax 
arising and working capital and other adjustments, would be distributed to the Antofagasta Group during 2023, on a date to be determined by Antofagasta. 
Atacama was seeking a binding private ruling from the Australian Tax Office to confirm that the disposal proceeds and their distribution to the Antofagasta 
Group would not be subject to Australian tax. In May 2023, Atacama received the binding private ruling confirming these points. Antofagasta then 
requested that the disposal proceeds including interest be distributed to the Antofagasta Group, resulting in a total distribution of $956.3 million by 
Atacama to the Antofagasta Group in May 2023.

The investments, which are included in the $891.1 million balances at 31 December 2023, are set out below: 

Investment in associates 

(i)  The Group’s 30% interest in Antofagasta Terminal Internacional (‘‘ATI’’), which operates a concession to manage installations in the port of 

Antofagasta. 

Investment in joint ventures 
• 
• 

The Group’s 50% interest in Minera Zaldívar SpA (‘‘Zaldívar’’).  
The Group had a 50% interest in Tethyan Copper Company Limited (‘‘Tethyan’’), which was a joint venture with Barrick Gold Corporation in respect of 
the Reko Diq project in the Islamic Republic of Pakistan (‘‘Pakistan’’). As explained in Note 17, on 15 December 2022 Antofagasta entered into definitive 
agreements to exit its interest in the Tethyan joint venture and it is therefore no longer recognised as a joint venture by the Group. 

As the net carrying value of the interest in Tethyan was negative, it was included within non-current liabilities, as the Group was liable for its share of the 
joint venture’s obligations.

1.  A deferred tax expense of $37.0 million has been recognised in respect of the movements in the fair value of equity investments (pre-tax gain of $137.0 million), resulting in a 

post-tax gain of $100.0 million (see Note 29). 

Equity investments represent those investments which are not subsidiaries, associates or joint ventures and are not held for trading purposes. The fair 
value of all equity investments are based on quoted market prices. 

Of the total equity investment balance at 31 December 2023, $275.2 million relates to a holding of approximately 18.1 million shares in Compañía de Minas 
Buenaventura S.A.A. (‘‘Buenaventura’’), representing approximately 7% of Buenaventura’s issued share capital. As detailed in Notes 4 and 22, during 
2023 the Group entered into an agreement to acquire an additional holding of up to 30 million shares in Buenaventura, representing approximately 12% of 
Buenaventura’s issued share capital.

1.  At 31 December 2022, the Other receivables balance included the proceeds receivable in respect of the Group’s disposal of its investment in the Tethyan joint venture 

(Note 17). 

The largest balances of trade receivables are with equity participants in the key mining projects. Many other significant trade receivables are secured by 
letters of credit or other forms of security. There is no material element which is interest-bearing. Trade receivables include mark-to-market adjustments 
in respect of provisionally priced sales of copper and molybdenum concentrates which remain open as to final pricing. Further details of such adjustments 
are given in Note 7. Other receivables include mainly due to IVA (Chilean Value Added Tax) receivables of $106.8 million (31 December 2022 -- $124.6 
million) and employee loans of $53.0 million (31 December 2022 -- $49.3 million).

The carrying value of the trade receivables recorded in the financial statements represents the Group’s maximum exposure to credit risk in relation to 
these items. Other than the expected credit loss provision amount set out above, the expected credit loss risk for other trade and other receivable 
balances is considered to be immaterial to the Group. 

22  Other financial asset 
Compañía de Minas Buenaventura S.A.A. 
During 2023, the Group entered into an agreement to acquire up to an additional 30 million shares in Compañía de Minas Buenaventura S.A.A. 
(‘‘Buenaventura’’), representing approximately 12% of Buenaventura’s issued share capital. Subsequent to the year-end, in March 2024, the agreement 
completed. Buenaventura is Peru’s largest, publicly traded precious and base metals company and a major holder of mining rights in Peru. A payment of 
$290.1 million was made in respect of this agreement in June 2023. As at 31 December 2023, an ‘‘other financial asset’’ balance has been recognised on 
the balance sheet in respect of the agreement, at its fair value of $457.2 million. A fair value gain of $167.1 million has been recognised during 2023 in 
respect of this asset. As detailed in Notes 4 and 19, as at 31 December 2023 the Group held an existing holding of approximately 18.1 million shares in 
Buenaventura, representing approximately 7% of Buenaventura’s issued share capital.  

23  Cash and cash equivalents, and liquid investments 
The fair value of cash and cash equivalents, and liquid investments is not materially different from the carrying values presented. The credit risk on cash 
and cash equivalents is considered to be limited because the counterparties are banks with high credit ratings assigned by international credit rating 
agencies. 

Cash and cash equivalents, and liquid investments comprised:

Recurring fair value measurements are those that are required in the balance sheet at the end of each reporting year. 

a) 

Equity investments are investments in shares on active markets and are valued using unadjusted quoted market values of the shares at the financial 
reporting date. These are level 1 inputs as described below. 

c) 

b)  Provisionally priced metal sales for the period are marked-to-market at the end of the period. Gains and losses from the marking-to-market of open 
sales are recognised through adjustments to revenue in the income statement and trade receivables in the balance sheet. Forward prices at the end 
of the period are used for copper sales while December average prices are used for molybdenum concentrate sales. These are level 2 inputs as 
described below. 
The other financial asset relates to an agreement the Group entered into during 2023 to acquire up to an additional 30 million shares in Compañía 
de Minas Buenaventura S.A.A. (‘‘Buenaventura’’) (as detailed in Note 22). Subsequent to the year-end, in March 2024, the agreement completed. 
A payment of $290.1 million was made in respect of this agreement in June 2023. As at 31 December 2023, an ‘‘other financial asset’’ balance has 
been recognised on the balance sheet in respect of the agreement, at its fair value of $457.2 million. A fair value gain of $167.1 million has been 
recognised during 2023 in respect of this asset. The fair value of the other financial asset has been calculated using observable market data, in 
particular the share price of Buenaventura as at 29 December 2023 (the last trading day in 2023). These are level 2 inputs. The valuation also 
assumed that the Group will acquire all 30 million shares and the agreement runs to its scheduled maturity, although this was not considered to be a 
significant factor in determining the fair value based on the assessed likelihood and impact of an early termination occurring.  
The element of cash and cash equivalents measured at fair value relates to money market funds, which are valued reflecting market prices at the 
period end. These are level 1 inputs as described below. 
Liquid investments are highly liquid current asset investments that are valued reflecting market prices at the period end. These are level 2 inputs as 
described below.  

d) 

e) 

The inputs to the valuation techniques described above are categorised into three levels, giving the highest priority to unadjusted quoted prices in active 
markets (level 1) and the lowest priority to unobservable inputs (level 3 inputs): 

o 
o 

Level 1 fair value measurement inputs are unadjusted quoted prices in active markets for identical assets or liabilities. 
Level 2 fair value measurement inputs are derived from inputs other than quoted market prices included in level 1 that are observable for the asset or 
liability, either directly or indirectly. 
Level 3 fair value measurement inputs are unobservable inputs for the asset or liability.  

o 
The degree to which inputs into the valuation techniques used to measure the financial assets and liabilities are observable and the significance of these 
inputs in the valuation are considered in determining whether any transfers between levels have occurred. In the year ended 31 December 2023, there 
were no transfers between levels in the hierarchy. 

C)  Financial risk management 
The Group’s activities expose it to a variety of financial risks: market risk (including commodity price risk, currency risk, interest rate risk and other price 
risk), credit risk and liquidity risk. The Group periodically uses derivative financial instruments, to reduce its exposure to commodity price, foreign 
exchange and interest rate movements. The Group does not use such derivative instruments for speculative trading purposes. 

The Board of Directors is responsible for overseeing the Group’s risk management framework. The Audit and Risk Committee assists the Board with its 
review of the effectiveness of the risk management process, and monitoring of key risks and mitigations. The Internal Audit department undertakes both 
regular and ad hoc reviews of risk management controls and procedures, the results of which are reported to the Audit and Risk Committee. 

(I)  Commodity price risk 
The Group generally sells its copper and molybdenum concentrate and copper cathode output at prevailing market prices, subject to final pricing 
adjustments which normally range from one to four months after delivery to the customer, and it is therefore exposed to changes in market prices 
for copper and molybdenum both in respect of future sales and previous sales, which remain open as to final pricing. In 2023, sales of copper and 
molybdenum concentrate and copper cathodes represented 89.4% of Group revenue and therefore revenues and earnings depend significantly on LME 
and realised copper prices. 

The Group periodically uses futures and min-max options to manage its exposure to copper prices. These instruments may give rise to accounting 
volatility due to fluctuations in their fair value prior to the maturity of the instruments. Details of those copper and molybdenum concentrate sales and 
copper cathode sales, which remain open as to final pricing, are given in Note 7.

FINANCIAL STATEMENTS 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
Commodity price sensitivity 
The sensitivity analysis below shows the impact of a movement in the copper price on the financial instruments held as at the reporting date. A movement 
in the copper market price as at the reporting date will affect the final pricing adjustment to sales that remain open at that date, impacting the trade 
receivables balance and consequently the income statement. A movement in the copper market price will also affect the valuation of commodity 
derivatives, impacting the hedging reserve in equity if the fair value movement relates to an effective designated cash flow hedge, and impacting the 
income statement if it does not. The calculation assumes that all other variables, such as currency rates, remain constant. 

o 

o 

If the copper market price as at the reporting date had increased by 10 c/lb, profit attributable to the owners of the parent would have increased by 
$19.0 million (2022 -- increase by $19.8 million). 
If the copper market price as at the reporting date had decreased by 10 c/lb, profit attributable to the owners of the parent would have decreased by 
$19.0 million (2022 -- decrease by $19.8 million).  

In addition, a movement in the average copper price during the year would impact revenue and earnings. A 10 c/lb change in the average copper price 
during the year would have affected profit attributable to the owners of the parent by $60.6 million (2022 -- $58.7 million) and earnings per share by 
6.1 cents (2022 -- 6.0 cents), based on production volumes in 2023, without taking into account the effects of provisional pricing. A $1 /lb change in the 
average molybdenum price for the year would have affected profit attributable to the owners of the parent by $10.2 million (2022 -- $9.5 million), and 
earnings per share by 1.0 cents (2022 -- 1.0 cents), based on production volumes in 2023, and without taking into account the effects of provisional 
pricing. A $100 /oz change in the average gold price for the year would have affected profit attributable to the owners of the parent by $9.6 million (2022 
-- $11.6 million), and earnings per share by 1.0 cents (2022 -- 1.2 cents), based on production volumes in 2023, and without taking into account the effects 
of provisional pricing. 

(II)  Currency risk 
The Group is exposed to a variety of currencies. The US dollar, however, is the currency in which the majority of the Group’s sales are denominated. 
Operating costs are influenced by the countries in which the Group’s operations are based (principally in Chile) as well as those currencies in which the 
costs of imported goods and services are determined. After the US dollar, the Chilean peso is the most important currency influencing costs and to a 
lesser extent sales. 

Given the significance of the US dollar to the Group’s operations, this is the presentational currency of the Group for internal and external reporting. 
The US dollar is also the currency for borrowing and holding surplus cash, although a portion of this may be held in other currencies, notably Chilean 
pesos and Sterling, to meet short-term operating and capital commitments and dividend payments. 

When considered appropriate, the Group uses forward exchange contracts and currency swaps to limit the effects of movements in exchange rates in 
foreign currency denominated assets and liabilities. The Group may also use these instruments to reduce currency exposure on future transactions and 
cash flows. Details of any exchange rate derivatives entered by the Group in the year are given in Note 26(D). 

The currency exposure of the Group’s cash, cash equivalents and liquid investments is given in Note 23, and the currency exposure of the Group’s 
borrowings is given in Note 24(C). The effects of exchange gains and losses included in the income statement are given in Note 10. Exchange differences 
on translation of the net assets of entities with a functional currency other than the US dollar are taken to the currency translation reserve and are 
disclosed in the Consolidated Statement of Changes in Equity on page 191. 

Currency sensitivity 
The sensitivity analysis below shows the impact of a movement in the US dollar/Chilean peso exchange rate on the financial instruments held as at the 
reporting date. 

The impact on profit or loss is as a result of the retranslation of non-US dollar monetary financial instruments (including cash, cash equivalents, liquid 
investments, trade receivables, trade payables and borrowings). The impact on equity is as a result of changes in the fair value of derivative instruments 
which are effective designated cash flow hedges, and changes in the fair value of equity investments. The calculation assumes that all other variables, 
such as interest rates, remain constant. 

If the US dollar had strengthened by 10% against the Chilean peso as at the reporting date, profit attributable to the owners of the parent would have 
increased by $34.7 million (2022 -- increase of $19.1 million). If the US dollar had weakened by 10% against the Chilean peso as at the reporting date, 
profit attributable to the owners of the parent would have decreased by $42.5 million (2022 -- decrease of $23.3 million). 

(III)  Interest rate risk 
The Group’s policy is generally to borrow and invest cash at floating rates. Fluctuations in interest rates may impact the Group’s net finance income or 
cost, and to a lesser extent the value of financial assets and liabilities. The Group occasionally uses interest rate swaps and collars to manage interest rate 
exposures on a portion of its existing borrowings. Details of any interest rate derivatives entered into by the Group are given in Note 24(D). 

The interest rate exposure of the Group’s borrowings is given in Note 24. 

Interest rate sensitivity 
The sensitivity analysis below shows the impact of a movement in interest rates in relation to the financial instruments held as at the reporting date. 
The impact on profit or loss reflects the impact on annual interest expense in respect of the floating rate borrowings held as at the reporting date, and the 
impact on annual interest income in respect of cash and cash equivalents held as at the reporting date. The impact on equity is as a result of changes in 
the fair value of derivative instruments which are effective designated cash flow hedges. The calculation assumes that all other variables, such as 
currency rates, remain constant. 

If the interest rate increased by 1%, based on the financial instruments held as at the reporting date, profit attributable to the owners of the parent would 
have decreased by $3.3 million (2022 -- decrease of $3.3 million). This does not include the effect on the income statement of changes in the fair value of 
the Group’s liquid investments relating to the underlying investments in fixed income instruments. 

(IV)  Other price risk 
The Group is exposed to equity price risk on its equity investments. 

Equity price sensitivity 
The sensitivity analysis below shows the impact of a movement in the equity values of the equity investment financial assets held as at the reporting date. 

If the value of the equity investments had increased by 10% as at the reporting date, equity would have increased by $28.9 million (2022 -- increase of 
$9.1 million). There would have been no impact on the income statement.

Financial statements continued 

26  Financial instruments and financial risk management continued 
(V)  Cash flow risk 
The Group’s future cash flows depend on a number of factors, including commodity prices, production and sales levels, operating costs, capital 
expenditure levels, and financial income and costs. Its cash flows are therefore subject to the exchange, interest rate and commodity price risks described 
above as well as operating factors and input costs. To reduce the risk of potential short-term disruptions to the supply of key inputs such as electricity and 
sulphuric acid, the Group enters into medium and long-term supply contracts to help ensure continuity of supply. Long-term electricity supply contracts 
are in place at each of the Group’s mines, in most cases linking the cost of electricity under the contract to the current cost of electricity on the Chilean 
grid or the generation cost of the supplier. The Group seeks to lock in supply of sulphuric acid for future periods of a year or longer, with contract prices 
agreed in the latter part of the year, to be applied to purchases of acid in the following year. Further information on production and sales levels and 
operating costs are given in the Operating review on pages 90 to 107. 

(VI)  Credit risk 
Credit risk arises from trade and other receivables, cash, cash equivalents, liquid investments and derivative financial instruments. The Group’s credit risk 
is primarily to trade receivables. The credit risk on cash, cash equivalents and liquid investments and on derivative financial instruments is limited as the 
counterparties are financial institutions with high credit ratings assigned by international credit agencies. 

The largest balances of trade receivables are with equity participants in the key mining projects. Many other significant trade receivables are secured by 
letters of credit or other forms of security. All customers are subject to credit review procedures, including the use of external credit ratings where 
available. Credit is provided only within set limits, which are regularly reviewed. The main customers are recurrent with a good credit history during the 
years they have been customers. 

Outstanding receivable balances are monitored on an ongoing basis. 

The carrying value of financial assets recorded in the financial statements represents the maximum exposure to credit risk. The amounts presented in the 
balance sheet are net of allowances for any doubtful receivables (Note 21). 

The Group has recognised an expected credit loss provision for its employee receivables, with the main inputs into the provision calculation being the 
average level of staff turnover and the average level of recovery of receivables from former employees. For the reasons set out above, the expected credit 
loss risk for other trade and other receivable balances is considered to be immaterial to the Group. 

(VII) Liquidity risk 
The Group manages liquidity risk by maintaining adequate cash reserves and financing facilities, through the review of forecast and actual cash flows. 

The Group typically holds surplus cash in demand or term deposits or highly liquid investments, which typically can be accessed or liquidated within 
24 hours. 

At the end of 2023, the Group was in a net debt position (2022 -- net debt position), as disclosed in Note 33(C). Details of cash, cash equivalents and liquid 
investments are given in Note 23, while details of borrowings including the maturity profile are given in Note 24(E). Details of undrawn committed 
borrowing facilities are also given in Note 24. 

The following table analyses the maturity of the Group’s contractual commitments in respect of its financial liabilities and derivative financial instruments.  
The table has been drawn up based on the undiscounted cash flows on the earliest date on which the Group can be required to pay. The table includes 
both interest and principal cash flows.

*  The preference shares pay an annual dividend of £100,000 in perpetuity, and accordingly it is not possible to determine total amounts payable for periods without a fixed end 

date.  

(VIII) Capital risk management 
The Group’s objectives are to return capital to shareholders while leaving the Group with sufficient funds to progress its short, medium and long-term 
growth plans as well as preserving the financial flexibility to take advantage of opportunities as they may arise. This policy remains unchanged.  

The Group monitors capital on the basis of net cash/debt (defined as cash, cash equivalents and liquid investments less borrowings) which was net debt 
of $1,159.8 million at 31 December 2023 (2022 -- net debt $885.8 million), as well as gross cash (defined as cash, cash equivalents and liquid investments) 
which was $2,919.4 million at 31 December 2023 (2022 -- $2,391.2 million). The Group’s total cash is held in a combination of on demand and term 
deposits and managed funds investing in high quality, fixed income instruments. The managed funds are held primarily for investment purposes rather 
than meeting short-term cash commitments and accordingly these amounts are presented as liquid investments; however they are included in net cash 
for monitoring and decision-making purposes. The Group has a risk averse investment strategy. The Group’s borrowings are detailed in Note 24. 
Additional project finance or shareholder loans are taken out by the operating subsidiaries to fund projects on a case-by-case basis.

FINANCIAL STATEMENTS 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
Under the terms of the major borrowing facilities, the Group is required to comply with the following financial covenants: 

1)  Net Financial Debt/EBITDA 
2)  EBITDA/Interest Expense 
3)  Total Indebtedness/Tangible Net Worth (being the net asset value less any intangible asset value) 
The Group has complied with these covenants throughout the reporting period.  

D)  Derivative financial instruments 
The Group periodically uses derivative financial instruments, to reduce its exposure to commodity price, foreign exchange and interest rate movements. 
The Group does not use such derivative instruments for speculative trading purposes.  

The Group did not have any derivative financial instruments during 2023 or 2022. 

When relevant, the Group applies the hedge accounting provisions of IFRS 9 ‘‘Financial Instruments’’. Changes in the fair value of derivative financial 
instruments that are designated and effective as hedges of future cash flows are recognised directly in other comprehensive income or expense, with 
such amounts subsequently recognised in the income statement in the period when the hedged item affects profit or loss. Any ineffective portion is 
recognised immediately in the income statement. Realised gains and losses on commodity derivatives recognised in the income statement are recorded 
within revenue. The time value element of changes in the fair value of derivative options is recognised within other comprehensive income. Realised gains 
and losses and changes in the fair value of exchange and interest derivatives are recognised within other finance items for those derivatives where hedge 
accounting has not been applied. When hedge accounting has been applied, the realised gains and losses on exchange and interest derivatives are 
recognised within other finance items and interest expense respectively. 

27  Long-term incentive plan 
The long-term incentive plan (the ‘‘Plan’’) forms part of the remuneration of senior managers in the Group. Directors are not eligible to participate in 
the Plan. 

Details of the Awards 
Under the Plan, the Group may grant awards based on the price of ordinary shares in the Company and cannot grant awards over actual shares. 

o 

o 

Restricted Awards: These awards are conditional rights to receive cash payment by reference to a specified number of the Company’s ordinary shares, 
subject to the relevant employee remaining employed by the Group when the Restricted Award vests, and 
Performance Awards: These awards are conditional rights to receive cash payment by reference to a specified number of the Company’s ordinary 
shares subject to both the satisfaction of a performance condition and the relevant employee remaining employed by the Group when the Performance 
Award vests. 

When awards vest under the Plan, participants become entitled to receive a cash payment by reference to the number and portion of awards that have 
vested and the market value of the Company’s ordinary shares on the date of vesting. There is no exercise price payable by participants in respect of 
the awards. 

Restricted Awards can only vest in full if participants remain employed by the Group for three years from the date that Restricted Awards are granted. 
In ordinary circumstances, the first one-third of a Restricted Award will vest after one year, the second one-third will vest after two years and the 
remaining one-third will vest after three years. There are no performance criteria attached to Restricted Awards. The fair value of Restricted Awards 
granted under the Plan is recorded as a compensation expense over the vesting periods, with a corresponding liability recognised for the fair value of the 
liability at the end of each period until settled. 

Performance Awards only vest if certain performance criteria are met. The performance criteria reflect a number of factors including total shareholder 
return, earnings levels, growth in the Group’s reserves and resources and project delivery targets. The fair value of Performance Awards under the Plan 
is recorded as a compensation expense over the vesting period, with a corresponding liability at the end of each period until settled. 

Valuation process and accounting for the awards 
The fair value of the awards is determined using a Monte Carlo simulation model. The inputs into the Monte Carlo simulation model are as follows: 

Weighted average forecast share price at vesting date 
Expected volatility 
Expected life of awards 
Expected dividend yields 
Discount rate 

2023 
$21.6
37.21%

2.93%
5.32%

2022 
$18.5
50.90%
3 years
6.77%
4.33%

Expected volatility was determined by calculating the historical volatility of the Group’s share price over the previous one year. The expected life of awards 
used in the model has been adjusted based on management’s best estimate for the effects of non-transferability and compliance of the objectives 
determined according to the characteristics of each plan.

The Group has recorded a liability of $13.9 million at 31 December 2023, of which $7.5 million is due after more than one year (31 December 2022 -- 
$17.2 million of which $4.7 million was due after more than one year) and total expenses of $12.6 million for the year (2022 -- expense of $13.1 million).  

28  Post-employment benefit obligations 
A)  Defined contribution schemes 
The Group operates defined contribution schemes for a limited number of employees. The amount charged to the income statement in 2023 was 
$0.1 million (2022 -- $0.1 million), representing the amount paid in the year. There were no outstanding amounts which remain payable at the end of 
either year. 

B)  Severance provisions 
Employment terms at some of the Group’s operations provide for payment of a severance payment when an employment contract comes to an end. 
This is typically at the rate of one month for each year of service (subject in most cases to a cap as to the number of qualifying years of service) 
and based on the final salary level. The severance payment obligation is treated as an unfunded defined benefit plan, and the obligation recognised 
is based on valuations performed by an independent actuary using the projected unit credit method, which are regularly updated. The obligation 
recognised in the balance sheet represents the present value of the severance payment obligation. Actuarial gains and losses are immediately 
recognised in other comprehensive income. 

The most recent valuation was carried out in 2023 by Ernst & Young, a qualified actuary in Santiago, Chile who is not connected with the Group. 

The main assumptions used to determine the actuarial present value of benefit obligations were as follows: 

Average nominal discount rate 
Average rate of increase in salaries 
Average staff turnover 

Amounts included in the income statement in respect of severance provisions are as follows: 

Current service cost (charge to operating profit) 
Interest cost (charge to other finance items)
Foreign exchange credit to other finance items 
Total charge to income statement 

Movements in the present value of severance provisions were as follows: 

Balance at the beginning of the year 
Current service cost 
Actuarial gains/(losses) 
Unwinding of discount on provisions 
Paid in the year 
Foreign currency exchange difference 
Balance at the end of the year

The discount rate is the interest rate used to discount the estimated future severance payments to their present value. The table above shows the principal 
instruments and assumptions utilised in determining the discount rate.  

Rate of increase in salaries 
This represents the estimated average rates of future salary increases, reflecting likely future promotions and other changes. This has been based on 
historical information for the Group for the period from 2019 to 2023. 

Turnover rate 
This represents the estimated average level of future employee turnover. This has been based on historical information for the Group for the period from 
2019 to 2023.  

Sensitivity analysis 
Significant actuarial assumptions for the determination of the defined obligation are discount rate, expected salary increase and staff turnover. The 
sensitivity analysis below has been determined based on reasonably possible changes of the respective assumptions occurring at the end of the reporting 
period, while holding all other assumptions constant. 

o 

o 

o 

If the discount rate is 100 basis points higher, the defined benefit obligation would decrease by $6.5 million (2022 -- decrease by $10.2 million). If the 
discount rate is 100 basis points lower, the defined benefit obligation would increase by $7.1 million (2022 -- increase by $11.7 million). 
If the expected salary growth increases by 1%, the defined benefit obligation would increase by $7.0 million (2022 -- increase by $10.5 million). If the 
expected salary growth decreases by 1%, the defined benefit obligation would decrease by $6.5 million (2022 -- decrease by $9.6 million).  
If the staff turnover increases by 1%, the defined benefit obligation would decrease by $2.9 million (2022 -- decrease by $2.5 million). If the staff 
turnover decreases by 1%, the defined benefit obligation would increase by $3.1 million (2022 -- increase by $2.5 million).

1.  The $40.8 million of deferred tax recognised directly in equity relates to a $37.0m deferred tax expense in respect of the movements in the fair value of equity investments 

(see Note 19) and a $3.8 million deferred tax expense in respect of actuarial gains on defined benefit plans. 

2.  A deferred tax expense of $41.8 million has been recognised in respect of the exceptional fair value gain of $167.1 million in respect of the agreement the Group entered into 

during 2023 to acquire up to an additional 30 million shares in Compañía de Minas Buenaventura S.A.A. (see Note 4). 

The charge to the income statement of $2.9 million (2022 -- $154.8 million) included an impact from foreign exchange differences of $0.3 million (2022: 
nil). 

Certain deferred tax assets and liabilities have been offset. Deferred tax assets and liabilities are offset where there is a legally enforceable right to do so, 
which under Chilean tax regulations is only possible within individual legal entities. 

The following is the analysis of the deferred tax balance (after offset):

The $72.0 million net deferred tax asset balance (2022 − $78.5 million) relates to the total deferred tax position of those individual Group entities which 
have a net deferred tax asset position. In general, these net deferred tax asset positions reflect tax losses, which in some cases are partly offset by 
deferred tax liabilities in respect of accelerated capital allowances and other temporary differences.

Financial statements continued 

29  Deferred tax assets and liabilities continued 
At 31 December 2023, the Group had unused tax losses associated with Chilean entities (predominantly Antucoya) of $523.3 million (2022 -- 
$460.3 million) available for offset against future profits. Generally under Chilean tax law, most tax losses can be carried forward indefinitely. A deferred 
tax asset of $141.2 million has been recognised in respect of 100% of these losses as at 31 December 2023 (31 December 2022 -- $124.5 million). 
In addition, at 31 December 2023, the Group had unused tax losses associated with entities outside of Chile (predominantly in respect of the Twin Metals 
project) of $496.8 million (2022 -- $427.0 million). A portion of the Twin Metals tax losses expire in the period from 2030 -- 2037, and the remainder 
can be carried forward indefinitely. Deferred tax assets have not been recognised in respect of these tax losses, reflecting the fact that the relevant 
entities have generated taxable losses in recent years. At 31 December 2023, deferred withholding tax liabilities of $66.6 million have been recognised 
(31 December 2022 -- $71.6 million) which relate to undistributed earnings of subsidiaries where it is considered likely that the corresponding profits will 
be distributed in the foreseeable future. The value of the remaining undistributed earnings of subsidiaries, for which deferred tax liabilities have not been 
recognised, because the Group is in a position to control the timing of the distributions and it is likely that distributions will not be made in the foreseeable 
future, was $7,101.1 million (31 December 2022 -- $6,430.4 million). If deferred withholding tax liabilities were recognised in respect of all of these 
remaining undistributed earnings of subsidiaries this would result in an additional deferred tax liability and expense of approximately $1,314.9 million 
(31 December 2022 -- $1,076.5 million), depending on the application of tax credits which may be available in particular circumstances. 

Temporary differences arising in connection with interests in associates are insignificant.  

The deferred tax balance of $1,584.6 million (2022 -- $1,464.8 million) includes $1,567.2 million (2022 -- $1,404.7 million) due in more than one year. 

The deferred tax assets of $72.0 million include $23.5 million due in less than 1 year and $48.5 million due in more than 1 year. 

The deferred tax liabilities of $1,656.6 million include $40.9 million due in less than 1 year and $1,615.7 million due in more than 1 year. 

All amounts are shown as non-current on the face of the balance sheet as required by IAS 12 Income Taxes.

Decommissioning and restoration costs relate to the Group’s mining operations. Costs are estimated on the basis of a formal closure plan and are subject 
to regular independent formal review by Sernageomin, the Chilean government agency which regulates the mining industry in Chile. During 2023, the 
Centinela provisions were updated to reflect new plans approved by Sernageomin during the year. The provision balance reflects the present value of the 
forecast future cash flows expected to be incurred in line with the closure plans, discounted using Chilean real interest rates with durations corresponding 
with the timings of the closure activities. At 31 December 2023, the real discount rates ranged from 2.29% to 2.41% (31 December 2022: 1.67% to 1.73%). 

It is estimated that the provision will be utilised from 2024 until 2066 based on current mine plans, with approximately 16% of the total provision balance 
expected to be utilised between 2024 and 2033, approximately 48% between 2034 and 2043, approximately 9% between 2044 and 2053 and 
approximately 27% between 2054 and 2066. 

Given the long-term nature of these balances, it is possible that future climate risks could impact the appropriate amount of these provisions, both in terms 
of the nature of the decommissioning and site rehabilitation activities that are required, or the costs of undertaking those activities. In its Annual Report 
and Accounts, the Group discloses in line with the recommendations of the Task Force on Climate-related Financial Disclosures (‘‘TCFD’’). This process 
included scenario analyses assessing the impact of transition and physical risks. As a simple high-level sensitivity, we have considered whether the level 
of estimated costs relating to the potential future risks identified under the scenario analysis could indicate a general level of future cost increases as a 
consequence of climate risks which could indicate a significant potential impact on these provision balances. This analysis did not indicate a significant 
potential impact on the decommissioning and restoration provision balances. However, more detailed specific analysis of the potential impacts of climate 
risks in future periods could result in adjustments to these provision balances. When future updates to the closure plans are prepared and submitted to 
Sernageomin for review and approval, it is possible that additional consideration of potential climate risk impacts may need to be incorporated into the plan 
assumptions. In addition, Sernageomin may introduce new regulations or guidance in respect of climate risks which may need to be addressed in future 
updates to the Group’s closure plans.

The transactions which Group companies entered into with related parties who are not members of the Group are set out below. There are no guarantees 
given or received and no provisions for doubtful debts related to the amount of outstanding balances. 

A)  Quiñenco SA 
Quiñenco SA (‘‘Quiñenco’’) is a Chilean financial and industrial conglomerate, the shares of which are traded on the Santiago Stock Exchange, and in 
which members of the Luksic family are interested. A Director of the Company, Jean-Paul Luksic, and a member of the Group’s Executive Committee, 
Andronico Luksic L, are also directors of Quiñenco. 

The following transactions took place between the Group and the Quiñenco group of companies, all of which were on normal commercial terms at market 
rates:

o 

o 

o 

the Group made purchases of fuel from ENEX SA, a subsidiary of Quiñenco, of $337.8 million (2022 -- $309.9 million). The balance due to ENEX SA 
at the end of the year was $13.3 million (2022 -- $28.6 million) 
the Group earned interest income of $0.9 million (2022 -- $0.8 million) during the year on investments with BanChile Administradora General de 
Fondos SA, a subsidiary of Quiñenco. Investment balances at the end of the year were nil (2022: nil) 
the Group purchased shipping services from Hapag Lloyd, an associate of Quiñenco, of $9.0 million (2022 -- $12.7 million). The balance due to 
Hapag Lloyd at the end of the year was nil (2022 -- $0.3 million) 
the Group made purchases of technology services from ARTIKOS CHILE SA, a subsidiary of Quiñenco, of $0.2 million (2022 -- $0.2 million). 
The balance due to ARTIKOS CHILE SA at the end of the year was nil (2022: nil) 

B)  Compañía de Inversiones Adriático SA 
In 2023, the Group leased office space on normal commercial terms from Compañía de Inversiones Adriático SA, a company in which members of the 
Luksic family are interested, at a cost of $0.8 million (2022 --$0.4 million). 

C)  Antomin 2 Limited and Antomin Investors Limited 
The Group holds a 51% interest in Antomin 2 Limited (‘‘Antomin 2’’) and Antomin Investors Limited (‘‘Antomin Investors’’), which own a number of copper 
exploration properties. The Group originally acquired its 51% interest in these properties for a nominal consideration from Mineralinvest Establishment, 
a company controlled by the Luksic family, which continues to hold the remaining 49% of Antomin 2 and Antomin Investors. During the year ended 
31 December 2023, the Group incurred $0.1 million (year ended 31 December 2022 -- $0.1 million) of exploration expense at these properties.  

D)  Tethyan Copper Company Limited (Reko Diq project) 
On 15 December 2022, Antofagasta entered into definitive agreements to exit its interest in the Tethyan joint venture, which was a joint venture with 
Barrick Gold Corporation in respect of the Reko Diq project in Pakistan, which is therefore no longer recognised as a joint venture by the Group. The 
group contributed nil (2022: nil) to Tethyan during 2023. 
E)  Compañia Minera Zaldívar SpA 
The Group has a 50% interest in Zaldívar (see Note 18), which is a joint venture with Barrick Gold Corporation. Antofagasta is the operator of Zaldívar. 
The balance due from Zaldívar to Group companies at the end of the year was $6.7 million (2022 -- $6.7 million). During 2023, Zaldívar declared 
dividends of nil to the Group (2022 -- $50.0 million). 

F)  Directors and other key management personnel 
Information relating to Directors’ remuneration and interests is given in the Remuneration Report on page 170. Information relating to the remuneration of 
key management personnel including the Directors is given in Note 9. 

36  Litigation and contingent liabilities 
The Group is subject from time to time to legal proceedings, claims, complaints and investigations arising out of the ordinary course of business. 
The Group cannot predict the outcome of individual legal actions or claims or complaints or investigations. As a result, the Group may become subject to 
liabilities that could affect our business, financial position and reputation. Litigation is inherently unpredictable and large judgements may at times occur. 
The Group may incur, in the future, judgement or enter into settlements of claims that could lead to material cash outflows. The Group considers that no 
material loss to the Group is expected to result from the legal proceedings, claims, complaints and investigations that the Group is currently subject to. 
Provisions are recognised when it is probable that the Group will be required to settle an obligation arising as a result of a legal claim against the Group. 

Details of any significant potential tax uncertainties are set out in Note 11. 

37  Ultimate parent company 
The immediate parent of the Group is Metalinvest Establishment, which is controlled by the E. Abaroa Foundation, in which members of the Luksic family 
are interested. 

Both Metalinvest Establishment and the E. Abaroa Foundation are domiciled in Liechtenstein. Information relating to the interest of Metalinvest 
Establishment and the E. Abaroa Foundation is given in the Directors’ Report.

Antofagasta plc  Annual Report 2023

FINANCIAL STATEMENTS 
 
 
 
2  Principal accounting policies of the Parent Company 
A summary of the principal accounting policies is set out below. These accounting policies have been applied consistently. 

A)  Currency translation 
The Company’s functional currency is the US dollar. Transactions in currencies other than the functional currency are translated at the exchange rate 
ruling at the date of the transaction. Monetary assets and liabilities, including amounts due from or to subsidiaries, denominated in currencies other than 
the functional currency (being US dollars) are retranslated at year-end exchange rates. Gains and losses on retranslation are included in net profit or loss 
for the year. 

Income recognition 

B) 
Dividends proposed by subsidiaries are recognised as income by the Company when they represent a present obligation of the subsidiaries, in the period 
in which they are formally approved for payment. 

Interest income is accrued on a time basis, by reference to the principal outstanding and the effective interest rate applicable, which is the rate that exactly 
discounts estimated future cash receipts through the expected life of the financial asset to that asset’s net carrying amount. 

C)  Dividends payable 
Dividends proposed are recognised when they represent a present obligation, in the period in which they are formally approved for payment. Accordingly, 
an interim dividend is recognised when paid and a final dividend is recognised when approved by shareholders. 

Investments in subsidiaries 

D) 
Investments in subsidiaries represent equity holdings in subsidiaries and long-term amounts owed by subsidiaries. Such investments are valued at cost 
less any impairment provisions. Investments relating to equity holdings in subsidiaries are reviewed for impairment if events or changes in circumstances 
indicate that the carrying amount may not be recoverable; the recoverable amount of the investment is the higher of fair value less costs of disposal and 
value in use. Investments relating to long-term amounts owed by subsidiaries are reviewed to assess if a material expected credit loss provision is 
required in respect of these balances. 

E)  Liquid investments and cash and cash equivalents  
Liquid investments represent highly liquid current asset investments such as term deposits and managed funds invested in high quality fixed income 
instruments. They do not meet the IAS 7 definition of cash and cash equivalents, normally because even if readily accessible, the underlying investments 
have an average maturity profile greater than 90 days from the date first entered into, or because they are held primarily for investment purposes rather 
than meeting short-term cash commitments. Cash and cash equivalents comprise cash on hand, deposits held on call with banks, highly liquid investments 
that are readily convertible into known amounts of cash, and which are subject to insignificant risk of changes in value and are held for the purpose of 
meeting short-term cash commitments rather than for investment or other purposes. The cash balance is presented net of bank overdrafts which are 
repayable on demand. Cash and cash equivalents have a maturity period of 90 days or less. 

F)  Borrowings  
Interest-bearing loans and bank overdrafts are initially recorded at the proceeds received, net of direct issue costs. They are subsequently measured at 
amortised cost using the effective interest method, with interest expense recognised on an effective yield basis. The effective interest method is a method 
of calculating the amortised cost of a financial liability and of allocating interest expense over the relevant period. The effective interest rate is the rate that 
exactly discounts estimated future cash payments through the expected life of the financial liability, or, where appropriate, a shorter period. Finance 
charges, including premiums payable on settlement or redemption and direct issue costs, are accounted for on an accruals basis using the effective 
interest rate method. 

G)  Borrowings – preference shares 
The sterling-denominated preference shares issued by the Company carry a fixed rate of return without the right to participate in any surplus. They are 
accordingly classified as borrowings and translated into US dollars at year-end rates of exchange. Preference share dividends are included within finance 
costs. 

H)  Equity instruments – ordinary share capital and share premium 
Equity instruments issued are recorded at the proceeds received, net of direct issue costs. Equity instruments of the Company comprise its sterling-
denominated issued ordinary share capital and related share premium. 

The presentational and the functional currency of the Company is US dollars, and ordinary share capital and share premium are translated into US dollars 
at historical rates of exchange based on dates of issue. 

Financing facilities 

I) 
On 30 December, 2023, Antofagasta plc agreed a revolving credit facility ‘‘RCF’’ of $500.0 million. This revolving credit facility has a term of three years, 
which expires on 30 December, 2025 (see Note 24F). 

3  Significant accounting estimates and judgements 
We do not consider there to be critical accounting judgements or key sources of estimation uncertainty which could have a significant risk of causing a 
material adjustment to the carrying amounts of the Company’s assets and liabilities within the next financial year. We have set out below the most 
significant judgements and estimates applied in the preparation of the Company’s balance sheet. The most significant accounting judgement is whether 
there are impairment indicators in respect of the carrying value of the Company’s investments in subsidiaries, which have a total carrying value as at 
31 December 2023 of $938.3 million. The most significant accounting estimate is whether a credit loss provision is required in respect of any of the 
Company’s receivable balances. Over 99% of the receivable balances relate to intercompany balances, primarily with Group holding companies which 
hold the Group’s investments in the operating companies. There is not considered to be any significant risk of a material overstatement of these carrying 
values. In assessing this, the Group has considered the overall market capitalisation of the Group, which was $21.1 billion at 31 December 2023, the cash 
and other assets held by the relevant Group companies and the level of earnings generated by the Group’s operations.

1.  The $349.2 million increase in the shares in subsidiaries balance reflects the acquisition by the Company of additional shares issued by the Company’s direct subsidiary 

Andean LFMA Limited during the year. 

The above amount of $468.5 million (31 December 2022 -- $468.5 million) in respect of amounts owed by subsidiaries due after more than one year 
relates to long-term funding balances for which the Company does not expect to demand repayment in the foreseeable future and which form an integral 
part of the Company’s long-term investment in those subsidiary companies.  

The Company has reviewed whether there are any indicators of impairment in respect of the equity investment balance and concluded that there are no 
such indicators. The expected credit loss risk for the element of the investment balance relating to amounts owed by subsidiaries due after more than one 
year is considered to be immaterial to the Company. 

ii)  Trade and other receivables – amounts owed by subsidiaries due after one year 
At 31 December 2023, an amount of $53.6 million (31 December 2022 -- $54.0 million) was owed to the Company by indirect subsidiaries. This amount is 
not expected to be realised within 12 months after the reporting period. The expected credit loss risk for the amounts owed by subsidiaries is considered 
to be immaterial to the Company. 

iii)  Trade and other receivables – amounts owed by subsidiaries due within one year  
At 31 December 2023, amounts owed by subsidiaries due within one year were $311.7 million (31 December 2022 -- $744.6 million). These balances 
principally relate to $308.3 million of intercompany dividends declared but not yet paid to the Company by its immediate subsidiary companies. The 
expected credit loss risk for the amounts owed by subsidiaries is considered to be immaterial to the Company. 

6  Amounts payable to subsidiaries 
At 31 December 2023, amounts payable to subsidiaries due within one year were $345.2 million (31 December 2022 -- $615.7 million). The decrease in 
this balance during the year mainly reflects the repayment of a $281.7 million balance as a result of an intra-group restructuring of intercompany 
balances. 

7  Borrowings – preference shares 
The authorised, issued and fully paid preference share capital of the Company comprised 2,000,000 5% cumulative preference shares of £1 each at both 
31 December 2023 and 31 December 2022. As explained in Note 24C, the preference shares are recorded in the balance sheet in US dollars at period-
end rates of exchange. 

The preference shares are non-redeemable and are entitled to a fixed 5% cumulative dividend, payable in equal instalments in June and December of 
each year. On a winding-up, the preference shares are entitled to repayment and any arrears of dividend in priority to ordinary shareholders, but are not 
entitled to participate further in any surplus. Each preference share carries 100 votes (see Note 24A (ix)) at any general meeting.

Alternative performance measures 

AAlltteerrnnaattiivvee  ppeerrffoorrmmaannccee  mmeeaassuurreess    

(not subject to audit or review) 

This Annual Report includes a number of alternative performance measures, in addition to amounts in accordance with UK-adopted International 
Accounting Standards. These measures are included because they are considered to provide relevant and useful additional information to users of the 
financial statements. Set out below are definitions of these alternative performance measures, explanations as to why they are considered to be relevant 
and useful, and reconciliations to the IFRS figures. 

A)  Underlying earnings per share 
Underlying earnings per share is earnings per share from continuing operations, excluding exceptional items. This measure is reconciled to earnings per 
share from continuing operations (including exceptional items) on the face of the income statement. This measure is considered to be useful as it provides 
an indication of the earnings generated by the ongoing businesses of the Group, excluding the impact of exceptional items which are irregular or non-
operating in nature.  

B)  EBITDA 
EBITDA refers to Earnings Before Interest, Tax, Depreciation and Amortisation. EBITDA is calculated by adding back depreciation, amortisation, profit or 
loss on disposals and impairment charges to operating profit. This comprises 100% of the EBITDA from the Group´s subsidiaries, and the Group´s 
proportional share of the EBITDA of its associates and joint ventures. 

EBITDA is considered to provide a useful and comparable indication of the current operating earnings performance of the business, excluding the impact 
of the historical cost of property, plant and equipment or the particular financing structure adopted by the business.

C)  Cash costs 
Cash costs are a measure of the cost of operating production expressed in terms of cents per pound of payable copper produced. 

This is considered to be a useful and relevant measure as it is a standard industry measure applied by most major copper mining companies which 
reflects the direct costs involved in producing each pound of copper. It therefore allows a straightforward comparison of the unit production cost of 
different mines, and allows an assessment of the position of a mine on the industry cost curve. It also provides a simple indication of the profitability of a 
mine when compared against the price of copper (per lb).  

With sales of concentrates at Los Pelambres and Centinela, which are sold to smelters and roasting plants for further processing into fully refined metal, 
the price of the concentrate invoiced to the customer reflects the market value of the fully refined metal less a ‘‘treatment and refining charge’’ deduction, 
to reflect the lower value of this partially processed material compared with the fully refined metal. For accounting purposes, the revenue amount is the 
net of the market value of fully refined metal less the treatment and refining charges. Under the standard industry definition of cash costs, treatment and 
refining charges are regarded as an expense and part of the total cash cost figure.

D)  Attributable cash, cash equivalents and liquid investments, borrowings and net debt 
Attributable cash, cash equivalents and liquid investments, borrowings and net debt reflects the proportion of those balances which are attributable to the 
owners of the parent, after deducting the proportion attributable to the non-controlling interests in the Group’s subsidiaries. 

This is considered to be a useful and relevant measure as the majority of the Group’s cash tends to be held at the corporate level and therefore 100% 
attributable to the owners of the parent, whereas the majority of the Group’s borrowings tends to be at the level of the individual operations, and hence 
only a proportion is attributable to the owners of the parent.

Ore reserves and mineral resources estimates

Ore reserves and mineral  
resources estimates

At 31 December 2023

Introduction 
The ore reserves and mineral resources estimates, presented in this 
report, comply with the requirements of the Australasian Code for 
Reporting of Exploration Results, Mineral Resources and Ore Reserves 
2012 edition (the JORC Code) which has been used by the Group as 
minimum standard for the preparation and disclosure of the 
information contained herein. The definitions and categories of ore 
reserves, and mineral resources are set out below. 

The information on ore reserves and mineral resources was prepared 
by or under the supervision of Competent Persons as defined in the 
JORC Code. The Competent Persons have sufficient experience 
relevant to the style of mineralisation and type of deposit under 
consideration and to the activity which they are undertaking. The 
Competent Persons consent to the inclusion in this report of the 
matters based on their information in the form and context in which it 
appears. The Competent Person for Exploration Results and Mineral 
Resources is Osvaldo Galvez (CP, Chile), Mineral Resource Evaluation 
Deputy Manager for Antofagasta Minerals SA. The Competent Person 
for Ore Reserves is Sofia Orellana (CP, Chile), Long-Term Mine 
Planning Deputy Manager for Antofagasta Minerals SA. 

The Group’s operations and projects are subject to a comprehensive 
programme of audits aimed at providing assurance in respect of ore 
reserves and mineral resource estimates. The audits are conducted by 
suitably qualified Competent Persons from within an operation, another 
operation of the Company or from independent consultants. The ore 
reserves and mineral resource estimates are the total reserves and 
resources, with the Group’s attributable share for each mine shown in 
the ‘Attributable Tonnage’ column. The Group’s economic interest in 
each mine is disclosed in the notes following the estimates on pages 
254 to 255. The totals in the table may include some small apparent 
differences due to rounding. 

Definitions and categories of ore reserves  
and mineral resources 
A ‘Mineral Resource’ is a concentration or occurrence of material of 
intrinsic economic interest in or on the Earth’s crust in such form, 
quality and quantity that there are reasonable prospects for eventual 
economic extraction. The location, quantity, grade, geological 
characteristics, and continuity of a Mineral Resource are known, 
estimated or interpreted from specific geological evidence and 
knowledge. Mineral Resources are sub-divided, in order of increasing 
geological confidence, into Inferred, Indicated and Measured 
categories. 

An ‘Inferred Mineral Resource’ is that part of a Mineral Resource for 
which tonnage, grade and mineral content can be estimated with a low 
level of confidence. It is inferred from geological evidence and 
assumed but not verified geological and/or grade continuity. It is based 
on information gathered through appropriate techniques from locations 
such as outcrops, trenches, pits, workings and drillholes which may be 
limited or of uncertain quality and reliability. 

An ‘Indicated Mineral Resource’ is that part of a Mineral Resource for 
which tonnage, densities, shape, physical characteristics, grade and 
mineral content can be estimated with a reasonable level of 
confidence. It is based on exploration, sampling and testing information 
gathered through appropriate techniques from locations such as 
outcrops, trenches, pits, workings and drillholes. The locations are too 
widely or inappropriately spaced to confirm geological and/or grade 
continuity but are spaced closely enough for continuity to be assumed. 

A ‘Measured Mineral Resource’ is that part of a Mineral Resource for 
which tonnage, densities, shape, physical characteristics, grade and 
mineral content can be estimated with a high level of confidence. It is 
based on detailed and reliable exploration, sampling and testing 
information gathered through appropriate techniques from locations 
such as outcrops, trenches, pits, workings and drillholes. The locations 
are spaced closely enough to confirm geological and grade continuity. 

An ‘Ore Reserve’ is the economically mineable part of a Measured 
and/or Indicated Mineral Resource. It includes diluting materials and 
allowances for losses, which may occur when the material is mined. 
Appropriate assessments and studies have been carried out and 
include realistic consideration on modifying factors such as mining 
methods, metallurgical process and economic, marketing, legal, 
environmental, social and governmental factors. These assessments 
demonstrate at the time of reporting that extraction could be 
reasonably justified. Ore Reserves are sub-divided in order of 
increasing confidence into Probable Ore Reserves and Proved Ore 
Reserves. 

A ‘Probable Ore Reserve’ is the economically mineable part of an 
Indicated, and in some circumstances, a Measured Mineral Resource. It 
includes diluting materials and allowances for losses which may occur 
when the material is mined. Appropriate assessments and studies 
have been carried out and include realistic consideration on modifying 
factors such as mining methods, metallurgical process and economic, 
marketing, legal, environmental, social and governmental factors. 
These assessments demonstrate at the time of reporting that 
extraction could reasonably be justified. 

A ‘Proved Ore Reserve’ is the economically mineable part of a 
Measured Mineral Resource. It includes diluting materials and 
allowances for losses which may occur when the material is mined. 
Appropriate assessments and studies have been carried out and 
include realistic consideration on modifying factors such as mining 
methods, metallurgical processes and economic, marketing, legal, 
environmental, social and governmental factors. These assessments 
demonstrate at the time of reporting that extraction could reasonably 
be justified.

Ore reserves and mineral resources estimates continued

Notes to ore reserves and mineral  
resources estimates 
The ore reserves mentioned in this report were determined 
considering specific copper cut-off grades for each mine and using a 
long-term copper price of $3.50/lb ($3.30/lb in 2022), $13.00/lb 
molybdenum ($13.00/lb in 2022) and $1,600/oz gold ($1,600/oz in 
2022), unless otherwise noted. These same values have been used for 
copper equivalent (CuEq) estimates, where appropriate. 

In order to ensure that the stated resources represent mineralisation 
that has “reasonable prospects for eventual economic extraction” 
(JORC Code) the resources are enclosed within pit shells that were 
optimised based on measured, indicated and inferred resources and 
considering a copper price of $4.20/lb ($3.75/lb in 2022). 
Mineralisation estimated outside these pit shells is not included in the 
resource figures. 

Group policy on auditing of resource and reserve estimates is that 
prior to first publication, an independent external audit is done. External 
audits are also done on resources and reserves for any material 
changes (incorporation of a significant amount of drillhole information, 
for instance) or every three to five years, whichever comes first. All 
the resource models that support the resource and reserve estimates 
have been audited as per Group policy. All resource and reserve 
estimates have been found to comply with the JORC Code (2012). 

a) Los Pelambres 

Los Pelambres is 60% owned by the Group. The cut-off grade applied 
to the determination of mineral resources is 0.30% copper, while the 
cut-off grade applied for ore reserves is variable over 0.35% copper. 
Ore Reserves decreased by 57 million tonnes due principally to 
depletion in the period and reflects the remaining capacity of the 
existing tailing dams, limiting the amount of mineral resource that can 
be converted into ore reserves. Mineral resources have increased 
overall by a net 174 million tonnes, including depletion, due to higher 
mineral prices and a decrease in the cut-off grade from 0.35%Cu to 
0.30%Cu. 

b) Centinela (Concentrates and Cathodes) 

Centinela is 70% owned by the Group and consists of Centinela 
Concentrates (Esperanza, Esperanza Sur and Encuentro Sulphide) and 
Centinela Cathodes (Encuentro and Llano deposits, including the oxide 
portion of the Mirador). The cut-off grade applied to the determination 
of ore reserves for Centinela Concentrates is 0.15% equivalent copper, 
with 0.15% copper used as a cut-off grade for mineral resources. The 
cut-off grades used at Centinela Cathodes are 0.20% copper for ore 
reserves and 0.15% copper for mineral resources. 

The Centinela Concentrates ore reserves have decreased by a net 
7 million tonnes, due mainly to depletion in the period, partially 
compensated by an increase associated with higher metal prices. 
Centinela sulphides mineral resources increased by a net 97 million 
tonnes, incorporating ore material that connects former Esperanza and 
Esperanza Sur resources, due mainly to higher product prices. The 
Centinela Cathodes ore reserves have decreased by a net 83 million 
tonnes, due mainly to depletion in the period and the ending of the 
leaching cycle in some sectors of the ROM pad. Centinela Cathodes 
ore reserves are made up of 131 million tonnes at 0.43% copper of 
heap leach ore and 61 million tonnes at 0.23% copper of ROM ore. 
Centinela oxides mineral resources decreased by a net 95 million 
tonnes, due mainly to the removal of ROM materials that ended their 
leaching cycle, depletion and higher mining and processing costs.

Antofagasta plc  Annual Report 2023

c) Antucoya 

Antucoya is 70% owned by the Group. The ore reserve cut-off grade 
is 0.16% copper, while the cut-off grade for mineral resources is 
0.15% copper. Ore reserves have increased by a net 9 million tonnes 
due to the resource model update, including in-fill drilling data, which 
compensated depletion. For 2023, the mineral resource model has 
been updated with 52 drillholes for a total of 11,650 metres. Mineral 
resources have decreased by a net 14 million tonnes, due mostly to 
depletion, and new drilling data. 

d) Polo Sur 

Polo Sur is 100% owned by the Group. The cut-off grade applied to the 
determination of mineral resources for both oxides and sulphides is 
0.20% copper. The 2023 resource model has been updated with 89 
drillholes for a total of 14,400 metres. Mineral resources have 
increased by a net 23 million tonnes, due mainly to the increase in 
metal prices. 

e) Penacho Blanco 

Penacho Blanco is 51% owned by the Group. The cut-off grade applied 
to the determination of mineral resources for both oxides and 
sulphides is 0.20% copper. For 2023, the resource model has not 
been updated. The mineral resources have increased by a net 115 
million tonnes, due mainly to the increase in metal prices. 

f) Mirador 

Mirador is 100% owned by the Group. A portion of Mirador Oxides is 
subject to an agreement between the Group and Centinela, whereby 
Centinela purchased the rights to mine the oxide ore reserves within 
an identified area. The mineral resources for Mirador Oxides subject to 
the agreement with Centinela are included in the Centinela Cathodes 
section. The resources not subject to the agreement are reported in 
this section. The cut-off grade applied to the determination of the 
mineral resources for oxides is 0.15% copper and for sulphides is 
0.20% copper. The mineral resources have increased by a net 14 
million tonnes, due mainly to the increase in metal prices. 

g) Los Volcanes 

Los Volcanes is 51% owned by the Group. The cut-off grade applied to 
the determination of mineral resources is 0.20% copper. For 2023, 
the mineral resource model has not been updated. The mineral 
resources have increased by a net 22 million tonnes, due mainly to the 
increase in metal prices. 

h) Brujulina 

Brujulina is 51% owned by the Group. The cut-off grade applied to the 
determination of mineral resources is 0.30% copper. For 2023, the 
mineral resource model has not been updated. The mineral resources 
have increased by a net 0.5 million tonnes, due mainly to the increase 
in metal prices. 

i) Sierra 

Sierra is 100% owned by the Group. The cut-off grade applied to the 
determination of mineral resources is 0.30% copper. For 2023, the 
mineral resource model has not been updated. The mineral resources 
have increased by a net 2 million tonnes, due mainly to the increase in 
metal prices. 

j) Encierro 

Encierro is 57.17% owned by the Group. For 2023, the mineral 
resource model has not been updated. Encierro’s mineral resources 
are stated above cut-offs of 0.50% copper for sulphides. All reported 
mineral resources have been defined as inferred. Mineralisation 
estimated below a 0.5% cut-off is not included in the mineral resource 
figures. 

OTHER INFORMATIONIn the southern part of the deposit (Phase 13), the final pit impacts 
a portion of the Minera Escondida mining property, for which there is 
an agreement for development. In parallel, agreements are pending 
with third parties to relocate additional infrastructure. 

Currently, Zaldívar is permitted to extract water and mine until 2025, 
following the approval of the Declaration of Environmental Impact 
(“DIA”) in early 2024 to align both the permits for mining and water 
extraction. The mine life after 2025 is based on an EIA application 
which was filed in June 2023 to extend mining and water 
environmental permits. This EIA includes a proposal to develop the 
primary sulphide ore deposit and a conversion of the water source for 
Zaldívar to either sea water or water from third parties, following a 
transition period during which the current continental water extraction 
permit is extended. The current ore reserves estimate assumes that 
the requested permit will be extended to allow for the extraction of all 
of Zaldívar’s ore reserves, through continuous operation of the mine 
without interruption. The details of the future permits or alternative 
water supply arrangements could lead to a review of and, eventually, 
an update to, Zaldívar’s mine plan. 

o) Antomin 2 and Antomin investors 

The Group has a 51% interest in two indirect subsidiaries, Antomin 2 
Limited (“Antomin 2”) and Antomin Investors Limited (“Antomin 
Investors”), which own several copper exploration properties in Chile’s 
Antofagasta Region and Coquimbo Region. These include, among 
others, Penacho Blanco, Los Volcanes and Brujulina. The remaining 
49% of Antomin 2 and Antomin Investors is owned by Mineralinvest 
Establishment (“Mineralinvest”), a company controlled by E. Abaroa 
Foundation, in which members of the Luksic family are interested. 
Further details are set out in Note 35(c) to the financial statements. 

k) Cachorro 

Cachorro is 100% owned by the Group. The cut-off grade applied to 
the determination of mineral resources for both oxides and sulphides 
is 0.50% copper. The 2023 resource model has been updated 
including new drilling data, adding 63 drillholes for a total of 37,000 
metres. Mineral resources have increased by a net 7 million tonnes, 
due to the resource model update. Resources have been defined as 
indicated and inferred material. Mineralisation estimated below a 0.5% 
cut-off is not included in the mineral resource figures. 

m) Twin Metals Minnesota LLC 

Twin Metals Minnesota LLC (“Twin Metals”) is 100% owned by the 
Group. Twin Metals has a 70% interest in the Birch Lake Joint Venture 
(“BLJV”), which holds the Birch Lake, Spruce Road and Maturi 
Southwest deposits, as well as a main portion of the Maturi deposit. 
With these interests taken into consideration, Twin Metals owns 83.1% 
of the mineral resource. For 2023, the mineral resource model has 
not been updated. The cut-off grade applied to the determination of 
mineral resources is 0.3% copper, which when combined with credits 
from nickel, platinum, palladium and gold, is deemed appropriate for an 
underground operation. In the mineral resource table ‘TPM’ (Total 
Precious Metals) refers to the sum of platinum, palladium and gold 
values in grammes per tonne. The TPM value of 0.57 g/tonne for the 
Maturi mineral resource estimate is made up of 0.15 g/tonne platinum, 
0.34 g/tonne palladium and 0.08 g/tonne gold. The TPM value of 0.30 
g/tonne for the Maturi Southwest mineral resource estimate is made 
up of 0.08 g/tonne platinum, 0.17 g/tonne palladium and 0.05 g/tonne 
gold. The TPM value of 0.70 g/tonne for the Birch Lake mineral 
resource estimate is made up of 0.19 g/tonne platinum, 0.41 g/tonne 
palladium and 0.10 g/tonne gold. The Spruce Road mineral resource 
estimate does not include TPM values as they were not assayed for 
TPMs. 

In 2022, Twin Metals filed a lawsuit in the US District Court for the 
District of Columbia (District Court) challenging the administrative 
actions resulting in the rejection of Twin Metals’ preference right lease 
applications (PRLAs), the cancellation of its federal mining leases 1352 
and 1353, the rejection of its Mine Plan of Operation (MPO), and the 
dismissal of the administrative appeal of the MPO rejection. Twin 
Metals claimed that the government’s actions were arbitrary and 
capricious, contrary to the law, and in violation of its rights. In 
September 2023, following a motion to dismiss filed by the 
government, the District Court dismissed Twin Metals’ claims. In 
November 2023, Twin Metals appealed the District Court’s order to the 
US Court of Appeals for the District of Columbia Circuit. This action is 
pending. If TMM is unsuccessful in having the decisions on the federal 
leases 1352 and 1353 and the PRLAs reversed through litigation, it will 
not have entitlement to the mineral resources associated with those 
mineral rights. 

n) Zaldívar 

Zaldívar is 50% owned by the Group. Heap leaching (HL) and dump 
leaching (DL) materials are defined based on total copper cut-off 
grades. The cut-off grade applied to the determination of ore reserves 
for Heap Leach ore is 0.31% copper, while the cut-off grade for Dump 
Leach material is 0.20% copper. Ore reserves have decreased by a 
net 60 million tonnes, due mainly to depletion in the period and higher 
mining and processing costs used for in pit optimisation. For mineral 
resources, the cut-off grade is 0.25% copper for HL and 0.10% copper 
for DL, throughout the life-of-mine period. The cut-off grade applied to 
the primary sulphide mineral resources is 0.3% copper. The mineral 
resources decreased by 2 million tonnes because of the combined 
effects of depletion and increase in metal prices.
