Chair’s
Statement 

“  Our differentiated and growing 
portfolio of approved medicines, 
global reach and rich R&D 
pipeline give us confidence that 
we will continue to grow faster 
than the industry over the near 
and medium term”

$2.90

Full-year dividend of  
$2.90 per share (2022: $2.90)

AstraZeneca is focused on 
delivering its Purpose and 
has ambitious plans for 
the future.

I was honoured to be appointed to succeed 
Leif Johansson as the Chair of AstraZeneca 
when he stood down at our Annual General 
Meeting in April. Leif brought together a 
strong Board, with an impressive and diverse 
mix of skills and experience, to oversee our 
ambitious pursuit of innovation and success.

Leif and I share the view that a board has 
three core roles: maintaining good governance, 
oversight of strategy and development of 
people. As your new Chair, I look forward to 
focusing on these priorities and, building on 
my own experience in other organisations, 
working with the Board to unlock the full 
potential of what AstraZeneca has to offer.

A clear strategy and ambitious goals
AstraZeneca’s achievements and returns to 
shareholders are built on the successful 
delivery of our Growth Through Innovation 
strategy and our strategic priorities. We have 
ambitious plans for the future and are 
relentless in our focus to push the boundaries 
of science to deliver life-changing medicines. 
By living our Values and realising our strategic 
goals, we aim to transform patient outcomes, 
deliver industry-leading revenue growth, and 
ensure we remain a great place to work. 
Between 2023 and 2030, we aim to launch at 
least 15 new medicines and become carbon 
negative, thereby making an even bigger 
difference for people, society and the planet.

Performance and outlook
As AstraZeneca celebrates its 25th 
anniversary, I was pleased we were able 
to report another year of strong financial 
development and scientific progress, with 
double-digit earnings growth, and investment 
in exciting areas of science that lay the 
foundations for long-term success.

Reflecting this financial performance, the 
Board intends to declare a second interim 
dividend of $1.97 per share, making a total 
dividend declared for the full year of $2.90.

Looking ahead, we expect another year of 
strong growth in 2024, driven by continued 
adoption of our medicines across geographies. 
Our differentiated and growing portfolio of 
approved medicines, global reach and rich 
R&D pipeline give us confidence that we will 
continue to grow faster than the industry over 
the near and medium term.

A purpose-driven organisation
In my time as a Director, I have experienced 
at first hand the commitment of AstraZeneca 
people to delivering our Purpose. And in my 
recent experience as Chair, whether at our 
Speke site in the UK or Gaithersburg in the 
US, our Gothenburg site in Sweden or our 
Tokyo office in Japan, I have been extremely 
impressed by the enthusiasm for everything 
they do. I would like to extend my personal 
thanks to everyone in AstraZeneca for all 
they have achieved in 2023, as well as to 
Pascal, the Senior Executive Team and my 
fellow Directors.

Engaging stakeholders and shareholders
The role AstraZeneca has to play in 
addressing public health challenges and 
promoting innovation and sustainable access 
to treatments resonates strongly with 
governments and other stakeholders I have 
met during the year. 

Through the Partnership for Health System 
Sustainability and Resilience (PHSSR), 
I engaged policymakers, academics and 
health leaders across countries to advance 
policies strengthening the capacity of health 
systems to absorb the impact of future crises, 
while effectively responding to today’s 
growing burden of diseases. AstraZeneca is 
incredibly proud to be a founding member of 
the PHSSR, a public-private partnership that 
is accelerating the transformation of health 
systems around the world. I also valued the 
opportunity to deepen AstraZeneca’s 
collaborations with patient advocacy groups, 
governments and the private sector to 
improve equitable health outcomes for all.

Most recently I was proud to lead the 
AstraZeneca delegation at the World 
Economic Forum where we explored how 
to deepen our collaboration with key 
stakeholders to ensure healthcare is viewed 
as a strategic asset everywhere in the world.

Finally, I have enjoyed meeting shareholders 
and understanding what you would like to see 
from AstraZeneca. I look forward to meeting 
more of you this year and to driving continued 
impact for patients.

2023 was a year in 
which we continued to 
grow the business and 
deliver for patients. At 
the same time, we are 
investing for the future 
benefit of people,

Regulatory events – submissions 
or approvals in major markets

2023 was a year of strong growth and 
execution of our long-term growth strategy as 
Total Revenue increased by 3% (6% at CER) 
to $45.8 billion. Excluding COVID-19 
medicines, Total Revenue increased by 13% 
(15% at CER) to $45.5 billion. 

Continued growth in our therapy areas
Our ability to grow the business builds on 
our broad-based, diverse sources of revenue 
across our therapy areas and regions.

In our therapy areas, Total Revenue in 2023 
for Oncology increased by 19% (21% at CER); 
Cardiovascular, Renal & Metabolism by 15% 
(18% at CER); and Respiratory & Immunology 
by 7% (10% at CER). Vaccines & Immune 
Therapies Total Revenue fell by 72% (71% 
at CER) as demand for COVID-19 medicines 
fell away, while Rare Disease rose by 10% 
(12% at CER).

Innovating in science
AstraZeneca has one of the leading 
development pipelines in the sector and its 
strength in 2023 was evidenced by first 
approvals for three new medicines – the first 
year in our eight-year goal of launching at 
least 15 new molecular entities (NMEs) 
between 2023 and 2030.

Airsupra was approved for the first time in 
January 2023 for use as an as-needed 
treatment to reduce risk of asthma 
exacerbations. In November, Truqap in 
combination with Faslodex was approved for 
certain patients with advanced HR-positive 
breast cancer. And, right at the end of 2023, 
AstraZeneca and Ionis’ Wainua was approved 
for the treatment of the polyneuropathy of 
hereditary transthyretin-mediated amyloidosis 
in adults. It is the only approved treatment that 
can be self-administered with an auto-injector. 

In our regions, Total Revenue in the US was 
up 6% in 2023, in Europe it grew by 10% 
(8% at CER) and by 2% (9% at CER) in 
Emerging Markets. Total Revenue fell by 14% 
(8% at CER) in Established Rest of World. 
Excluding COVID-19 medicines, Total 
Revenue grew in all regions.

The good news continued in January 2024 
with first approval of Voydeya, a first-in-class 
oral, Factor D inhibitor developed as an 
add-on to proven standard of care Ultomiris 
or Soliris to address the needs of a small 
subset of patients with paroxysmal nocturnal 
haemoglobinuria.

Our financial performance was matched by 
our operational performance, with 282 
successful on-time launches during the year, 
overall supply performance of more than 99% 
and zero critical observations reported from 
49 external inspections. This represents an 
outstanding performance that ensures a 
continuous supply of high-quality medicines 
to patients.

The broad strength of our pipeline was 
exemplified by the fact that we achieved 
56 regulatory events during the year, either 
submissions or approvals for our medicines 
in major markets. Additionally, we recorded 
30 pipeline progression events, either NME 
Phase II starts or Phase III investment 
decisions. Of course, pushing boundaries 
sometimes means setbacks and, while we 
had some clinical trials during the year that 
did not meet their primary objectives, we are 
committed to improving health outcomes and 
learn from all our trials. Overall, 2023 was 
predominantly a year of scientific success and 
our pipeline progress indicates our ability to 
deliver longer-term sustainable growth.

Chief Executive Officer’s Review

Importantly, the science in each of our 
therapy areas is making a real difference to 
the lives of people around the world. For 
example, in Oncology, Enhertu, the antibody 
drug conjugate we are developing with 
Daiichi Sankyo, is approved around the world 
for the treatment of HER2-mutated breast, 
lung and gastric cancers. In addition, in 2023, 
it received not one, but two more US 
Breakthrough Therapy Designations for 
multiple types of HER2-expressing tumours 
and HER2-positive colorectal cancer. 
Additionally, in January 2024, it was granted 
Priority Review in the US for patients with a 
range of metastatic HER2-positive solid 
tumours.

These designations demonstrate the impact 
regulatory authorities believe Enhertu can 
have. Dato-DXd is also being developed 
with Daiichi Sankyo, and pivotal trial data 
announced during the year underlined our 
confidence in its potential to replace 
conventional chemotherapy for many patients 
with advanced lung and breast cancers.

In BioPharmaceuticals, data from the Forxiga 
DELIVER trial was critical in informing a Class 
1a recommendation in updated European 
Society of Cardiology Heart Failure guidelines. 
We have further strengthened our pipeline with 
CinCor’s candidate drug, baxdrostat for blood 
pressure lowering, with Quell to develop, 
manufacture and commercialise engineered 
T-regulatory cell therapies for autoimmune-
driven diseases, and with Eccogene’s novel 
agent, AZD5004 for the treatment of obesity 
and broader cardiometabolic conditions.

Our medicines are now helping patients with 
rare diseases in 70 markets – 18 more than 
2021. Treatments include Ultomiris for multiple 
indications, including neuromyelitis optica 
spectrum disorder (NMOSD), a progressive 
autoimmune disease that impacts the central 
nervous system. With no relapses observed in 
the pivotal CHAMPION-NMOSD trial, 
Ultomiris marks a significant advance for 
these patients. Regulatory reviews are 
ongoing, including in the US, and it is already 
approved in the EU and Japan.

People, society and the planet
All AstraZeneca’s achievements are down 
to the skills and capabilities of its people, 
and I am delighted to see that we have a 
highly engaged workforce, with 86% believing 
that we are a great place to work. I am also 
pleased with the progress we are making 
in creating an inclusive multinational and 
multicultural environment where everyone 
belongs, and using this diversity as a 
competitive advantage. I am particularly 
proud that 50% of our senior roles are 
filled by women.

Looking beyond AstraZeneca, 2023 was the 
year in which the world recognised that the 
climate crisis is a health crisis. This was no 
more apparent than at COP28 in Dubai where, 

for the first time, health was on the agenda 
and AstraZeneca was able to play a leading 
role in a dedicated Health Day that discussed 
the transition to low-carbon, climate-resilient 
health systems.

Icosavax, focused on developing 
differentiated, high-potential vaccines using 
an innovative, protein virus-like particle 
platform, will build on our expertise in 
respiratory syncytial virus.

We operate across the whole life-cycle of a 
medicine and, in November, we launched 
Evinova, a health-tech business designing and 
leveraging digital tools to accelerate 
innovation across the life sciences sector, the 
delivery of clinical trials as well as better 
health outcomes.

As shown throughout this Report, our efforts 
to push the boundaries of science are helped 
by artificial intelligence and new digital 
technologies that allow us to discover and 
deliver new treatments faster than ever before 
and drive a step-change in the diagnosis, 
monitoring and treatment of patients.

Colleagues
In closing, I want to thank all the AstraZeneca 
team for the part they have played in an 
exceptional year and for what we have 
been able to achieve for people, society 
and the planet.

Thanks also go to my colleagues on the 
Senior Executive Team where, during the year, 
we welcomed Sharon Barr, who joined as 
Executive Vice President, BioPharmaceuticals 
R&D to replace Mene Pangalos, who retires in 
2024. Sharon brings outstanding experience 
from Alexion and a track record of driving 
productivity, innovation and delivery of 
medicines. I want to thank Mene for his 
remarkable contribution to AstraZeneca and 
all he has done to transform how we approach 
R&D. In particular, I would like to pay tribute to 
the role he played in AstraZeneca’s response 
to the COVID-19 pandemic. The quality of the 
medicines he has brought to patients, and the 
pipeline and capabilities he has built, will be 
his legacy for many years to come.

In the year when we said farewell to Leif 
Johansson as Chair, I would like to close by 
extending my thanks to his successor, Michel 
Demaré, who continues to ensure we pursue 
our Purpose of pushing the boundaries of 
science to deliver life-changing medicines.

Pascal Soriot 
Chief Executive Officer

AstraZeneca is working to decarbonise 
healthcare and is doing so in collaboration 
with peers, stakeholders and suppliers. Since 
2015, there has been a 68% reduction in our 
Scope 1 and 2 greenhouse gas (GHG) 
emissions and, during 2023, we concluded 
agreements in the UK and in the US to use 
renewable natural gas, or biomethane, to 
supply clean heat to our sites. In addition, 
through our power purchase agreement in 
Sweden, we are expanding the country’s wind 
energy capacity. Also in 2023, we 
strengthened our investment in nature-based 
solutions by expanding our AZ Forest 
programme to include planting and 
maintaining 200 million trees across six 
continents by 2030. Overall, through our 
Ambition Zero Carbon strategy we are on 
track to halve our entire value chain Scope 1, 
2 and 3 footprint by 2030 and, through AZ 
Forest, we aim to become carbon negative 
for all residual GHG emissions from 2030 
onwards, removing more from the 
atmosphere than we emit.

Of course, our greatest contribution to human 
health is through our medicines and securing 
a future where people have access to 
affordable, sustainable healthcare. Through 
our access to healthcare programmes, we 
have reached more than 66 million people, 
while our Partnership for Health System 
Sustainability and Resilience is fostering joint 
learning and acting as a catalyst to strengthen 
health systems in more than 30 countries. We 
are not resting there and are advancing a 
health equity strategy that will build on our 
existing access programmes to enable more 
equitable global health outcomes.

Investing in future health
Our vision for health is not a short-term one. 
While maintaining our focus on discovering 
new small and large molecules, we are also 
increasing investment behind new modalities 
that we believe have the potential to 
revolutionise outcomes for patients. We are 
exploring modalities such as cell, gene and 
RNA therapies, epigenetics and 
oligonucleotides to unlock entirely new 
treatment approaches and are excited by 
their curative potential.

Our own efforts in these new modalities are 
supplemented by external expertise. In 2023, 
we announced the proposed acquisition of 
biotechnology company, Gracell, to further 
our cell therapy ambitions across oncology 
and autoimmune diseases, and an agreement 
with Cellectis, a clinical-stage biotechnology 
company, to accelerate cell therapy as well as 
genomic medicine. We also acquired a 
portfolio of preclinical rare disease gene 
therapies and our proposed acquisition of

What science can do: 
artificial intelligence

Artificial intelligence (AI) and our ability to process 
and understand vast amounts of data is accelerating 
innovative science, allowing us to discover and 
deliver new medicines faster than ever before. 

It helps healthcare professionals diagnose, monitor and treat patients 
more personally and precisely, helps patients play an active part in their 
own treatment, and enables care to move from disease management to 
stopping the progress of disease, long-term remission, and even cure.

    For more information on our approach to AI, please see IT and IS resources on page 41.

In research and development (R&D), 
AI transforms our understanding of 
disease biology; drives earlier diagnosis; 
and helps us create the next generation 
of medicines and pioneer new 
approaches in the clinic and beyond. 

    See page 34.

In Operations, AI enhances manufacturing 
and supply, enabling us to respond more 
pro-actively, drive automation and robotics, 
and raise quality standards still further. 

    See page 40.

In our therapy areas and markets, 
AI helps create new ways of doing 
business and build new and more 
integrated healthcare systems, helping 
healthcare practitioners treat more 
patients earlier and empower patients. 

    See from page 16 and page 41.

Across the business, AI enables us to work 
more effectively, as well as work seamlessly 
with industry and academic partners. We 
aim to do so in a way that is responsible, 
ethical and transparent for the benefit of 
people, society and the planet.

continued

Impact of global trends

Along with others, the pharmaceutical sector faces economic challenges, geopolitical 
uncertainty and the challenge of climate change. Rapidly-evolving technologies offer 
many benefits, while demographic change is driving an increased demand for healthcare. 
Successful organisations are transparent and build trust with their stakeholders.

The war in Ukraine and the COVID-19 
pandemic have accelerated a historic shift in 
the global order. Also, urgent, short-term risks 
are creating economic and geopolitical 
changes that may hasten other global threats. 
Current crises that divert attention and 
resources from medium- to longer-term risks 
may increase pressures on natural and human 
ecosystems. Some of these risks are close to 
a point of no return, but opportunities exist to 
shape a more secure future.

Geopolitical tensions, such as conflict in the 
Middle East, increase pressure on companies’ 
supply and distribution networks and may 
also have ripple effects over the medium term, 
contributing to a potential ‘polycrisis’ of 
interrelated environmental, geopolitical and 
socioeconomic risks relating to natural 
resources supply and demand. Geopolitical 
tensions and economic pressures have 
already limited, and in some cases reversed, 
progress on climate change mitigation, at 
least over the short term.

(Source: World Economic Forum (WEF): The Global Risk 
Report 2023 18th edition)

These growth projections remain below the 
historical (2000-2019) average of 3.8%. For 
advanced economies, the expected slowdown 
is from 2.6% in 2022 to 1.5% in 2023 and 
1.4% in 2024, with stronger than expected US 
momentum but weaker than expected growth 
in the euro area. Emerging market and 
developing economies are projected to have 
modestly declining growth, from 4.1% in 2022 
to 4.0% in both 2023 and 2024. Forecasts for 
global growth over the medium term, at 3.1%, 
are at their lowest in decades, and prospects 
for countries to catch up to higher living 
standards are weak. The likelihood of a hard 
economic landing has receded, but the 
balance of risks to global growth remains 
tilted to the downside.

Global inflation was forecast to decline 
steadily, from 8.7% in 2022 to 6.9% in 2023 
and 5.8% in 2024 but is not expected to return 
to target until 2025 in most countries.

(Source: IMF World Economic Outlook, October 2023)

By 2050, the world’s population of people 
aged 60 and older will double, to 2.1 billion. 
The number of people aged above 80 is 
expected to triple between 2020 and 2050, to 
426 million. This places strains on healthcare 
systems and reduces the pool of working age 
people.

Low- and middle-income countries (LMICs) 
are now seeing the greatest population 
changes. By 2050, two thirds of the world’s 
over 60s will live in LMICs, which are also 
disproportionately affected by non-
communicable diseases (NCDs). NCDs kill 
41 million people each year, more than three 
quarters of these in LMICs. 

NCDs represented seven of the 10 leading 
causes of death in 2019 or 74% of deaths 
globally. Cardiovascular (CV) diseases 
account for 17.9 million deaths annually, 
followed by cancers (9.3 million), chronic 
respiratory diseases (4.1 million) and diabetes 
(2.0 million).

but also risks that must 
be managed.

Climate change and 
ecosystem degradation 
impact human health and 
undermine the capacity 
of health systems.

Demand for healthcare 
is increasing and science 
is driving improvements 
in healthcare, but risks

AI has the potential to bring significant 
benefits to the healthcare sector. For example, 
data science and AI can increase productivity 
in research, development and manufacturing, 
helping new medicines to reach patients more 
quickly. For medical professionals, AI can 
improve decision making, reduce errors and 
costs, personalise care plans and enhance 
patient monitoring. AI may also enhance the 
quality and accessibility of healthcare 
services, especially in remote and 
underserved areas. 

However, a survey of chief risk officers by 
the WEF identified concerns about the 
potential harms caused by AI technologies – 
deliberately or inadvertently. More than 90% 
of respondents wished to see an accelerated 
pace of regulation around the development of 
these technologies to ensure the benefits can 
be realised safely. 

(Source: WEF: Chief Risk Officers Outlook July 2023)

Climate change is a threat to human 
wellbeing and planetary health. There is a 
rapidly closing window of opportunity to 
secure a liveable and sustainable future for all. 
Without urgent, effective and equitable 
mitigation and adaptation actions, climate 
change increasingly threatens ecosystems, 
biodiversity, and the livelihoods, health and 
wellbeing of current and future generations.

While demographic and other changes are 
driving an increased demand for healthcare, 
continued advances in science and digital 
technologies are driving healthcare innovation 
and improvements. But risks remain. In 
addition to the downward pricing pressure, 
the sector faces regulatory challenges, loss of 
exclusivity and genericisation, and increasing 
expectations from various stakeholders. 

(Source: Intergovernmental Panel on Climate Change (IPCC) 
Summary for Policymakers of Synthesis Report on Climate 
Change 2023)

To succeed, pharmaceutical companies must 
be able to take advantage of AI and emerging 
technologies. They also need to respond to 
the demands and expectations, and earn the 
trust of patients and caregivers, healthcare 
professionals and health authorities, payers, 
policymakers and others. They need to 
protect themselves against harmful 
misinformation and disinformation, which will 
require collaboration between businesses, 
policymakers and other stakeholders to tackle 
at scale.

Research and development phases – duration: 5-15 years

Launch phase – duration: 5-15 years

1.  Undertake scientific 
research to identify 
potential new medicines.

2.  Preclinical studies in 

laboratory and animals to 
understand if the potential 
medicine is safe to 
introduce into humans. 

3.  Phase I trials with small 
groups of healthy human 
volunteers (small 
molecules) or patients 
(biologics) to understand 
how the potential medicine 
is absorbed into the body, 
distributed and excreted.

4.  Phase II trials on small- to 
medium-sized groups of 
patients to test effectiveness 
and tolerability of the 
medicine and determine 
optimal dose.

5.  Phase III trials in a 

larger group of patients 
to gather information 
about effectiveness and 
safety of the medicine 
and evaluate the overall 
benefit/risk profile.

7.  Launch new medicine while 
continuously monitoring, 
recording and analysing 
reported side effects. 

8.  Post-launch R&D to further 
understand the benefit/risk 
profile of the medicine and 
life-cycle management 
activities to understand 
its full potential.

6.  Seek regulatory approvals 

Post-exclusivity – duration: 20+ years

for manufacturing, 
marketing and selling 
the medicine.

9.  Patent expiry and generic 

medicine entry.

This is a high-level overview of a medicine’s life-cycle and is illustrative only. It is neither intended to, nor does it, represent the life-cycle of any particular medicine or of every medicine discovered 
and/or developed by AstraZeneca, or the probability of success or approval of any AstraZeneca medicine.

1   The patient numbers reached for AstraZeneca medicines is an estimation of the average number of patients on our medicines in a given year. The calculation is based upon the volume that we 
manufacture globally, converted using the number of days of therapy (DoT) and the average patient compliance with their treatment. If a patient is treated by more than one AstraZeneca 
product they are double-counted.

Our Key Performance Indicators and 
remuneration 
We measure our productivity and success 
against our Key Performance Indicators 
(KPIs), which are aligned to our strategic 
priorities. Several KPIs in this section are used 
to measure the remuneration of Executive 
Directors, allowing us to disclose aggregated 
targets without disclosing sensitive 
commercial information at the individual KPI 
level. Any variances between the KPI and 
values used in determining remuneration are 
explained in the Directors’ Remuneration 
Report from page 102. Since 2021, we have 
included the delivery of our Ambition Zero 
Carbon commitments in our executive 
incentive arrangements. 

Achieve Group 
Financial Targets

We have three strategic priorities, whose 
effective delivery will help us achieve our 
financial targets.

Our capital allocation priorities include 
investing in the business and pipeline, 

including potentially value-enhancing 
business development opportunities; 
maintaining a strong, investment-grade credit 
rating; and supporting a progressive dividend 
policy, balancing opportunities for growth 
and maintaining a strong balance sheet.

Our strategy in Oncology
We strive to push the boundaries of 
science to change the practice of medicine 
and transform the lives of patients living 
with cancer through:

1. Scientific platforms to attack cancer from 
multiple angles, including targeting cancer 
cells directly and activating the immune 
system. We use monotherapy and 
combination approaches to drive deeper, 
more durable, responses:
a. Tumour drivers and resistance – targeting 

genetic mutations and resistance 
mechanisms that enable cancer cells to 
survive and proliferate.

b. DNA damage response – targeting the 

DNA repair process to block cancer cells 
reproducing.

c. Antibody Drug Conjugates (ADCs) 

– highly potent cancer-killing agents 
delivered directly to cancer cells via a 
linker attached to a targeted antibody.

d. Epigenetics – targeting changes to 

genome expression caused by cancer.

e. Immuno-oncology – activating the body’s 
own immune system to help fight cancer.
f.  Cell therapies – harnessing living cells to 

target cancer.

g. Immune engagers – redirecting the 

immune system’s T-cells to the tumour 
and amplifying that patient’s own 
anti-cancer immune response.

2. Treating cancer earlier where the greatest 
opportunity for cure exists and building 
expertise and leadership in key tumour types. 

3. Collaborating to harness transformational 
technologies, including computational 
pathology, circulating tumour DNA (ctDNA) 
testing, digital health and data science/AI.
4. Leveraging our global footprint – to make 

cancer therapies available to every eligible 
and appropriate patient.

2023 review – strategy in action
Lung cancer
Scientific advances are strengthening the 
potential of our medicines to offer cure and 
long-term survival in lung cancer with a focus 
on early detection and precision medicine. 
Our comprehensive portfolio includes leading 
medicines Tagrisso, Imfinzi, Imjudo, Enhertu 
and Orpathys, along with a promising pipeline 
of potential new medicines and combinations 
across diverse mechanisms of action. 
AstraZeneca lung cancer data were featured 
in four plenary presentations at major medical 
congresses this year. 

 > Positive results from the FLAURA2 Phase III 
trial showed Tagrisso with the addition of 
chemotherapy demonstrated a statistically 
significant and clinically meaningful 
improvement in progression-free survival 
(PFS) versus Tagrisso monotherapy in 
advanced epidermal growth factor receptor 
mutated (EGFRm) non-small cell lung 
cancer (NSCLC) and was ultimately granted 
Priority Review in the US based on these 
results. Furthermore, positive overall 
survival results from the ADAURA Phase III 
trial showed Tagrisso achieved an 
unprecedented overall survival benefit for 
adjuvant early-stage EGFRm NSCLC, 
becoming the first Phase III trial to 
demonstrate survival benefit in this setting. 

 > We reported positive results from the 

TROPION-Lung01 Phase III trial which 
showed that Dato-DXd demonstrated a 
statistically significant PFS benefit versus 
docetaxel in patients with previously treated 
locally advanced or metastatic NSCLC, and 
a clinically meaningful benefit in those with 
non-squamous tumours. We also reported 
results from TROPION-Lung02 and 
TROPION-Lung04 Phase Ib trials which 
showed Dato-DXd in combination with 
immunotherapy (pembrolizumab or Imfinzi, 
respectively), with or without chemotherapy, 
demonstrated encouraging responses and 
no new safety signals in the 1st-line 
advanced NSCLC setting. Dato-DXd is 
jointly developed and commercialised with 
Daiichi Sankyo. 

Over 30m 

The global burden of cancer is 
expected to grow, with over 30 
million newly diagnosed 
patients estimated by 2040. Two 
thirds of those patients are 
expected to be in low-to-middle 
income countries.

 > Positive Phase III results from the AEGEAN 
Phase III trial showed Imfinzi significantly 
improved event-free survival in patients with 
NSCLC, increasing the time patients lived 
without recurrence or progression before 
and after surgery, and regulatory 
submission was accepted in the US based 
on these results. Additionally, Imfinzi in 
combination with Imjudo was approved in 
the EU for patients with metastatic NSCLC 
based on the POSEIDON Phase III trial. We 
also reported that the PACIFIC-2 Phase III 
trial for Imfinzi concurrently administered 
with CRT did not achieve statistical 
significance for PFS versus CRT alone in 
unresectable, Stage III NSCLC.

 > Enhertu became the first human epidermal 
growth factor receptor 2 (HER2)-directed 
therapy approved in the EU for patients with 
HER2-mutant advanced NSCLC based on 
results from the DESTINY-Lung02 trial. 
Enhertu is jointly developed and 
commercialised with Daiichi Sankyo. 
 > Our novel immuno-oncology bispecific 
development programme continued to 
advance with the initiation of the eVOLVE-
Lung02 Phase III trial investigating 
volrustomig, which simultaneously targets 
PD-1 and CTLA-4, as a 1st-line treatment in 
combination with chemotherapy in 
metastatic NSCLC.

Breast cancer
We are aiming to redefine clinical practice and 
transform outcomes across all subtypes and 
stages of breast cancer. Ultimately, it is our 
ambition to contribute to eliminating breast 
cancer as a cause of death. Our 
comprehensive portfolio of approved 
medicines, including Truqap, Enhertu, 
Lynparza, Faslodex and Zoladex, and 
promising breast cancer medicines in 
development, including Imfinzi, Dato-DXd and 
camizestrant, leverage different mechanisms 
of action to address the biologically diverse 
breast cancer tumour environment. 

 > Positive results from the TROPION-
Breast01 Phase III trial showed that 
Dato-DXd provided a statistically significant 
and clinically meaningful PFS benefit versus 
investigator’s choice chemotherapy for 
patients with inoperable or metastatic 
HR-positive, HER2-low or negative 
metastatic breast cancer previously treated 
with endocrine-based therapy and at least 
one systemic therapy. Updated results from 
the BEGONIA Phase Ib/II trial showed that 
Dato-DXd in combination with Imfinzi 
demonstrated robust and durable tumour 
responses in the 1st-line treatment of 
patients with metastatic triple-negative 
breast cancer. 

 > Our newest Oncology medicine, Truqap, 

was approved in the US in combination with 
Faslodex as the first AKT-inhibitor for 
patients with HR-positive, HER2-negative 
locally advanced or metastatic breast 
cancer with certain gene alterations 
following disease progression or 
recurrence, based on the CAPItello-291 
Phase III trial. The US regulatory submission 
was granted Priority Review in June 2023.
 > Enhertu was approved in the EU and China 

as the first HER2-directed therapy for 
patients with HER2-low metastatic breast 
cancer based on the DESTINY-Breast04 
Phase III trial.

 > Two Phase III trials (CAMBRIA-1 and 

CAMBRIA-2) were initiated to investigate 
camizestrant, our potential next-generation 
selective estrogen receptor (ER) degrader, 
as an adjuvant therapy for patients with 
ER-positive, HER2-negative early 
breast cancer. 

Genitourinary/Gynaecological cancers
In genitourinary cancers, we aim to transform 
treatment paradigms through the delivery of 
innovative treatments to help many more 
patients than today, including establishing 
Lynparza plus abiraterone and prednisone as 
a standard of care (SoC) in 1st-line metastatic 
castration-resistant prostate cancer (mCRPC). 
In gynaecological (GYN) cancers, we will 
continue to redefine survival expectations, 
introducing new medicines beyond ovarian 
cancer across multiple GYN tumours, 
expanding into endometrial with Imfinzi and 
into cervical cancer. 

 > Positive results from the DUO-O Phase III 
trial showed treatment with a combination 
of Lynparza, Imfinzi, chemotherapy and 
bevacizumab demonstrated a statistically 
significant improvement in PFS versus 
chemotherapy plus bevacizumab in patients 
with advanced ovarian cancer without 
tumour breast cancer gene (BRCA) 
mutations. Additionally, results from the 
DUO-E Phase III trial showed that Imfinzi 
plus chemotherapy in combination with 
Lynparza reduced the risk of disease 
progression or death versus chemotherapy 
in advanced or recurrent endometrial 
cancer, becoming the first global Phase III 
trial of immunotherapy plus poly (ADP-
ribose) polymerase (PARP) inhibition to 
demonstrate clinical benefit in this setting.
 > Lynparza plus abiraterone and prednisone 
was approved in the US and Japan for the 
treatment of BRCA-mutated (BRCAm) 
metastatic castration-resistant prostate 
cancer, based on the Phase III PROpel trial.
 > Our next wave of potential new medicines 

includes saruparib, a PARP1 selective agent 
being investigated in combination with 
novel hormonal agents in metastatic 
castrate-sensitive prostate cancer 
(EvoPAR-Prostate01 Phase III trial), and 
volrustomig, a potential new treatment 
being tested in advanced cervical cancer 
(eVOLVE-Cervical Phase III trial).

lung nodules in routine chest x-rays. The solution 
is integrated with medical imaging systems, 
providing real-time malignancy risk score 
indicating risk of lung cancer that can be referred 
for further diagnostics. The technology, which 
has been implemented in 29 countries across 335 
sites and has analysed more than 1.5 million 
chest x-rays (as at December 2023). As part of our 
partnership with the World Economic Forum’s 
EDISON Alliance, we have committed to 
screening five million patients for lung cancer 
risk using AI technology.

 > We initiated an exclusive global licence with 
LaNova Medicines for AZD0305 (LM305), a 
GPRC5D ADC, with the aim to accelerate 
our entry into multiple myeloma.

Pan-tumour
Together with Daiichi Sankyo, we are 
exploring the potential role of HER2-directed 
therapies in treating multiple solid tumour 
types. Positive results from the DESTINY-
PanTumour02 Phase II trial showed Enhertu 
demonstrated clinically meaningful survival 
across multiple HER2-expressing advanced 
solid tumours including either biliary tract, 
bladder, cervical, endometrial, ovarian or 
pancreatic cancers or other tumours. In 
January 2024, Enhertu was granted Priority 
Review in the US for patients with a range of 
metastatic HER2-positive solid tumours. 

Gastrointestinal cancers
We have a broad and robust development 
programme for the treatment of gastrointestinal 
cancers in many stages and disease types, 
including several positive results as well as 
approvals across multiple medicines. 

 > We accelerated our ADC development 

programme, entering an exclusive global 
licence agreement with KYM Biosciences 
to develop AZD0901, a potentially first-in-
class ADC targeting Claudin 18.2, with 
interim results showing promising early 
clinical efficacy.

 > We reported positive high-level results for 

 > For our novel bispecific programme we 

the EMERALD-1 Phase III trial which 
showed Imfinzi, in combination with 
transarterial chemoembolisation (TACE) 
and bevacizumab, demonstrated a 
statistically significant and clinically 
meaningful improvement in PFS versus 
TACE alone in liver cancer patients eligible 
for embolisation. This is the first global 
Phase III trial to show improved clinical 
outcome for systemic therapy in 
combination with TACE in this setting, and 
the trial continues to follow the secondary 
endpoint of overall survival.

 > Positive results from the MATTERHORN 

Phase III trial showed treatment with Imfinzi, 
in combination with standard of care (SoC) 
FLOT neoadjuvant chemotherapy, 
significantly improved pathologic complete 
response versus neoadjuvant 
chemotherapy in gastric and 
gastroesophageal junction cancers.

 > Imfinzi was approved in China for the 1st-line 
treatment of adult patients with unresectable 
or metastatic BTC in combination with 
chemotherapy, based on the TOPAZ-1 
Phase III trial, and in the EU in combination 
with Imjudo for the treatment of patients 
with advanced or uHCC, based on the 
Phase III HIMALAYA trial.

Blood cancers
In haematology, we are using our six scientific 
platforms to develop and test novel 
investigational agents designed to target 
underlying drivers. Calquence, our next-
generation BTK inhibitor, has treated 50,000 
patients globally with approvals in 89 
countries across multiple haematological 
diseases.

 > Calquence was approved for the first time 
in China for the treatment of CLL or SLL, 
based on the ASCEND global Phase III trial 
and a Phase I/II trial in China.

 > The tablet formulation of Calquence was 

approved in the EU for CLL and is designed 
to be co-administered with gastric 
acid-reducing agents, allowing greater 
patient and physician choice.

 > Promising interim results from a Phase I trial 
of AZD0486, a CD19/CD3 next-generation 
T-cell engager, demonstrated a high 
complete response rate in patients with

Our strategy in CVRM
Our ambition is to improve and save lives 
for the millions of people who are living 
with the complexities of CVRM diseases. 

 > The impact of CVRM diseases on people, 
society and our planet is immense and 
growing, yet these diseases remain 
underdiagnosed, undertreated, and their 
interconnections under-recognised. 
 > By understanding their interconnections 
and targeting the mechanisms that drive 
CVRM diseases, we will be able to detect, 
diagnose and treat people earlier and more 
effectively, stop disease progression and 
ultimately pave the way to a cure.

 > AstraZeneca is uniquely positioned to 

improve the outcomes of patients living with 
CVRM diseases today and tomorrow with 
our strong and expanding portfolio and a 
broad, deep and innovative pipeline 
delivered by a talented, passionate and 
diverse team. 

 > We are building the leading CVRM business.

2023 review – strategy in action
Our CVRM strategy is focused on four key 
areas: CV, renal, HF, and metabolic diseases.

Cardiovascular (CV)
CV disease is the leading cause of death and 
is responsible for approximately one third of 
all deaths globally. Our ambition is to reduce 
CV risk by improving hypertension control and 
reducing dyslipidaemia. 

 > We continue to make a difference for 

patients with Brilinta, now approved in more 
than 124 countries for atherosclerosis and 
in 82 countries for high-risk patients with 
history of heart attack. 

 > Andexxa is designed to bind to FXa 
inhibitors and rapidly reverse their 
anticoagulant effect in patients with major 
bleeds. In June, the Andexxa Phase IV 
(Annexa-I) trial stopped early after achieving 
pre-specified efficacy criteria versus usual 
care. The results of the trial have been 
presented at the World Stroke Congress 
and submitted for publication.

 > In February 2023, AstraZeneca completed 

the acquisition of CinCor, focused on 
developing baxdrostat, an investigational 
once-daily medication, for the treatment of 
hard-to-treat hypertension. 

 > There is also a need for new approaches to 
stop progression of atherosclerosis caused 
by dyslipidaemia. AZD0780 is an oral 
inhibitor (oPCSK9) being developed for 
greater ease of use and enhanced 
convenience, aiming to drive reduction in 
LDL-C levels not achievable by statins alone.

Renal
Nearly 850 million people worldwide, or more 
than one in 10 people, are affected by kidney 
disease and more than 90% of people with 
CKD remain undiagnosed. Our ambition in CKD 
is to eliminate progression to kidney failure. 

 > Forxiga is now approved in over 120 
markets for the treatment of CKD. 

 > In November, results from the real-world 
ZORA observational multicountry study 
showed that treating HK with the potassium

Improving diagnosis pathways in 
heart failure
In the UK, we partnered with NHS Greater 
Glasgow and Clyde, the West of Scotland 
Innovation Hub and the University of Glasgow 
on PROJECT OPERA, an initiative designed to 
enhance digital diagnostic pathways for HF. 

In the pilot, PROJECT OPERA led to a reduction 
in echocardiogram waiting times to just six 
weeks from 12 months. Shorter wait times and 
earlier diagnosis can reduce the risk of 
hospitalisation and mortality for patients and 
avert approximately 8kg of CO₂ emissions per 
patient per year. We are now applying these 
learnings to other regions, including the rest 
of the UK, Spain, France, Germany, Mexico 
and China.

image to be updated

binder Lokelma can allow patients with CKD 
or HF to maintain their lifesaving ren-in-
angiotensin-aldosterone system inhibitor 
(RAASi) therapy which can prevent risk of 
progression to end-stage kidney disease. 
ZORA also showed patients were 2.5 times 
more likely to stay on RAASi therapy when 
treated with Lokelma versus those not 
prescribed a potassium binder. 

 > At the American Society of Nephrology 

(ASN) 2023, the Phase IIb data for 
zibotentan/dapagliflozin was presented 
showing significant albuminuria reduction 
versus dapagliflozin alone in patients with 
CKD and proteinuria, supporting progress 
to Ph3 for High Proteinuria CKD.

 > Additional real-world evidence from the 
REVEAL-CKD, OPTIMISE-CKD and 
IMPACT-CKD studies highlighted the urgent 
need to act on the growing global burden 
and underdiagnosis of CKD.

 > In September 2023, the Global Patient 

Alliance for Kidney Health, a community-led 
alliance of 17 patient advocacy 
organisations, was launched with financial 
sponsorship from AstraZeneca.

 > We have an innovative early pipeline in 

renal, with AZD2373 under investigation 
as a precision medicine with the aim of 
preventing progression to kidney failure for 
people genetically at risk of kidney disease 
due to two apolipoprotein L1 (APOL1) alleles.

Heart failure (HF)
HF affects nearly 64 million people globally 
and is closely linked to other CVRM 
conditions. Our ambition is to eliminate HF as 
first cause of hospitalisation and cure HF with 
reduced ejection fraction. 

 > The DELIVER Phase III trial showed that 
Forxiga reduced the risk of CV death or 
worsening HF across all left ventricular 
ejection fractions (LVEF). Forxiga is now 
approved for HF across all LVEF in 91 
markets including the EU, US, China and 
Japan. In August 2023, Forxiga received a 
1st-line recommendation in the 2023 
European Society of Cardiology Treatment 
Guidelines for HF across the LVEF spectrum.

 > Transthyretin-mediated amyloid 
cardiomyopathy (ATTR-CM) and 
polyneuropathy (ATTRv-PN) are progressive 
systemic diseases leading to poor quality of 
life and eventually death. In September 
2023, published results from the NEURO-
TTRansform Phase III trial for eplontersen, a 
potential best-in-class, ligand-conjugated 
antisense oligonucleotide designed to treat 
all types of ATTR, demonstrated sustained 
benefit in the treatment of ATTRv-PN 
through 85 weeks. Together with our 
partner Ionis Pharmaceuticals, we received 
the first regulatory approval for Wainua 
(eplontersen) for the treatment of ATTRv-PN 
in the US in December 2023 with the EU 
and others expected to follow in 2024.

 > Wainua is also currently being evaluated in 
the Phase III CARDIO-TTRansform trial for 
ATTR-CM.

 > Our early pipeline is aimed at targeting key 
mechanisms in HF, including widespread 
inflammation, fibrosis, hypertrophy and 
microvascular dysfunction, as a major 
priority. Mitiperstat (AZD4831) is an 
investigational, oral myeloperoxidase (MPO) 
inhibitor intended to be complementary to 
SoC for patients diagnosed with HF with 
preserved ejection fraction. By targeting 
this key disease driver, the aim is to reduce 
inflammation and fibrosis, thereby increasing 
survival and reducing hospitalisation.

Metabolism
More than 650 million adults are living with 
obesity and the prevalence of diabetes is 
expected to rise to 783 million by 2045. Our 
ambition is to eliminate metabolic 
dysfunction-associated steatohepatitis, 
(MASH, previously NASH) fibrosis as a leading 
cause of liver failure. We also remain 
committed to treat beyond haemoglobin A1C 
in T2D. 

 > Forxiga continues to help patients with T2D 
worldwide with approvals in more than 100 
countries. In June 2023, Xigduo XR 
(dapagliflozin and metformin hydrochloride 
extended-release) was approved in China 
and, in July 2023, Sidapvia (dapagliflozin 
and sitagliptin) was approved in Korea, both 
for the treatment of adults with T2D.

 > With one of the broadest clinical pipelines in 
MASH and cirrhosis, we are investigating 
new therapeutic modalities and precision 
medicine to target genetic drivers of 
disease in MASH to stop or slow disease 
progression.

 > In November, AstraZeneca and Eccogene 

entered into an exclusive licence agreement 
for AZD5004, an investigational oral 
once-daily glucagon-like peptide 1 receptor 
agonist (GLP-1RA) currently in a US Phase I 
clinical trial for the treatment of obesity, T2D 
and other cardiometabolic conditions.

Our strategy in Respiratory & 
Immunology
Our ambition is to transform care in 
respiratory and immune-mediated 
diseases by moving beyond symptom 
control to achieve disease modification, 
remission and, one day, cures for millions 
of patients worldwide.

COPD 
We are working to eliminate COPD as a 
leading cause of death by transforming care 
through our broad portfolio. 

Our strategy is to:
 > Drive earlier diagnosis and prompt 

intervention with the most effective 
therapies to reduce mortality by preventing 
exacerbations and reducing 
cardiopulmonary risk.

 > Advance innovative biology and novel 
therapeutic platforms including next-
generation biologics and orals that will 
enable us to slow disease progression, 
drive disease modification, and reverse the 
structural damage caused by the disease.

Asthma
Our ambition in asthma is to eliminate asthma 
attacks and achieve clinical remission, even in 
people with the most severe asthma. 

Our strategy is to:
 > Establish our anti-inflammatory reliever 

inhaled portfolio as the backbone of care.
 > Drive towards clinical remission with systemic 
biologics, and with pre-biologics for those 
patients not controlled on current therapies.
 > Introduce new modality therapies and bring 
forward precision medicine opportunities.

Immunology
Our ambition is to disrupt immunology by 
focusing on areas of high unmet medical need 
to drive clinical remission and eventually cure.

Our strategy is to:
 > Lead in lupus. 
 > Disrupt in established diseases with 

suboptimal treatment outcomes through 
precision medicine and novel mechanisms 
with a combination of our mid-stage internal 
pipeline and external collaborations, 
targeting diseases such as inflammatory 
bowel disease (IBD) and rheumatoid arthritis. 
 > Invest in future transformative technologies 
with curative potential, such as complex 
biologics and cell therapy.

New Respiratory
We are also moving beyond asthma and COPD 
to address other respiratory diseases with 
significant unmet medical need, including 
severe viral lung infection, interstitial lung 
disease and idiopathic pulmonary fibrosis (IPF).

2023 review – strategy in action
COPD
Breztri, our triple inhaled therapy continues to 
gain market share, demonstrating strong 
volume growth within the growing fixed-dose 
combination triple class across major 
markets. In October 2023, patients received 
their first dose in the ATHLOS Phase III trial 
exploring Breztri’s ability to improve 
parameters that indicate cardiopulmonary 
function in COPD. Breztri is also being studied 
in asthma in two Phase III pivotal trials, 
KALOS and LOGOS.

The OBERON and TITANIA Phase III trials of 
tozorakimab (anti-IL-33 mAb) are ongoing. In 
October 2023, patients received their first 
dose in the MIRANDA Phase III trial of 
tozorakimab.

Decarbonising respiratory care
Chronic respiratory diseases are examples of the growing 
health impact of climate change. Poor air quality and 
extreme weather pose great risks to people living with 
asthma and COPD, and increase the number of people 
developing these diseases. We are dedicated to 
discovering and developing respiratory medicines that 
improve outcomes for patients as well as lowering the 
carbon footprint of respiratory care which stems from the 
use of medicines, doctor visits and hospital care.

Early detection, diagnosis and disease control to avoid 
exacerbations are powerful ways to reduce overall 
healthcare resource utilisation and hospitalisations, and 
thus the carbon footprint of care. In addition to efforts to 
improve outcomes for patients, we are also decarbonising 
respiratory care by transitioning to climate-friendly 
inhaled medicines, moving our entire portfolio to a 
next-generation propellant with near-zero Global 
Warming Potential.

Compounds in early-stage clinical 
development include: 
 > Mitiperstat, a selective MPO inhibitor in 
Phase II. A 10-fold increase in MPO (an 
enzyme associated with oxidative stress) 
concentration is associated with a 40% 
increase of risk of a COPD exacerbation.
 > AZD6793, an oral IRAK4 inhibitor that targets 

many of the key pathways triggered by 
bacterial and viral infections, smoke and other 
environmental factors in COPD patients.

Asthma
Symbicort maintained its position as the 
leading inhaled corticosteroid (ICS)/long-
acting beta2-agonist (LABA) globally by 
volume. Performance has been driven by 
strong growth in Emerging Markets, offset by 
generic erosion in the EU, US and Japan.

In January 2024, Airsupra launched in the US 
for the as-needed treatment or prevention of 
bronchoconstriction and to reduce the risk of 
exacerbations in people with asthma aged 18 
years and older, offering the first and only FDA 
approved anti-inflammatory rescue therapy to 
treat airway obstruction and inflammation 
concomitantly. AstraZeneca entered into a co-
development agreement with Bond Avillion 2 
Development in March 2018 for the 
development of the then drug candidate 
PT027 for asthma in the US. 

Fasenra, our first respiratory biologic has 
reached more than 119,000 patients with severe 
eosinophilic asthma. In April, we announced 
positive results from the MIRACLE Phase III trial, 
an efficacy and safety study of Fasenra in 
patients in Asia with a history of uncontrolled 
severe eosinophilic asthma. A Phase III trial in 
COPD, RESOLUTE, is also ongoing.

continues following approval, gaining market 
share and achieving broad labels and 
reimbursement globally. 

Compounds in early-stage clinical 
development for asthma include:
 > AZD8630, an inhaled fragment antibody 
(inhaled biologic) in co-development with 
Amgen, that targets thymic stromal 
lymphopoietin.

 > Atuliflapon (AZD5718), a precision medicine 

approach in asthma with an oral 
5-lipoxygenase-activating protein (FLAP) 
inhibitor that blocks the 5-lipoxygenase 
pathway, a clinically validated target which 
could offer an alternative for uncontrolled 
patients before becoming eligible for 
systemic biologics.

 > AZD4604, an inhaled JAK1 inhibitor that has 
the potential to block the effects of T2-high 
pro-inflammatory pathways (IL4/13, TSLP) 
and T2-lower pathways (IL6, IL17), many of 
which are poorly responsive to ICS in 
patients with asthma. 

New Respiratory
The TILIA Phase III trial of tozorakimab in 
severe viral lower respiratory tract disease is 
ongoing.

Other compounds in early-stage clinical 
development include: 
 > AZD0292, an anti-pseudomonas 

aeruginosa mAb for the treatment of 
bronchiectasis.

Immunology
Saphnelo continues to grow rapidly during its 
launch phase and in June 2023, was included 
in the 2023 EULAR recommendations for the 
management of SLE, less than two years after 
first launch.

Tezspire is the first and only biologic approved 
for patients with severe asthma with no 
phenotype or biomarker limitation within its 
approved label. Tezspire’s strong performance 

Fasenra’s life-cycle management programme 
includes multiple clinical trials in eosinophilic 
diseases beyond the current severe asthma 

indication. In September 2023, we announced 
positive high-level results from the MANDARA 
Phase III trial which showed that Fasenra met 
the primary endpoint and demonstrated 
non-inferior rates of remission compared to 
mepolizumab in patients with EGPA who were 
receiving oral corticosteroids with or without 
stable immunosuppressive therapy. MANDARA 
is the first head-to-head trial of biologics in 
EGPA, comparing a single injection of Fasenra 
to three injections of mepolizumab, every four 
weeks. Full results from the trial were presented 
in November 2023 at the American College of 
Rheumatology Convergence meeting. 

Compounds in early-stage clinical 
development include: 
 > AZD7798, a CCR9-depleting mAb. CCR9 is 
the main chemokine receptor for trafficking 
lymphocytes to the small intestine and 
considered central to the generation of small 
bowel inflammation in Crohn’s disease.

In June 2023, we announced an agreement 
with Quell Therapeutics to develop, 
manufacture and commercialise engineered 
T-regulator (Treg) cell therapies for 
autoimmune diseases in order to reset 
immune tolerance and drive durable

Our strategy in Vaccines & 
Immune Therapies
We have a portfolio of medicines that 
includes vaccines for COVID-19 
and influenza, long-acting antibodies 
for COVID-19 and RSV, and a pipeline 
of next-generation therapeutics and 
scientific platforms. We are optimising 
the potential of both vaccines and 
antibodies, providing long-lasting 
immunity and supporting sustainable 
and resilient healthcare systems 
worldwide by reducing the burden 
of frequent infectious diseases.

Vaccines
We are engineering next-generation vaccines 
that have the potential to generate potent and 
long-lasting immune responses. 

Advancing our ambition in vaccines, in 
January 2024 we entered a collaboration 
agreement with US-based biotechnology 
company Omniose to research vaccines for 
serious bacterial diseases, and we will have 
exclusive rights to Omniose’s proprietary 
bioconjugation platform for up to three years.

Antibodies
We are pioneering novel approaches to 
develop highly targeted, long-acting antibodies, 
using our half-life extension technology. We 
have significantly accelerated the speed at 
which we are able to identify potent antibody 
candidates, screening billions of antibody 
candidates in a matter of months. This 
complementary approach, with vaccines 
providing potential protection for those able 

to mount their own immune response, and 
antibody therapies for those who cannot, aims 
to ensure quality care for all.

Regulatory applications are currently under 
review in Japan and other countries.

2023 review – strategy in action
Our Vaccines & Immune Therapies strategy 
is focused on reducing the burden of 
respiratory infections, including RSV, hMPV, 
COVID-19 and influenza.

Respiratory syncytial virus
Beyfortus is a single dose long-acting 
antibody (LAAB), developed and 
commercialised from an alliance between 
AstraZeneca and Sanofi, using AstraZeneca’s 
proprietary YTE half-life extension technology. 
In April 2023, AstraZeneca, Sobi and Sanofi 
updated and simplified their contractual 
arrangements relating to the development and 
commercialisation of Beyfortus in the US.

In July 2023, Beyfortus was approved in the 
US for the prevention of RSV LRTD in 
newborns and infants born during or entering 
their first RSV season, and for children up to 
24 months of age who remain vulnerable to 
severe RSV disease through their second RSV 
season. In the US, Beyfortus is the first 
approved and recommended immunisation to 
prevent severe RSV disease in all infants 
under eight months by the CDC Advisory 
Committee on Immunization Practices.

In January 2024, Beyfortus was approved in 
China for the prevention of RSV LRTI in 
neonates and infants entering or during their 
first RSV season and is anticipated to be 
available during the upcoming 2024 to 2025 
RSV season. 

Since its initial approval in 1998, Synagis has 
become a global SoC for RSV prevention and 
helps protect at-risk babies against RSV. In 
February 2023, new cost-effectiveness 
analysis of Synagis for the prevention of RSV 
infection in otherwise healthy Canadian 
infants born at 29-35 weeks’ gestational age, 
was presented at the 7th Respiratory 
Syncytial Virus Foundation Conference in 
Lisbon, Portugal.

Our agreement with Sobi for the rights to 
Synagis in the US remains ongoing.

In December 2023, AstraZeneca announced 
an agreement to acquire Icosavax, to bolster 
the Vaccines & Immune Therapies pipeline 
with a potential first-in-class, Phase III-ready, 
combination vaccine against RSV and hMPV, 
using an innovative, protein virus-like particle 
platform. 

COVID-19
AZD3152 is an investigational next-generation 
LAAB being developed to potentially protect 
vulnerable patients such as the 
immunocompromised from COVID-19, given 
that they may not have any other non-vaccine 
option. In July 2023, AstraZeneca shared 
positive high-level results from the Phase I 
safety cohort of the ongoing SUPERNOVA 
Phase I/III COVID-19 prevention trial, which 
showed that AZD3152 was generally 
well-tolerated and displayed 
pharmacokinetics consistent with Evusheld 
through to day 29. AstraZeneca licensed 
AZD3152 from RQ Biotechnology in May 2022.

Working to bring medicines to patients faster
Immunobridging is an approach to a clinical trial 
used to infer effectiveness of a new drug or 
vaccine candidate through an accepted surrogate 
measure for efficacy. Immunobridging trials – 
which are well-established for testing vaccines 
– can help accelerate access to important new 
therapies, without compromising tolerability. 

AstraZeneca is helping to lead the way with 
innovative immunobridging trials to accelerate 
access to next-generation monoclonal antibodies 
for COVID-19, where alternatives to running large 
efficacy trials are especially important given the 
rapid pace of viral evolution and the need to 
potentially protect those at highest risk for 
severe disease.

image to be updated

In October 2023, AstraZeneca announced 
new data from two extensive real-world 
evidence studies, which highlighted that 
immunocompromised people continue to face 
significant and disproportionate burdens from 
COVID-19, with substantially higher rates of 
severe COVID-19 outcomes compared to the 
general population. The INFORM and EPOCH 
studies were published in Lancet Regional 
Health Europe and Current Medical Research 
and Opinion, respectively. Data from INFORM 
were presented at the 12th Annual IDWeek 
Conference.

Evusheld is a LAAB combination for the 
pre-exposure prophylaxis (prevention) and 
treatment of COVID-19. All Product Sales in 
2023 were derived from sales of Evusheld in 
the first quarter. 

Vaxzevria was co-invented by the University 
of Oxford. Through a landmark agreement in 
2020, Vaxzevria was developed and 
distributed by AstraZeneca at cost during the 
pandemic. Total Revenue for COVID-19 
medicines (Vaxzevria and COVID-19 mAbs) 
declined significantly in 2023, due to the 
fulfilment of Vaxzevria contracts.

Emergency Use Authorisation, based on 
positive results from the SUPERNOVA 
sub-study, was submitted in the US for the 
investigational LAAB sipavibart for pre-
exposure prophylaxis of COVID-19 in an 
immunocompromised patient population.

The International Immunocompromised 
Advocacy Network, an independent, 
community-led network of more than 44 
patient advocacy organisations, was launched 
in October 2023 with initial financial 
sponsorship from AstraZeneca.

Influenza
Fluenz Tetra/FluMist Quadrivalent is a live 
quadrivalent vaccine, given as an intranasal 
spray. It is the first and only commercial 
intranasal flu vaccine that offers a needle-free 
alternative to traditional flu vaccinations. This 
year marked the 20th anniversary since the 
first regulatory approval of FluMist/Fluenz. 

In February 2023, AstraZeneca entered into 
an agreement with the US Government’s 
Department of Defense via the Medical 
Chemical, Biological, Radiological and 
Nuclear Defense Consortium to develop a 
ribonucleic acid (RNA)-based universal 
pandemic influenza vaccine. As part of this 
agreement, AstraZeneca will receive up to 

approximately $80 million over three years to 
develop the vaccine from preclinical research 
through a Phase I/II clinical study.

In March 2023, Japan’s Ministry of Health, 
Labour and Welfare approved FluMist 
Quadrivalent for children aged two to 18 
years. Daiichi Sankyo holds rights to FluMist 
Quadrivalent in Japan.

In October 2023, the FDA accepted for review 
the Supplemental Biologics Licence
Application (sBLA) for a self- or caregiver-
administration option for FluMist Quadrivalent.

Therapy Area Review 
Rare Disease 
continued

2023 review – strategy in action
Sustained leadership in complement
Alexion was the first company to translate the 
complement system into transformative 
medicines. We are continuing that legacy of 
leadership across multiple disease areas, 
leveraging AstraZeneca’s established footprint 
and expanding our global presence through 
Centres of Excellence to reach patients with 
high unmet medical need.

2023 performance was underpinned by 
consistent, durable and strong business 
growth, driven by continued patient demand 
in gMG, a progressive, neuromuscular disease 
which can impact mobility, speech and 
breathing, together with launches in new 
markets and successful conversion from 
Soliris to Ultomiris across shared indications.

Beyond Soliris and Ultomiris
We are developing a broad portfolio of 
potential medicines that target various 
components of the complement system, with 
opportunities to pursue indications across a 
wide range of therapeutic areas of interest, 
including haematology, nephrology, neurology 
and ophthalmology.

We are exploring the ability to treat earlier-line 
and broader gMG patient populations in a 
Phase III trial with gefurulimab (ALXN1720), a 
next-generation C5 inhibitor that is self-
administered subcutaneously.

We are also evaluating potential treatments for 
certain rare nephrology conditions, including 
ALXN2030, an investigational small interfering 
RNA targeting the complement C3 protein.

The EU and Japan approved our long-acting 
C5 inhibitor Ultomiris for the treatment of 
adults with NMOSD, a progressive 
autoimmune disease that impacts the central 
nervous system. With no relapses observed in 
the pivotal CHAMPION-NMOSD trial, 
Ultomiris marks a significant advance for 
NMOSD patients, offering dosing every eight 
weeks and the potential to live relapse-free. 
Regulatory reviews for Ultomiris for the 
treatment of NMOSD are ongoing in additional 
countries, including the US.

We have further expanded access to our 
first-in-class C5 inhibitor Soliris for patients 
with rare neurological diseases; Soliris has the 
potential to improve outcomes and quality of 
life for these patients and their families. Soliris 
has been approved in the EU and Japan for 
certain paediatric patients with refractory 
gMG, and was approved in China for the 
treatment of certain adults with gMG and 
certain adults with NMOSD.

Additional clinical trials of Ultomiris are 
ongoing in several disease areas where the 
complement pathway is thought to play a role, 
including Phase III trials in haematopoietic 
stem cell transplant-associated thrombotic 
microangiopathy and in cardiac surgery-
associated acute kidney injury. Following 
review of high-level results, we made the 
decision to discontinue a Phase II/III clinical 
trial evaluating Ultomiris in adults with 
dermatomyositis. No new safety findings were 
observed, and the safety data are consistent 
with the established safety profile of Ultomiris.

Factor D inhibition
We have a robust portfolio of investigational 
medicines that inhibit the complement protein 
Factor D, including small molecule oral assets 
with potential broad application across 
several disease areas.

Voydeya (danicopan) received the first-ever 
regulatory approval in Japan for the treatment 
of a subset of adults with PNH to be used in 
combination with C5 inhibitor therapy. The 
approval of Voydeya, a first-in-class, oral, 
Factor D inhibitor, was based on the positive 
results from the pivotal ALPHA Phase III trial; 
results from the 12-week primary evaluation 
period of the trial were published in The 
Lancet Haematology. Voydeya was developed 
as add-on to proven SoC Ultomiris or Soliris 
to address the needs of the subset of patients 
(approximately 10-20%) with PNH who 
experience clinically significant extravascular 
haemolysis (EVH) while treated with a C5 
inhibitor. Regulatory submissions for Voydeya 
are currently under review with multiple global 
health authorities.

Alexion is also evaluating Voydeya in an 
ongoing Phase II trial as a potential 
monotherapy for geographic atrophy, a 
chronic and progressive eye disease.

Additional investigational, oral Factor D 
inhibitors in clinical development are:

 > Vemircopan (ALXN 2050) in ongoing 
Phase II clinical trials in a number of 
rare diseases.

 >  ALXN2080 in an ongoing Phase I trial.

70 countries 

Our Rare Disease medicines 
are now approved in 70 
countries.

Expanding beyond complement
We have continued to expand our rare disease 
focus with novel assets for non-complement 
mediated diseases.

Amyloidosis is a group of complex rare 
diseases, with varying types and severities. 
Alexion and AstraZeneca are advancing the 
industry’s largest amyloidosis pipeline, across 
a broad range of modalities, to address the 
spectrum of patient need across multiple 
disease subtypes. 

Amyloid light chain (AL) amyloidosis
In AL amyloidosis, misfolded abnormal 
proteins build up and form toxic amyloid 
deposits in organs throughout the body 
(including the heart and kidneys), causing 
significant organ damage and failure that may 
ultimately be fatal.

Anselamimab (CAEL-101), a potentially 
first-in-class fibril-reactive mAb for the 
treatment of AL amyloidosis, is currently being 
evaluated in the Cardiac Amyloid Reaching for 
Extended Survival (CARES) Phase III clinical 
programme in combination with SoC therapy 
in AL amyloidosis. Two parallel Phase III trials 
in patients with Mayo Stage IIIa and Stage IIIb 
disease, respectively, are ongoing.

Transthyretin amyloidosis (ATTR)
ATTR cardiomyopathy (ATTR-CM) is a 
systemic, progressive and fatal condition that 
leads to HF and a high rate of fatality within 
four years from diagnosis.

Alexion holds an exclusive licence from 
Neurimmune to develop and commercialise 
ALXN2220 (NI006), an investigational mAb 
that specifically targets misfolded 
transthyretin. ALXN2220 is designed to 
directly address the pathology of ATTR-CM by 
enabling removal of amyloid fibril deposits in 
the heart, with the potential to treat patients 
with advanced ATTR-CM.

Positive Phase I results were published in the 
New England Journal of Medicine for 
ALXN2220 in the treatment of patients with 
ATTR-CM and HF, indicating a favourable 
safety profile as well as a substantial 
reduction of cardiac amyloid deposition over a 
12-month period, and a Phase III trial of 
ALXN2220 is underway.

Positive high-level results from the Japan 
Phase III trial of acoramidis (ALXN2060) in 
adults with ATTR-CM showed consistency to 
those in the global BridgeBio ATTRibute-CM 
Phase III trial, including survival, cardiac-
related hospitalisations and other measures 
of improved functions and quality of life at 
30 months. Alexion holds an exclusive 
licence from BridgeBio’s subsidiary, Eidos 
Therapeutics, Inc., to develop and 
commercialise acoramidis in Japan; this 
trial in Japan was conducted to support 
local registration.

Thousands of diseases – including 
80% of known rare diseases – are 
believed to be caused by a genetic 
mutation. Genomic medicines are 
designed to treat or cure these 
diseases through the addition, 
alteration or inactivation of the 
malfunctioning gene. Supported by 
recent strategic acquisitions, 
investments and collaborations, 

Alexion and AstraZeneca are 
uniquely positioned to advance 
an industry-leading suite of 
next-generation genomic 
medicines and platforms, with 
the objective to develop innovative 
therapies with improved safety 
and efficacy profiles.

Hypophosphatasia (HPP)
HPP is a rare, genetic metabolic disease 
characterised by impaired bone 
mineralisation, muscle weakness and other 
systemic manifestations of the disease, which 
can lead to death in infants and significant 
disability at any age.

Neurofibromatosis Type 1 (NF1) Plexiform 
Neurofibromas (PN)
NF1 PN is a rare, progressive, genetic 
condition impacting multiple body systems 
characterised by benign tumours called 
plexiform neurofibromas, which develop 
along nerve sheaths throughout the body.

We completed a Phase I trial in adult patients 
with HPP for efzimfotase alfa (ALXN1850), our 
next-generation alkaline phosphatase enzyme 
replacement therapy. Efzimfotase alfa is 
designed to help reduce the treatment burden 
for patients via more convenient dosing and 
subcutaneous administration. A Phase III trial 
has been initiated to evaluate efzimfotase alfa 
in adolescent and adult HPP patients who 
have not previously been treated with Strensiq.

In May 2023, Koselugo was approved in China 
for paediatric patients with NF1 and PNs.

Wilson disease
We announced the difficult decision to 
terminate the ALXN1840 programme in Wilson 
disease based on review of results from 
Phase II mechanistic trials and discussions 
with regulatory authorities. 

Rare cancers
Rare cancers account for approximately 27% 
of cancer deaths and have a lower five-year 
survival rate than most common cancers, 
representing a significant unmet medical 
need. For example, glioblastoma is a rare 
brain cancer that is almost always fatal, with a 
five-year overall survival rate of less than 10% 
following diagnosis. We are partnering with 
colleagues across AstraZeneca to follow the 
science and identify opportunities where we 
can leverage our expertise and infrastructure 
to deliver transformative outcomes for patients.

pipeline progressions, we focus on both 
near-term and longer-term delivery. Phase II 
NME starts ensure the ongoing robustness 
and future stability of the pipeline (and 
reflect the outcome of nearer-term strategic 
investment decisions). Phase III investments 
measure assets that will deliver nearer-term 
value (and reflect the outcome of longer-term 
strategic investment decisions). Submission 
and approval metrics demonstrate the 
advancement of this innovation through 
filing and approval in four major markets 
(US, EU, China and Japan).

Our R&D resources 
Our strategic R&D centres
The Discovery Centre in Cambridge, UK, is 
located in a bioscience hotspot and is now 
occupied by more than 2,000 employees 
working in drug discovery and development 
across our therapy areas. Gaithersburg is our 
largest R&D site in the US and our presence in 
Maryland contributes to the state’s economy 
while supporting the growth of the life 
sciences industry. Supporting the entire 
life-cycle of our medicines, our Gothenburg 
site facilitates interactions between drug, 
device, diagnostics and digital health 
companies in a growing life science 
ecosystem. 

In 2026, we plan to begin the phased 
occupation of our new strategic R&D centre 
and Global Alexion headquarters in Boston. 
The centre is located in Kendall Square, at the 
heart of one of the world’s top biotech 
research and technology innovation centres. 

Our centre in Shanghai recognises the 
importance of the China market to our future 
growth and our focus on bringing Chinese 
innovation to the world.

Investing in R&D
In 2023, R&D expenditure was $10,935 million 
(2022: $9,762 million; 2021: $9,736 million), 
including Core R&D costs of $10,267 million 
(2022: $9,500 million; 2021: $7,987 million). In 
addition, we spent $2,530 million on acquiring 
product rights (such as through in-licensing) 
(2022: $2,051 million; 2021: $27,042 million). 
We also invested $212 million on the 
implementation of our R&D restructuring 
strategy (2022: $111 million; 2021: $223 
million). Allocations of spend by early- and 
late-stage development are shown in the chart 
to the left.

2023 investment increased to support our 
late-stage portfolio: in Oncology, 
camizestrant, volrustomig and our ADC 
portfolio; in BioPharmaceuticals, Breztri/
Trixeo and tozorakimab. The Eccogene 
agreement exclusively licensed AZD5004, 
with spend on the programme and trial 
planning. COVID-19 investment continued 
with AZD3152 SUPERNOVA trial for 
prophylaxis and treatment options. 
We also invested in new modalities and 
technologies with acquisitions of Pfizer 
genomic assets, Neogene and the Cellectis 
cell therapy agreement.

Our R&D in 2023
In 2023, we continued to progress our 
science, focusing on four key areas of 
transformative science. Our scientists 
published 808 manuscripts with 158 in 
‘high-impact’ peer-reviewed journals, each 
with an impact factor exceeding 15 (Thomson 
Reuters five-year impact factor score). The 
ongoing high impact continues to reflect 
the quality of, and drive to share, our science.

Enhancing our understanding 
of disease biology
Advancing our understanding of disease 
biology is helping uncover novel drivers for 
the diseases we aim to prevent, treat and in 
the future, cure. Selecting the right target 
remains the most important decision in 
drug discovery.

2023 developments included:
 > Demonstrating the power of combining 

genomics with proteomics to discover how 
rare changes in genes affect plasma 
proteins by using data from more than 
50,000 individuals in the UK Biobank. This 
study, published in Nature, is the largest of 
its kind.

 > Together with academic and 

biopharmaceutical industry partners, we 
launched Together For Change, a 10-year 
initiative to close the gap on historical 
health care inequities, education and 
training by building more diversity in genetic 
research, accelerating education pathways, 
and improving genomic tools for people of 
African ancestry.

 > Publishing in several high-impact journals, 
including Nature, reflecting our progress 
in understanding the role that tumour-
associated myeloid cells with 
immunosuppressive properties play in 
poor patient outcomes and in treatment 
resistance in cancer.

 > Establishing a new world-class functional 
genomics laboratory with the Medical 
Research Council and the Milner 
Therapeutics Institute at the University of 
Cambridge to accelerate drug discovery 
and further the UK’s global genomics 
leadership. Innovative collaborations such 
as this allow us to share resources and 
expertise to advance science for the 
benefit of patients.

 > Working with Ad Scientiam to develop 
digital biomarkers to improve symptom 
tracking for rare neurological and 
neuromuscular diseases.

Creating the next generation 
of therapeutics
We continue to design new ways of targeting 
the drivers of disease. The diversity of 
technologies applied in our early pipeline is 
exemplified by the increased number of new 
modalities entering clinical development, 
including ADCs, antibodies (e.g. bispecific, 
inhaled fragment, cell depleting monoclonal), 
cell therapies, genomic medicines, PROTACs, 
oligonucleotides and T-cell engagers.

2023 developments included: 
 > Advancing novel engineered Treg cell 
therapies designed to induce durable 
immune tolerance as a potential cure for 
serious immune-mediated diseases. This is 
being explored in type-1 diabetes (T1D) and 
inflammatory bowel disease (IBD) in a new 
strategic collaboration with Quell 
Therapeutics. 

 > Demonstrating the strength of our 

proprietary ADC technology by advancing 
AZD9592 (epidermal growth factor receptor 
(EGFR) cMET bispecific) and AZD5335 (FR ) 
into the clinic.

 > Advancing our ambition to bring cell 

therapies to solid tumours by disclosing 
two novel CAR-Ts – AZD0574 (STEAP2) and 
AZD6422 (Claudin 18.2) – designed utilising 
our innovative armouring technology to 
resist the immunosuppressive tumour 
microenvironment, and progressing our first 
T-cell receptor therapies – NT-125 (fully 
individualised) and NT-175 (TP53) – into the 
clinic through Neogene.

 > Accelerating our cell therapy and genomic 
medicine ambitions in areas of high unmet 
medical need across oncology, immunology 
and rare diseases, via a collaboration and 
investment agreement with Cellectis to 
leverage gene editing technologies and 
manufacturing capabilities, via the 
proposed acquisition of Gracell, which 
includes a clinical-stage autologous 
BCMA/CD19 CAR-T therapy targeting 
haematologic malignancies and autoimmune 
diseases and a proprietary cell therapy 
manufacturing platform, and via the 
acquisition of a portfolio of preclinical 
rare disease gene therapies from Pfizer.

Better predicting clinical success 
of our candidate drug molecules
We are adopting a range of cutting-edge 
technologies, generating data that are more 
relevant to patients than previous methods, 
to help us predict the clinical effectiveness 
of our candidate drug molecules.

2023 developments included:
 > Collaborating with Verge Genomics to more 
efficiently identify and validate therapeutic 
targets for rare diseases by leveraging 
Verge’s AI-enabled platform trained on 
patient tissue samples.

 > Under our collaboration with GRAIL, new 
data showed the promise of the GRAIL 
methylation assay for detecting residual 
disease in blood cancer following 
treatment, with potential to inform early 
intervention strategies.

 > Collaborating with Qureight to leverage 
imaging data analytics and AI models to 
better understand how patients with rare 
and complex lung diseases could respond 
to novel drugs. 

 > Pioneering the use of Quantitative 

Continuous Scoring (QCS), our novel, 
fully automated computational pathology 
solution, within our clinical trial portfolio. Early 
clinical studies have shown that QCS can 
identify the right patient populations suitable 
for targeted therapies, such as ADCs.
 > Publishing findings in Advanced Science 
that show our ability to develop novel 
microphysiological systems that can 
combine multiple cell types and reproduce 
the structures of functioning organs to 
accurately recreate key aspects of kidney 
biology in the lab for the first time.

Pioneering new approaches 
to engagement in the clinic
We are pioneering clinical innovation to design 
and deliver patient-centric clinical trials that 
improve the patient and site team experience 
while optimising the use of data, digital and AI 
to improve patient outcomes in clinical trials 
and beyond.

2023 developments included:
 > Publishing in Nature Medicine our 6R 

framework for implementing digital health 
technology in clinical trials based on 
qualitative research. This showed how 
technology is enabling a shift from the 
traditional physical site-based trial model, 
reducing the burden on patients and trial 
sites and enabling continuous data 
collection while driving more innovative 
trial designs. 

 > Collaborating with existing UK NHS lung 
cancer screening programmes, research 
sites and investigators to identify COPD 
patients eligible for clinical trials. The 
initiative also strengthens our 
understanding of factors contributing to 
resilience and early disease development. 
 > Launching Evinova to bring to market digital 
health solutions that are science-based, 
evidence-led and human-experience 
driven. Evinova will prioritise digital 
solutions to optimise clinical trial design 
and delivery.

Bioethics

BV

‘Bioethics’ means ethical issues 
arising from the study and practice 
of biological and medical science. 
Our key principles are set out in 
our Global Standard.

Driving innovation in clinical trials
We are pioneering new approaches to clinical 
trials. By integrating data science, digital health 
technology and AI, we focus on clinical 
innovation to transform study design, improve 
patient outcomes, accelerate timelines, reduce 
burdens on patients and trial teams, and 
improve environmental sustainability.

Clinical trial transparency
We believe that transparency enhances the 
understanding of how our medicines work, 
which benefits patients. We publish information 
about our clinical research, as well as the 
registration and results of all our interventional 
clinical trials and most non-interventional trials 
for all products – regardless of whether the 
results are favourable. This includes 
completed trials for marketed medicines, 
drugs in development and drugs where 
development has been discontinued.

As of 31 December 2023, AstraZeneca had:
 > Shared anonymised individual patient-level 

data from 270 unique studies.

 > Responded to 364 requests from external 

Research use of human biological 
samples and genomic information 
We use human biological samples and 
genomic information for research into better 
understanding of diseases, improved 
diagnosis, and other healthcare improvements, 
as well as for the research and development 
of new medicines. We are committed to 
minimising the use of human foetal tissue 
(hFT) through scientific advancements. 
Permission is granted only when no other 
scientifically reasonable alternative is 
available, or there is a regulatory requirement. 
There were two new hFT approvals in 2023. 
To date, eight projects using hFT have been 
approved, and three projects are ongoing.

AstraZeneca is committed to the 3Rs 
(Replacement, Reduction and Refinement of 
animals in research) and has programmes to 
accelerate the development of new approach 
methodologies, which have potential to 
reduce and eventually replace the need for 
animals. We focus on robust experimental 
design and analysis to ensure the fewest 
animals are needed to achieve scientific 
objectives, with our scientists refining 
procedures and applying high standards 
of animal care.

Animals were needed for in-house studies 
122,768 times in 2023 (100,803 in 2022), and 
on our behalf in contract research studies 
59,690 times (53,377¹ in 2022). In total, over 
97% were rodents or fish, with the majority 
being mice (84%). The remainder is made up 
of rabbits, camelids, ferrets, dogs, pigs, 
non-human primates, chickens and sheep. 
Dogs and non-human primates make up less 
than 1% of the total. AstraZeneca does not 
conduct research using wild-caught non-
human primates or great ape species.

AstraZeneca is committed to transparency 
and is signatory to the Concordat on 
Openness on Animal Research (UK), the 
Openness Agreement on Animal Research 
and Teaching (Australia/New Zealand) and is 
contributing to the U.S. Animal Research 
Openness Initiative.

AstraZeneca has an animal welfare assurance 
programme that ensures research conducted 
by third parties meets our high standards.

Development pipeline overview

2023 was another remarkable year for 
pipeline development. We achieved 56 
regulatory events, either submissions 
or approvals for our medicines in 
major markets, including three NME 
first	approvals.

Green Labs 
Through	our	Green	Labs	programme	and	
My	Green	Lab	accreditation,	we	are	reducing	
the environmental impact of our lab operations 
by engaging scientists and changing mindsets 
to design, develop and deliver new medicines 
in the most sustainable way.

This performance is backed by a healthy 
pipeline of high-potential medicines, with a 
total of 30 pipeline progression events, either 
NME Phase II starts or Phase III investment 
decisions, indicating our ability to deliver 
longer-term sustainable growth.

Our pipeline comprises 178 projects, of which 
160 are in the clinical phase of development. 
We have 17 NME projects in pivotal trials or 
under regulatory review, compared with 15 at 
the end of 2022. Also in 2023, 31 NMEs 

progressed to their next phase of development 
and 18 projects were discontinued: eight for 
poorer than anticipated safety or efficacy 
results and 10 as a result of a strategic shift 
in the environment or portfolio prioritisation.

Accelerating our pipeline 
We are prioritising our investment in specific 
programmes, focusing on scientific innovation. 
As a result, we received 10 Regulatory 
Designations (Breakthrough Therapy, Priority 
Review or Fast Track) for eight new medicines 

that offer potential to address unmet medical 
need in certain diseases. We also secured 
Orphan Drug Designation for the development 
of six medicines to treat rare diseases.

The Inflation Reduction Act (IRA) of 2022 was 
passed to address affordability concerns. 
Farxiga has been selected in the first round 
of negotiations under the IRA, with the price 
taking effect in 2026, which is the same year 
we expect to lose exclusivity, and the impact 
is therefore expected to be manageable. We 
are evaluating our portfolio to understand 
timings associated with the potential inclusion 
of other medicines in future negotiations. We 
have a diversified product portfolio providing 
a broad spectrum of treatments in different 
therapy areas, allowing access for patients in 
need of our innovative medicines.

Europe
The total European pharmaceutical market 
was worth $248 billion in 2023. We are the 
seventh-largest prescription-based 
pharmaceutical company in Europe (see 
market definitions on page 232) with a 3.3% 
market share of pharmaceutical sales by 
value. Total Revenue was $9,611 million, up 
10% (8% at CER).

Our regions 
We strive to meet our growth and profitability 
goals through commercial excellence in each 
of our global reporting regions.

US 
As the tenth-largest prescription-based 
pharmaceutical company in the US, we have a 
3.6% market share of US pharmaceuticals by 
sales value. Total Revenue increased by 6% in 
2023 to $19,077 million, driven by the 
continued growth of our Oncology medicines 
and Farxiga. Recent launches in heart failure 
and chronic kidney disease drove an increase 
in market share. 

The US healthcare system is complex. 
Multiple payers and intermediaries influence 
patient access to branded medicines through 
regulatory rebates in government programmes 
and voluntary rebates paid to managed 
care organisations and pharmacy benefit 
managers for commercially insured patients. 
Significant pricing pressure is driven by payer 
consolidation, restrictive reimbursement 
policies and cost control tools, such as 
exclusionary formularies and price protection 
clauses. Many formularies employ ‘generic 
first’ strategies and/or require physicians to 
obtain prior approval for the use of a branded 
medicine where a generic alternative exists.

$5,099 million, with sales in Japan down 10% 
(3% at CER) to $3,705 million.

Emerging Markets 
With Total Revenue of $12,025 million, up 2% 
(9% at CER), AstraZeneca was the second-
largest multinational pharmaceutical 
company, as measured by prescription sales, 
and the fifth fastest-growing top 10 
multinational pharmaceutical company in 
Emerging Markets in 2023. 

In China, AstraZeneca is the largest 
pharmaceutical company in the hospital 
sector, as measured by sales value. In 2023, 
Total Revenue increased by 1% at actual rate 
of exchange (7% at CER) to $5,876 million 
(2022: $5,792 million). Roxadustat and Lokelma 
were renewed in the National Reimbursement 
Drug List (NRDL) and Xigduo, Tagrisso 
(ADAURA), Lynparza (PAOLA-1), Calquence, 
Soliris and Koselugo achieved listing for the 
first time. Since the implementation of VBP, 
several AstraZeneca brands have been 
impacted. In the most recent cycles of VBP 
implementation, Faslodex and Plendil were 
included. Additional AstraZeneca brands are 
expected to be included in future VBP cycles. 
There was some impact on demand in the 
second half of the year, mainly with oncology 
products, following the government anti-
corruption campaign announced in July 2023.

We were shocked following the Russian 
invasion of Ukraine in February 2022 and, 
since then, have provided practical support to 
ensure the safety, health and wellbeing of our 
employees. As a healthcare business, we are 
doing everything possible to ensure medical 
supply chains continue to operate and that 
patients in both countries are able to access 
our medicines, while complying with sanctions 
imposed on Russia.

Healthcare in low- and middle-
income countries  BV
AstraZeneca is committed to building resilient 
and sustainable health systems and improving 
equitable access to healthcare. By working 
collaboratively, we remove barriers to care 
and support the development and delivery of 
healthcare, particularly in low- and middle-
income countries. We also adapt our 
programmes to suit local health systems and 
communities, contributing to health system 
capacity and resilience through training, 
education, prevention and early detection and 
diagnosis.

AstraZeneca in Japan 
We are the second-largest prescription-based 
pharmaceutical manufacturer with a 6.1% value 
market share of Innovative Branded 
pharmaceutical sales by value, and have gained 
recognition as being a great place to work by the 
Great Place to Work Institute.

Pricing and value of our medicines 
Increasing demand for healthcare means 
increasing pressure on health system 
budgets. This shift results in price and 
reimbursement restrictions in many markets. 
These pressures also result in movement from 
primary to speciality care, including rare 
diseases, which comprise a growing share 
of our portfolio. This pricing pressure, coupled 
with higher rates of inflation, means that we 
are unable to pass on the full impact of 
price increases.

In 2023, we identified four confirmed external 
breaches across our Commercial business 
(2022: 10). There were 3,758 instances 
(instances can involve multiple people) of 
employee and third-party non-compliance 
with our policies (2022: 2,872). A total of 296 
employees and third parties were removed 
from their role as a result of a breach 
(2022: 147) and 2,968 received warnings 
(2022: 3,326). We brief our Audit Committee 
quarterly on breach statistics, serious 
incidents and corresponding remediation.

Pricing for our medicines seeks to reflect 
the value they bring to patients, payers and 
society, and the significant investment 
required for targeted treatment options. In our 
discussions with national, regional and local 
stakeholders, we base our pricing policies on 
four principles: sustainability, value, access 
and flexibility. We collaborate with payers to 
conclude innovative outcomes and value-
based reimbursement models that improve 
patient outcomes and enable access to 
medicines across key therapeutic areas and 
geographic regions. We also offer a number of 
patient assistance programmes that help 
increase patients’ access to medicines and/or 
healthcare by reducing their cost burden.

Responsible sales and marketing  BV
As outlined in the Code of Ethics on page 49, 
we are committed to high ethical standards. 
Our compliance professionals advise on, and 
monitor, adherence to our Code and policies, 
and work with local staff to ensure we meet 
our ethical standards. 

Nominated signatories review product 
promotional materials and activities to ensure 
compliance with applicable regulations and 
codes of practice, and that information is 
accurate and balanced. Group Internal Audit 
conducts audits of selected marketing 
companies. 

Breaches primarily consist of low-impact 
incidents. We continue to foster a culture 
where employees can speak their minds, 
with strong first-line oversight (and related 
reporting) as well as targeted second-line 
monitoring to identify concerns early, and 
use learnings to improve our programme.

Anti-bribery and anti-corruption  BV
We do not tolerate bribery or any other form of 
corruption. Preventing bribery and corruption 
are a focus of our third-party risk management 
and due diligence processes, as well as our 
monitoring and audit programmes. We reinforce 
our commitment to ethical business conduct 
through our annual Code of Ethics training, 
which is delivered to all employees and 
relevant third parties.

Growth and Therapy Area Leadership

Operations 

Our manufacturing and supply 
function continued to support our 
growth and pipeline, demonstrating 
excellence in product launches, 
quality and supply, with focus on 
progressive, sustainable processes.

Ensuring quality and compliance 
As outlined in our Code of Ethics on page 49, 
we are committed to high ethical standards. 
As members of the International Federation 
of Pharmaceutical Manufacturers and 
Associations (IFPMA) and the European 
Federation of Pharmaceutical Industries 
and Associations (EFPIA), we adhere to 
their codes. 

Managing our supply chain 
During 2023, the world environment continued 
to be volatile and uncertain. The geopolitical 
events, trade sanctions, regulatory changes 
and high inflation are types of challenges 
that continue to require rapid operational 
responses. We continued to successfully 
meet our responsibilities to patients ensuring 
supply of our life-saving medicines with 
robust supply chain operations and reduced 
end-to-end supply lead times. We delivered 
increased demand and growth opportunities 
with flexibility and agility. As the regulatory 
environment evolves post COVID-19, 
AstraZeneca continues to deliver industry-
leading quality performance. FDA recall data 
from 2020 to 2023 showed that AstraZeneca 
had zero recalls during this period.

Supply chain finance 
AstraZeneca has a supply chain finance 
programme to support the cash flow of our 
external supply base. The programme is 
managed by Taulia Inc. (with funding provided 
by some of the Group’s relationship banks) 
and provides suppliers with visibility of 
invoices and payment dates via a dedicated 
platform. Suppliers can access this platform 
free of charge and have flexibility to select 
individual invoices for early payment. On 
election of an early payment, a charge is 
incurred by the supplier based on the period 
of acceleration, central bank interest rate and 
the rate agreed between Taulia Inc. and each 
supplier. All early payments are processed 
by the funders and AstraZeneca settles the 
original invoice amount with the funders at 
maturity of the original invoice due date. The 
programme operates in the US, UK, Sweden 
and Germany. As at 31 December 2023, the 
programme had 432 suppliers enrolled and 
a potential early payment balance of 
$112 million. We have a separate programme 
in China with 29 suppliers enrolled and a 
potential early payment balance of $11 million.

In 2023, we made strong progress against our 
Operations 2025 strategy, focused on scaling 
our capabilities to support business growth, 
leveraging the benefits of new manufacturing 
technology and digital innovation:

 > Delivered 282 launches across major markets.

Responsible supply chain  BV
All employees and contractors who source 
goods and services on behalf of AstraZeneca 
are expected to follow our Global Standard 
for Procuring Goods and Services. Through 
assessments and improvement programmes, 
including our third-party risk management 
system, we monitor supplier compliance with 
our published Global Standard on 
Expectations of Third Parties and Code of 
Ethics. In 2023, we conducted 47 audits (2022: 
42) on high-risk commercial suppliers 
(external manufacturing partners) to ensure 
appropriate practices and controls. Of these, 
50% fully met our expectations while 45% had 
improvement plans for minor instances of 
non-compliance. There were two audits 
indicating a high risk to AstraZeneca and 
action has been taken to mitigate these 
supply and/or reputational risks. We also use 
EcoVadis scores to assess and improve 
supplier sustainability performance.

Our Sustainable Procurement Programme 
embeds responsible sourcing practices and 
promotes ethical behaviour, aiming to achieve 
100% ethical spend with suppliers who share 
our Values. This fosters their progress on 
sustainability, enables us to innovate together 
and accelerates supplier diversity. Our 
Supplier Diversity Programme maximises 
opportunities for small and diverse 
businesses to be part of our value chain and 
supports their growth. In 2023, we reached 
our ambition to have active supplier diversity 
programmes in 10 countries outside the US by 
2025, with Switzerland, Ireland and Canada 
joining Brazil, South Africa, the UK, Australia, 
New Zealand, Poland and Sweden.

Global manufacturing capability 
Our principal tablet and capsule formulation 
and packing sites are in the UK, Sweden, 
China, Puerto Rico and the US, with local 
supply sites in Egypt, India, Japan and Russia, 
and regional supply sites in Brazil, Indonesia, 
France and Mexico. We also have major 
formulation sites for the global supply of 
parenteral and/or inhalation products in the 
US, Sweden, France, Australia and the UK. 
Most of the manufacture of active 
pharmaceutical ingredients (APIs) is delivered 
through the efficient use of external sourcing 
that is complemented by internal capabilities. 
For biologics, our principal commercial 
manufacturing facilities are in the US, 

 > Progressed our investments in 

manufacturing technologies, new modalities 
and digital innovations.

 > Five sites within the network – Nijmegen, 

Cairo, Cikarang, Lomas Verdes and 
Cotia – have delivered a 98% reduction 
in Scope 1 and Scope 2 GHG emissions 
(from 2015 baseline) measured against 
science-based targets.

Sweden, the UK and the Netherlands. Our 
network contains capabilities in process 
development, drug substance, drug product 
manufacturing and distribution, including 
global supply of mAbs and influenza vaccines. 

In January 2023, we finalised the sale of our 
West Chester site in Ohio, US, to National 
Resilience, Inc. This enabled the continued 
supply of AstraZeneca medicines produced 
at the site to patients, as well as continued 
employment for more than 500 people 
working at the site. We continue to pursue 
growth opportunities in China. In March 2023, 
we announced plans for a new facility in 
Qingdao to manufacture pressurised 
metered-dose inhalers (pMDIs) for respiratory 
products. In May 2023, AstraZeneca leased a 
facility in Rockville, Maryland, US. This facility 
will be fitted out for cell therapy manufacture 
to support clinical and commercial supply. In 
October 2023, we announced our intent to exit 
our supply site in Bangalore, India. 

Alexion has internal manufacturing facilities 
and also works with third-party contract 
manufacturers to supply clinical and 
commercial quantities of our products and 
product candidates. Our internal manufacturing 
capability includes a fill/finish facility at our 
Athlone site and a packaging and labelling 
facility at our Dublin site. Our drug substance 
manufacturing capabilities are shared 
between Athlone and Dublin and we have a 
large-scale drug substance facility in Dublin.

At the end of 2023, we employed 15,609 
people at 27 Operations sites in 16 countries.

Additional Information

We are already realising the value of our 
investments in AI, machine learning and deep 
learning to transform the way we work and 
accelerate drug discovery. For example, our 
patent optimiser tool helps our chemists 
identify the best molecules faster to support 
patent protection for our scientific 
breakthroughs. Our scientists and AI 
engineers use these technologies when 
solving chemistry, biology, pathology and 
clinical business problems.

Our investments in AI and new solutions also 
improve how we launch new medicines and 
help transform patient outcomes. We are 
deploying these technologies to enhance the 
healthcare provider experience, expand our 
patient assistance programmes and improve 
how patients navigate the health ecosystem 
to manage their care. For example, our Rare 
Disease therapy area uses data and AI to 
identify patients, drive early diagnoses and 
accelerate their treatment in areas of high 
unmet medical need.

We have created a robust, in-house 
programme for generative AI, identifying 
eight architecture patterns that cover use 
cases across AstraZeneca. This framework, 
which will be rolled out in 2024, ensures we 
are addressing the ethical, data privacy, 
legal and procurement requirements needed 
to fully leverage this new technology in a 
responsible way. 

In Operations, we continue to automate our 
manufacturing facilities to drive productivity 
improvement through optimising material and 
information flow, increasing process yields 
and driving right first time quality. For 
example, one of our global ‘digital lighthouse’ 
sites in Wuxi, China has already achieved top 
decile performance in quality, speed and 
performance through the use of an integrated 
Lean Digital approach.

We ensure robust governance via the 
enterprise data office, which empowers the 
enterprise data council to strengthen the 
Group’s data governance. This approach 
ensures that our data policies and standards 
are streamlined, clear and effective.

Our ongoing commitment to training helps our 
teams take full advantage of fast-developing 
new technologies to deliver innovation at pace 
across the organisation. This includes 
partnering with our HR and Learning & 
Development teams to upskill the entire 
organisation to help maximise the benefits of 
generative AI. We also invest in talent at our 
Global Technology Innovation Centres in 
Guadalajara, Mexico and Chennai, India as we 
prepare to scale our business for future 
growth.

Accelerating the delivery of enhanced value 
in Global Operations
Innovative technology platforms will transform 
the way new medicines are developed, 
manufactured and launched. Integrating digital 
solutions, data science and AI with continuous 
manufacturing platforms will enable shorter 
lead times, increased productivity and a 
reduced environmental impact.

that values and rewards innovation, 
entrepreneurship and outstanding 
performance.

Unlocking the potential of our people 
Our award-winning coaching strategy helps 
employees learn, adapt and grow.

Performing as an enterprise team 
Building diverse talent and critical capabilities
In 2023, we successfully completed the 
integration of Alexion employees into 
AstraZeneca by:

 > Migrating 4,900 employees from Alexion 

to AstraZeneca. 

 > Transitioning more than 100 employees 

from Alexion to AstraZeneca as a result of 
portfolio realignments.

Creating a culture of high performance
Since the removal of performance ratings in 
2021, our primary focus has shifted towards 
coaching, development and the contributions 
of our employees. To aid managers in 
developing their teams, we deliver 80 
performance development workshops each 
year. So far these have been attended by over 
14,000 line managers. The effectiveness of 
our performance approach can be seen in the 
completion rate of end-of-year insights. In our 
2023 performance development cycle, 96% of 
employees and 97% of managers successfully 
completed their year-end insights promoting 
accountability and goal alignment, and 
enabling fair and objective evaluation.

An essential element of our performance 
development approach is the provision of 
continuous recognition. In 2023, 535,979 
rewards were distributed to 87% of employees 
through our recognition platform. Notably, 
24% of these awards were cross-functional, 
highlighting the collaborative and cohesive 
nature of our organisation. 

Listening to our workforce
Listening to our workforce is important in 
ensuring AstraZeneca continues to be a great 
place to work and we encourage employees 
to speak their minds. In 2023, feedback 
mechanisms included onboarding surveys, 
exit interviews and our global employee 
engagement survey. The results of our 
engagement survey are shared with the 
Board of Directors, Senior Executive Team 
(SET), line managers and employees to 
ensure full transparency.

Key highlights: 

 >  92% participation in global engagement 

survey.

 > 89% of employees stated they believe 

strongly in AstraZeneca’s future direction 
and key priorities.

 > 89% of employees stated they had at least 
one development discussion with their 
manager.

 > In exit interviews, more than 92% of 
employees who left said they would 
consider working at AstraZeneca again.
 > We received an average rating of 4.6 out 

of five from successful hires in our 
Candidate Experience survey.

Advancing a culture of lifelong learning 
and development
Central to our success is ensuring our 
employees, managers and teams have the 
potential to develop and grow. We develop 
capabilities through targeted and inclusive 
development programmes, from early talent 

to enterprise leaders. Our digital learning 
portal supports a continuous learning mindset 
that drives a high-performing and innovative 
organisation. 

Key 2023 highlights demonstrating our 
progress:

 > Invested $33.7 million in the upskilling of our 
employees, an average spend of $376 per 
employee.

 > 2,040,956 total learning hours, an average 

of 17.7 hours per employee.

 > 69% of employees accessed our global 

learning platform.

 > 4,401 attendees across our development 

experiences (up 9% since 2022).
 > 88% of employees believe they have 

improved their existing skills, learned new 
skills or had a development opportunity.

Our development programmes build 
capabilities for the future, helping us to unlock 
potential, drive innovation and foster an 
inclusive culture, building diverse future 
leaders.

Of our 2023 development experience 
attendees, 21% were identified as succession 
candidates for at least one position and 73% 
of our programme participants are women. 
The resignation rate for employees who went 
through a development programme is 8.3%, 
compared to 10% for AstraZeneca overall.

Human rights  BV  
Our human rights principles support the basic 
rights of all people, such as the right to health, 
freedom from slavery, and privacy. Our Code 
of Ethics, Human Rights Statement and 
Expectations of Third Parties commit us to 
respecting and promoting international human 
rights, both within our own operations but also 
our wider spheres of influence. This includes 
working only with third parties who share our 
approach. To that end, we integrate human 
rights considerations into our processes and 
practices. We are also committed to ensuring 
that there is no modern slavery or human 
trafficking in our value chains, or any part of 
our business. Our human rights policies are 
designed to ensure we consider the impact of 
our operations including our interactions with 
third parties on human rights. The output 
of our work to mitigate human rights risks is 
detailed in our Modern Slavery Statement 
which is published annually. We provide 
assurance annually to the Audit Committee.

Employee relations  BV
Our Employee Relations function takes a 
global approach to employment principles 
and standards, local laws and good practice. 
Our ambition is to build a positive and safe 
working environment for employees through 
global policies and processes. To achieve this, 
our Employee Relations function works in 
partnership with Legal, Compliance, HR and 
Employee Representative groups, such as the 
European Consultation Committee, works 
councils and unions. According to our biennial 
Human Rights survey, the most recent of 
which was carried out in 2022, 45% of our 
countries have a relationship with trade unions. 

Champions of inclusion and diversity
Our global commitment to inclusion and 
diversity (I&D) is woven into everything we do, 
and is reflected in our Values and the 
behaviours that underpin them.

Women comprise 53.9% (approximately 
47,800) of our global workforce. At the end 
of 2023, there were six women on our Board 
(46.2% of the total). Following the retirement 
of Katarina Ageborg in January 2023 and the 
appointment of Sharon Barr as Executive 
Vice-President, BioPharmaceuticals R&D in 
August 2023, five out of 12 SET members 
(41.7%) were women at the end of the year. 
Mene Pangalos will be retiring in early 2024. 

Our employees represent a diverse range of 
backgrounds, coming from 179 countries. In 
2023, to promote inclusion and diversity, we 
have established the Global Inclusion and 
Diversity Ambassador Group, which is led by 
senior leaders and sponsored by our CEO. 
This group reflects the diversity of our global 
workforce and organisational structure. They 
are responsible for collaborating with local 
leaders to customise approaches that address 
local needs and drive progress towards our 
global inclusion and diversity commitments.

Our Board of Directors and the SET conduct 
biannual and quarterly reviews, respectively, 
of our workforce composition, covering 
gender, ethnicity and age representation. In 
the US, where we have more comprehensive 
data available, 36.7% of our workforce identify 
as an ethnic minority (2022: 35.7%). In 2023, 
we rolled out pay equity training to all line 
managers of US-based employees to ensure 
equitable reward and compensation.

We are committed to hiring and promoting 
talent ethically and in compliance with

Sustainability

BV

Sustainability at AstraZeneca means 
harnessing the power of science and 
innovation, and our global reach, to 
build a healthy future for people, 
society and the planet. 

Overview
We seek to create value beyond the impact 
of our medicines by embedding sustainability 
into everything we do – from the lab to the 
patient – and by supporting health system 
resilience to make sustainable healthcare 
available to all.

During 2023, we were recognised for our 
efforts across all our sustainability priorities, 
including:

 > AstraZeneca received a rating of AA (on a 

scale of AAA-CCC) in the MSCI ESG 
Ratings assessment.

 > Included in Dow Jones Sustainability Index 
Top 20% of 2,500 of the world’s largest 
companies and in Europe Index.

 > Listed in Financial Times European Climate 

Leaders for the third consecutive year.

 > Included in Forbes World’s Top Companies 

for Women.

Driving emissions reductions with clean heat 
and renewable energy 
The research, development and production of 
medicines is an energy intensive process. We are 
decarbonising our operations as we transition to net 
zero: in the UK and in the US, we will use renewable 
natural gas, or biomethane, to supply clean heat to 
our sites.

Our approach to sustainability
Our Purpose to push the boundaries of 
science to deliver life-changing medicines is 
underpinned by our commitment to contribute 
sustainably to people, society and the planet. 
As a global business, we are playing our part 
by operating ethically and responsibly, and 
helping tackle the biggest challenges of our 
time, including climate change, biodiversity 
loss and global health equity. These challenges 
are interdependent and require collaboration 
to be successfully addressed, implementing 
a variety of approaches across a network of 
relationships. By working together to find 
science-based solutions, we believe we can 
drive real change and build a better future.

Benchmarking and assurance
We contribute to key global environmental, 
social and governance (ESG) performance 
evaluations, recognising the value of 
independent third-party assessment and 
insights. Our performance is also assessed 
independently based on the information and 
data we make publicly available. Bureau 
Veritas has provided limited independent 
assurance for the sustainability information 
contained within this Annual Report and Form 
20-F. Assurance is in accordance with the 
International Standard on Assurance 
Engagements (ISAE) 3000 (Revised) and ISAE 
3410 Assurance Engagements on Greenhouse 
Gas (GHG) Statements.

Governance
Our sustainability strategy is developed by the 
SET, which reviews our sustainability scorecard 
quarterly, and is approved by the Board. Our 
Board Sustainability Committee monitors 
the execution of the sustainability strategy, 
overseeing the communication of our activities 
with stakeholders, and providing input to the 
Board and other Board Committees as required.

Additional Information

Access to healthcare  BV
We want to secure a future where all people 
have access to affordable, sustainable and 
innovative healthcare, throughout the patient 
care pathway, from prevention, early detection 
and diagnosis, to the effective treatment of 
disease. We are working to remove barriers, 
deliver innovative medicines and strengthen 
health system infrastructure and resilience 
through global and local partnerships, across 
all our focus areas.

Achievements in 2023
 > We reached more than 66 million people 

(cumulatively) through access to healthcare 
programmes.

 > Healthy Heart Africa trained more than 

11,300 healthcare workers (cumulatively) 
and conducted more than 47 million 
screenings (cumulatively) for elevated blood 
pressure.

 >  Young Health Programme directly reached 

more than 15 million young people 
(cumulatively) and trained over 580,000 as 
Peer Educators since launch in 2010 in 
more than 40 countries.

 >  We reached more than 13 million people 
(cumulatively) through our patient access 
programmes, enabling sustainable access 
to AstraZeneca medicines in around 25 
countries, most of which were low- and 
middle-income countries.

Equitable access
Your health should not be determined by who 
you are, where you live or where you were 
born. We are working to remove barriers to 
healthcare and give everyone the chance to 
be as healthy as possible.

Diversity in clinical trials
We are committed to designing clinical 
programmes with equity at the forefront, from 
idea inception to patient care. Our approach is 
patient-centric, data-driven and science-led. 
We are improving the diversity of clinical trial 
participants with strong data foundations, 
tools and standards for aligning and tracking 
progress, and external partnerships. We work 
with industry groups, regulatory agencies, and 
local community groups to shape clinical trial 
diversity policies for the future, while 
delivering for patients today.

Rare diseases
More than 10,000 rare diseases are estimated 
to exist today, but fewer than 10% have 
approved treatment options. Rare disease 
community members face many unique 
challenges in pursuing equitable access to 
healthcare, such as significant delays in 
diagnosis, greater chances of hospitalisation 
from preventable conditions, scheduling and 
travelling to appointments, and accessing 
available treatments. 

We believe people with rare diseases deserve 
the same attention and investment to find 
and access therapies as anyone else. 

As we expand the geographies where our rare 
disease medicines are available, we continue 
to build relationships with patient communities 
early in our development programmes to 
better understand their needs. We focus on: 
increasing clinical trial diversity; developing 
improved data collection processes to enhance 
our understanding of how rare diseases affect 
specific patient populations; improving access 
to diagnostic tools; and supporting efforts to 
improve the experience of those participating 
in our clinical trials. We also supply medicines 
for rare diseases through patient support and 
access programmes.

Improving access to digital solutions
Through our A.Catalyst Network innovative 
partnerships, we are harnessing the latest 
technologies to improve patient outcomes, 
make healthcare more accessible and 
personalised, and drive efficiencies in health 
systems. As participants in EDISON Alliance’s 
One Billion Lives Challenge, we aim to screen 
five million patients for lung cancer risk by 
2025, using AI-based technology in 
collaboration with Qure.ai. 

Affordability and pricing
We are committed to addressing barriers to 
access and affordability. Industry, policymakers 
and payers need to work together to identify 
solutions. Through collaborations, partnerships 
and stakeholder coalitions, we are working to 
ensure essential and innovative medicines 
become more widely available.

Health system resilience
Sustainable healthcare for all requires stronger 
health systems to deliver an infrastructure 
designed to be resilient, inclusive and 
responsive to the needs of the population it 
serves. We are investing in ground-breaking 
global collaborations, driving multisectoral 
policy and action, empowering local 
partnerships and fast-tracking innovation to 
expand access to higher quality healthcare.

Partnership for Health System Sustainability 
and Resilience (PHSSR)
The PHSSR is a non-profit, multisector, global 
collaboration with a unified goal of building 
more sustainable and resilient health systems, 
active in more than 30 countries. PHSSR has 
commissioned over 20 research reports to 
date, providing independent, evidence-based 
recommendations to strengthen health 
systems and facilitate cross-border best-
practice sharing, working with national 
experts with first-hand experience.

In 2023, PHSSR published its second 
Summary Report with insights from 
18 countries, and launched research on seven 
new Asia-Pacific countries. PHSSR also 
established an EU expert advisory group, to 
support EU policymakers in improving policies 
on prevention and early detection of NCDs. By 
fostering joint learning and action through 
high-level stakeholder engagement at over 

40 global, regional and national platforms, the 
PHSSR catalysed efforts to strengthen health 
systems around the world. 

Healthy Heart Africa programme
Our Healthy Heart Africa programme is 
committed to reducing hypertension and 
the burden of cardiovascular disease, aiming 
to reach 10 million people with elevated blood 
pressure across Africa by 2025. We work with 
local and global partners to raise awareness 
and offer training, screening and reduced cost 
treatment, where applicable. In 2023, the 
programme launched in eight of 10 planned 
grant countries, in addition to the existing 
nine countries of operation.

Young Health Programme
The multi award-winning Young Health 
Programme (YHP) aims to empower young 
people to make more informed choices about 
their health and catalyse a global, youth-led 
advocacy movement, supported by 
community programmes and research. It 
helps to develop young leaders and is focused 
on vulnerable and under-resourced 
communities in 40 countries. Through 
partnerships with more than 60 non-profit 
partners around the world including UNICEF, 
the YHP promotes health literacy and policy 
action. In 2023, the YHP won the Better 
Society Award for Partnership with an 
International Charity together with UNICEF. 

Community investment
Community investment at AstraZeneca is built 
upon the principles of equity, transparency 
and partnership, working together to build 
healthy and resilient communities. In 2023, 
we contributed $115.4 million in financial and 
non-financial donations, (including product 
donations), to more than 810 non-profit 
partners across 76 countries. We also 
donated $4.7 billion (2022: $3.1 billion) of 
medicines through patient assistance 
programmes around the world, the largest 
of which is our AZ&Me Prescription Savings 
Program in the US. 

Product donation programmes
In 2023, we gave $7.5 million (2022: 
$12.1 million) in product donations for disaster, 
humanitarian relief and public health need. 
We are committed to working with all health 
system stakeholders to enable the supply of 
medicine to patients and to support the 
resilience and recovery of healthcare facilities 
in vulnerable communities.

Longer-term targets:

Environmental protection  BV
A healthy environment is critical for human 
health and health system resilience, already 
impacted by climate change and the 
degradation of ecosystems. Science-led 
climate action and investments in nature and 
biodiversity are vital to improving health 
outcomes and proactively managing our 
environmental impact.

Through our Natural Resource Efficiency Fund, 
we have invested approximately $175 million in 
environmental efficiency innovations since 
2015. This, together with other central capital 
investments, has seen a further $36.6 million 
spent in 2023, including 72 new projects.

Achievements in 2023
 >  67.6% reduction in Scope 1 and 2 GHG 

emissions since 2015.

 > 17.5% reduction in energy consumption 

since 2015.

 > 19.9 million trees planted by AZ Forest 

since 2020.

 > 19.5% reduction in water usage and 13.2% 

reduction in our waste since 2015.

 > 99% safe API discharges for AstraZeneca 
sites and 94% safe API discharges for 
globally managed first-tier supplier sites.
 > 97.6% of paper-based product packaging 
materials used in 2022 (data collated in 
2023) confirmed as supplied from 
sustainable sources.

Ambition Zero Carbon
Approximately 5% of global GHG emissions 
come from the healthcare sector. We are 
accelerating the delivery of net-zero 
healthcare and our own progress towards net 
zero, as one of the first companies to have our 
Scope 1, 2 and 3 targets verified under the 
Science-Based Targets initiative Net-Zero 
Corporate Standard.

Near-term targets:

 > 98% absolute reduction in Scope 1 and 2 

GHG emissions by 2026 from 2015 baseline, 
maximising transition to electric vehicles in 
our road fleet (EV100) by end of 2025 and 
using 100% renewable energy (RE100) for 
electricity and heat by end of 2025.

 > Reduce energy consumption by 10% and 
double energy productivity (EP100) from 
2015 to 2025.

 > Launch first next-generation respiratory 
inhalers with near-zero climate impact 
propellant from 2025.

 > 95% of our suppliers by spend covering 

purchased goods and services and capital 
goods, and 50% of our suppliers by spend 
covering upstream transportation and 
distribution and business travel, will have 
science-based targets (SBTs) by 2025.

 > 50% reduction in total Scope 3 GHG 

emissions by 2030 and 90% reduction by 
2045, from 2019 baseline.

 > Carbon negative for all residual emissions 
from 2030 and science-based net zero 
by 2045.

 > Transition to next-generation respiratory 
inhalers with near-zero climate impact 
propellant across our portfolio by 2030.
 > Plant and maintain 200 million trees by 

2030, through our global AZ Forest initiative.

Our goal of becoming carbon negative across 
our value chain from 2030 recognises that 
total emissions from value chain partners are 
significantly larger than from our own direct 
operations. We are embedding net-zero 
assessments into our existing and future 
product portfolios, engaging our suppliers 
to reduce their direct emissions through to 
2030 and identifying carbon removal options.

Product sustainability
People and the planet will benefit from those 
medicines that have the smallest possible 
environmental impact, yet maintain the highest 
efficacy and safety standards. As 
technologies and healthcare systems evolve, 
so should solutions to reduce the use of 
energy, water and material, as well as waste 
and pollution generated from designing, 
manufacturing and delivering medicines to 
patients. We are using a data-driven approach 
through our Life Cycle Assessment (LCA) and 
Product Sustainability Index programmes to 
address the largest contributor to our Scope 3 
emissions: our product value chains.

In 2023, we continued to focus on the 
next-generation propellant transition for pMDI 
products in our respiratory portfolio. The new 
propellant HFO-1234ze(E) has up to 99.9% 
lower GWP than propellants currently used in 
respiratory medicines. As essential, life-saving 
medicines for millions of respiratory patients 
globally, they are strategically important to our 
business and a key product-related element 
of Ambition Zero Carbon. In 2023, project 
milestones achieved included further Phase III 
investment decisions, a harmonised, global 
development programme, readouts of pivotal 
studies and initiation of key registration studies.

As part of our commitment to drive thought 
leadership and innovation to manage 
pharmaceuticals in the environment, we lead 
the Innovative Health Initiative PREMIER 
project, a partnership between the European 
Commission and the EFPIA. We are 
developing tools to identify potential 
environmental risks of APIs and make data 
more accessible to all stakeholders. In 2023, 
PREMIER published an evidence-led 
prioritisation of environmental data generation, 
aiming to reduce reliance on fish studies. 

Natural resources
The conservation and sustainable use of 
natural resources and the protection and 
restoration of ecosystems are vital for a 
healthy future and to tackle the environmental 
drivers of disease. We are investing in nature 
to benefit planetary and societal health, while 
working towards sustainable resource use, 
water security and halting and reversing 
biodiversity loss.

Our targets aim to decouple water use and 
waste generation from business growth and 
to minimise environmental impacts from our 
supply chain and operations, supported by 
efficiency projects, collaboration with suppliers 
on responsible sourcing, designing out waste 
and pollution, and landscape restoration 
targets via AZ Forest.

Circular economy
Adopting circular business approaches and 
implementing efficient processes to develop 
and produce our medicines are key to reducing 
natural resources used in our value chains. 
We are leveraging our experience with Lean 
manufacturing and embedding best practices, 
working with organisations such as My Green 
Lab. In 2023, we introduced a new internal 
Site Waste Circularity Rate metric to drive 
improvements through increased recycling 
and the external reuse or repurposing of 
waste materials across all our sites.

Water stewardship
We continue to work with key stakeholders, 
including our ongoing collaboration with the 
World Wide Fund for Nature Sweden. Starting 
in 2024, we will invest $5 million per year to 
fund nature restoration and water stewardship 
projects in the communities where we operate. 

AZ Forest
In 2023, we announced an increase in our 
investment to $400 million in our global AZ 
Forest programme, to plant 200 million trees 
by 2030 and ensure their long-term survival. 
This includes new or expanded projects in 
Brazil, India, Vietnam, Ghana, Rwanda and 
Kenya, which will contribute to our climate 
action, promote the restoration of biodiversity 
and natural habitats, and build community 
resilience. The programme is expected to 
restore more than 100,000 hectares 
worldwide, positively impacting an estimated 
80,000 livelihoods and local communities. We 
are led by guiding principles that provide a 
baseline for project design and a consistent 
approach that follows the science. We do not 
purchase land for reforestation or own the 
trees, but have the rights to carbon 
certificates generated by some projects. In 
2023, we planted over nine million trees using 
locally-appropriate species.

EU Taxonomy Disclosure  BV

Assessment
The EU Taxonomy (Regulation (EU) 2020/852) 
and associated Delegated Acts represent 
an evolving reporting framework. The EU 
Taxonomy (Taxonomy) is a classification 
system for sustainable economic activities. 
An economic activity is Taxonomy-eligible if it 
is described in the Taxonomy Delegated Acts. 
An economic activity is Taxonomy-aligned 
if it makes a substantial contribution to one 
or more of the specified environmental 
objectives, meets specified Do-No-
Significant-Harm criteria, and is carried out 
in compliance with specified minimum social 
safeguards. In 2023, the EU adopted the new 
Environmental Delegated Act, which includes 
pharmaceutical activities.

Information prepared under this disclosure 
is consistent with our Consolidated Financial 
Statements for the year ended 31 December 
2023, and comparatives, prepared under the 
basis of preparation detailed in our Group 
Accounting Policies on page 152. 

Capital expenditure (Capex) was assessed for 
Taxonomy-eligibility on a project basis. 
Operating expenditures (Opex) were assessed 
for Taxonomy-eligibility based on the nature of 
expense. Taxonomy-alignment assessments 
were conducted on an activity level, based on 
our Global Standards and Policies. No activity 
was assessed as fully Taxonomy-aligned in 
2023. Double-counting was avoided by 
reconciliation to underlying financial records.

Interpretation of the EU Taxonomy is required 
and company-specific assumptions are 
required to fulfil the reporting requirements. 
Since no activity was assessed as fully 

Taxonomy-aligned, we have set out our 
required disclosures in a simplified format 
below as the prescribed table formats relating 
to alignment disclosures are not applicable.

Revenue
The Taxonomy-eligible Revenue KPI is defined 
as Taxonomy-eligible Revenue divided by 
Total Revenue, which corresponds to ‘Total 
Revenue’ in our Consolidated Statement 
of Comprehensive Income as detailed on 
page 148.

The Group’s revenues are wholly derived from 
the business of pharmaceuticals, which we 
accordingly consider in total for Taxonomy-
eligibility under the activity ‘Manufacture of 
medicinal products’. Consequently, our 
Taxonomy-eligible Revenue KPI for the 
year ended 31 December 2023 is 100% 
(2022: 0%). Last year, our business activity 
of pharmaceuticals was not covered by the 
EU Taxonomy.

Capital expenditure
The Taxonomy-eligible Capex KPI is defined 
as Taxonomy-eligible Capex divided by Total 
Capex. 

 >  Taxonomy-eligible Capex is capex related 
to assets or processes associated with 
Taxonomy-eligible activities. Purchase of 
intellectual property, marketing and 
distribution rights over medicinal products 
is considered in total for Taxonomy-
eligibility under the activity ‘Manufacture of 
medicinal products’.

 > Total Capex corresponds to the total of the 
‘Additions through business combinations’ 
and ‘Capital expenditure’ movement types 

as detailed in Note 7 – Property, plant and 
equipment (page 169), the total of the 
‘Additions – separately acquired’ and 
‘Additions through business combinations’ 
movement types as detailed in Note 8 – 
Leases Right-of-use assets (page 170), and 
the total of the ‘Additions – separately 
acquired’ and ‘Additions through business 
combinations’ movement types as detailed 
in Note 10 – Intangible assets (page 172).

The Group’s Taxonomy-eligible Capex KPI for 
the year ended 31 December 2023 is 83% 
(2022: 14%). 

Operating expenditure
The Taxonomy-eligible Opex KPI is defined as 
Taxonomy-eligible Opex divided by 
Taxonomy-defined Opex. 

 > The Group’s Taxonomy-eligible Opex is 

expenses related to assets or processes 
associated with Taxonomy-eligible 
economic activities. R&D expenses are 
considered in total for Taxonomy-eligibility 
under the activity ‘Manufacture of medicinal 
products’. 

 > The Group’s Taxonomy-defined Opex is the 
total of R&D expenses, and other direct 
non-capitalised costs that relate to building

Our commitment to climate change
We support the Task Force on Climate-related 
Financial Disclosures (TCFD) framework. As 
such, we have made disclosures within the 
Annual Report consistent with the four TCFD 
recommendations, the 11 recommended 
disclosures and all sector guidance, and in 
compliance with the requirements of Listing 
Rule 9.8.6R(8) of the UK Financial Conduct 
Authority (FCA) and in compliance with 
sections 414CA and 414CB of the Companies 
Act 2006 and amended by The Companies 
(Strategic Report) (Climate-related Financial 
Disclosure) Regulations 2022. Pages 51 to 53 
set out the required disclosures in more detail 
and explain where further information can 
be found – for example methodology and 
results – including documents outside this 
Annual Report. 

We have applied the TCFD framework since 
2020, initially focusing on the most significant 
risks and opportunities, with plans to include 
medium- and low-risk areas indicated by 
section. All our business operations worldwide 
are in scope unless otherwise stated.

Potential impact

To future-proof our business and build 
resilience to ensure long-term financial 
sustainability and the continued supply of 
medicines to patients, we have screened 
physical risks from the impacts of climate 
change across our operations and strategic 
suppliers. These risks are defined by the cost 
of interruption and strategic importance, and 
our assessment includes climate change-
related hazards arising under three different 
scenarios by 2030, 2050 and 2100, including a 
worst-case scenario (SSP5-RCP 8.5). We 
prioritised screening results according to 
business criticality, to identify material sites 
for deep dive assessments during 2021 and 
2023. We also continued to engage with 
strategic partners with a critical role in patient 
supply to understand their exposure to 
climate-related hazards and their resilience to 
climate change.

For medicines, transition risks and 
opportunities are screened by using LCA and 
carbon intensity data. In 2023, we have 
continued to focus on pMDIs in our respiratory 
portfolio due to their relative high carbon 
intensity. We aim to launch our first next-
generation pMDI from 2025 and complete the 
transition to a near-zero Global Warming 
Potential (GWP) propellant across our 
portfolio by 2030, as part of our Ambition Zero 
Carbon strategy to accelerate business 
decarbonisation while ensuring people can 
access essential medicines. 

How it is managed

Mitigation measures are often already in 
place to address climate-related risks and 
opportunities, including transition to a 
low-carbon economy and net-zero healthcare 
provision. Physical and transitional climate-
related risks are included within a specific 
risk in the Group’s risk landscape ‘Failure to 
meet regulatory or ethical expectations on 
environmental impact, including climate 
change’.

Physical 
risks

Disruption to own and third-party supplier sites:

 > Increased extreme heat events and cooling 
needs impacting compliance with Good 
Manufacturing Practice.

 > Heavy rainfall causing local flooding and/or 

landslides.

 > High winds damaging structures.
 > Lack of a consistent high-quality water supply. 

Identified risks are embedded within planning of nature-based or technical 
mitigations, integrated into site master plans and local business continuity 
plans. 

Climate risks are mitigated through supply chain design and product-level 
business continuity management.

Appropriate water management strategies are being established across our 
manufacturing sites and the broader supply chain.

Transition 
risks and 
opportunities

Some healthcare providers are transitioning to 
net-zero healthcare systems to meet their own 
climate targets, which may alter the demand for 
medicinal products based on their carbon footprint. 

SBTs and strategy for net-zero emissions by 2045, including transition to 
near-zero GWP propellant across our respiratory portfolio from 2025 to 2030.

New EU Fluorinated-gas (F-gas) Regulation and 
per- and polyfluoroalkyl substances (PFAS) 
restriction proposal presented to the European 
Chemicals Agency (ECHA) and potential impact 
on our transition to next-generation, near-zero 
GWP propellant HFO-1234 ze(E). 

We believe the necessary safeguards and sufficient quota will remain 
available within the forthcoming EU F-gas Regulation to transition our pMDI 
portfolio safely to next-generation, near-zero GWP propellant by 2030. 

In response to the ECHA public consultation, we have recommended that 
HFO-1234 ze(E) should be excluded from the proposed universal ban to 
ensure patient access to essential life-saving pMDI medicines is maintained.

Carbon pricing uncertainty over future 
environmental taxation and regulation. 

Delivery of the Ambition Zero Carbon strategy mitigates exposure to future 
value chain pricing and taxation.

Supply/demand of renewable energy requires 
higher investment. Changes in geopolitics can 
lead to loss of access. 

Investment of approximately $175 million in our natural resource reduction 
programme since 2015, including $25.5 million in 2023, and collaborations 
with key partners to scale renewable energy sources and secure supply 
chain access.

Change in raw material or sourcing costs, as well 
as costs related to the transition to low-carbon 
technologies. 

Ongoing engagement with strategic supply chain partners on their transition 
plans to a low-carbon economy and possible impacts on cost.

Strategy

Describe the climate-related risks and 
opportunities the organisation has identified 
over the short, medium, and long term.

Physical risks from climate change primarily relate to disruption or delays to 
manufacturing and/or distribution, including cold chain logistics, increased 
insurance premiums, reputational damage, and other resulting 
consequences – see table on page 51. 

 pages 5 to 10
 pages 16 to 19

Describe the impact of climate-related 
risks and opportunities on the 
organisation’s businesses, strategy, 
and financial planning. 

Describe the resilience of the organisation’s 
strategy, taking into consideration different 
climate-related scenarios, including a 2°C 
or lower scenario.

Transition risks and opportunities are primarily regulatory and market 
changes, and/or pressure and ability to reduce product carbon footprints 
and decarbonise our value chain – see table on page 51.

Taking into account climate-related risks and opportunities, we are taking 
enterprise-wide action to reduce GHG emissions from our global operations 
and fleet by 98% by 2026 (from a 2015 baseline) with a $1 billion spend 
budgeted from 2020. We aim to halve our entire value chain footprint (Scope 
3) by 2030, on a pathway to achieve a 90% reduction in emissions by 2045 
(from a 2019 baseline). In 2023, we increased our investment in nature-based 
solutions to $400 million through AZ Forest, to mitigate our residual 
emissions and reach our net-zero SBTs to prepare for a low-carbon 
economy, and contribute to community and nature resilience with broader 
co-benefits. Our transition plan to net zero is disclosed in our Sustainability 
Report as a response to FCA requirement 2021/61 9.8.6F.

 pages 5 to 10
 pages 16 to 21

We build resilience by addressing the physical and transitional risks and 
opportunities across the value chain. 

 pages 1, 4 and 6

We have used three different climate-related scenarios (RCP 2.6, 4.5 and 
8.5). We are building resilience against a worst-case scenario (RCP 8.5) in 
our supply chain by investing in mitigation in at-risk sites, supply chain 
design, and inventory levels, to manage interruption risks. No material 
business impact from such short-term events is currently foreseen. 

Value chain decarbonisation, with net-zero targets aligned to a 1.5°C 
scenario, will secure low-carbon economy resilience and scale opportunities 
in progressive markets.

Risk Overview

 “Our Principal Risks 
are those risks that are 
most likely to have a 
material impact on our 
business.”

Managing risk 
Our approach to risk management is designed 
to encourage clear decision making on which 
risks we take and how we manage these risks. 
We strive to embed sound risk management 
in our strategy, planning, budgeting and 
performance management processes. The 
Board defines the Group’s risk appetite. This 
enables the Group, in both quantitative and 
qualitative terms, to judge the level of risk 
it is prepared to take in achieving its overall 
objectives. The Board expresses the 
acceptable levels of risk for the Group using 
three key dimensions. These are: (i) earnings 
and cash flow, (ii) return on investment and 
(iii) ethics and reputation. Annually, the Group 
develops a detailed three-year bottom-up 
business plan and 10-year long-range projection 
to support the delivery of its strategy. The 
Board considers these in the context of the 
Group’s risk appetite. Adjustments are made 
to the plan or risk appetite to ensure they 
remain aligned.

The SET is required by the Board to oversee 
and monitor the effectiveness of the risk 
management processes implemented by 
management. Within each SET function, 
leadership teams discuss the risks the 
business faces. Quarterly, each SET function 
assesses changes to these risks, new and 
emerging risks and mitigation plans. These 
are assimilated into a Group Risk Report for 
the Board, Audit Committee and SET. 

Global Compliance, Finance and Global 
Internal Audit support the SET by advising 
on policy and standard setting, monitoring 
and auditing, communication and training, 
as well as reporting on the adequacy of line 
management processes as they apply to risk 
management. The Board believes that existing 
processes provide it with adequate information 
on the risks and uncertainties we face. The 
Board has carried out a robust assessment 
of the Principal and emerging risks facing the 
Group. Our Principal Risks are those risks that 
are most likely to have a material impact on 
our business and are a subset of the total risk 
landscape facing the Group. The table on 
pages 56 and 57 provides insight into these 
Principal Risks.

Emerging risks
Emerging risks are ‘new’ risks that have the 
potential to crystallise in the future but are 
unlikely to impact the business during the next 
year. The outcome of such risks is often more 
uncertain. They may begin to evolve rapidly or 
simply not materialise. 

We monitor our business activities and 
external and internal environments for new, 
emerging and changing risks to ensure these 
are managed appropriately. Annually, we 
combine input from each SET function and 
external insight to scan the horizon for emerging 
risks and a summary is presented to the 
Audit Committee and Board. Emerging risks 
continue to be monitored as part of the ongoing 
risk management processes outlined above.

Climate risk
The identification and assessment of climate 
risk form part of our existing risk management 
processes. ‘Failure to meet regulatory and 
ethical expectations on environmental impact, 
including climate change’ is a component of 
the Group’s risk landscape but is not currently 
considered to be a Principal Risk for the Group.

We support the TCFD framework and 
continue to develop our disclosures in line 
with its recommendations. Our TCFD 
Summary Statement from page 51 
summarises the work undertaken to date to 
understand the potential impact of climate 
change on our business and outlines future 
areas of management focus.

Cybersecurity risk
Our approach to identifying, assessing and 
managing material cybersecurity risks 
(including those that result from the use of 
third parties in business processes and data 
management) is integrated within our 
Group-wide approach to managing risk. 
Failure in information technology or 
cybersecurity has been identified as a 
Principal Risk. Mitigations are in place to 
manage these risks, and these are monitored, 
and their effectiveness regularly reported, for 
example, in KPI dashboards provided 
to management and the Audit Committee. 
Incidents are managed and reported using 
the cybersecurity incident management 
framework which in turn is connected to 
the Group’s crisis management framework. 
Cybersecurity risks are overseen by the Audit 
Committee, which performs an in-depth 
review annually. Its reviews are supported by 
senior management, the VP, Group Internal 
Audit and other assurance or providers as 
required. Cybersecurity risks (including 
previous incidents) have not materially 
affected our business strategy, results of 
operations or financial condition.

“ We monitor our 
business activities 
and external and 
internal environments 
for new, emerging 
and changing risks 
to ensure these 
are managed 
appropriately.”

 > Principal Risk: Failure or delay in the 

delivery of our pipeline or launch of new 
medicines. 
 – Scenario 3 – Assumes no launches 

of new products.

 > Principal Risk: Failure to maintain supply 

of compliant, quality medicines.
 – Scenario 4 – Major equipment failure or 
significant regulatory observation at one 
of our major manufacturing sites results 
in a 12-month loss of formulation 
capability for one of our key oncology 
products leading to supply interruption.

 > Principal Risks: Failure in information 
technology or cybersecurity; adverse 
outcome of litigation and/or government 
investigations.
 – Scenario 5 – Legal, regulatory, cyber 
or other non-compliance results in a 
payment of $500 million in 2025.

In addition, the Board has considered more 
stressed scenarios, including restrictions 
on debt factoring and no access to capital 
markets to raise new debt. In each scenario 
(or combination of scenarios above), the 
Group is able to rely on its existing cash, 
cash equivalents and short-term fixed income 
investments, committed credit facilities, 
leveraging its cost base, reducing capital 
expenditure and taking other cash 
management measures to mitigate the 
impacts and still have residual capacity 
to absorb further shocks.

Based on the results of this analysis, the 
Directors have a reasonable expectation 
that the Company will be able to continue in 
operation and meet its liabilities, as they fall 
due, over the three-year period of their 
assessment.

Viability statement 
In accordance with provision 31 of the 2018 
UK Corporate Governance Code, the Board 
has determined that a three-year period to 
31 December 2026 constitutes an appropriate 
period over which to provide its viability 
statement. 

The Board assesses the Company’s prospects 
using a 10-year long-range projection. It notes 
the rich and varied portfolio of medicines in 
development across a range of therapy areas 
and the medicines currently commercialised 
in more than 100 markets and concludes that 
the Company’s long-term prospects remain 
strong. The Board also considers annually 
and on a rolling basis, a three-year bottom- 
up detailed business plan and, given the 
inherent uncertainty involved, believes that 
the three-year statement presents readers 
of this Annual Report with a reasonable 
degree of assurance over the ongoing viability 
of the Company while still providing a 
longer-term perspective.

The three-year detailed business plan 
captures risks to the sales and cost forecasts 
at a market and SET function level. The plan is 
used to perform central net debt and headroom 
profile analysis. The following scenarios have 
been applied to this analysis to create a 
severe but plausible downside combining a 
number of the Principal Risks detailed from 
pages 56 to 57. 

 > Principal Risks: Pricing, affordability, 

access and competitive pressures; failures 
or delays in the quality or execution of the 
Group’s commercial strategies.
 – Scenario 1 – Government action on 

pricing, higher than anticipated 
competition and other commercial 
headwinds result in lower than 
anticipated growth rates for our 
medicines.

 – Scenario 2 – A significant incident leads 
to reputational damage in a key market 
resulting in an ongoing 10% reduction in 
revenue achieved in this market.

The development of pharmaceutical product 
candidates is a complex, risky and lengthy process 
involving significant resources. A project may fail at 
any stage of the process due to a number of factors, 
which could adversely affect our future business 
and results of operations.

 > Prioritise and accelerate our pipeline.
 > Strengthen pipeline through acquisitions, 

licensing and collaborations.

 > Focus on innovative science in our main 

therapy areas.

 > Improve R&D productivity.

We are subject to laws and regulations that control 
our ability to market our pharmaceutical products. 
Delays in regulatory approvals could delay our ability 
to market our products and may adversely affect 
our revenue.

 > Quality management systems 

incorporating monitoring, training and 
assurance activities.

 > Collaborating with regulatory bodies and 
advocacy groups to monitor and respond 
to changes in the regulatory environment, 
including revised processes, timelines 
and guidance.

Global economic, political and social pressures 
are creating an ever more challenging environment 
in which we operate. Global financial pressures 
may lead to the implementation of further cost 
containment measures by payers which could 
have an adverse effect on our business results. 

 > Implement pricing, reimbursement and 

policy frameworks.
 > Focus on key products.
 > Demonstrate value of medicines/health 

economics.

 > Implement innovative value-based 

agreements focused on patient outcomes.

 > Global footprint.
 > Diversified portfolio.

Global economic and 
political conditions 
placing downward 
pressure on healthcare 
pricing and spending 
and therefore on revenue 
and innovation. 

A failure to execute our commercial strategies or 
achieve the level of sales anticipated for a medicine 
could materially impact our business results.

 > Focus on key products.
 > Substantial investment in sales and 

marketing activities.

 > Accelerate execution of plans and risk 

share through business development and 
strategic collaborations and alliances.

Supply chain and business execution risks

Failure to 
maintain 
supply of 
compliant, 
quality 
medicines

Failure in 
information 
technology or 
cybersecurity

Failure to 
attract, develop, 
engage and 
retain a diverse, 
talented and 
capable 
workforce

Supply chain difficulties may result in product 
shortages which could lead to lost product sales 
and materially affect our reputation and revenues.

 > Establishment of new manufacturing 

facilities, creating capacity and 
technical capability to support new 
product launches.

 > Contingency plans, including dual 
sourcing, multiple suppliers and 
close monitoring and maintenance of 
stock levels.

 > Business continuity and resilience 

initiatives, disaster and data recovery, 
and emergency response plans.

 > Quality management systems.

Significant disruption to our IT systems, including 
breaches of data security or cybersecurity, or failure 
to comply with applicable laws or regulations could 
harm our reputation and materially affect our 
financial condition or results of operations. 

 > Cybersecurity incident management 

framework and dashboard.

 > Disaster and data recovery plans.
 > Strategies to secure critical systems 

and processes.

Growing multi-faceted 
cyber threat.

 > Regular cybersecurity and privacy training 

for employees. 

The inability to attract and retain highly-skilled 
personnel may weaken our succession plans for 
critical positions, impact the implementation of our 
strategic objectives, and ultimately result in the 
failure of our business operations. 

 > Targeted recruitment and retention 

strategies deployed to secure critical skills 
and capabilities.

 > Development of our employees.
 > Evolve our culture.

Safety concerns relating to our products may lead 
to recalls, seizures, interruption of supply and loss 
of product approvals, which could adversely affect 
patient access, our reputation and our revenues. 
Significant product liability claims could also arise, 
which may be costly, divert management attention,

our reputation.

 > Robust processes and systems in place 
to manage patient safety and efficacy 
trends as well as externally reported risks 
through regulatory agencies and other 
parties. This includes a comprehensive 
pharmacovigilance programme 
supplemented by close monitoring and 
review of adverse events.

Our business is subject to a wide range of laws and 
regulations around the world. Actual or perceived 
failure to comply may result in AstraZeneca being 
investigated by government agencies and authorities 
and/or in civil legal proceedings.

 > Established compliance framework with 
strong ethical and compliance culture.
 > Combined internal and external counsel 

management.

Government investigations, litigations, and other 
legal proceedings, regardless of outcome, could 
be costly, divert management attention, or damage 
our reputation and demand for our products.

Unfavourable resolutions to proceedings against us 
could subject us to criminal liability, fines, penalties 
or other monetary or non-monetary remedies, 
including enhanced damages, require us to make 
significant provisions in our accounts relating to legal 
proceedings and could materially adversely affect 
our business or results of operations.

The pharmaceutical industry is experiencing 
pressure from governments and other payers 
to impose limits on intellectual property (IP) 
protections to manage healthcare costs. If we are 
unable to obtain, defend and enforce our IP, we may

2023wasayearof
strongbusiness
performance,with
sustainedrevenue
growthandexcellent
pipelineprogress.

2023 represented another year of excellent 
performance. We started the year with several 
operational uncertainties, including revenues 
from our COVID-19 mAbs and certain other 
products. Despite some of these risks 
materialising, the vast majority of the portfolio 
outperformed expectation, leading to an 
exceptional year. This speaks to the strength 
of our diversified portfolio and geographic 
footprint. Our R&D teams are progressing 
novel medicines and we continue to enhance 
our portfolio though business development 
and mergers and acquisitions. At the same 
time, we continue to optimise ‘how work is 
done’, expanding services offered in our 
shared business Centres of Excellence. Our 
colleagues across functions remain focused 
on quality, reporting, controls, cybersecurity, 
and supply, while incorporating a mindset of 
continuous improvement.

Total Revenue growth
AstraZeneca achieved Total Revenue of 
$45.8 billion in 2023, including $1.4 billion of 
Alliance Revenue and $0.6 billion of 
Collaboration Revenue with growth of 3% 
(CER: 6%). 2023 delivered 13 blockbuster 
medicines in total. Excluding COVID-19 
medicines, Total Revenue increased by 
13% (CER: 15%) in the year.

Product Sales grew by 2% (CER: 4%) to 
$43.8 billion, with 12 blockbuster medicines, 
including Ultomiris, Soliris and Strensiq from 
our Rare Disease portfolio. Our continued 
investment in Oncology and CVRM medicine 
launches supported sustained Product Sales 
growth, with Oncology achieving 17% (CER: 
20%) and CVRM achieving 15% (CER: 18%). 
Standout performances came once again 
from Farxiga ($6.0 billion), Tagrisso ($5.8 
billion) and Imfinzi ($4.2 billion). Within our 
Rare Disease portfolio, Soliris achieved 
Product Sales of $3.1 billion but saw a decline 
of 16% (CER: 14%) due to the successful 
conversion to Ultomiris, which had growth of 
51% (CER: 52%) to $3.0 billion in the year. In 
the US, we had overall growth of 4%, with 
Product Sales of $18.0 billion. In Emerging 
Markets, Product Sales grew by 1% (CER: 
8%) to $11.8 billion, with growth in CVRM and 
Tagrisso. In Europe, Product Sales increased 
by 9% (CER: 7%) to $9.0 billion, reflecting 
strong performances from Oncology and 
Forxiga and in Established Rest of World 
markets, there was a decline of 14% (CER: 
8%) to $5.0 billion due to mandatory pricing 
reductions of Tagrisso in Japan and the drop 
off in demand for COVID-19 medicines. 

Alliance Revenue increased by 89% (CER: 
89%) to $1.4 billion, including $1.0 billion from 
Enhertu, which achieved blockbuster status 
for the first time. Collaboration Revenue 
declined by 1% (CER: 1%) to $0.6 billion. 

Profitability
Reported EPS was $3.84 in the year (2022: 
$2.12) and Core EPS was $7.26 (2022: $6.66) 
driven by improved Product Sales Gross 
Margin from Total Revenue growth and a 
decline in sales of lower margin COVID-19 
medicines. 

Keymilestones/approvals
Our continued investment in the pipeline 
yielded several significant approvals and 
milestones in the year, including regulatory 
approval in the US for Truqap in breast 
cancer, Wainua (eplontersen) in transthyretin-
mediated amyloid polyneuropathy and 
Beyfortus for the prevention of RSV in infants. 
In Japan, in January 2024, Voydeya was 
approved for the treatment of anaemia due to 
extravascular haemolysis. 

2023 also afforded me the opportunity to 
engage with a number of our stakeholders – 
from investors to key opinion leaders and 
physicians at congresses, and from 
employees to government officials. This 
brought to light how special a place 
AstraZeneca truly is. Our stakeholders see 
AstraZeneca as a company on the forefront of 
science with a broad ambition to continuously 
improve health, our communities and our 
planet. During all my interactions, I have been 
impressed with the engagement, energy and 
passion of my colleagues and humbled by the 
privilege of working with an amazing set of 
people. 2024 will bring more change and we 
will continue to evolve while remaining true to 
our Values.

Management presents these results externally 
to meet investors’ requirements for 
transparency and clarity. Core financial 
measures are also used internally in the 
management of our business performance, in 
our budgeting process and when determining 
compensation. As a result, Core performance 
measures allow investors to differentiate 
between different kinds of costs but they 
should not be used in isolation. 

Our determination of non-GAAP measures, 
and our presentation of them within this 
Financial Review, may differ from similarly titled 
non-GAAP measures of other companies.

The SET retains strategic management of 
the costs excluded from Reported financial 
information in arriving at Core financial 
measures, tracking their impact on Reported 
Operating profit and EPS, with operational 
management being delegated on a case-by-
case basis to ensure clear accountability and 
consistency for each cost category.

We strongly encourage readers of this 
Annual Report not to rely on any single 
financial measure but to review our Financial 
Statements, including the Notes thereto, and 
our other publicly filed reports, carefully and 
in their entirety.

 > Core performance measures are adjusted 
to exclude certain significant items, using a 
set of established principles.

Use of non-GAAP performance measures
Core performance measures, EBITDA, Net 
debt, CER, Product Sales Gross Margin 
(formerly termed Gross Margin) and Operating 
Margin are non-GAAP performance measures 
because they cannot be derived directly from 
the Financial Statements. 

By disclosing non-GAAP performance and 
growth measures, in addition to our Reported 
financial information, we are enhancing 
investors’ ability to evaluate and analyse 
the financial performance and trends of 
our ongoing business and the related key 
business drivers. The adjustments are made 
to our Reported financial information in order 
to show non-GAAP performance measures 
that illustrate clearly the impact on our 
performance of factors such as changes 
in revenues and expenses driven by volume, 
prices and cost levels relative to such 
prior years or periods. These non-GAAP 
performance measures are not a substitute 
for, or superior to, financial measures 
prepared in accordance with GAAP.

As shown in the 2023 Reconciliation of 
Reported results to Core results table on 
page 62, our reconciliation of Reported 
financial information to Core performance 
measures includes a breakdown of the items 
for which our Reported financial information is 
adjusted, and a further breakdown by specific 
line item as such items are reflected in our 
Reported income statement. This illustrates 
the significant items that are excluded from 
Core performance measures and their impact 
on our Reported financial information, both as 
a whole and in respect of specific line items.

FinancialReview 
continued

Businessbackgroundandresults
overview
The business background is covered in the 
Healthcare in a Changing World section from 
page 7, the Therapy Area Review from page 16, 
and the Our Strategy and Key Performance 
Indicators section from page 12, which 
describe in detail the business developments 
of our products.

As described earlier in this Annual Report, 
sales of our products are directly influenced 
by medical need and are generally paid for 
by health insurance schemes or national 
healthcare budgets. Our operating results can 
be affected by a number of factors other than 
the delivery of operating plans and normal 
competition.

Over the longer term, the success of our R&D 
is crucial and we devote substantial resources 
to this area. The benefits of this investment 
are expected to emerge over the long term 
and there is considerable inherent uncertainty 
as to the scale and timing of outcomes and 
their transition to saleable products.

Measuringperformance
Reported and Core performance are referred 
to in this Financial Review when reporting on 
our performance in absolute terms, but more 
often in comparison with earlier years:

 > Reported performance takes into account 
all the factors (including those which we 
cannot influence, such as currency 
exchange rates) that have affected the 
results of our business. The Consolidated 
Financial Statements have been prepared in 
accordance with UK-adopted IAS and with 
the requirements of the Companies Act 
2006 as applicable to companies reporting 
under those standards. The Consolidated 
Financial Statements also comply fully with 
IFRS Accounting Standards as issued by 
the IASB and IAS as adopted by the EU.

Non-GAAP measures: definitions

Revenue

Constant exchange rate 
(CER) growth rates 

Definition: Retranslation of the current year’s performance at the 
previous year’s average exchange rates, adjusted for other 
exchange effects, including hedging.

 Reconciliation,see
page62

Why we use them: CER measures allow us to focus on the changes 
in revenues and expenses driven by volume, prices and cost levels 
relative to the prior period. Revenues and cost growth expressed 
in CER allow management to understand the true local movement 
in revenues and costs, in order to compare recent trends and 
relative return on investment. CER growth rates can be used to 
analyse revenues in a number of ways but, most often, we consider 
CER growth by products and groups of products, and by countries 
and regions. 

CER revenue growth can be further analysed by revenue volumes 
and selling price. Similarly, CER cost growth helps us to focus on 
the real local change in costs so that we can manage the cost 
base effectively.

Limitations: CER measures are not always better indicators of 
performance. Where countries are subject to high inflation and 
currencies that depreciate persistently, adjusting out the effect of 
foreign exchange fluctuations could give an overly optimistic view 
of growth. 

Profitability

Core performance 
measures

 Reconciliation,see
page62

Core performance measures are adjusted to exclude certain 
significant items. In determining the adjustments to arrive at 
the Core result, we use a set of established principles relating 
to the nature or materiality of individual items or groups of items, 
excluding, for example, events which are (i) outside the normal 
course of business, (ii) incurred in a pattern that is unrelated to the 
trends in the underlying financial performance of our ongoing 
business, or (iii) related to major acquisitions, to ensure that 
investors’ ability to evaluate and analyse the underlying financial 
performance of our ongoing business is enhanced. 

Our Core adjustments are summarised as:

Restructuring costs, including charges that relate to the impact 
of our global restructuring programmes on our capitalised 
manufacturing facilities and IT assets. These can take place over 
multiple reporting periods, given the long life-cycle of our business. 

Why we use them: We adjust for these charges and provisions 
because they primarily reflect the financial impact of change to 
legacy arrangements, rather than the underlying performance of 
our ongoing business. 

Intangible amortisation and impairments, including impairment 
reversals but excluding any charges relating to IT assets. 
Intangibles generally arise from business combinations and 
individual licence acquisitions. 

Why we use them: We adjust for these charges because their 
pattern of recognition is largely uncorrelated with the underlying 
performance of the business. 

Product Sales Gross 
Margin

 Reconciliation,see
page62.

Definition: Product Sales Gross Margin (formerly termed Gross 
Margin) is the percentage by which Product Sales exceeds the Cost 
of sales, calculated by dividing the difference between the two by 
the sales figure. The calculation of Reported and Core Product 
Sales Gross Margin excludes the impact of Alliance Revenue and 
Collaboration Revenue and any associated costs, thereby reflecting 
the underlying performance of Product Sales.

Alexion acquisition-related items, primarily fair value adjustments on 
acquired inventories and fair value impact of replacement employee 
share awards. 

Why we use them: We adjust for this item to enable a more 
meaningful comparison of the performance of acquired business 
and products to that of internally developed products, as well as 
removing charges whose pattern of recognition is largely 
uncorrelated to the underlying performance of the business.

Other specified items, principally the imputed finance charges and 
fair value movements relating to contingent consideration on 
business combinations, imputed finance charges and 
remeasurement adjustments on certain Other payables arising from 
intangible asset acquisitions, legal settlements and remeasurement 
adjustments relating to Other payables assumed from the Alexion 
acquisition. 

Why we use them: We adjust for these items to enable a more 
meaningful comparison of the performance of acquired businesses 
and products to that of internally developed products, as well as 
removing charges whose pattern of recognition is largely 
uncorrelated to the underlying performance of the business.

It should be noted that some costs excluded from our Core results, 
such as intangibles amortisation and finance charges related to 
contingent consideration, will recur in future years, and other 
excluded items such as impairments and legal settlements costs, 
along with other acquisition-related costs, may recur in the future.

Limitations: Core results exclude significant costs (such as 
restructuring, intangible amortisation and impairments, and other 
acquisition-related adjustments), but incorporate associated 
benefits, including Product Sales arising from business 
combinations, asset acquisitions and assets which have been 
amortised, as well as the benefits resulting from restructuring 
activities and, as such, they should not be regarded as a complete 
picture of the Group’s financial performance, which is presented 
in its Reported results. The exclusion of the adjusting items may 
result in Core earnings being materially higher or lower than 
Reported earnings. 

Why we use it: This measure sets out gross profitability of Product 
Sales when taking account of only direct Cost of sales. It is a key 
performance measure of the contribution to fund operating costs 
and overall quality of the business. 

Limitations: Product Sales Gross Margin percentage excludes the 
impact of Alliance Revenue and Collaboration Revenue and related 
costs and therefore should not be regarded as giving a full picture of 
Total Revenue performance.

Net debt

 Reconciliation,see

Definition: Operating profit as a percentage of Total Revenue. 

Why we use it: This measure sets out profitability derived from 
operating activities before the impact of finance costs and tax. 
It is a key performance measure of the overall quality of the 
operations of the business. 

Definition: Reported Profit before tax plus Net finance expense, 
Share of after-tax losses of joint ventures and associates, and 
charges for Depreciation, amortisation and impairment.

Limitations: Operating Margin percentage excludes the impact of 
financing costs and therefore should not be regarded as a full picture 
of revenue performance. 

Why we use it: EBITDA allows us to understand our baseline 
profitability, removing any ‘non-operational’ expenses and non-cash 
items that are not considered by management to be reflective of the 
underlying performance of the Group.

Limitations: EBITDA does not take account of the cost of investment 
to generate revenues, hence is not always the best indicator of 
performance. 

Definition: Interest-bearing loans and borrowings and Lease 
liabilities, net of Cash and cash equivalents, Other investments 
and Net derivative financial instruments.

Why we use it: Net debt is a measure that provides valuable 
additional information regarding the Group’s net financial liabilities 
and is a measure commonly used by investors and rating agencies. 
It facilitates the tracking of one of our key financial priorities: 
deleveraging.

Restructuring costs

 > Restructuring costs totalling $467 million (2022: $717 million) mainly comprise those incurred on the Post Alexion Acquisition Group 

Review (PAAGR) of $362 million (2022: $675 million). 

Intangible amortisation 
and impairments

 > Amortisation totalling $3,846 million (2022: $4,080 million) relating to intangible assets, except those related to IT. Further 

information on our intangible assets is contained in Note 10 to the Financial Statements from page 172. Intangible impairment 
charges were $434 million (2022: $318 million), excluding those related to IT. Further details relating to intangible asset impairments 
are included in Note 10 to the Financial Statements from page 172.

Acquisition of Alexion

 > Costs associated with our acquisition of Alexion in July 2021 amounting to $137 million (2022: $3,571 million), primarily relating to 
the impact from the unwind of the fair value adjustment to Alexion inventories at the date of acquisition. In 2023, the impact of the 
fair value uplift unwind on Cost of sales is $114 million (2022: $3,484 million). The majority of the fair value uplift unwound through 
Reported Cost of sales in line with associated revenues in 2022. 

 > The fair value of replacement employee share awards is higher than both the value of the Alexion awards the employees were 

originally granted and the expected value of future awards to those employees. As a result, the Group will recognise an inflated 
expense during the remaining vesting period of these awards. This temporary increase in Operating expenses, when compared with 
the expected expense based on the grant-date value, will be excluded from the Group’s Core results.

 > Other acquisition-related items to be excluded from the Group’s Core results include professional fees, retention bonuses included 

in the acquisition agreement and the effect of unwinding other acquisition-related fair value adjustments over time.

Other

 > Other adjustments, excluding taxation adjustments, amounted to $1,755 million (2022: $1,261 million).
 > Other adjustments to Reported SG&A expenses were $1,458 million (2022: $985 million), primarily including a charge to legal 

provisions of $425 million in relation to Nexium and Losec/Prilosec product liability litigation, $510 million in relation to Bristol-Myers 
Squibb Co. and E.R. Squibb & Sons, LLC and $70 million in relation to Alexion shareholder litigation. Other adjustments also include 
$549 million (2022: $82 million) net fair value adjustments relating to contingent consideration balances, and a credit of $111 million 
(2022: a charge of $82 million) of remeasurement adjustments relating to Other payables. Further details relating to contingent 
consideration balances are contained in Note 20 to the Financial Statements from page 181, and further details of legal 
proceedings, ongoing at 31 December 2023, are contained within Note 30 to the Financial Statements from page 204.

 > Other adjustments to Net finance expense of $298 million (2022: $277 million) include discount unwind charges on liabilities arising 

from business combinations and on liabilities resulting from the Enhertu collaboration agreement.

 > Other adjustments to Taxation amounted to $405 million (2022: $1,049 million). Adjustments to Taxation in 2022 included a one-time 

favourable net adjustment of $876 million to deferred taxes arising from an internal reorganisation to integrate Alexion.

By Product 
2023 succeeded in delivering 12 blockbuster 
drugs. 

Our largest selling products in the year were 
Farxiga ($5,963 million), Tagrisso ($5,799 million), 
Imfinzi ($4,237 million), Soliris ($3,145 million), 
and Ultomiris ($2,965 million). Farxiga sales 
increased by 36% (CER: 39%), with continued 
volume growth across all major regions driven 
by launches in HF and CKD. Tagrisso sales 
grew by 7% (CER: 9%) reflecting a strong 
performance from increased demand across 
all markets. Imfinzi Product Sales grew by 
52% (CER: 55%), with increased 
use worldwide driven by new launches and 
established indications. Soliris declined 
by 16% (CER: 14%) due to the successful 
conversion to Ultomiris, which increased by 
51% (CER: 52%).

Calquence continued its growth with an 
increase of 22% (CER: 23%) in the year to 
$2,514 million driven by increased market 
penetration globally, including increased new 
patient starts in Europe and sustained US 
performance. 

Within Vaccines & Immune Therapies, Product 
Sales declined by 79% (CER: 78%) due to 
fulfilment of contracts signed during the 
pandemic.

Product Sales 
By geography 
US Product Sales were up 4% to $17,961 
million, reflecting the continued growth of our 
Oncology medicines and Farxiga, which had 
growth of 35%, with recent launches in HF 
and CKD driving an increase in market share. 
Product Sales in Emerging Markets grew by 
1% (CER: 8%) to $11,751 million in 2023 with 
growth in CVRM, Respiratory & Immunology 
and Tagrisso. Product Sales in ex-China 
Emerging Markets remained broadly flat (CER: 
growth of 8%) at $5,884 million, with increases 
in Oncology and Farxiga offset by declines in 
COVID-19 medicines. In Europe, Product 
Sales grew by 9% (CER: 7%) to $9,029 million, 
reflecting a strong performance in Oncology 
and Forxiga but also reflecting COVID-19 
medicines decline. Established Rest of World 
Product Sales decreased by 14% (CER: 8%) 
to $5,048 million, with sales in Japan down 
9% (CER: 1%) to $3,654 million, driven by 
decline in COVID-19 medicines partially offset 
by increases in Oncology.

$1,022 million Alliance Revenue from Enhertu, 
which achieved blockbuster status for the first 
time in 2023.

Details of our significant business 
development transactions which give rise to 
Alliance Revenue are given below.

Enhertu (Daiichi Sankyo)
In March 2019, AstraZeneca announced it 
had entered into an alliance with Daiichi 
Sankyo to develop and commercialise 
Enhertu for multiple cancer types. In markets 
where Daiichi Sankyo is selling the product, 
AstraZeneca is entitled to receive a royalty 
(in Japan) or a share of costs and income 
(in other territories). Share of gross profits and 
royalty income from Daiichi Sankyo are 
recognised as Alliance Revenue. Enhertu 
launched in the US on 31 December 2019.

Tezspire (Amgen)
In 2012, AstraZeneca entered into a 
collaboration agreement with Amgen to 
co-develop and co-commercialise five 
development stage programmes. Of these, 
only AMG 157 (Tezspire tezepelumab) remains 
in the collaboration. A second active molecule 
(AZD8630) was added in 2021. Manufacturing 
will be undertaken by Amgen, while 
commercialisation activity will be undertaken 
either jointly, or by AstraZeneca or Amgen 
individually, dependent on the market and on 
the agreed terms.

AstraZeneca will recognise 100% of the sales 
as principal in all markets other than the US, 
as well as 100% of the associated cost of 
sales. In markets other than the US, where 
AstraZeneca is recognising sales, the share of 
gross margin payable to Amgen will be shown 
as additional cost of sales. In the US, where 
Amgen is recognising sales, AstraZeneca will 
record its share of gross profit as Alliance 
Revenue.

Beyfortus (Sanofi)
In March 2017, AstraZeneca entered into 
an alliance with Sanofi to develop and 
commercialise Beyfortus jointly. Under the 
terms of the global agreement, Sanofi made 
an upfront payment of €120 million and will 
pay up to €495 million upon achievement 
of certain development and sales-related 
milestones. All costs and profits are shared 
equally. The US element of this collaboration 
was subject to a participation agreement with 
Sobi, effective from January 2019 until April 
2023, at which point there was an update 
to the contractual relationships between 
AstraZeneca, Sobi and Sanofi relating to 
the future sales of Beyfortus. Alliance Revenue 
recognises AstraZeneca’s 50% share of gross 
profits on sales of Beyfortus in major markets 
outside the US.

Alliance Revenue in respect of this agreement 
has been recognised as follows:

 > In 2023, AstraZeneca recognised Alliance 

Revenue of $57 million. 

Collaboration Revenue
Collaboration Revenue decreased in the year 
by 1% (CER: 1%) to $594 million.

Details of our significant business 
development transactions which give rise 
to Collaboration Revenue are given below.

Lynparza/Koselugo (MSD)
In July 2017, the Group announced a global 
strategic oncology collaboration with MSD 
to co-develop and co-commercialise 
AstraZeneca’s Lynparza for multiple cancer 
types. As part of the agreement, MSD will 
pay AstraZeneca up to $8.5 billion in total 
consideration, including $1.6 billion upfront, 
$750 million for certain licence options and 
up to $6.2 billion contingent upon successful 
achievement of future regulatory and sales 
milestones. Of the upfront payment of 
$1.6 billion, $1.0 billion was recognised as 
Collaboration Revenue on deal completion in 
2017, with the remaining $0.6 billion deferred 
to the balance sheet, of which less than 
$0.1 billion remains for 2023. AstraZeneca 
records all Collaboration Revenue of Lynparza 
and Koselugo; amounts due to MSD under the 
collaboration will be recorded under 
Cost of sales.

Alliance Revenue in respect of this agreement 
has been recognised as follows:

Grossprofit
Reported Gross profit increased by 17% 
(CER: 21%) to $37,543 million. Core Gross 
profit increased by 6% (CER: 9%) to $37,800 
million. Reported Product Sales Gross Margin 
grew by 10 (CER: 10) percentage points to 
81.1%. Core Product Sales Gross Margin grew 
by two (CER: two) percentage points to 81.7%. 
Both Reported and Core Product Sales Gross 
Margin reflected positive product mix effects 
from Rare Disease and Oncology medicines, 
negative product mix effects from rising 
contributions of products with share of gross 
profit arrangements, and negative geographic 
mix effects as Emerging Markets grew as a 
proportion of Total Revenue. Reported Gross 
Margin was impacted by the fair value 
adjustment to Alexion inventories. The fair 
value uplift unwind through Cost of sales in 
2023 was $114 million (2022: $3,848 million). 

Operatingexpenses
Reported Operating expenses increased by 
7% (CER: 8%) in the year to $30,690 million. 
Core Operating expenses increased by 7% 
(CER: 9%) to $24,545 million. 

Reported R&D expense increased by 12% 
(CER: 13%) to $10,935 million and Core R&D 
expense increased by 8% (CER: 9%) to 
$10,267 million. Both Reported and Core R&D 
expense were impacted by recent positive 
data readouts for several high priority 
medicines and increased investment in new 
platforms, technologies and capabilities. 
Reported R&D expense also includes 
intangible asset impairment charges of $417 
million; an increase of $322 million from 2022, 
which includes $244 million related to the 
impairment of the ALXN1840 intangible asset, 
following the decision to discontinue this 
development programme in Wilson disease. 

Reported SG&A expense increased by 4% 
(CER: 6%) to $19,216 million and Core SG&A 
expense increased by 7% (CER: 9%) to 
$13,739 million. Both Reported and Core 
SG&A expense increases were driven 
primarily by market development activities for 
launches. Reported SG&A expense was 
impacted by amortisation of intangible assets 
related to the Alexion acquisition and other 
acquisitions and collaborations. Reported 
SG&A expense was also impacted by a $510 
million charge to provisions relating to a legal 
settlement with Bristol-Myers Squibb and Ono 
Pharmaceutical, and a $425 million charge to 
provisions for product liability litigations related 
to Nexium and Prilosec. The prior year 
Reported SG&A expense was impacted by a 
$775 million legal settlement with Chugai 
Pharmaceutical Co. Ltd. 

Otheroperatingincomeandexpense
Reported Other operating income and expense 
in the year was up 161% (CER: 160%) to 
$1,340 million. Core Other operating income 
and expense in the year was up 186% (CER: 
186%) to $1,279 million. For 2023, both 
Reported and Core Other operating income 
and expense were impacted by a gain of 
$712 million on replacement of the contractual 
relationship between AstraZeneca, Sobi and 
Sanofi with a royalty relationship between 
Sanofi and Sobi and income of $241 million on 
the disposal of the US rights to Pulmicort 
Flexhaler. 

2022 included royalties and disposal 
proceeds on small divestments including the 
divestment of rights to Plendil. 

In accordance with our Collaboration Revenue 
definition in the Group Accounting Policies 
from page 152, proceeds from these 
divestments are recorded as Other operating 
income and expense and comprise the 
majority of Other operating income and 
expense for the year. 

Operatingprofit
Reported Operating profit increased by 118% 
(CER: 134%) to $8,193 million in the year. The 
Reported Operating Margin increased by nine 
percentage points (CER: 10) to 17.9% of Total 
Revenue. Core Operating profit grew by 9% 
(CER: 14%) in the year to $14,534 million. 

Netfinanceexpense
Reported Net finance expense increased by 
2% (CER: 1%) in the year to $1,282 million. 
Core Net finance expense increased by 1% 
(CER: decreased by 1%) in the year to 
$984 million. Reported Net finance expense 
was impacted by the discount unwind on 
acquisition-related liabilities. Core Net finance 
expense increased due to higher interest 
received on cash and short-term investments, 
broadly offset by higher rates on floating debt 
and bond issuances.

Profitbeforetax
Reported Profit before tax increased to 
$6,899 million (2022: $2,501 million). Core 
Profit before tax increased by 9% (CER: 15%) 
to $13,538 million. Pre-tax adjustments to 
arrive at Core Profit before tax amounted to 
$6,639 million in 2023 (2022: $9,870 million), 
comprising $6,341 million adjustments to 
Operating profit (2022: $9,593 million) and 
$298 million to Net finance expense (2022: 
$277 million).

EBITDA
EBITDA increased by 47% (CER: 55%) to 
$13,580 million in the year (2022: $9,237 
million) and was negatively impacted by the 
$114 million unwind of inventory fair value 
uplift recognised on the acquisition of Alexion.

Taxation
The Reported tax rate for the year was 14% 
and the Core tax rate in the year was 17% 
and included a favourable adjustment of 
$828 million to deferred taxes arising from 
a UK Group company undertaking a routine 
intragroup purchase of certain intellectual 
property which was offset by updates to tax 
liabilities following progress of reviews by tax 
authorities and administrative appeal 
processes, and derecognition of deferred tax 
assets following changes to forecast taxable 
income of specific subsidiaries.

The income tax paid for the year was 
$2,366 million. This was $1,428 million higher 
than the Reported tax charge for the year, 
which benefited from a net deferred tax credit 
of $1,507 million (2022: $2,428 million), relating 
to the aforementioned $828 million deferred 
tax credit on the intragroup purchase of 
certain intellectual property, intangible 
amortisation and impairments, and other 
deferred tax items, partially offset by updates 
to estimates of prior period tax liabilities 
following progress of reviews by tax 
authorities and administrative appeal 
processes, and the timing differences for cash 
tax payments. Additional information on these 
items is contained in Note 4 to the Financial 
Statements from page 164. 

We pay corporate income taxes, customs 
duties, excise taxes, stamp duties, 
employment and many other business taxes 
in all jurisdictions in which we operate. We 
also collect and pay employee taxes and 
other indirect taxes such as value-added tax 
in these jurisdictions. 

Totalcomprehensiveincome
Total comprehensive income increased by 
$4,279 million to a profit of $6,694 million in 
2023. Other comprehensive income, net of tax 
was $733 million, an increase of $1,611 million. 
This income was primarily driven by foreign 
exchange arising on consolidation gains of 
$608 million (2022: losses of $1,446 million) 
and tax credits on items that will not be 
reclassified to profit or loss of $101 million

Restructuring
Post Alexion Acquisition Group Review 
(PAAGR)
In conjunction with the acquisition of Alexion 
in 2021, the enlarged Group initiated a 
comprehensive review, aimed at integrating 
systems, structure and processes, optimising 
the global footprint and prioritising resource 
allocations and investments. These activities 
are expected to be substantially complete by 
the end of 2026, with a number of planned 
activities having commenced in late 2021 
and during 2022 and 2023. 

During 2023, the Group identified all remaining 
activities and finalised the scope of the 
programme. These additional activities, 
alongside updated estimates of the existing 
planned activities, have resulted in an increase 
to the expected one-time restructuring costs 
of $0.6 billion, of which an insignificant 
amount are non-cash costs, and an increase 
in capital investments of $0.7 billion. This 
includes the commencement of work on the 
planned upgrade of the Group’s Enterprise 
Resource Planning IT systems (Axial Project), 
which is expected to be substantially 
complete by the end of 2030, resulting in 
capital investments for software assets of 
$0.7 billion and one-time restructuring cash 
costs of $0.3 billion, over the full course of the 
project. Anticipated annual run-rate pre-tax 
benefits have increased by $0.5 billion, and 
are expected to be realised by the end of 
2026. This excludes significant strategic and 
compliance-related benefits resulting from the 
Axial Project, as a result of transforming core 
enterprise-wide processes, harmonising 
systems architecture and enabling future 
digital capabilities.

Consequently, the total programme activities 
are now anticipated to incur one-time 
restructuring costs of approximately $3.6 billion, 
of which approximately $2.5 billion are cash 
costs and $1.1 billion are non-cash costs, and 
capital investments of approximately $1.6 billion. 

Run-rate pre-tax benefits, before reinvestment, 
are now expected to be approximately 
$2.4 billion by the end of 2026. In line with 
established practice, restructuring costs will 
be excluded from our Core (non-GAAP) 
financial measures. 

During 2023, the Group has recorded 
restructuring charges of approximately 
$0.4 billion in relation to the PAAGR (2022: 
$0.7 billion), bringing the cumulative charges 
to date under this programme to $2.1 billion. 
Of these costs, $0.7 billion are non-cash 
costs arising primarily from impairments and 
accelerated depreciation on affected assets. 

As at 31 December 2023, the PAAGR has 
realised annual run-rate pre-tax benefits, 
before reinvestment, of $1.3 billion.

Other programmes 
The Global Post Pandemic New Ways of 
Working programme that was initiated in 
2020 in response to the changing business 
environment, accelerated by the COVID-19 
pandemic, is now substantially complete 
and has delivered changes that reflect the 
increasing utilisation of digitisation and 
technology, as well as the new ways of 
working that reflect the size, nature and 
footprint of commercial teams, enabling 
functions, R&D and operations. Costs 
incurred in 2023 and 2022 were insignificant. 

Legacy programmes include: the 2016 plan 
to redeploy investment to key disease areas, 
particularly Oncology; the centralisation of 
our global R&D footprint into three strategic 
centres; transformation of the IT organisation 
and closure of a number of manufacturing 
facilities; and the transformation of SG&A 
functions (principally Finance and HR). Net 
costs for legacy programmes in 2023 were 
$92 million (2022: $45 million). 

The aggregate restructuring charge incurred 
in 2023 across all our restructuring programmes 
was $467 million (2022: $717 million). Final 
estimates for programme costs, benefits and 
headcount impact in all functions are subject 
to completion of the requisite consultation in 
the various areas. 

Our priority, as we undertake these restructuring 
initiatives, is to work with our affected 
employees on the proposed changes, acting 
in accordance with relevant local consultation 
requirements and employment law.

Net debt
Net debt at 31 December 2023 was 
$22,510 million (2022: $22,923 million). 
At 31 December 2023, gross debt (interest-
bearing loans and borrowings) was 
$28,622 million (2022: $29,232 million). Of the 
gross debt outstanding, $5,400 million is due 
within one year (2022: $5,542 million). 

At 31 December 2023, Cash and cash 
equivalents and Other investments totalled 
$5,962 million (2022: $6,405 million). 

The Group had committed bank facilities of 
$6,875 million available to manage liquidity at 
31 December 2023. $2.0 billion of the 
commitments mature in February 2025. The 
maturity of the $4,875 million facilities was 
extended in February 2024 from April 2026 to 
April 2029. All facilities contain no financial 
covenants and were undrawn at 31 December 
2023. The Group regularly monitors the credit 
standing of the banks providing the facilities 
and currently does not anticipate any issue 
with drawing on the committed facilities 
should this be necessary. Advances under 
these facilities currently bear an interest rate 
per annum based on SOFR (Secured 
Overnight Financing Rate) plus a margin.

Acquisitions
In assessing whether an acquired set of 
assets and activities is a business or an asset, 
management will first elect whether to apply 
an optional concentration test to simplify the 
assessment. Where the concentration test is 
applied, the acquisition will be treated as the 
acquisition of an asset if substantially all of 
the fair value of the gross assets acquired 
(excluding cash and cash equivalents, 
deferred tax assets, and related goodwill) 
is concentrated in a single asset or group 
of similar identifiable assets. Where the 
concentration test is not applied, or is not 
met, a further assessment of whether the 
acquired set of assets and activities is a 
business will be performed.

Acquisitions treated as Business 
combinations
On 16 January 2023, AstraZeneca completed 
the acquisition of Neogene, a global clinical-
stage biotechnology company pioneering the 
discovery, development and manufacturing of 
next-generation T-cell receptor therapies 
(TCR-Ts). The purchase price allocation 
exercise has completed, with the fair value of 
total consideration determined at $267 million. 
Intangible assets of $100 million and goodwill 
of $158 million were recognised in the 
acquisition balance sheet, as well as a cash 
outflow of $189 million net of cash acquired.

1  Bank loans and other borrowings include interest charges payable in the period, as detailed in Note 28 to the Financial 

consideration and non-contingent 
consideration is payable to a maximum of 
$120 million. Neogene’s results have been 
consolidated into the Group’s results from 
16 January 2023.

On 16 November 2022, AstraZeneca completed 
the acquisition of 100% of the issued shares of 
LogicBio Therapeutics, Inc. (LogicBio), a 
clinical-stage genetic medicine company 
pioneering genome editing and gene delivery 
platforms to address rare and serious diseases 
from infancy through adulthood. The total 
consideration was $72 million. $68 million 
cash was paid on the completion date, with 
$4 million of outstanding options, which will be 
settled in cash, recorded in current Trade and 
other payables. LogicBio’s results have been 
consolidated into the Group’s results from 
16 November 2022. 

The acquisitions have been accounted for as 
business combinations using the acquisition 
method of accounting in accordance with 
IFRS 3 ‘Business Combinations’. 

Acquisitions treated as asset acquisitions
On 24 February 2023, AstraZeneca completed 
the acquisition of 100% of the issued shares 
of CinCor, for consideration of $1,268 million, 
which included intangible assets acquired of 
$780 million, $424 million of cash and cash 
equivalents, and $75 million of marketable 
securities. Contingent consideration of up to 
$496 million could be paid on achievement of 
regulatory milestones, and those liabilities will 
be recorded when milestones are triggered, or 
performance conditions have been satisfied. 

In September 2023, AstraZeneca completed 
the definitive purchase and licence agreement 
for a portfolio of preclinical rare disease gene 
therapy programmes and enabling technologies 
from Pfizer. The agreement has a total 
consideration of up to $1 billion consisting of a 
$300 million upfront payment and $700 million 
of contingent consideration, plus tiered 
royalties on sales. 

Commitments and contingencies
We have commitments and contingencies 
which are accounted for in line with Group 
Accounting Policies and are described in Note 
30 to the Financial Statements from page 204. 

We also have taxation contingencies. These 
are described in this Financial Review, in the 
Taxation section in the Critical accounting

 > In October 2018, we exercised our option 
over IPH2201 and simultaneously entered 
into a further multi-element transaction with 
Innate Pharma. Under the agreement, we 
paid $50 million to collaborate on, and 
acquire an option to license, IPH5201, a 
potentially first-in-class anti-CD39 mAb. 
Additionally, we paid $20 million to acquire 
options over four future programmes 
currently being developed by Innate Pharma, 
and paid €62.6 million to acquire a 9.8% 
stake in Innate Pharma. The $100 million 
option fee and $50 million premium paid 
over market price for the investment in 
Innate Pharma have been capitalised as 
intangible assets. The payment for future 
programmes will be expensed as R&D 
expenditure over four years.

We determine these business development 
transactions to be significant using a range of 
factors. We look at the specific circumstances 
of the individual arrangement and apply 
several quantitative and qualitative criteria. 
As we consider business development 
transactions to be an extension of our R&D 
strategy, the expected total value of 
development payments under the transaction 
and its proportion of our annual R&D spend, 
both of which are proxies for overall R&D 
effort and cost, are important elements of 
the determination of the significance. Other 
quantitative criteria we apply include, without 
limitation, expected levels of future sales, the 
possible value of milestone payments and 
the resources used for commercialisation 
activities (for example, the number of staff). 
Qualitative factors we consider include, 
without limitation, new market developments, 
new territories, new areas of research and 
strategic implications.

FinancialReview

Off balance sheet transactions and 
commitments
We have no off balance sheet arrangements 
and our derivative activities are non-speculative. 
The table on page 69 sets out our minimum 
contractual obligations at the year end.

Research and development collaboration 
payments
Details of future potential R&D collaboration 
payments are also included in Note 30 to the 
Financial Statements on page 204. As detailed 
in Note 30, payments to our partners may not 
become payable due to the inherent 
uncertainty in achieving the development and 
revenue milestones linked to the future 
payments. We may enter into further 
collaboration projects in the future that may 
include milestone payments and, as certain 
milestone payments fail to crystallise due to, 
for example, failure to obtain regulatory 
approval, unfavourable data from key studies, 
adverse reactions to the product candidate or 
indications of other safety concerns, they may 
be replaced by potential payments under new 
collaborations.

Investments, divestments and capital 
expenditure 
We have completed more than 60 major or 
strategically important business development 
transactions over the past three years.

The following strategic investment was made 
in 2023:

Eccogene
 > In November 2023, AstraZeneca and 

Eccogene entered into an exclusive licence 
agreement for AZD5004, an investigational 
oral once-daily GLP-1RA for the treatment 
of obesity, type-2 diabetes and other 
cardiometabolic conditions. Preliminary 
results from the Phase I trial have shown a 
differentiating clinical profile for AZD5004, 
with good tolerability and encouraging 
glucose and body weight reduction across 
the dose levels tested compared to 
placebo. Under the terms of the agreement, 
Eccogene received an initial upfront 
payment of $185 million and up to an 
additional $1.8 billion in future clinical, 
regulatory, and commercial milestones and 
tiered royalties. AstraZeneca is granted 
exclusive global rights for the development 
and commercialisation of AZD5004 for any 
indication in all territories except China, 
where Eccogene has the right to co-
develop and co-commercialise alongside 
AstraZeneca.

In addition to the business development 
transactions detailed under Collaboration 
Revenue from page 65 of this Financial 
Review, the following significant collaborations 
remain in the development phase:

Daiichi Sankyo 
 > In July 2020, AstraZeneca entered into 

a new global development and 
commercialisation agreement with Daiichi 
Sankyo for Dato-DXd, its proprietary 
trophoblast cell-surface antigen 2 (TROP2)-
directed ADC and potential new medicine 
for the treatment of multiple tumour types. 
AstraZeneca agreed to pay Daiichi Sankyo 
an upfront payment of $1 billion in staged 
payments: $350 million was due upon 
completion, with $325 million after 12 months 
and $325 million after 24 months from the 
effective date of the agreement. AstraZeneca 
also agreed to pay additional conditional 
amounts of up to $1 billion for the successful 
achievement of regulatory approvals and 
up to $4 billion for sales-related milestones. 
The transaction was accounted for as an 
intangible asset acquisition, recognised 
initially at the present value of non-contingent 
consideration, with any potential future 
milestone payments capitalised into the 
intangible asset as they are recognised. 
The companies will jointly develop and 
commercialise Dato-DXd worldwide, except 
in Japan where Daiichi Sankyo will retain 
exclusive rights. AstraZeneca and Daiichi 
Sankyo will share equally development 
and commercialisation expenses as well 
as profits relating to Dato-DXd worldwide, 
except for Japan where Daiichi Sankyo will 
be responsible for such costs and will pay 
AstraZeneca mid single-digit royalties. 
Daiichi Sankyo will record sales in the US, 
certain countries in Europe and certain 
other countries where Daiichi Sankyo has 
affiliates. Profits shared with AstraZeneca 
from those countries will be recorded as 
Alliance Revenue by AstraZeneca. 
AstraZeneca will record Product Sales in 
other countries worldwide, for which profits 
shared with Daiichi Sankyo will be recorded 
within Cost of sales. Daiichi Sankyo will 
manufacture and supply Dato-DXd. 

Innate Pharma
 > In April 2015, we entered into two oncology 
agreements with Innate Pharma: first, a 
licence which provides us with exclusive 
global rights to co-develop and 
commercialise IPH2201 in combination with 
Imfinzi; and, second, an option to license 
exclusive global rights to co-develop and 
commercialise IPH2201 in monotherapy 
and other combinations in certain treatment 
areas. We jointly fund Phase II studies with 
Innate Pharma and we lead the execution 
of these studies. In respect of these 
agreements, we made an initial payment 
to Innate Pharma of $250 million. The 
agreement also includes a Phase III 
initiation milestone of $100 million, as well 
as additional regulatory and sales-related 
milestones. We record all sales and pay 
Innate Pharma double-digit royalties on net 
sales. The arrangement includes the right 
for Innate Pharma to co-promote in Europe 
for an equal share of costs and income in 
the territory.

Currency impact
If foreign exchange rates for February 2024 to 
December 2024 were to remain at the average 
rates seen in January 2024, it is anticipated 
that 2024 Total Revenue and Core EPS for the 
year would incur a low single-digit adverse 
impact versus the performance at CER.

This commentary represents management’s 
current estimates and is subject to change. 
See the Cautionary statement regarding

Financialriskmanagement
Financial risk management policies
Insurance
Our risk management processes are 
described in Risk Overview from page 54. 
These processes enable us to identify risks 
that can be partly or entirely mitigated through 
the use of insurance. We focus our insurance 
resources on the most critical areas, or where 
there is a legal requirement, and where we 
can get the best value for money through 
structured and traditional insurance. We 
purchase an external multi-line insurance 
programme to mitigate against significant 
financial loss arising from core business risks. 

Treasury
The principal financial risks to which we are 
exposed are those arising from liquidity, 
interest rates, foreign currency and credit. We 
have a centralised treasury function to manage 
these risks in accordance with Board-approved 
policies. Note 28 to the Financial Statements 
from page 195 sets out the relevant policies 
and the way we manage these risks and our 
capital management objectives, as well as a 
sensitivity analysis of the Group’s exposure to 
exchange rate and interest rate movements. 

Capitalisationandshareholderreturn
Capitalisation
The total number of shares in issue at 
31 December 2023 was 1,550 million (2022: 
1,550 million). 

Shareholders’ equity increased by $2,106 
million to $39,143 million at the year end. 
Non-controlling interests were $23 million 
(2022: $21 million). 

Dividend and share repurchases
The Board has recommended a second 
interim dividend of $1.97 (156.0 pence, 
20.65 SEK) to be paid on 25 March 2024. 
This brings the full-year dividend to $2.90 
(227.8 pence, 30.29 SEK). Against Reported 
EPS, the Group had a dividend cover ratio of 
1.32:1 in 2023 (2022: 0.74:1). Against Core 
EPS, the Group had a dividend cover ratio of 
2.50:1 in 2023 (2022: 2.32:1). This dividend is 
consistent with the progressive dividend 
policy, by which, the Board intends to 
maintain or grow the dividend each year.

The Board regularly reviews its distribution 
policy and its overall financial strategy to 
continue to strike a balance between the 
interests of the business, our financial creditors 
and our shareholders. Having regard for 
business investment, funding the progressive 
dividend policy and meeting our debt service 
obligations, the Board currently believes it is 
appropriate to continue the suspension of the 
share repurchase programme which was 
announced in 2012.

The Board reviews the level of distributable 
reserves of the Parent Company annually and 
aims to maintain distributable reserves that 
provide adequate cover for dividend payments. 
At 31 December 2023, the overwhelming 
majority of the Profit and loss account reserve 
of $17,640 million (2022: all of the Profit and loss 
account reserve of $7,458 million) was available 
for distribution, subject to filing these Financial 
Statements with Companies House. When 
making a distribution to shareholders, the 
Directors determine profits available for 
distribution by reference to guidance on 
realised and distributable profits under the 
Companies Act 2006 issued by the Institute of 
Chartered Accountants in England and Wales 
and the Institute of Chartered Accountants of 
Scotland in April 2017.

The profits of the Parent Company have been 
received in the form of receivables due from 
subsidiaries. The availability of distributable 
reserves in the Parent Company is dependent 
on those receivables meeting the definition of 
qualifying consideration within the guidance, 
and in particular on the ability of subsidiaries 
to settle those receivables within a reasonable 
period of time. The Directors consider that, 
based on the nature of these receivables and 
the available cash resources of the Group 
and other accessible sources of funds, at 
31 December 2023, the overwhelming 
majority (2022: all) of the Company’s profit 
and loss reserves were available for 
distribution.

Futureprospects
As outlined earlier in this Annual Report, our 
strategic priorities support delivery of our 
Growth Through Innovation strategy and our 
Purpose: to push the boundaries of science to 
deliver life-changing medicines. 

In support of this, we made certain choices 
around our three strategic priorities: 

 > Science and Innovation
 > Growth and Therapy Area Leadership
 > People and Sustainability.

Full year 2024: additional commentary
Total Revenue is expected to increase by a 
low double-digit to low teens percentage. 
Core EPS is expected to increase by a low 
double-digit to low teens percentage.

Collaboration Revenue is expected to 
increase substantially, driven by success-
based milestones and certain anticipated 
transactions. Other operating income is 
expected to decrease substantially (2023 
included a $241m gain on the disposal of 
Pulmicort Flexhaler US rights, and a $712m 
one-time gain relating to updates to 
contractual arrangements with Sobi and 
Sanofi). The Core Tax rate is expected to be 
between 18-22%.

The Group is unable to provide guidance on a 
Reported basis because it cannot reliably 
forecast material elements of the Reported 
results, including any fair value adjustments 
arising on acquisition-related liabilities, 
intangible asset impairment charges and legal 
settlement provisions. Please refer to the 
Cautionary statement section regarding 
forward-looking statements on page 236.

FinancialReview 
continued

Criticalaccountingpoliciesandestimates
The Consolidated Financial Statements have 
been prepared in accordance with UK-adopted 
IAS and with the requirements of the Companies 
Act 2006 as applicable to companies reporting 
under those standards. The Consolidated 
Financial Statements also comply fully with IFRS 
Accounting Standards as issued by the IASB 
and IAS as adopted by the EU. The 
accounting policies employed are set out in 
the Group Accounting Policies section from 
page 152. In applying these policies, we make 
estimates and assumptions that affect the 
Reported amounts of assets and liabilities and 
disclosure of contingent assets and liabilities. 
The actual outcome could differ from those 
estimates. Some of these policies require a high 
level of judgement because the areas are 
especially subjective or complex.

We believe that the most critical accounting 
policies and significant areas of judgement and 
estimation are in the following areas and align 
with the accounting policies containing our key 
accounting judgements and significant 
accounting estimates as disclosed in the 
Financial Statements from page 152:

 > Revenue recognition – see Revenue 

Accounting Policy from page 152 and 
Note 1 on page 161

 > Expensing of internal development 

expenses – see Research and Development 
Policy from page 154

Rebates, chargebacks and returns in the US
When invoicing Product Sales in the US, we 
estimate the rebates and chargebacks that 
we expect to pay, which are considered to be 
estimates. These rebates typically arise from 
sales contracts with third-party managed 
care organisations, hospitals, long-term care 
facilities, group purchasing organisations 
and various federal or state programmes 
(Medicaid contracts, supplemental rebates, 
etc.). They can be classified as follows:

 > Chargebacks, where we enter into 

arrangements under which certain parties, 
typically hospitals, long-term care facilities, 
group purchasing organisations, the 
Department of Veterans Affairs, Public 
Health Service Covered Entities, and the 
Department of Defense, are able to buy 
products from wholesalers at the lower 
prices we have contracted with them. The 
chargeback is the difference between the 
price we invoice to the wholesaler and the 
contracted price charged by the wholesaler 
to the other party. Chargebacks are 
credited directly to the wholesalers.

 > Regulatory, including Medicaid and other 
federal and state programmes, where we 
pay rebates based on the specific terms 
of agreements with the US Department 
of Health and Human Services and with 
individual states, which include product 
usage and information on best prices and 
average market prices benchmarks.

 > Impairment review of Intangible assets – 

 > Contractual, under which entities such as 

see Note 10 on page 174

Business combinations and Goodwill Policy 
from page 156 and Note 27 from page 193

Revenue recognition
Product Sales are recorded at the invoiced 
amount (excluding inter-company sales and 
value-added taxes), less movements in 
estimated accruals for rebates and chargebacks 
given to managed care and other customers, 
which are a particular feature in the US and 
are considered to be key estimates. It is the 
Group’s policy to offer a credit note for all 
returns and to destroy all returned stock in all 
markets. Cash discounts for prompt payments 
are also discounted from sales. Sales are 
recognised when the control of the goods has 
been transferred to a third party, which is usually 
when title passes to the customer, either on 
shipment or on the receipt of goods by the 
customer, depending on local trading terms.

third-party managed care organisations are 
entitled to rebates depending on specified 
performance provisions, which vary from 
contract to contract.

The effects of these deductions on our US 
pharmaceuticals revenue and the movements 
on US pharmaceuticals revenue provisions 
are set out on this page.

Accrual assumptions are built up on a 
product-by-product and customer-by-
customer basis, taking into account specific 
contract provisions coupled with expected 
performance, and are then aggregated into a 
weighted average rebate accrual rate for each 
of our products. Accrual rates are reviewed 
and adjusted on an as needed basis. There 
may be further adjustments when actual 
rebates are invoiced based on utilisation 
information submitted to us (in the case of 
contractual rebates) and claims/invoices are 
received (in the case of regulatory rebates and 
chargebacks). We believe that we have made 
reasonable estimates for future rebates using 
a similar methodology to that of previous 
years. Inevitably, however, these estimates 
involve assumptions in respect of aggregate 
future sales levels, segment mix and 
customers’ contractual performance.

Overall adjustments between gross and net 
US Product Sales amounted to $18,607 million 
in 2023 (2022: $14,846 million) with the 
increase driven by our US Product Sales.

Cash discounts are offered to customers to 
encourage prompt payment. Accruals are 
calculated based on historical experience and 
are adjusted to reflect actual experience. Our 
revenue recognition policy is described within 
Group Accounting Policies from page 152. 

Industry practice in the US allows wholesalers 
and pharmacies to return unused stocks 
within six months of, and up to 12 months 
after, shelf-life expiry. The customer is credited 
for the returned product by the issuance of 
a credit note. Returned products are not 
exchanged for products from inventory and 
once a return claim has been determined to 
be valid and a credit note has been issued 
to the customer, the returned products are 
destroyed. At the point of sale in the US, we 
estimate the quantity and value of products 
which may ultimately be returned. Our returns 
accruals in the US are based on actual 
experience. Our estimate is based on the 
historical sales and returns information for 
established products together with market-
related information, such as estimated shelf 
life, product recall, and estimated stock levels 
at wholesalers, which we receive via third-
party information services. For newly 
launched products, we use rates based on 
our experience with similar products or a 
pre-determined percentage.

Sarbanes-OxleyActsection404
As a consequence of our Nasdaq listing, we 
are required to comply with those provisions 
of the Sarbanes-Oxley Act applicable to 
foreign issuers. Section 404 of the Sarbanes-
Oxley Act requires companies annually to 
assess and make public statements about 
the quality and effectiveness of their internal 
control over financial reporting. As regards 
Sarbanes-Oxley Act section 404, our approach 
is based on the Committee of Sponsoring 
Organizations (COSO) 2013 framework.

Our approach to the assessment has been to 
select key transaction and financial reporting 
processes in our largest operating units and 
a number of specialist areas (e.g. financial 
consolidation and reporting, treasury operations 
and taxation), so that, in aggregate, we have 
covered a significant proportion of the key 
lines in our Financial Statements. Each of 
these operating units and specialist areas has 
ensured that its relevant processes and 
controls are documented to appropriate 
standards, taking into account, in particular, 
the guidance provided by the US Securities 
and Exchange Commission (SEC).

We have also reviewed the structure and 
operation of our ‘entity level’ control 
environment. This refers to the overarching 
control environment, including structure of 
reviews, checks and balances that are 
essential to the management of a well 
controlled business.

Introduction

“ Good governance underpins 
any successful enterprise...”

 “This Report reviews 
AstraZeneca’s 
governance and the 
work of the Board’s 
Committees.”

well as the Sustainability Committee, had an 
important role considering the potential and 
enacted regulations by the US, EU and UK on 
sustainability reporting, as well as the ongoing 
assessments of double materiality topics for 
AstraZeneca under EU regulations, to ensure 
that we are prepared for new sustainability 
reporting regulations which you will see 
reflected in AstraZeneca’s 2024 Annual 
Report. The Sustainability Committee also 
reviewed progress against our Ambition Zero 
Carbon targets and programmes.

Euan and the Science Committee had a 
particularly busy year in reviewing our R&D 
strategy and science capabilities as well as 
studying the scientific case for the numerous 
acquisitions and licensing opportunities that 
were undertaken during 2023.

A particular responsibility of the Remuneration 
Committee in 2023 was to review and update 
our Remuneration Policy, which can be found 
from page 127 and will be proposed for 
approval by our shareholders at the AGM in 
April. In doing so, we are introducing some 
changes the Board believes are in the best 
interests of the Group and its shareholders, 
and which will incentivise management to 
deliver our ambitious strategy. 

Good governance underpins any successful 
enterprise and I look forward to continuing my 
role in ensuring that AstraZeneca’s future 
growth and prospects are accompanied and 
enabled by good governance overseen by a 
skilled and diverse Board of Directors.

Michel Demaré
Chair

It’s a pleasure to be introducing AstraZeneca’s 
Corporate Governance Report for the first 
time as Chair.

Our Strategic Report provides an update on 
how AstraZeneca is delivering its Growth 
Through Innovation strategy, including how we 
attract, retain and develop talented people as 
our employees. This Report reviews 
AstraZeneca’s governance and the work of 
the Board’s Committees.

I would like to begin by thanking my fellow 
Directors for the support they have given me 
in my first year as Chair and welcoming Anna 
Manz who became a Non-Executive Director 
and member of the Audit Committee in 
September. She brings extensive cross-sector 
business skills and knowledge to the Board, 
having held international roles in North 
America and Asia Pacific and served as an 
executive and non-executive in large, listed 
companies.

I also want to recognise the role that all the 
Directors play in carrying out their 
responsibilities as members of our Board 
Committees. I am particularly grateful to the 
chairs of the Committees for the diligent and 
committed way in which they carry out their 
duties, especially Philip Broadley who, in 
addition to his important role as Chair of the 
Audit Committee, performs the role of our 
senior independent Non-Executive Director. 
Finally, I would like to thank Euan Ashley who 
assumed the role as Chair of the Science 
Committee during the year.

I would urge readers to read the reports from 
the individual Committee Chairs that give an 
indication of the depth and breadth of their 
work on behalf of shareholders. This 
Governance Report also reports on how we 
consider the interests of our stakeholders and 
engage with them in determining our strategy.

The Audit Committee has a key role in 
monitoring the integrity of our financial 
reporting and management of risk. Cyber risk 
and cyber security have been, and continue to 
be, a particular focus of their activity in recent 
years. During 2023, the Audit Committee as

Additional Information

The Directors are collectively responsible 
for the success of the Group. The Board 
maintains and periodically reviews a list 
of matters that can only be approved by the 
Board. Matters that have not been expressly 
reserved to the Board in this way are 
delegated to the CEO or one of the Board’s 
five Committees. The diagram below 
illustrates this governance structure. 

The Board’s responsibilities include setting 
our strategy and policies, overseeing risk 
and corporate governance, and monitoring 
progress towards meeting our objectives and 
annual plans. It is accountable to our 
shareholders for the proper conduct of the 
business and our long-term success, and 
seeks to represent the interests of all 
stakeholders. 

The CEO, CFO and SET take the lead in 
developing our strategy; proposals are 
reviewed and constructively challenged by 
the Board, before the strategy is approved.

Governance structure

The Board has delegated some of its powers to the CEO and operates with the assistance of five Committees:

1. Board leadership and 
Company purpose 
A. Board’s role 
The Board’s role is to promote the long-term 
sustainable success of the Company. The 
Directors’ diverse range of skills, experience 
and industry knowledge, and ability to 
exercise independent and objective 
judgement, help the Board to operate 
effectively in its oversight of delivery of the 
Group’s strategy, generation of shareholder 
value and contributions to wider society. 

The Board’s effective operation is 
underpinned by a sound governance 
structure, described on page 77. Through 
a programme of regular Board and Board 
Committee meetings, Directors receive 
information on AstraZeneca’s financial 
performance, the R&D pipeline and critical 
business issues. The Board is accountable 
to our shareholders for the proper conduct 
of the business and our long-term success 
and seeks to represent the interests of 
all stakeholders. 

B. Purpose, culture and strategy
The Board believes that our Purpose, to push 
the boundaries of science to deliver life-
changing medicines, positions AstraZeneca 
for long-term sustainable success. 

Our Code of Ethics and our Values underpin 
the behaviours that support our culture.

G. Board composition, independence and 
division of responsibilities 
The composition of the Board is set out on 
pages 78 and 79. The majority of the Board 
consists of independent Non-Executive 
Directors. Directors’ independence is 
considered annually by the Board, as 
described on page 83. 

The Board is responsible for setting our 
strategy and policies, overseeing risk and 
corporate governance, and monitoring 
progress towards meeting our objectives and 
annual plans. The Board conducts an annual 
review of the Group’s overall strategy.

C. Resources and controls 
The Board ensures that the necessary 
resources are in place to help the Company 
meet its objectives and measure its 
performance against them. 

The Group Internal Audit and Compliance 
functions provide quarterly reports to the 
Audit Committee on their activities and 
annual reviews of key themes, processes 
and systems (including arrangements for 
whistleblowing). The Board has full oversight 
of these matters by way of the Audit 
Committee Chair’s reports to the Board after 
each Committee meeting. Board members 
are also able to access the information 
provided to the Audit Committee.

The Board has a formal system in place for 
Directors to declare a conflict, or potential 
conflict, of interest.

D. Stakeholder engagement 
The Board aims to ensure a good dialogue is 
maintained with shareholders, so that their 
views are understood and considered. The 
Board also engages with and considers wider 
stakeholder groups, including the workforce, 
in its decision making. 

E. Workforce policies 
Based on our Values, expected behaviours 
and key policy principles, the Code of Ethics 
empowers employees to make decisions in 
the best interests of the Group, the Company, 
society and the patients we serve. It is 
applicable to the Group worldwide, including 
the Board.

2. Division of responsibilities 
F. Chair of the Board
Michel Demaré, our Non-Executive Chair, 
is responsible for the Board’s overall 
effectiveness in directing the Company. 
Mr Demaré was first appointed to the 
Board in 2019 and was considered to be 
independent on his appointment as Chair 
in April 2023. 

The Directors are collectively responsible for 
the success of the Group. The roles of the 
Board, Board Committees, Chair, senior 
independent Non-Executive Director and CEO 
are documented, as are the Board’s reserved 
powers and delegated authorities. The 
Board’s responsibilities and the governance 
structure by which it delegates authority are 
outlined in the Corporate Governance 
Overview on page 77. 

The Board maintains a list of matters that are 
reserved to, and can only be approved by, the 
Board. These include: the appointment, 
termination and remuneration of any Director; 
approval of the annual budget; approval of any 
item of fixed capital expenditure or any proposal 
for the acquisition or disposal of an investment 
or business which exceeds $300 million; the 
raising of capital or loans by the Company 
(subject to certain exceptions); the giving of 
any guarantee in respect of any borrowing of 
the Company; and allotting shares of the 
Company. Matters that have not been 
expressly reserved to the Board are delegated 
to the Committees of the Board or the CEO. 

H. Non-Executive Directors’ role 
and time commitment 
The Non-Executive Directors exercise 
objective judgement in respect of Board 
decisions, providing scrutiny and challenge 
and holding management to account. 
Non-Executive Directors offer strategic 
guidance and specialist advice based on their 
breadth of experience and knowledge. The 
Non-Executive Directors regularly meet 
without the Executive Directors or other 
management present.

Corporate Governance Report
Compliance with the UK 
Corporate Governance Code continued

The Company’s senior independent Non-
Executive Director serves as a sounding 
board for the Chair and as an intermediary for 
the other Directors when necessary. The 
senior independent Non-Executive Director is 
also available to shareholders if they have 
concerns that contact through the normal 
channels of Chair or Executive Directors has 
failed to resolve, or for which such contact is 
inappropriate. Philip Broadley was appointed 
senior independent Non-Executive Director on 
1 March 2021. 

As well as their work in relation to formal 
Board and Board Committee meetings, 
Non-Executive Directors commit time 
throughout the year to meetings and 
telephone calls with various levels of executive 
management and other key stakeholders, 
visits to AstraZeneca’s sites throughout the 
world (whether in person or virtually) and, for 
new Directors, induction sessions and site 
visits. The Chair and individual Board 
members ensure that Board members’ time 
commitment to the Company is sufficient to 
fulfil their duties as Directors and fully 
discharge their obligations to shareholders, 
particularly in the case of the Chairs of Board 
Committees. For the Chair of the Board, 
generally, as a basic commitment, it is 
expected that they would need to devote 
about 40% of their time or the equivalent of 
not less than 90 days per annum in the 
fulfilment of their duties.

When contemplating taking up additional 
appointments, Non-Executive Directors 
consult the Chair to ensure thought is given to 
any potential impact on their time commitment 
to AstraZeneca. Careful consideration is given 
to the nature of the potential appointment and 
the type of company involved (for example, 
whether the company is a public listed 
company or privately held), to help assess the 
likely time requirement. For significant 
additional appointments, the full Board would 
typically be involved in this process. 

    For more information on:

Committee Report, see from 
page 90.

 External audit, see page 96 
and Note 31 to the Financial 
Statements, on page 210.

our business risks, our 
procedures for identifying our 
emerging risks, how we describe 
our Principal Risks and 
uncertainties, and our Viability 
statement, see Risk management 
and controls on the following 
page, and the Risk Overview 
from	page	54.

 The Remuneration Committee’s 
work, see page 102.

In 2023, Aradhana Sarin was appointed as 
an independent director of Anheuser-Busch 
InBev and Philip Broadley was appointed as a 
Non-Executive Director and Chair-designate 
of Lancashire Holdings Limited. These 
appointments were considered and approved 
by the Board on the basis that they would not 
prevent or reduce the ability of either to 
perform their roles for AstraZeneca to the 
required standard.

The performance of the Non-Executive 
Directors is assessed annually as part of the 
Board’s performance evaluation, as described 
on page 89. 

Subject to specific Board approval, Executive 
Directors and SET members may accept 
external appointments as non-executive 
directors of other companies and retain any 
related fees paid to them, provided that such 
appointments are not considered by the 
Board to prevent or reduce the ability of the 
executive to perform his or her role within the 
Group to the required standard.

I. Company Secretary 
The Company Secretary is responsible to the 
Chair for ensuring that all Board and Board 
Committee meetings are properly conducted, 
that the Directors receive appropriate 
information prior to meetings to enable them 
to make an effective contribution and that 
governance requirements are considered and 
implemented. The 2023 Board performance 
evaluation set out on page 89 provides details 
of the effective operation of the Board.

3. Composition, succession and evaluation 
J. Appointments and succession planning 
The Nomination and Governance Committee 
and, where appropriate, the full Board, 
regularly review the composition of the Board 
and the status of succession to both SET- and 
Board-level positions. Directors have regular 
contact with, and access to, succession 
candidates for SET positions. The Committee 
also recognises the importance of diversity 
when considering potential appointments. 

There is a formal, rigorous and transparent 
procedure for appointments to the Board. The 
Nomination and Governance Committee 
Report details changes in Board composition 
during the year, and the appointment and 
induction processes, from page 90.

In accordance with Article 66 of the Articles of 
Association of the Company (the Articles), all 
Directors retire at each AGM and may offer 
themselves for re-election by shareholders. 
The Notice of AGM will give details of those 
Directors seeking election or re-election.

K. Skills, experience and knowledge 
When the Nomination and Governance 
Committee reviews the composition of the 
Board and its Committees, it uses a matrix 
that records the skills and experience of 
current Board members and compares this 

with the skills and experience it believes are 
appropriate to the Company’s overall business 
and strategic needs, both now and in 
the future. 

The Committee is also mindful of Directors’ 
lengths of tenure and the need to refresh 
Board membership over time.

L. Board evaluation 
In 2023, the Board undertook an internal 
Board performance evaluation. More 
information on the evaluation process, 
including the results and actions taken, can be 
found on page 89.

4. Audit, risk and internal control 
M. Internal and external audit 
The Audit Committee is responsible for 
reviewing the relationship and independence 
of our external auditor, 
PricewaterhouseCoopers LLP (PwC). The 
Committee maintains a policy for the 
pre-approval of all audit services and 
audit-related services undertaken by the 
external auditor, the principal purpose of 
which is to ensure that the independence of 
the external auditor is not impaired. A tender 
of audit services will be conducted in 2024 
with any change taking effect from 2027. 
More information can be found on page 101.

The Audit Committee also reviews the 
independence and effectiveness of Group 
Internal Audit.

N. Fair, balanced and 
understandable assessment 
The Board considers this Annual Report, 
taken as a whole, to be fair, balanced and 
understandable, and provides the information 
necessary for shareholders to assess 
AstraZeneca’s position and performance, 
business model and strategy. The Board’s 
assessment is described on page 100. 

The Board and the Audit Committee review 
the Company’s quarterly financial results 
announcements to ensure they present a fair, 
balanced and understandable assessment of 
the Company’s position and prospects to 
shareholders.

O. Risk management 
The Board is responsible for the Company’s 
risk management system and internal 
controls, and their effectiveness. The Board 
delegates some responsibilities for risk 
management oversight to the Audit 
Committee, such as quarterly reviews of the 
Company’s principal and key active risks. 
During 2023, the Directors continued to review 
the effectiveness of our system of controls, 
risk management (including a robust 
assessment of the emerging and principal 
risks) and high-level internal control 
processes. This included an annual 
Governance and Assurance Report to all 
Directors, which is considered in detail by the 
Audit Committee and reviewed by the Board.

Additional Information

Any areas of concern are highlighted in the 
Audit Committee Chair’s update to Directors 
at the relevant Board meeting and discussed 
by the Board. The Report is based on a full 
year-end review of the Company’s risk and 
control processes (incorporating financial, 
operational and compliance controls) and 
findings from assurance processes. 

The Directors believe that the Group maintains 
an effective, embedded system of internal 
controls and complies with the FRC’s 
guidance entitled ‘Guidance on Risk 
Management, Internal Control and Related 
Financial and Business Reporting’.

5.	Remuneration	
P. Remuneration policies and practices 
The Remuneration Committee is responsible 
for determining, approving and reviewing the 
Company’s global remuneration principles 
and frameworks, to ensure that they support 
the strategy of the Company and are designed 
to promote long-term sustainable success. 

Non-Executive Directors’ independence
In December 2023, the Board considered the 
independence of the Non-Executive Directors, 
other than the Chair of the Board, for the 
purposes of the Code and the Nasdaq Listing 
Rules. Taking into account the recommendations 
set out in the Code and the Nasdaq Listing 
Rules, the Board considers that all the 
Non-Executive Directors except Marcus 
Wallenberg are independent. Marcus 
Wallenberg was appointed as a Director of 
Astra in May 1989 and subsequently became 
a Director of the Company in 1999. He is a 
Non-Executive Director of Investor AB, which 
has a 3.33% interest in the issued share 
capital of the Company as at 7 February 2024. 
For these reasons – his overall length of tenure 
and relationship with a significant shareholder 
– the Board does not believe that he can be 
determined independent under the Code. 
However, the Board believes that he has 
brought, and continues to bring, considerable 
business experience and makes a valuable 
contribution to the work of the Board. 

Q. Developing executive remuneration policy 
The Remuneration Committee routinely 
reviews the Directors’ Remuneration Policy 
and executive remuneration arrangements to 
ensure they continue to promote the delivery 
of the long-term strategy and support the 
Company’s ability to recruit and retain 
executive talent to deliver against that 
strategy. The Committee also considers 
remuneration arrangements in the context of 
corporate governance best practice and 
arrangements for the wider workforce, and 
regularly consults with its major investors on 
remuneration proposals. No Director is 
involved in determining their own 
remuneration arrangements or outcomes.

R. Remuneration outcomes and 
independent judgement 
To ensure it maintains independent judgement 
when determining remuneration outcomes, 
the Remuneration Committee considers a 
range of data including detailed business and 
individual performance information. The 
Committee also consults with other Board 
Committees to utilise their expertise when 
determining performance outcomes.

Further information on Directors’ 
appointments
Chair of the Board
Mr Demaré was appointed as Chair of 
the Board at the conclusion of the 2023 AGM, 
following Mr Johansson’s retirement, and he 
was considered independent upon appointment. 

As well as being a Non-Executive Director 
of AstraZeneca and Chair of the Board’s 
Sustainability Committee, Nazneen Rahman 
is the Director of the Sustainable Medicines 
Partnership (SMP), a multi-stakeholder, 
not-for-profit collaboration with the aim of 
advancing the environmental sustainability of 
medicines. AstraZeneca is a strategic 
collaborator in the SMP. Dr Rahman has 
recused herself from acting as the lead 
contact for the SMP in its relationship with 
AstraZeneca, and this relationship, including 
project work and overall programme 
management, is handled by other members 
of the SMP team. 

Risk management and controls
Global Compliance and Group Internal 
Audit (GIA) 
Through our compliance programme and 
three lines of defence risk management 
framework (line management; Risk and 
Compliance functions; GIA), Global 
Compliance helps the Group achieve its 
priorities and do business the right way. 
It takes a global approach that addresses 
key risk areas, including those related to 
third parties and anti-bribery/anti-corruption. 
Its work helps us to reinforce compliant 
behaviours through our Code of Ethics, 
policies, training, advice and guidance. 
We also conduct risk assessment activities 
and foster a culture where individuals can 
raise concerns.

We take alleged compliance breaches and 
concerns seriously. We investigate and take 
appropriate disciplinary and remediation 
action to address and prevent reoccurrence 
through internal functions and external 
advisers. Depending on breach severity, the 
Group may need to disclose and/or report the 
incident to a regulatory or government 
authority.

Global Compliance provides assurance 
insights to the Audit Committee on 
compliance matters. GIA carries out a range 
of audits and periodically reviews the 
assurance activities of other Group functions.

The results from these activities are reported 
to the Audit Committee. Global Compliance 
and GIA share outcomes and coordinate 
reporting on compliance matters throughout 
the organisation. GIA is established by the 
Audit Committee on behalf of the Board and 
acts as an independent and objective 
assurance function guided by a philosophy of 
adding value to improve the operational 
control framework of the Group. The scope of 
GIA’s responsibilities encompasses, but is not 
limited to, the examination and evaluation of 
the adequacy and effectiveness of the 
Group’s governance, risk management and 
internal control processes in relation to the 
Group’s defined goals and objectives. 

Among others, internal control objectives 
considered by GIA include:

 > Compliance with significant policies, plans, 

procedures, laws and regulations. 

 > Consistency of operations or programmes 
with established objectives and goals, and 
effective performance. 
 > Safeguarding of assets.

Based on its activity, GIA is responsible for 
reporting significant risk exposures and 
control issues identified to the Board and to 
senior management, including fraud risks, 
governance issues and other matters needed 
or requested by the Audit Committee. It may 
also evaluate specific operations at the 
request of the Audit Committee or 
management, as appropriate.

Corporate Governance Report
Connecting with our stakeholders  
continued

In addition to the principal stakeholders described on pages 84 and 85, the Board considers the following stakeholder groups important for the 
business operations and strategic direction of the Company.

Community
Wherever we work in the world, we aim to make a 
positive impact on people and the communities in 
which they live through our community investment.

We aim to advance patient health, increase access 
to care, drive science innovation and build healthy 
and resilient communities for all.

Employees
Successfully acquiring, retaining and developing a 
talented and diverse workforce is critical to 
achieving our 2030 Bold Ambition. Our employees 
are a key part of our strategy and we are committed 
to being a great place to work. More information is 
included on pages 44 and 45.

Health authorities 
We engage regulators globally about the 
manufacture, development, review, approval and 
marketing of our products.

How the Board engages with stakeholders

The stakeholder table on pages 84 and 85 
sets out management’s main interactions with 
certain key stakeholders. Feedback from 
these interactions is provided to the Board in 
a variety of ways, which allows the Board to 
understand the key interests of stakeholders 
and consider them in its decision-making 
process. 

The Board undertakes additional direct 
engagement with stakeholders to better 
understand their interests and concerns, so 
these can be factored into its decision making.

Examples of the Board’s engagement are set 
out in the following columns. Information on 
how stakeholders and other factors were 
considered in the Board’s principal decisions 
in 2023 is set out on the following page.

Full Board/Other
 > During 2023, a number of Directors, 

including the Chair, the CEO and the CFO, 
met investors at roadshows and in 
one-on-one meetings.

 > The Chair hosted receptions focused on 

shareholder engagement, including events 
in the UK and Sweden.

 > The 2023 AGM was held in London, which 
allowed those shareholders able to attend 
to interact with, and ask questions of, the 
Board. All Directors were present at the 
meeting.

    For more information on how the 
Management and the Board have 
considered Modern Slavery, 
see the Audit Committee report 
from page 94, Human Rights 
on	page	45	and	AstraZeneca’s	
Modern Slavery Act Statement, 
which is available on our website, 
www.astrazeneca.com.

Governments
AstraZeneca partners closely with governments 
around the world to promote health, support 
healthcare research and innovation, facilitate 
equitable access to innovative care solutions, and 
build resilient and sustainable healthcare systems.

Multilateral and non-governmental organisations 
(NGOs) 
AstraZeneca partners with multilateral organisations 
and NGOs to deliver science-based health 
programming that addresses global health issues 
and supports the delivery of the UN Sustainable 
Development Goals. AstraZeneca’s commitment to 
reduce health inequity has also been demonstrated 
by donations to support patients in medically 
underserved communities and humanitarian settings 
through disaster relief efforts.

Media
An active and constructive relationship with the 
media is important to build trust with the Company’s 
key stakeholders by transparently reporting on the 
Group’s activities, including the results of key trials 
and business updates, as well as seeking to 
enhance and protect the reputation of the 
organisation.

Suppliers and third-party providers
AstraZeneca collaborates with a broad range of 
partners to support the development, manufacturing 
and delivery of life-changing medicines to patients 
across the world. Data led and technology driven, 
the Global Procurement function facilitates 
collaboration with diverse and ethical suppliers, 
pursuing some of the most ambitious sustainability 
targets in the industry to dramatically reduce carbon 
emissions throughout the supply chain. 

 > Investor reports and financial analysts’ 

consensus data are made available to the 
Board. Feedback is regularly provided to 
the Board by management on their 
interactions with investors. The Chair also 
hosted an annual reception focused on 
investor engagement.

 > The CEO and the CFO, along with other 

members of management, met 
governmental agencies and regulators to 
discuss matters including the pricing of 
medicines and equitable access.
 > The Board held one of its scheduled 

meetings during 2023 at AstraZeneca’s site 
in Tokyo, Japan and another at its site in 
Gaithersburg, MD, US. During the meetings, 
the Board met employees, including 
scientists and commercial teams, and 
hosted ‘townhall’ meetings. During the 
visits, the Chair also met with external 
stakeholders, including patient advocacy 
groups, NGOs and US government staff 
and officials through a series of meetings 
and roundtable discussions.

 > The CEO attended a number of scientific 

conferences in 2023, relevant to the 
Company’s main areas of R&D and 
Commercial activity.

 > Members of the Audit Committee visited 

the Speke, UK site where they met with the 
site leadership team, branding team, 
AstraZeneca Speke graduates and 
apprentices and hosted a ‘townhall’ 
meeting. The Committee also visited the 
AstraZeneca and Alexion UK marketing 
company site in 2023.

 > The CEO and senior leaders met with 15 

governments and engaged at 40 events at 
COP28, highlighting the interconnection 
between climate action, health resilience 
and equity, and demonstrating the action at 
scale the Company is taking on this agenda. 

 > The Chair of the Audit Committee took part 
in the following visits during 2023: a virtual 
visit to the AstraZeneca marketing company 
in Taiwan; in-person visits to the Gulf 
Cooperation Council (GCC) cluster in Dubai 
to meet with the MEA area leadership and 
GCC leadership teams; visit to the Chennai 
Global Innovation & Technology Centre which 
included meetings with the site leadership 
team and an employee ‘townhall’ meeting; 
and finally, a visit to the AstraZeneca India 
marketing company which also included 
meetings with senior leadership and an 
employee ‘townhall’ meeting.

 > Members of the Science Committee visited 
the AstraZeneca site in Cambridge, UK for 
a two-day meeting which included a lab 
visit to the Functional Genomics Centre on 
the first day. This was followed by a poster 
session with UK scientists from 
AstraZeneca and one-to-one meetings with 
global R&D leaders. In the evening, Science 
Committee members had informal 
discussions with meeting presenters from 
R&D. The second day included a lunch with 
the Directors, with each Science Committee 
member hosting a table of AstraZeneca 
scientists, including rising stars nominated 
by functions.

 > The Chair of the Remuneration Committee 
met with investors who hold approximately 
50% of the Company’s issued share capital 
and with three proxy advisers to discuss the 
proposals for the 2024 Directors’ 
Remuneration Policy and its implementation 
for the Executive Directors in 2024. For 
further information, see the Remuneration 
Report on page 102. 

 > The CEO, CFO and the Chair, regularly 

engaged with employees through in-person 
and online events, including ‘Ask me 
anything’ and ‘fireside chats’ sessions. 
Employees had the opportunity to ask 
questions in advance or during sessions.

Set out below are examples of how key stakeholders, Section 172(1) duties and other matters are considered by the Board when making its 
Principal Decisions in 2023. 

Principal Decisions in 2023

2023 Group Funding Plan
In January 2023, the Board reviewed and 
approved the Group’s 2023 funding plan. 

The Board considered: investors; and the 
long-term success of the Company.

How the Board had regard to these matters:
 > Reviewed the expected funding 

requirements for the year ahead as well as 
the medium- and long-term funding and 
liquidity prospects.

 > Discussed the Group’s capital allocation 
priorities, the long-term strategy and the 
measures required to deliver the strategy, 
including investment in the pipeline and 
potential external acquisitions to further 
strengthen the pipeline. The Board 
considered the benefit of these investments 
for patients and investors, alongside the 
potential impact of acquiring debt.

 > Considered the Group’s liquidity position 

and the expectations of investors regarding 
the progressive dividend policy.

Board Committees’ composition 
and succession planning
During 2023, the Board reviewed and made 
the following appointments:

 > Appointment of Michel Demaré as Chair of 
the Nomination and Governance Committee.

 > Appointment of Nazneen Rahman as a 

member of the Remuneration Committee.
 > Appointment of Euan Ashley as Chair of the 

Science Committee.

 > Appointment of Euan Ashley as a member 

of the Nomination and Governance 
Committee.

 > Appointment of Anna Manz as a Non-
Executive Director and member of the 
Audit Committee.

The Board considered: investors; the long-term 
success of the Company; and maintaining 
high standards of business conduct.

How the Board had regard for these matters:
 > Engaged with a number of AstraZeneca’s 

largest shareholders for them to hear about 
the search processes and to understand 
their views.

 > Considered the Board’s diversity, time 

commitments of the candidates and other 
relevant UK Corporate Governance Code 
provisions, as well as other Board-level 
succession planning considerations.
 > Reviewed the experience of potential 
candidates and met those who were 
shortlisted to evaluate which individuals had 
the skills required to support management 
in the continued delivery of value to 
shareholders and life-changing medicines 
to patients, while also maintaining high 
standards of business conduct.

 > Considered the succession requirements of 

the Board, the length of tenure of the 
current Non-Executive Directors and the 
independence requirements as set out in 
the UK Corporate Governance Code, and 
the importance of ensuring a smooth and 
orderly transition. 

 > Considered the continuity and reassurance 
the appointments provided to management 
and investors, and had regard to the likely 
consequences of the decision in the 
long term and the interests of those 
most affected.

Acquisitions and collaborations 
to strengthen the pipeline 
During 2023, the Board considered, and 
approved, a number of transactions to 
strengthen the Group’s pipeline and 
accelerate the development of potentially 
life-changing medicines. These included the 
acquisition of CinCor Pharma; the acquisition 
of a rare disease gene therapy portfolio and 
technologies from Pfizer; the research and 
collaboration agreement with Quell 
Therapeutics; the approval of the equity 
investment and global research and 
collaboration agreement in cell and gene 
therapy with Cellectis; the approval of the 
in-licensing of AZD5004 from Eccogene; the 
acquisition of Gracell Biotechnologies; and 
the acquisition of Icosavax. 

The Board considered: investors; the 
long-term success of the Company; 
employees; patients; and maintaining high 
standards of business conduct.

How the Board had regard to these matters:
 > Reviewed the unmet medical need and 
considered how the transactions would 
further strengthen the Group’s pipeline.
 > Considered the benefits to patients if the 

Group was able to accelerate the 
development of novel treatments, which 
could potentially deepen clinical responses 
and improve patient outcomes.

 > Considered the financial impact of the 

transactions on the Group’s viability and 
capital allocation priorities, alongside the 
financial benefits from the acquisitions if the 
technologies were successful.

Divestment of Pulmicort Flexhaler in the US
During 2023, the Board approved the 
divestment of Pulmicort Flexhaler in the US 
to Cheplapharm.

The Board considered: investors; the 
long-term success of the Company; patients; 
and maintaining high standards of 
business conduct.

How the Board had regard to these matters:
 > Considered the Company’s long-term 

strategy, the status of Pulmicort intellectual 
property in the US and the potential impact 
this may have on revenue, as well as the 
investment required in the pipeline to 
ensure the development of further life-
changing medicines.

 > Recognised the importance in ensuring that 
appropriate arrangements were in place to 
ensure the continued supply of medicines 
to patients.

 > Considered the financial benefit of the 
divestment and how this could be 
reinvested, to further benefit patients 
and shareholders.

Settlement of patent litigation
In July 2023, the Board approved the 
settlement of the patent litigation with 
Bristol-Myers Squibb and related parties 
relating to Imfinzi and Imjudo. 

The Board considered: investors; the 
long-term success of the Company; and 
maintaining high standards of business conduct.

How the Board had regard to these matters:
 > Reviewed the financial impact of the 

settlement and the potential benefits and 
risks of continuing with the litigation.

 > Considered the settlement value compared 
to the cost of continued litigation and the 
potential size of damages which were 
being sought.

 > The time and efforts required from 

management in continuing to defend the 
litigation and the potential distraction this 
could create.

Board’s reserved powers and delegation 
of authority to the CEO
In May 2023, the Board reviewed its reserved 
powers and delegation of authority to the 
CEO, and made the following changes:

briefed on relevant transactions with a value 
exceeding the previous threshold but below 
the newly approved threshold. 

 > Considered the overall Group materiality 

threshold applied by AstraZeneca’s 
auditors, PwC, in its audit work when

AstraZeneca’s reputation), the Chair and CEO. 

Engaging with our workforce
AstraZeneca is committed to being a great 
place to work. Engagement with employees is 
an important element in ensuring an 
environment in which all employees are 
respected, where openness is valued, 
diversity celebrated and every voice heard. 
We rely on our global workforce to uphold our 
Values, deliver our strategic priorities and 
work to sustain and improve short- and 
long-term performance. For AstraZeneca, 
‘global workforce’ includes our full-time and 
part-time employees, fixed-term workers and 
external contractors working full- or part-time, 
anywhere in the world.

The Directors believe that the Board as a 
whole should be responsible for engaging 
with and understanding the views of the 
workforce. Consequently, the Board has 
chosen not to implement any of the three 
methods set out in the Code. Instead, it uses 
various mechanisms and long-standing 
communication channels in place across the 
Group that enable and facilitate engagement 
with the global workforce. These include the 
Board’s review of the global workforce Pulse 
survey and the biannual Workforce Culture 
and Employee Engagement Report; Board 
members hosting ‘townhall’ meetings for the 
workforce, including Q&A sessions; and 
review of data relating to talent, development, 
inclusion and diversity initiatives, and online 
social media channels. Directors also visit our 
sites and carry out virtual engagements, 
which facilitate understanding of business 
operations and also provide opportunities for 
interactions between Directors and the 
workforce, including engagement with 
high-potential employees. Where required, 
issues or concerns raised by the workforce 
are fed back to management and discussed 
by the Board. Whenever relevant, the Board 
considers the views of the workforce and the 
potential impact on the workforce when it 
makes key decisions.

Engaging with the wider workforce can present 
challenges due to the size of the workforce and 
the global footprint, as well as the variety of 
roles throughout the organisation. In addition to 
in-person engagements, virtual engagements 
help to ensure that individual Directors, as 
well as Board and Board Committees, have 
the opportunity to meet with a range of 
employees from across the global workforce, 
and to hear and understand their views.

The Board believes that this alternative 
approach continues to be the best model of 
engagement for the Group and ensures that 
the Board has access to the views of the 
workforce regardless of location and provides 
meaningful information and data that the 
Board can use when considering the impact 
of strategic decisions on employees. 
Additionally, the chosen mechanisms allow all 
Directors to engage with a wider cross-
section of the global workforce.

Workforce culture
During 2023, the Board reviewed the biannual 
Workforce Culture and Employee Engagement 
Report, which demonstrated how our Values 
and behaviours are embedded throughout all 
levels of the workforce. The report contains a 
summary metric dashboard which is divided 
into categories reflecting AstraZeneca’s 
Values and behaviours. Where the Board has 
concerns that the culture does not reflect our 
Values, the Board seeks assurances from 
management that remedial action has been 
taken and, where necessary, requests senior 
management’s attendance at Board meetings 
to discuss corrective actions.

92%

of employees took part in the November 2023 
Pulse survey.

‘Townhall’ meetings, ‘fireside chats’ and 
‘Ask me anything’ discussions
Both Non-Executive Directors and Executive 
Directors regularly participate in meetings 
with sites, or large groups of the workforce 
– either virtually or in person. These enable 

direct engagement between the Board and 
employees, including Q&A sessions, such as 
the Chair ‘fireside chat’. During the year, 
among other events, the Board hosted 
in-person ‘townhall’ meetings for employees 
in Japan and US sites, which were also 
broadcast to other sites in the region to 
increase reach and participation.

Employee opinion surveys (Pulse)
Twice a year, employees are invited to take 
part in an opinion survey, which seeks their 
views of the business. The results are reviewed 
by management and trends are monitored. 
The results are shared with the Board, which 
enables the Directors to understand the views 
and sentiments of the workforce.

89%

of employees stated they believe strongly in 
AstraZeneca’s future direction and key 
priorities in the November 2023 Pulse survey.

Site visits 
During 2023, Directors visited various Group 
sites across the world, including those in 
India, Dubai, Japan, the US, the UK and the 
Alexion campus in Dublin, Ireland. The 
majority of visits were in person but, to 
maximise engagement opportunities, 
some were virtual, including those to the 
AstraZeneca businesses in the Nordics, 
Spain and Taiwan. 

>10

AstraZeneca Group sites around the world 
visited by Directors during 2023.

Wellbeing
Where appropriate – for example in relation to 
recent humanitarian events – the Board 
receives regular updates on the steps taken 
by management to create safe working 
environments and support the mental and 
physical wellbeing of the workforce.

Additional Information

As part of the Board performance 
evaluation, Directors were asked to 
consider the following areas:

 > Board composition
 > Stakeholder oversight
 > Board dynamics
 > Board Committees
 > Strategic oversight
 > Risk oversight
 > Succession planning and 

people oversight
 > Priorities for change

2023 overview 
The UK Corporate Governance Code states 
that there should be an annual evaluation of 
the performance of the board, its committees, 
the chair and individual directors and that, for 
larger listed companies such as AstraZeneca, 
this should be externally-facilitated at least 
every three years. The Company was due to 
have an externally-facilitated evaluation 
in 2023. 

The Board elected to postpone the externally-
facilitated review until 2024 and instead run an 
internal performance evaluation in 2023. This 
was considered to be a proportionate 
approach in light of the change in Chair during 
the year. Given the 27 April 2023 effective date 
of appointment of Michel Demaré as Board 
Chair, the Board concluded that it would be a 
better use of time and resources for the next 
externally-facilitated annual performance 
review to take place in 2024, so that at least 
the first 12 to 18 months of the Board’s work 
under the new Chair could be taken into 
account.

The internal evaluation was run via a web-
based survey covering a wide range of topics 
that were broadly similar to topics from 
previous evaluations. A report was prepared 
using the answers to this survey which was 
discussed by the Board at its meeting in 
December 2023, and was used by the Chair 
as the basis for individual conversations with 
each Board member prior to the full 
Board discussion.

As part of each Director’s individual 
discussion with the Chair during the Board 
evaluation, his or her contribution to the work 
of the Board and personal development needs 
were considered. Directors’ training needs are 
met by a combination of: internal 
presentations and updates, and external 
speaker presentations, as part of Board and 
Board Committee meetings; specific training 
sessions on particular topics, where required; 
and the opportunity for Directors to attend 
external courses at the Company’s expense, 
should they wish to do so.

The Nomination and Governance Committee 
also reviews the composition of the Board to 
ensure that it has the appropriate expertise, 
while also recognising the importance of 
diversity. For more information on the 
Nomination and Governance Committee’s 
work, see the Nomination and Governance 
Committee Report from page 90.

2023 outcomes and actions against prior 
year recommendations
 > The Board continues to operate effectively 
with an atmosphere that enables candid 
discussion. Its relationship with 
management, including the CEO, CFO and 
SET, was highly rated.

 > Each Director continues to perform 

effectively and demonstrate commitment 
to their role, as does the Chair (whose 
evaluation by Board members, absent the 
Chair, was led by the senior independent 
Non-Executive Director). 

 > The composition of the Board was 

highly rated.

 > The Board has a good understanding of 
the views and requirements of its key 
stakeholders. 

 > All of the Board’s Committees continue 

to operate effectively.

 > The Board’s contribution to strategy 

development, oversight of the R&D pipeline 
and effectiveness in monitoring and 
considering key external developments 
were highly rated. The Board oversees 
risk effectively.

Succession planning and people oversight 
continues to be a key area of focus. Key 
priorities for 2024 included strategy, financial 
performance and capital allocation, 
monitoring the R&D pipeline, market-specific 
and geopolitical issues, and Board and SET 
succession planning. To address areas 
highlighted by the 2022 annual Board 
performance evaluation, various steps were 
taken during 2023, including:

 > The re-establishment – following the 
COVID-19 pandemic – of a strong 
programme of in-person Board meetings, 
including site visits, balanced with some 
Board meetings being held virtually to 
reduce the Board’s carbon footprint and the 
need for Directors to undertake 
intercontinental travel.

 > Focusing the Nomination and Governance 

Committee’s work regarding Non-Executive 
Director succession planning on addressing 
the needs of the Board in the period to 
2026, when four current Non-Executive 
Directors will reach nine years’ tenure, with 
the appointment of Anna Manz in 
September 2023 being the first tangible 
outcome of this work.

 > Continued routine work by the Nomination 
and Governance Committee to plan for 
future CEO succession, including reviews of 
both internal and external potential 
candidate options.

 > Arranging a session to enable the Board to 
review how management was approaching 
drug pricing legislation in the US.

On behalf of the Nomination and Governance 
Committee (the Committee), I am pleased to 
present the Committee’s report on its 
activities during 2023.

Committee’s role
The Committee works on behalf of the full 
Board to review the composition of the Board 
and its Committees and carry out succession 
planning for all Board positions, including taking 
the lead in the search for and recruitment of 
new Directors. The Committee ensures the 
Board has an appropriate balance of 
expertise, experience and diversity. A matrix 
that records the skills and experience of 
current Board members is one of the main 
tools used by the Committee to do this. 

The Nomination and Governance 
Committee’s terms of reference 
are available on our website, 
www.astrazeneca.com.

The matrix is shown in the charts to the left.

Decisions relating to the appointment of 
Directors are made by the entire Board based 
on the Committee’s recommendations, taking 
into account the merits of the candidates and 
the relevance of their background and 
experience, measured against objective criteria, 
with care taken to ensure appointees have 
enough time to devote to the Board’s business.

Board and Board Committee changes 
during the year
Following the retirement of Leif Johansson 
from the Board at the end of the AGM on 
27 April 2023, I was appointed Chair of the 
Board. In addition, I also assumed the role of 
Chair of this Committee. Further details about 
the Chair succession process are set out in 
the 2022 annual report.

In April, the Board appointed Euan Ashley as 
Chair of the Science Committee, in 
succession to Nazneen Rahman, effective 
1 June 2023, with Nazneen remaining a 
member of the Science Committee. Euan was 
appointed as a member of the Nomination 
and Governance Committee, effective the 
same date. The Board appointed Nazneen 
Rahman as a member of the Remuneration 
Committee, effective 1 May 2023. 

In May, the Board appointed Anna Manz as a 
Non-Executive Director and a member of the 
Audit Committee with effect from 1 September 
2023. The appointment process was led by 
the Committee and involved Anna meeting 
with multiple Directors. Anna brings extensive 
cross-sector business skills and knowledge to 
the Board, having held international roles in 
North America and Asia-Pacific and served as 
an executive and non-executive in large, listed 
companies. Anna’s significant financial and 
strategic leadership experience, including in 
areas such as risk, treasury and accounting, 
will enable her to fully contribute to the work 
of our Audit Committee.

Inclusion and diversity
The Board views all aspects of diversity among 
Board members as important considerations 
when reviewing its composition. The Board 
also aims to maintain a balance in terms of the 
range of experience and skills of individual 
Board members, which includes relevant 
international business, pharmaceutical industry 
and financial experience, and appropriate 
scientific and regulatory knowledge. The 
biographies of Board members set out on 
pages 78 and 79 give more information about 
current Directors in this respect.

The Board has adopted an Inclusion and 
Diversity Policy (the Policy), which is 
applicable to the Board and its Committees. 
The Policy reinforces the Board’s ongoing 
commitment to all aspects of diversity and to 
fostering an inclusive environment in which 
each Director feels valued and respected. 
Although the Board appoints candidates 
primarily based on merit and the relevance of 
their background and experience, measured 
against objective criteria, it recognises that an 
effective Board, with a broad strategic 
perspective, requires diversity. The Policy 
provides a commitment to use at least one 
professional search firm that has signed up to 
the ‘Voluntary Code of Conduct for Executive 
Search Firms’, to help recruit Directors from a 
broad, qualified group of candidates, to 
increase diversity of thinking and perspective. 
The Board’s approach to inclusion and 
diversity continues to yield successful results. 

As at 31 December 2023, 31% of the 
Company’s full Board identifies as an ethnic 
minority, 45% of the Company’s Non-
Executive Directors are women, and women 
make up 46% of the full Board. The 
information presented in the following tables 
was collected on a self-reporting basis. The 
Board, SET and Company Secretary were 
provided with the prescribed table, and asked 
to complete based on how they identify. The 
Board is pleased that the Company meets the

updated diversity policy targets as specified 
in the FCA’s Policy Statement on Diversity and 
inclusion on company boards and executive 
management, which was published in 
April 2022:

 > 46% of the Board are women, above the 

target of at least 40%.

 > Following the appointment of Aradhana 
Sarin as CFO, the Company meets the 
policy target that at least one of the Chair 
of the Board, Chief Executive Officer, senior 
independent Non-Executive Director or 
Chief Financial Officer be a woman.

 > The Board satisfies the target of at least 
one member of the Board being from a 
non-white ethnic minority background.

As well as being considered in decisions 
about succession and Board appointments, 
inclusion and diversity is integrated across our 
Code of Ethics and associated workforce policy 
for the organisation as a whole. We were 
named 2nd ranking Healthcare company in 
the FTSE 100 for women on boards and in 
leadership in the FTSE Women Leaders 
Review. For the year ended 31 December 
2023, following the retirement of Katarina 
Ageborg in January 2023 and Sharon Barr’s 
appointment as Executive Vice-President, 
BioPharmaceuticals R&D in August 2023, 
women represented 43% of the SET and its 
leadership teams.

Ongoing training and development
On her appointment as an independent 
Non-Executive Director, Anna Manz 
commenced an ongoing tailored induction 
programme to provide an understanding of 
the Group and which reflects Anna’s existing 
expertise and Committee membership. Key 
areas of the induction programme include:

 > Meetings with members of the Board, SET 

and other senior management.

 > Meeting with external legal advisers.
 > Meeting with the external auditors.
 > Access to a digital reading room which 
provides information on the Group, 
including financial performance, pipeline 
information, key Company policies, investor 
and analyst reports, media updates and 
guidance on directors’ duties and listed 
company requirements.

In addition to arranging comprehensive 
induction programmes when new Non-
Executive Directors are appointed to the 
Board, the Committee recognises the

Diversity Policy can be read

to diversity in the organisation

importance of continuing development and 
training opportunities for all Directors. We are 
committed to developing a culture of lifelong 
learning throughout our organisation. Specific 
sessions with internal and external experts are 
periodically arranged for the full Board, to 
ensure that Directors have access to 
specialist knowledge across a broad range of 
areas to support their strategic decision 
making. For example, this year Board 
members participated in a roundtable event 
with key external experts in the areas of lung 
cancer and ATTR during the Board meeting in 
Tokyo, Japan to discuss the latest science 
and clinical research in those areas.

At least annually, I discuss with each Director 
his or her contribution to the work of the 
Board and personal development needs. 
Directors’ training needs are met by: a 
combination of internal presentations and 
updates, and external speaker presentations, 
as part of Board and Board Committee 
meetings; specific training sessions on 
particular topics, where required; and the 
opportunity for Directors to attend external 
courses at the Company’s expense, should 
they wish to do so. Directors are encouraged 
to visit the Group’s sites, providing 
opportunities to meet local management and 
tour AstraZeneca facilities. Virtual visits are 
also arranged to allow further interactions with 
employees and sites. These visits further 
Directors’ understanding of the Group’s 
business and operations, as well as provide 
an insight into the particular challenges faced 
locally and opportunities to engage directly 
with employees and other stakeholders.

Succession planning
The Committee considers both planned and 
unplanned (unanticipated) succession 
scenarios. The Committee split the majority of 
its time on this topic in 2023 between 
succession planning for Non-Executive 
Directors, successfully concluding the 
recruitment of Anna Manz in September and 
continued routine succession planning for the 
role of CEO, which included desktop research 
relating to potential external candidates and 
reviewing the strengths and areas of 
development for potential internal candidates. 
Korn Ferry and Lygon Group assisted the 
Committee with its succession planning work 
this year. Korn Ferry undertakes executive 
search assignments for the Company but has 
no other connection with AstraZeneca or its 
individual Directors.

Corporate governance
The Committee advises the Board periodically 
on significant developments in corporate 
governance and the Company’s compliance 
with the UK Corporate Governance Code. 
Further information on our corporate 
governance arrangements, including the 
Company’s statement of compliance with the 
Code during the year, is set out from page 81.

Chair’s introduction
The Science Committee’s (the Committee) 
core role is to provide assurance to the Board 
regarding the quality, competitiveness and 
integrity of the Group’s R&D activities. 
Our dialogue with AstraZeneca’s R&D leaders 
and other scientist employees, as well as 
visits to our R&D sites throughout the world, 
allows us to review and assess:

 > The approaches we adopt in respect of our 

chosen therapy areas. 

 > The scientific technology and R&D 

capabilities we deploy. 

 > AstraZeneca R&D strategic science 
capabilities: including multi-omics and 
bioinformatics, and AI and computational 
strategies. This was supported by further 
in-person presentations from AstraZeneca 
scientists on site at Cambridge, UK 
covering across all R&D areas. 
 > Acquisitions and in-licensing 

agreements: review for the Board the 
scientific case for acquisition and licensing 
opportunities, including:
 – Acquisition of CinCor Pharma, Inc., 
adding baxdrostat (CIN-107) to the 
cardiorenal portfolio.

 > The scientific strategy for maintaining our 

 – Exclusive global licence agreement with 

pipeline and competitiveness. 

 > The decision-making processes for R&D 

projects and programmes. 

 > The quality of our scientists, their career 
opportunities and talent development. 

 > Benchmarking against industry and 

scientific best practice, where appropriate.

We also periodically review important 
bioethical issues and assist in the formulation 
of appropriate policies in relation to such 
issues, agreeing these on behalf of the Board. 
The Committee also considers future trends in 
medical science and technology, and reviews, 
on behalf of the Board, the R&D aspects of 
specific business development or acquisition 
proposals, advising the Board on its conclusions.

Activities during the year
The Committee met nine times during 2023, 
both virtually and face to face. Our key areas 
of focus included:

 > Company strategy and strategic 
priorities for R&D: including key 
prioritised science platforms across R&D 
(Oncology, BioPharmaceuticals and Rare 
Disease) and areas of focus for long-term 
success, including business development 
strategy and external trends impacting 
R&D investment. 

KYM Biosciences, for CMG901, a 
potential first-in-class ADC targeting 
Claudin 18.2.

 – Acquisition of Neogene Therapeutics 

Inc., a global clinical-stage biotechnology 
company pioneering the discovery, 
development and manufacturing of 
next-generation TCR-Ts.

 – Purchase and licence agreement for a 
portfolio of pre-clinical gene therapy 
programmes and enabling technologies 
from Pfizer Inc.

Standing attendees at Committee meetings 
during 2023 included the EVP, Operations, 
IT and Sustainability and VP, Global SHE 
and Operations Sustainability.

Chair’s introduction
The Sustainability Committee (the Committee) 
continued its important work during 2023 to 
oversee the execution of the Company’s 
sustainability strategy. In addition to this 
important function, the Committee’s other 
roles are:

 > To oversee the Company’s disclosures 

relating to sustainability and communication 
of our sustainability activities with our 
stakeholders. 

 > To monitor developments and best practice 
and provide input to the Board and other 
Board Committees on sustainability matters 
as required.

 > To advise the Remuneration Committee on 

the Company’s performance against 
sustainability metrics and targets.

Committee meetings and other informal 
interactions with employees allow Committee 
members to engage closely with those 
charged with executing our sustainability 
strategy. This helps us develop a deeper 
understanding of sustainability initiatives, their 
progress, who executes them, and how this is 
done, to share with the wider Board.

Activities during the year
During 2023, the Committee met twice 
formally. In addition, the Committee facilitated 
a deep dive session for the full Board focusing 
on developments in laws and regulations 
relating to sustainability reporting and 
progress against our Ambition Zero Carbon 
(AZC) targets and programmes. To enhance 
our understanding of the sustainability 
initiatives in action at AstraZeneca and hear 
colleagues’ personal perspectives, the 
Committee invited employees to its meetings 
who were involved in workstreams and 
projects from across our sustainability 
strategy. This included hearing from R&D 
scientists in Macclesfield, UK about their work 
to recover and reuse solvents which are a 
material contributor to our carbon footprint 

and a briefing paper relating to the rollout of 
electronic patient information leaflets.

Our focus areas during the year included:

 >  How numerous regulations, including the 
IFRS Sustainability Disclosure Standards, 
European Sustainability Reporting 
Standards and Corporate Sustainability 
Reporting Directive (CSRD), would impact 
the Company’s reporting on sustainability 
matters and the measures being taken to 
ensure the Company has a single source of 
sustainability-related data. 

 > The establishment and oversight of a new 

Sustainability Steering Committee 
comprised of representatives from Finance, 
Sustainability, Compliance, HR and 
Government Affairs which will be 
accountable to both the Committee and 
the Audit Committee to ensure consistency 
over all aspects of sustainability across 
the business.

 > The establishment and development of a 
health equity strategy which aims to build 
on existing access to healthcare 
programmes to enable more equitable 
health outcomes across the globe.
 > Oversight of the conduct of the CSRD 

double materiality assessment.

 > Supporting the Remuneration Committee in 
its consideration of how the delivery of our 
ESG priorities is incentivised, and reviewing 
performance against our ESG remuneration 
targets relating to AZC.

 > Overseeing engagement with investors on 

sustainability-related matters and reviewing 
AstraZeneca’s external disclosures.

  on 1 September 2023. 

Chair’s introduction
On behalf of the Audit Committee 
(the Committee) I am pleased to present 
the Committee’s report on its activities and 
the significant matters we considered 
during 2023.

In 2023, following his election as Chair of 
the Board, Michel Demaré stepped down 
as a member of the Committee immediately 
following the AGM in April. My thanks go to 
Michel for his valuable contributions to the 
Committee’s work over the past few years. 
We also welcomed Anna Manz as a member 
of the Committee following her appointment 
to the Board in September. Anna brings 
wide-ranging, international experience from 
a number of industries, and has already 
begun to make effective contributions to 
the work of the Committee. 

The Committee believes that it has carried 
out its responsibilities effectively throughout 
the year, and to a high standard, providing 
independent oversight. It has had good 
support from AstraZeneca personnel and 
PwC, the Company’s auditors. 

The Committee’s main responsibilities 
include monitoring the integrity of financial 
reporting and formal announcements 
relating to financial performance, reviewing 
the effectiveness of internal controls and 
risk management systems, and overseeing 
the external and internal audit processes. 

The Committee continues to apply 
appropriate challenge to the Company’s 
management; for example, the Committee 
challenged the timing of recognition of 
provisioning for certain legal items and their 
presentation as non-core items. This matter 
was subject to robust discussions and 
scrutiny from the Committee before it was 
satisfied with management’s approach.

The Committee’s agenda continues to be 
driven by the Company’s key active risks and 
key strategic programmes which are 
considered at every Committee meeting, and 
inform the Committee’s agenda of in-depth 
sessions which, this year, have included 
sessions on:

 > Our Operations function, as we continue 
to evolve our supply chain capabilities.

 > Our IT/IS function, to gain a better 

understanding of how we seek to mitigate 
cybersecurity threats.

 > The China market environment and 
healthcare industry trends, the 
enforcement environment, and how risks 
are being proactively managed.

 > How the Company seeks to mitigate the 
impact of inflationary pressures across 
the business.

 > Organisational activities to support the 

Company’s 2030 Bold Ambition.

These sessions allowed the Committee to 
continue exploring specific aspects of risks in 
their ‘real world’ business contexts, in direct 
dialogue with people in the business that 
have responsibility for managing these risks. 

The Committee also spent considerable time 
keeping ourselves updated on developments 
in the reporting and regulatory environment, 
including the proposed governance and audit 
reforms in the UK, SEC updated interpretations 
on non-GAAP measures reporting, and 
sustainability-related reporting.

This year, we continued our approach of a 
combination of in-person and virtual Committee 
meetings and interactions with colleagues 
from across the organisation. Of particular 
note this year were the Committee’s in-person 
visits to AstraZeneca’s manufacturing site in 
Speke, UK, and to the AstraZeneca and 
Alexion UK marketing companies. I also made 
in-person visits to the marketing companies in 
India and the Gulf Cooperation Cluster (GCC) 
in Dubai and a visit to the Global Innovation 
and Technology Centre in Chennai, India. 
These interactions, along with the in-depth 
sessions I refer to above, have allowed 
Committee members to maximise our 
engagement with colleagues across the 
business, deepen our understanding of the 
priorities and challenges facing many different 
markets and business areas, and hear a wide 
range of employees’ views directly.

We hope you find the Committee’s Report 
useful and informative, and, as ever, 
I welcome any feedback.

Corporate Governance

 
Committee overview
Committee composition
In December 2023, the Board determined the 
Committee met the UK, US and Swedish 
composition requirements by virtue of Philip 
Broadley and Anna Manz having recent and 
relevant financial experience for the purpose 
of the UK Corporate Governance Code (the 
Code), having competence in accounting and/
or auditing for the purpose of the Disclosure 
and Transparency Rules, being financial 
experts for the purposes of the Sarbanes-
Oxley Act, and having expertise in accounting 
and auditing for the purposes of the Swedish 
Corporate Governance Code and Swedish 
Companies Act. The Board determined that all 
members of the Committee are independent 
for the purposes of the Code and that the 
Committee members as a whole have 
competence relevant to the sector in which 
the Company operates, by virtue of their 
experience of working in science-driven, 
healthcare and/or pharmaceutical industries, 
or as a result of their tenure with AstraZeneca. 
The Committee members’ qualifications, skills 
and experience are detailed in their 
biographies on pages 78 and 79 and meeting 
attendance is shown on page 77.

Role of the Committee
The Committee’s main responsibilities include 
monitoring the integrity of financial reporting 
and formal announcements relating to financial 
performance, reviewing the effectiveness of 
internal controls and risk management 
systems, and overseeing the external and 
internal audit processes. The Committee 
reports to the Board the principal matters it 
considers and any significant concerns it has 
or that have been reported to it. Further 
information about the Committee’s role and 
work during the year is set out in this Audit 
Committee Report.

Activities during the year 
Financial reporting
Effective internal controls, appropriate 
accounting practices and policies, and the 
exercise of experienced judgement by the 
Committee and the Board underpin 
AstraZeneca’s financial reporting integrity. 

Strategic Report

Corporate Governance

Financial Statements

Additional Information

The Committee’s activities in this area in 
2023 included:

 > Reviewing key elements of the Financial 

Statements and the estimates and 
judgements contained in the Group’s 
financial disclosures, as well as considering 
the appropriateness of management’s and 
the external auditor’s analysis and 
conclusions on judgemental accounting 
matters. The significant financial reporting 
issues considered are described in detail in 
the table from page 98. Further information 
on the significant accounting matters 
considered is included in the Financial 
Review under Critical accounting policies 
and estimates from page 72 and within our 
Group Accounting Policies from page 152. 

 > Considering the completeness and 

accuracy of the Group’s reported financial 
performance against its internal and 
external key performance indicators.

 > Reviewing the preparation of the Directors’ 
Viability statement and considering the 
adequacy of the analysis supporting the 
assurance provided by that statement, as 
well as the going concern assessment and 
adoption of the going concern basis in 
preparing this Annual Report and the 
Financial Statements. 

 > Reviewing quarterly updates from both 

management and PwC on the programme 
of activities relating to control over financial 
reporting and the effectiveness of testing 
that has been performed across the internal 
control environment. 

 > Considering the external auditor’s reports 

on its audit of the Group Financial 
Statements, as well as reports from 
management, Group Internal Audit (GIA), 
Global Compliance and the external auditor 
on the effectiveness of our system of 
internal controls and, in particular, our 
internal control over financial reporting. This 
included consideration of compliance with 
applicable provisions of the Sarbanes-
Oxley Act – in particular, the status of 
compliance with the programme of internal 
controls over financial reporting 
implemented pursuant to section 404 of 
that Act. 

 > Discussing financial reporting 

considerations in relation to significant 
transactions that occurred in the year, the 
valuation and presentation of the defined 
benefit pension arrangements, impairment 
of intangible assets, restructuring 
programmes and the presentation of 
collaboration and alliance revenues. The 
Committee also reviewed developments in 
sustainability reporting requirements and 
the Company’s activities, governance 
frameworks and approach in compliance 
with enacted and emerging regulations in 
relation to sustainability.

Risk identification and management
The Committee continued its regular reviews 
of the Group’s approach to risk management, 
the operation of its risk reporting framework 
and risk mitigation. This included 
consideration of the manner in which the risk 
management process was embedded in the 
Group such that the Committee could be 
assured that management’s accountability for 
risks was clear and functioning effectively.

The Company’s risk framework, described 
further from page 54, provides the context for 
the Committee to consider the Directors’ 
Viability statement which is underpinned by 
the assurance provided through a ‘stress test’ 
analysis under which key profitability, liquidity 
and funding metrics are tested against severe 
downside scenarios.

Each of these scenarios assumes that the 
associated risks crystallise and that 
management will take mitigating actions 
against those risks. The Committee 
considered in detail the validity of each 
scenario. This included obtaining additional 
analysis from management as to the indirect 
or unintended consequences of its proposed 
mitigating actions including, for example, 
assessing the likely response of a broader 
range of stakeholders. The Committee also 
assessed whether the proposed mitigations 
were viable.

The Committee is updated on key active and 
emerging risks facing the Company through a 
quarterly risk management report from the 
CFO. The likelihood of each of the risks 
materialising and its potential impact was 
monitored by the Committee and the reports 
from the CFO enabled the Committee to track 
the trend applicable to each risk compared to 
the previous quarter. The composition and 
profile of these risks informs the Committee’s 
agenda of in-depth sessions. For example, an 
upward trend, in terms of the likelihood and 
potential impact of the risk, was noted for the 
key active risk relating to IT, cyber risk and 
data security, therefore the Committee spent 
additional time with representatives from the 
IT function to understand those risks and the 
actions being undertaken to mitigate them.

More information on the basis of 
preparation of Financial 
Statements on a going concern 
basis is set out on page 227 and 
in the Financial Statements on 
page 152.

Further information on the 
significant financial reporting 
issues considered is set out in the 
table from page 98.

Further information about the 
Principal Risks faced by the 
Group and the Viability statement 
is set out in Risk Overview from 
page 54.

Report

Cyber risk, digital security and information 
governance
Our approach to identifying, assessing and 
managing material cybersecurity risks 
(including those that result from the use of 
third parties in business processes and data 
management) is integrated within our 
Group-wide approach to managing risk. 
Failure in information technology or 
cybersecurity has been identified as a 
Principal Risk. Mitigations are in place to 
manage these risks, and these are monitored, 
and their effectiveness regularly reported, for 
example in KPI dashboards provided to 
management and the Committee. Incidents 
are managed and reported using the 
cybersecurity incident management 
framework which in turn is connected to the 
Group’s crisis management framework. 
Cybersecurity risks are overseen by the 
Committee, who perform an in-depth review 
annually. Their reviews are supported by 
senior management, the VP, Group Internal 
Audit (GIA) and other assurance or providers 
as required. Cybersecurity risks (including 
previous incidents) have not materially 
affected our business strategy, results of 
operations or financial condition.

Sustainability reporting and 
climate-related risk
The Committee is responsible for overseeing 
sustainability-related disclosures that are 
linked to the Financial Statements, which 
includes the TCFD Summary Statement and 
the EU Taxonomy disclosures in this Annual 
Report and the extended TCFD Statement 
published separately. These statements are 
also reviewed by the Sustainability Committee, 
to support the Committee’s review. 

The Committee received updates in the 
current year regarding the proposed and/or 
enacted regulations by the US, EU, UK and 
the International Sustainability Standards 
Board (ISSB) on sustainability reporting, as 
well as the ongoing assessment of potential 
double materiality topics for the Company 
under EU regulations.

For further information, see IT 
and IS resources on page 41.

For more information on our Code 
of Ethics, see page 49, and on 
Anti-bribery and anti-corruption, 
see page 39. 

AstraZeneca’s Modern Slavery 
Act Statement is available on our 
website, www.astrazeneca.com.

Legal and Compliance
The Committee’s activities in this area 
included reviewing:

 > Quarterly reports from the Legal function to 
monitor the status of significant litigation 
matters and governmental investigations.
 > Quarterly reports from Global Compliance 
to provide oversight of key compliance 
incidents (both substantiated and 
unsubstantiated), possible trends and the 
dispersion of incidents across our business 
functions and management hierarchy. The 
reports included corrective actions taken so 
that the Committee could assess the 
effectiveness of controls, and monitor and 
ensure timely remediation. 
 > Reporting on compliance with 

AstraZeneca’s Code of Ethics to ensure 
high ethical standards and that 
AstraZeneca operates within the law in all 
countries where we operate. 

 > The monitoring, review, education and 

improvements made to support assurance 
that the risk of modern slavery and human 
trafficking is eliminated, to the fullest extent 
possible, from AstraZeneca’s supply chain.

Internal Audit 
The Committee reviewed GIA’s activities, 
including:

 >  Reviewing quarterly reports of work carried 
out by GIA, including the status of follow-up 
actions with management. In 2023, GIA 
provided assurance over compliance with 
significant policies, plans, procedures, laws 
and regulations, as well as risk-based 
audits across a broad range of key business 
activities and continued its thematic 
reporting to the business. The 2023 audit 
plan was aligned to our key active risks and 
wider risk taxonomy. Separate meetings are 
arranged to discuss follow-up actions in 
more depth with specific teams, when 
required by the Committee.

 >  Carrying out the annual effectiveness 

review of GIA in late 2023 by considering its 
performance against the internal audit plan 
and key activities.

 >  Approving the 2024 internal audit plan, 

which is aligned to our key active risks and 
wider risk taxonomy. 

 >  Considering the geographic presence, 
reach and capabilities of GIA and the 
appropriateness of the Group’s resource 
allocation for this vital assurance function.

The Committee noted the continued 
contributions of GIA in supporting and 
delivering value to the business and the 
Committee during the year. The Committee 
supports GIA’s continued efforts to deploy its 
resources in line with the shape and size of 
the overall organisation and was satisfied with 
the quality, experience and expertise of the 
GIA function. 

An independent External Quality Assessment 
of GIA is performed every five years and was 
last performed in 2021.

External audit
The Company’s external auditor, PwC, 
provided quarterly reports to the Committee 
over key audit and accounting matters, and 
business processes, internal controls and 
IT systems.

The Committee oversaw the conduct, 
performance and quality of the external audit, 
in particular through its review and challenge 
of the coverage of the external auditor’s audit 
plan and subsequent monitoring of progress 
against it. The Committee maintained regular 
contact with PwC through formal and informal 
reporting and discussion throughout the year, 
with a continued focus on maintaining audit 
efficiency and quality. The Committee also 
sought management’s feedback on the 
conduct of the audit and considered the level 
of and extent to which the auditors challenged 
management’s assumptions. The Committee 
also received a formal letter and report from 
the Financial Reporting Council (FRC) 
following the joint FRC and Public Company 
Accounting Oversight Board (PCAOB) 
inspection of PwC’s 2022 audit of 
AstraZeneca. The FRC’s inspection was rated 
as “Good” (the highest rating possible) and 
there were no ‘Key’ or ‘Other’ findings. 
The FRC also recognised a number of areas 
of good practice in relation to the conduct of 
the audit. 

A number of interactions took place between 
Committee members and PwC during the 
year, outside of formal Committee meetings, 
to enhance the Committee’s understanding of 
the audit process including the Committee 
Chair joining PwC’s Account Planning 
Workshop to meet face-to-face with PwC 
team members responsible for auditing 
AstraZeneca’s global entities.

Additional Information

The Committee reviewed audit and non-audit 
fees of the external auditor during the year, 
including the objectivity and independence 
of the external auditor through the application 
of the Audit and Audit-Related Services 
Approval Policy, as described further on 
page 100.

Engagement with employees and 
other stakeholders
The Committee regularly interacts with 
members of management below the SET and 
seeks wider engagement with the Group’s 
employees and other stakeholders, during 
deep dive sessions at formal Committee 
meetings and as separate engagements.

Committee members undertook a mixture of 
in-person and virtual interactions with a wide 
range of teams from across the organisation, 
including: Information Technology and 
Information Security; Operations and 
Procurement; Human Resources; Global 
Business Services; the AstraZeneca and 
Alexion marketing companies in the UK; 
the Speke, UK manufacturing site; and the 
marketing companies for the GCC and India.

The breadth of these interactions is crucial as 
it enhances the Committee’s understanding of 
the business and provides valuable insights 
into the key issues and challenges relating to, 
and current and emerging risks associated 
with, our activities in these areas. The 
Committee welcomes the opportunity to 
engage directly with employees in these 
meetings which provide an opportunity to 
gauge employee sentiment and hear their 
views directly. The Committee also uses 
these interactions to communicate the 
importance it attaches to compliance and 
our ‘Speak Up’ culture.

Reporting and regulatory environment 
The Committee has kept abreast of 
developments in the reporting and regulatory 
environment. This has included consideration 
of the proposed governance and audit 
reforms in the UK, SEC updates on clawbacks 
and non-GAAP reporting, consultations on 
sustainability-related reporting requirements 
in a number of jurisdictions, and requirements 
to disclose further information about diversity 
and inclusion on company boards in the UK 
from 2023. 

The Committee was also briefed on thematic 
reviews published by the FRC during the year, 
including those on fair-value-measurement 
and climate-related metrics and targets.

Ensuring the quality of external financial 
reporting to shareholders and other 
stakeholders remains paramount to the 
Committee. This includes its assessment of 
the annual reports to ensure that, taken as a 
whole, they are fair, balanced and 
understandable (for which the process is 
described on page 100). External validation of 
the Annual Report is an important indicator of 
the quality of our reporting. The Committee 
was pleased with the feedback from the FRC 
that it received in 2023 on the 2022 
Annual Report:

 > The FRC undertook a routine corporate 

reporting review of the 2022 Annual Report 
and did not raise any questions or queries 
that required further correspondence, 
which the Committee consider a reflection 
of the quality financial reporting and 
compliance undertaken by AstraZeneca. 
The FRC highlighted some areas where 
reporting could be further enhanced which 
management and the Committee have 
considered in preparing this Annual Report. 
 > The FRC also reviewed our reporting in the 

context of the 2018 UK Corporate 
Governance Code and raised no significant 
points in this respect. 

 > In the FRC’s 2022/2023 Annual Review of 

Corporate Governance Reporting, the FRC 
highlighted the following aspects of the 
2022 Annual Report as examples of best 
practice: (i) how the impact of 
AstraZeneca’s learning culture contributed 
positively to retention and promotion rates 
and more accurate succession planning; 
and (ii) how AstraZeneca’s strategy and 
KPIs in relation to scientific measures are 
linked to remuneration.

model-focused reporting highlighted our 
‘Life-cycle of a medicine’ text and diagram 
in the 2022 Annual Report (an updated 
version of which appears on page 11 of this 
Annual Report) as a best practice example 
of how an issuer can better meet investor 
needs, particularly for a reader who is not a 
pharmaceutical expert.

Committee performance
The Committee conducted the annual 
evaluation of its own performance, referring to 
the Committee-specific results of a Board 
performance review survey prepared by the 
Company Secretary’s team. The results were 
reported to and discussed with the 
Committee and the Board. The overall results 
of the survey were positive and noted the 
Committee’s efforts and focus.

Significant financial reporting issues considered by the Committee in 2023

Matter considered

Valuation of intangible
assets

   See Financial Review 
from page 58 and 
Note 10 to the 
Financial Statements 
from page 172.

The Group carries significant intangible assets on its 
Consolidated Statement of Financial Position arising from the 
acquisition of businesses and intellectual property (IP) rights to 
medicines in development and on the market. Each quarter, the 
CFO reports on the carrying value of the Group’s intangible 
assets as well as the specific assets identified as at risk of 
impairment. In respect of intangible assets that are identified as 
at risk of impairment, the Committee receives information on the 
difference between the carrying value and management’s 
current estimate of discounted future cash flows for these 
products (the headroom). Products will be identified as ‘at risk’ 
because the headroom is small or, for medicines in 
development, there is a significant potentially adverse event 
such as the publication of clinical trial results which could 
significantly alter management’s forecasts for the product. The 
reviews also cover the impact on any related contingent 
consideration arising from previous business combinations.

Committee’s conclusion and response

The Committee considered the impairment reviews of the 
Group’s intangible assets. Impairments of $17 million arose in 
relation to launched products, and $417 million arose in relation 
to products in development.

The Committee assured itself of the integrity of the Group’s 
accounting policy and models for its assessment and valuation 
of its intangible assets, including understanding the key 
assumptions and sensitivities within those models. The 
Committee also considered the internal and external estimates 
and forecasts for the Group’s cost of capital relative to the 
broader industry. The Committee was satisfied that the Group 
had appropriately accounted for the identified impairments.

Revenue recognition

   See Financial Review 
from page 58 and 
Note 1 to the 
Financial Statements 
from page 160.

The US is our largest single market and accounted for 42% of 
our Total Revenue in 2023. Revenue recognition, particularly in 
the US, is affected by rebates, chargebacks, returns, other 
revenue accruals and cash discounts.

The Committee pays attention to management’s estimates of 
these items, its analysis of any unusual movements and their 
impact on revenue recognition.

In 2023, a new category of revenue termed Alliance Revenue 
was included on the face of the Statement of Comprehensive 
Income, and comparative information re-presented. Alliance 
Revenue includes profit shares, revenue shares or royalties from 
defined collaborative arrangements, and was previously a 
sub-category of Collaboration Revenue.

The Committee receives regular reports from management and 
the external auditor on this complex area. The US market 
remains highly competitive with diverse marketing and pricing 
strategies adopted by the Group and its peers.

The Committee recognised the close monitoring and control by 
management of the overall gross-to-net deductions.

The Committee was consulted on the proposed update to 
presentation of Alliance and Collaboration Revenues, and 
aligned on the usefulness of enhanced disclosures of Alliance 
Revenues for better visibility and reflect differences in revenue 
profiles for Alliance and Collaboration Revenues. The 
Committee also discussed the accounting considerations for 
key milestones in Collaboration Revenue.

Alternative performance 
measures (APMs)

   See Financial Review 
from page 58.

Litigation and 
contingent liabilities

   See Note 30 to the 
Financial Statements 
from page 204.

AstraZeneca reports APMs to provide helpful supplementary 
information to the IFRS measures to enable a better 
understanding of the Group’s financial performance and 
position.

The Committee carefully considered management’s 
presentation of the non-core items and noted that the 
presentation was consistent with prior years for the items.

Accounting for the acquisition of Alexion in 2021 resulted in 
more significant items being classified as non-core, which 
continue impacting performance in the current year, especially 
relating to the unwind of fair value uplift of inventory and 
amortisation of allocated fair value of purchased intangible 
assets. The fair value uplift of inventory was fully unwound in 
the year, hence the amortisation of intangibles will remain the 
material non-core item from the acquisition transaction. There 
were some significant one-off legal settlements in the year 
which were classified as non-core items in line with the 
Group’s policy. 

Management carefully analyses the presentation of various 
items to ensure it is fair and balanced, and follows guidelines 
issued by the European Securities and Markets Authority and 
the SEC, as well as FRC thematic reviews.

AstraZeneca is involved in various legal proceedings 
considered typical to its business and the pharmaceutical 
industry as a whole, including litigation and investigations 
relating to product liability, commercial disputes, infringement 
of IP rights, the validity of certain patents, antitrust law, and 
sales and marketing practices.

In the current period, net legal provisions of $1,020 million were 
recorded for three legal proceedings within non-core items once 
the criteria for recognising a provision were met.

The Committee further considered management’s assessment 
and recommendation to present the $1,020 million legal 
provision costs as non-core items, and concurred with 
management that the presentation was appropriate due to their 
significance and consistent with classification in prior years.

The Committee reviewed proposed disclosures for non-GAAP 
items in line with the various regulatory guidance and 
concurred with management that the presentation enabled 
additional helpful guidance.

Of the matters the Committee considered in 2023 the more 
significant included: the settlements in the Nexium and Prilosec 
product liability litigation, the Imfinzi patent litigation and the 
Alexion shareholder litigation. 

The Committee carefully considered the timing of recognition 
and presentation of these provisions and concurred with 
management’s assessment. The Committee was also satisfied 
that the Group was effectively managing its litigation risks 
including seeking appropriate remedies and continuing to 
defend its IP rights vigorously.

Additional Information

Significant financial reporting issues considered by the Committee in 2023 continued

The Group has business activities around the world and incurs a 
substantial amount and variety of business taxes. AstraZeneca 
pays corporate income taxes, customs duties, excise taxes, 
stamp duties, employment and many other business taxes in all 
jurisdictions where due. In addition, we collect and pay 
employee taxes and indirect taxes such as value-added tax. The 
taxes the Group pays and collects represent a significant 
contribution to the countries and societies in which we operate. 
Tax risk can arise from unclear laws and regulations as well as 
differences in their interpretation.

Committee’s conclusion and response

The Committee reviews the Group’s approach to tax, including 
governance, risk management and compliance, tax planning, 
dealings with tax authorities and the level of tax risk the Group 
is prepared to accept.

During 2023, the Committee considered the tax accounting 
implications of a UK Group company’s intragroup purchase of 
certain intellectual property as well as developments in certain 
uncertain tax positions in the year. The Committee considered 
the analysis provided by management and concurred with the 
presentation and reporting of these items.

The Committee was satisfied with the Group’s practices 
regarding tax liabilities, including, most notably, its response to 
developments in the corporate income tax environment.

Group is prepared to 
accept, can be found

Segmental reporting 

   See the Key 
Judgement within 
Note 6 to the Financial 
Statements from 
page 167.

Management has reviewed the developments in the year and 
determined the Group continues to operate as a single segment 
based on key decisions on resource allocation and performance 
monitoring being carried out at a Group level by the SET.

The Committee received reports from management regarding 
considerations for segmental reporting based on the current 
operations and management of the business.

There were no significant changes in the Group’s business 
during the year, with the Alexion integration continuing as 
envisioned.

The Committee considered the analysis provided by 
management and concurred with management that 
presenting AstraZeneca’s performance under one segment 
was appropriate.

Retirement benefits

   See Financial Review 
from page 58 and Note 
22 to the Financial 
Statements from 
page 183.

Accounting for defined benefit pension and other post-
retirement benefits remains an important area of focus. The 
present value of these liabilities is sensitive to changes in 
long-term interest rates, future inflation and mortality 
expectations. The assumptions used to value the liabilities for 
the Group’s main post-retirement benefit obligations are 
updated every quarter along with asset valuations. 

The Committee was satisfied that the Group’s contribution 
policy and actuarial assumptions used to value liabilities were 
appropriate during the year. The Committee monitors the 
funding level of the Group’s defined benefit obligations on a 
quarterly basis, alongside key developments. The Committee 
also received a separate update from the Global Pensions team 
covering key activities over the year. 

The Group is cognisant of the wider regulatory environment and 
local requirements around funding levels and contributions. In 
May 2023, the triennial actuarial valuation as at 31 March 2022 
for the UK defined benefit pension scheme was agreed with 
AstraZeneca Pensions Trustee Limited (the Trustee of the UK 
pension scheme) and submitted to the Pensions Regulator. In 
December 2023, the Group enacted a charge over the 
Company’s Cambridge Biomedical Campus site, to provide 
long-term security to the AstraZeneca Pension Fund.

The Committee was reassured by the Group’s engaged and 
balanced approach to managing the risks associated with its 
defined benefit obligations, noting the completion of the 
actuarial valuation ahead of the statutory deadline. The 
Committee reviewed and concurred with management’s 
accounting and presentation of pension balances.

The Committee is cognisant of the need to adhere to local 
funding regulations and noted the security provided by the 
Group, which underwrites obligations to members.

Guaranteed Minimum Pensions (GMP) equalisation is now 
largely complete and most UK retirees were offered flexibility 
to reshape their benefit through a Pension Increase Exchange 
option.

In May 2023, the Group executed a buy-out of its qualified US 
Defined Benefit Pension Plan with an external insurer. All Plan 
liabilities have been discharged and the Plan has been 
wound-up.

The Committee was satisfied with the progress made on GMP 
equalisation, noting the additional flexibility offered.

The Committee was satisfied with the process and outcome of 
the US buy-out, noting that it reduces long-term financial risk to 
the Group and provides security to participants.

Audit Committee 
Report  
continued

Fair, balanced and 
understandable assessment
As in previous years, at the instruction of the 
Board, the Committee undertook an 
assessment of this Annual Report to ensure 
that, taken as a whole, it is fair, balanced and 
understandable and provides the information 
necessary for shareholders to assess the 
Company’s position and performance, 
business model and strategy. The Committee 
reviewed the Company’s governance 
structure and assurance mechanisms for the 
preparation of this Annual Report and, in 
particular, the contributor and SET member 
verification process. The Committee received 
an early draft of this Annual Report to review 
its proposed content and the structural 
changes from the prior year and to undertake 
a review of the reporting for the year, following 
which the Committee members provided their 
individual and collective feedback. In addition, 
in accordance with its terms of reference, the 
Committee (alongside the Board) took an 
active part in reviewing the Company’s 
quarterly announcements and considered the 
Company’s other public disclosures which are 
managed through its Disclosure Committee 
(the Committee was updated on matters 
considered by the Disclosure Committee 
regularly throughout the year). To aid its 
review further, the Committee also received 
a summary of the final Annual Report’s 
content, including AstraZeneca’s successes 
and setbacks during the year and an 
indication of where they were disclosed 
within the document.

The processes described above allowed the 
Committee to provide assurance to the Board 
to assist it in making the statement required of 
it under the Code, which is set out from 
page 81.

Internal controls
Information on the Company’s internal 
controls is included in the Audit, risk and 
internal control section in the Corporate 
Governance Report on page 82. During the 
period covered by this Annual Report there 
was no change in our internal control over 
financial reporting that occurred that has 
materially affected, or is reasonably likely to 
materially affect, our internal control over 
financial reporting.

The CFO (supported by the SVP Finance, 
Group Controller & Head of Global Finance 
Services), monitors the status of all services 
being provided by the external auditor. 
Authority to approve work exceeding the 
pre-agreed annual fee limits and for any 
individual service above the clearly trivial 
threshold is delegated to the Chair of the 
Committee together with one other 
Committee member in the first instance. 
A standing agenda item at Committee 
meetings covers the operation of the 
pre-approval procedures and regular reports 
are provided to the full Committee.

All services other than the pre-approved audit 
and audit-related services, require approval 
by the Committee on a case-by-case basis. 
In 2023, PwC provided audit services 
including interim reviews of the results of the 
Group for the period ended 30 June 2023 and 
audit-related and other assurance services. 

The increase to the statutory audit fee for 
2023 is largely driven by inflationary increases. 

Fees for audit-related and other assurance 
services amounted to 6% of the fees payable 
to PwC for audit services in 2023 (2022: 4%). 
The Committee is mindful of the 70% 
non-audit services fee cap under EU 
regulation, together with the overall proportion 
of fees for audit and audit-related services in 
determining whether to pre-approve such 
services. Fees for audit-related and other 
assurance services payable to PwC in 2023 
were 7% (2022: 6%) of average audit fees over 
2020 to 2022 (2022: 2019 to 2021). 

PwC were better placed than any alternative 
provider to provide these services in terms of 
their familiarity with the Company’s business, 
skills, capability and efficiency with which they 
could deliver the relevant services. All such 
services were either within the scope of the 
pre-approved services set out in the Policy or 
were presented to Committee members for 
pre-approval and all such services were 
permitted by the FRC Ethical Standard.

At the January 2024 Committee meeting, 
the CFO presented the conclusions of the 
evaluation by the CEO and CFO of the 
effectiveness of our disclosure controls and 
procedures that is required by Item 15(a) of 
Form 20-F as at 31 December 2023. Based 
on their evaluation, the CEO and the CFO 
concluded that, as at that date, the Company 
maintained an effective system of disclosure 
controls and procedures. 

External auditor
PwC is the Company’s external auditor. 
In April 2023, PwC was reappointed as the 
Company’s auditor for the financial year 
ended 31 December 2023, its seventh 
consecutive year as auditor, having first 
been appointed for the financial year ended 
31 December 2017, following a competitive 
tender carried out in 2015. Sarah Quinn 
continued as the lead audit partner at PwC 
for 2023 following her appointment in 
January 2022.

Audit, audit-related and other assurance 
services provided by the external auditor
The Committee maintains the Audit and 
Audit-Related Services Approval Policy (the 
Policy) for the pre-approval of all audit 
services, audit-related services and other 
assurance services undertaken by the 
external auditor. The principal purpose of the 
Policy is to ensure that the independence of 
the external auditor is not impaired.

The pre-approval procedures permit certain 
audit and audit-related services to be 
performed by the external auditor, subject to 
annual fee limits agreed with the Committee 
in advance. Pre-approved audit and 
audit-related services below the clearly trivial 
threshold (within the overall annual fee limit) 
are subject to case-by-case approval by the 
SVP Finance, Group Controller & Head of 
Global Finance Services.

Pre-approved audit services included services 
in respect of the annual financial statement 
audit (including quarterly and half-year 
reviews), attestation opinion under section 
404 of the Sarbanes-Oxley Act, statutory 
audits for subsidiary entities, and other 
procedures to be performed by the 
independent auditor in order to form an 
opinion on the Group’s Consolidated Financial 
Statements. The pre-approved audit-related 
services, which the Committee believes are 
services reasonably related to the 
performance of the audit or review of the 
Company’s Financial Statements, included 
certain services required by law or regulation, 
such as financial statement audits of 
employee benefit plans and capital market 
transactions. The Policy prohibits any tax 
services. Audit-related services included the 
assurance in relation to tax regulatory 
certificates required to be issued by the 
external auditor.

Additional Information

In order to comply with UK legal requirements 
regarding the auditor’s tenure and audit 
tendering, the external audit must be put out 
to tender before the 2027 financial year. In late 
2023, the Committee decided to commence 
the tender process for the audit mandate for 
the 2027 financial year. This will ensure 
sufficient time to carry out the process and, 
in the event that a new auditor is appointed, 
clear any conflicts and ensure a new auditor 
builds up the necessary knowledge and 
business familiarity to ensure the delivery of 
an effective audit. PwC is eligible to re-tender 
for the audit and has indicated its willingness 
to be one of the firms included in the tender. 
The Committee will lead the tender process 
and has approved an inclusive, competitive 
and transparent process by which the tender 
will be conducted to determine a high-quality 
audit delivery provider.

Regulation
The Committee considers that the Company 
has complied with the Competition and 
Markets Authority’s Statutory Audit Services 
for Large Companies Market Investigation 
(Mandatory Use of Competitive Tender 
Processes and Audit Committee 
Responsibilities) Order 2014 in respect of its 
financial year commencing 1 January 2023.

Assessing external audit effectiveness
In accordance with its normal practice, the 
Committee considered the performance of 
PwC and its compliance with the 
independence criteria under the relevant 
statutory, regulatory and ethical standards 
applicable to auditors. The Committee 
assessed PwC’s effectiveness principally 
against four key factors, namely: judgement; 
mindset and culture; skills, character and 
knowledge; and quality control. As part of that 
assessment, it also took account of the views 
of senior management within the Finance 
function and regular Committee attendees. 

As part of the Committee’s assessment of the 
quality of the audit, the Committee focused on 
the auditor’s effective use of experts and 
technology as well as appropriate challenge of 
management’s judgements especially in 
relation to areas of significant financial 
reporting issues (as described in the table 
from page 98). Areas that were reviewed by 
the Committee included PwC’s extensive and 
detailed review of the valuations and 
assumptions related to defined benefit 
pension valuations and the UK group 
company intragroup purchase of certain IP, 
assumptions and calculations over Gross to 
Net Product Sales, legal settlements in the 
year, intangible asset assumptions used in 
cashflow modelling, and the recognition and 
measurement of uncertain tax liabilities.

The Committee concluded that the PwC audit 
was effective for the financial year ended 
31 December 2023. In February 2024, the 
Committee recommended to the Board the 
reappointment of PwC as the Company’s 
auditor for the financial year ending 
31 December 2024. Accordingly, a resolution 
to reappoint PwC as auditor will be put to 
shareholders at the Company’s AGM in 
April 2024.

shareholder returns.

   The role of the Remuneration 
Committee is set out in its terms 
of reference, available at 
www.astrazeneca.com. 

On behalf of the Board, I am pleased 
to present AstraZeneca’s Directors’ 
Remuneration Report for the year ended 
31 December 2023. 

At the beginning of the year, we announced 
the launch of our inspiring new 2030 Bold 
Ambition. Since launch, significant progress 
has already been made towards delivering 
on our stretching target of 15 new medicines 
by 2030, including the approvals of Truqap, 
Wainua and Airsupra. With strong revenue 
growth in 2023 and over 30 Phase III clinical 
trials underway (10 of these expected to 
have blockbuster potential), it is clear that 
AstraZeneca’s remarkable performance 
trajectory is set to continue to deliver value 
to shareholders in the years to come.

Key Committee activities in 2023
The Committee was pleased to have received 
a high degree of support for the 2022 
Directors’ Remuneration Report, with a 94% 
vote in favour at the Company’s 2023 AGM. 

An important area of focus for the Committee 
this year has been reviewing the current 
Directors’ Remuneration Policy (the Policy), 
which is required to be put to shareholders at 
the 2024 AGM. 

In the period since our Policy was last 
approved in 2021, we are proud that 
AstraZeneca has continued to grow and 
prosper under our CEO’s leadership – 
delivering excellent returns for shareholders, 
and consistently positioned first or second in 
the FTSE 100, materially larger in size than 
other UK listed companies. As a major global 
organisation, operating within the highly 
competitive global pharmaceuticals sector, the 
Committee is very aware of the challenges of 
providing competitive executive remuneration 
which balances the genuine pay pressures 
from a talent market heavily influenced by US 
practice, and the expectations of UK investors 
and the corporate governance environment.

During 2023, I spent time meeting with 
investors who hold over 50% of the 
Company’s issued share capital to discuss 
the Committee’s proposals for the 2024 
Policy. The valuable feedback received was 
discussed with the Committee, and was 
factored into the Committee’s consideration of 
both executive remuneration in 2024 and the 
Policy which will be put to shareholders for 
approval at the 2024 AGM. The new proposals 
are summarised later in this letter, and our 
new Policy can be found from page 127.

AstraZeneca has a well-established high 
performance culture, and we are committed 
to delivering and rewarding excellent 
performance. Over the year, the Committee has 
worked closely with its independent advisor 
and the Audit, Science and Sustainability 
Committees to ensure that the financial, 
science and ESG measures in our incentive 
plans are appropriate, suitably stretching and 
accurately assessed in order to enable the 
Company to achieve the 2030 Bold Ambition 
and Growth Through Innovation strategy.

In addition to overseeing the reward 
arrangements in relation to our Senior 
Executive Team (SET), including those for the 
appointment of Sharon Barr as EVP, 
BioPharmaceuticals R&D, we continue to look 
further into total reward of the wider workforce 
and are supportive of the Company’s efforts 
to ensure reward decisions are equitable by 
career level, geography and gender. The 
Committee is pleased that 35% of the 
employee population are eligible to participate 
in AstraZeneca share plans so that employees 
can share in the Company’s performance and 
align with the experience of shareholders. We 
are proud that AstraZeneca remains 
committed to paying a living wage for all 
employees globally.

Additional Information

AstraZeneca’s 2023 performance
Science and Innovation: 2023 saw another 
year of exceptional performance as we 
continued to expand and rapidly advance our 
high-quality portfolio. The scientific progress 
is essential for our patients who stand to 
benefit from our medicines and we are 
delighted that not only did we deliver 30 
pipeline progression events, either NME 
Phase II starts or Phase III investment 
decisions, but we were also able to exceed 
our goal for regulatory events by delivering 46 
over the year. AstraZeneca also continued to 
invest for the future and build our scientific 
leadership, with highlights including the 
agreement with Quell Therapeutics and 
proposed acquisition of Gracell 
Biotechnologies to advance cell therapies 
across oncology and autoimmune diseases 
and the new licensing agreement with 
Eccogene for a novel once daily oral GLP-
1RA, adding an exciting early asset with 
potential as a next-generation treatment for 
cardiometabolic diseases, diabetes and 
obesity to the CVRM portfolio. 

Growth and Therapy Area Leadership: 
In 2023, the commercial and regulatory teams 
have made great progress driving a 3% 
(constant exchange rate (CER): 6%) growth in 
Total Revenue, despite a decline of $3,736 
million from COVID-19 medicines. Excluding 
COVID-19 medicines, Total Revenue 
increased by 13% (CER: 15%). Oncology Total 
Revenue increased by 19% (CER: 21%) to 
$18,447 million following approvals of Imfinzi 
for biliary tract cancer and Imfinzi plus Imjudo 
for liver and lung cancers. Tagrisso, Imfinzi, 
Lynparza and Calquence were once again all 
stand out performers. Within BioPharmaceuticals, 
there was strong growth in all non-COVID-19 
therapy areas. CVRM Total Revenue was up 
15% (CER: 18%) to $10,628 million driven by 
Forxiga, Lokelma, roxadustat and Andexxa. 
Respiratory & Immunology Total Revenue was 
$6,404 million, an increase of 7% (CER: 10%). 
Rare Disease Total Revenue grew by 10% 
(CER: 12%) to $7,764 million, largely driven by 
Ultomiris (up 51% (CER: 52%)), along with 
marked contribution from Strensiq, Koselugo 
and Kanuma as they expand into new markets.

People and Sustainability: We continue to 
strive to be a great place to work. We have 
continued to invest in developing our leaders 
and nurturing a culture of lifelong learning. In 
2023, over 11,000 employees have 
participated in an immersive development 
experience and over 1.2 million self-guided 
learning modules have been completed in our 
learning platform Degreed. Inclusion and 
diversity remains an important priority; in 2023 
the Company has focused on embedding 
equity into our talent processes, building 
inclusive leadership capabilities and engaging 
our global workforce through quarterly Power 
of Diversity programming, such as our

advancing to 50.1%, and have strong 
cultural diversity in our executive cohort, 
with 40 countries of origin represented in 
executive levels.

Sustainability is increasingly embedded into 
everything we do. The expansion of AZ 
Forest, raising our commitment to plant and 
ensure the long-term survival of over 200 
million trees by 2030, will contribute to 
Ambition Zero Carbon and remove around 
30 million tonnes of carbon dioxide from the 
atmosphere. Our ground-breaking partnership 
to deliver renewable natural gas to our US 
research and manufacturing sites will provide 
a source of clean heat which will contribute to 
our science-based target of reducing Scope 1 
and 2 emissions (operations and fleet) by 98% 
by 2026, whilst also contributing to the circular 
economy. We celebrated AstraZeneca being 
ranked number 1 among pharmaceutical 
companies for climate action in a new STAT 
Report, and we were proud of our strong 
presence at Climate Week and the UN 
General Assembly as we continued to drive 
change at scale.

2023 remuneration outcome
The Committee always seeks to ensure that 
the remuneration of our Executive Directors and 
our wider workforce reflects the underlying 
performance of the business. When approving 
outcomes, we therefore considered the Group 
scorecard along with wider business and 

individual performance over 2023, including 
other achievements across the enterprise, 
such as advancing our People and 
Sustainability priorities. In that context, the 
Committee believes that the payments 
outlined below fairly reflect their performance.

Annual bonus – 79.5% of maximum
When determining bonus outturns, the 
Committee considered the formulaic outcome 
from the Group scorecard along with wider 
business and individual impact and 
performance in 2023, including ESG 
achievements. The Committee determined to 
award an annual bonus equivalent to 79.5% of 
maximum to Mr Soriot and Dr Sarin (equivalent 
to 198.75% and 159% of base pay 
respectively), in line with the Group scorecard 
outcome. Details of the factors considered to 
determine the bonuses are provided from 
page 111.

    More information on the TSR 

peer groups for PSP awards can 
be found on page 115.

One half of each Executive Director’s bonus 
for 2023 will be deferred into AstraZeneca 
shares for three years to ensure further 
alignment with shareholder interests. 

Long-term incentives (LTIs)
2021 PSP – 88% of maximum
Our approach aims to reward sustainable 
outperformance and as a result of three very 
strong years, our 2021 award will vest towards 
the upper end of the possible range. The 
three-year performance period for 
Performance Share Plan (PSP) awards 
granted to our senior leaders in 2021, ended 
on 31 December 2023. Awards for all 
participants will vest at 88% of maximum, 
as shown on page 115 and reflects strong 
performance across all measures, as well as 
delivering a three-year TSR of 40%.

Policy review and remuneration in 2024
The Policy is due for renewal and we will be 
seeking shareholder approval for a new 
version of the Policy at the Company’s AGM 
on 11 April 2024. The new Policy is intended to 
remain in effect for three years from the date 
of the AGM.

During 2023, the Committee reviewed the 
Policy to ensure that it continues to be aligned 
with corporate governance best practice and 
promotes the delivery of long-term 
shareholder value. In shaping the new Policy, 
we have taken into account the perspectives 
of shareholders gathered from consultation 
undertaken during 2023. I met 26 of 
AstraZeneca’s largest shareholders and three 
proxy advisors to discuss our proposals, and 
was pleased with the level of engagement, 
feedback and support received. 

The purpose of the new Policy is to:

 > Incentivise the delivery of the Company’s 
2030 Bold Ambition and Growth Through 
Innovation strategy.

 > Continue to emphasise the importance 
the Committee places on performance-
related pay.

 > Retain and motivate incumbent Executive 
Directors to deliver against our strategy. 
 > Ensure that sufficient headroom exists to 
deliver market competitive performance 
based reward to our executives and down 
through the organisation.

In developing the new Policy proposals, the 
Committee noted that AstraZeneca has 
changed and grown significantly since the 
introduction of the 2021 Policy. The Company 
is more complex, with the integration of 
Alexion and the addition of successful new 
therapy areas in Rare Diseases and Vaccines 
& Immune Therapies. TSR of 40% has been 
delivered in this period, and Total Revenue 
has increased from $26.6 billion in 2020 to 
$45.8 billion at the end of 2023.

market-leading talent. Notably, we experience 
pay compression challenges under the 2021 
Policy, which does not provide sufficient 
headroom to deploy appropriately leveraged 
pay for performance compensation across our 
most senior leadership levels. Independent 
benchmarking of reward demonstrates that our 
current remuneration policy risks limiting our 
ability to compete for key roles below the Board, 
with heads of R&D being the most highly 
compensated roles in the industry below CEO 
level. 40% of our senior leaders are based in the 
US and over 40% of our revenue derives from 
the US. The Committee is acutely aware that we 
must be able to compete for the best talent in 
the US market. 

The Committee recognises that US pay 
practices differ from the UK, and in particular 
that US companies may offer a combination 
of time-based restricted stock, performance-
based stock, and sometimes market value 
options to executive directors. At AstraZeneca 
we firmly believe that executive pay should be 
clearly aligned to performance and therefore 
we are not proposing to alter the design of our 
incentive plans (annual bonus and PSP) in 
principle. However, in order to address the 
challenges of pay compression, and to 
provide a more competitive package for senior 
executives, we are proposing an increase to 
the maximum total incentive opportunity 
under our Policy, as set out below. The 
recommended changes will be accompanied 
by the Committee’s continued commitment to 
setting stretching targets, aligning to the 
delivery of the 2030 Bold Ambition. 

three-year cycle of the Policy. It will further 
engage our executive leadership in the 
conversion of the strength of our pipeline to 
commercial success, delivering industry-leading 
growth and our ambition of launching 15 new 
medicines by 2030 off the back of our planned 
material financial investment in future pipeline 
and partnerships. The importance of retaining 
and motivating our incumbent Executive 
Directors and senior leadership team in order 
to drive our 2030 Bold Ambition has been a 
key theme in consultation discussions with 
our shareholders. We seek to be competitive 
with comparable European pharma market 
peers and our proposals aim to reflect the 
performance, market capitalisation and future 
ambition of the Company in that context. 

Proposed changes to the Policy and how it 
will be implemented are summarised below 
and in more detail on page 127. The Policy is 
set out from page 128. The Committee would 
like to highlight that the key proposed changes 
are strictly linked to performance-related pay. 

 > No Policy changes are proposed in relation 

to base pay increases (which will not 
exceed the average of the relevant wider 
workforce) or pension arrangements 
(which are already in line with the relevant 
wider workforce).

 > We propose to increase the target annual 
bonus opportunity for the CEO, Mr Soriot, 
to 150% of base pay, resulting in a new 
maximum bonus of 300% of base pay 
(currently 250%), in line with the median target 
bonus opportunity of his global peer group. 
 > Target annual bonus for the CFO, Dr Sarin, 
remains unchanged at 100% of base pay, 
with a maximum bonus opportunity of 
200% of base pay. 

We face increasing external talent market 
pressure as our employees are rightly viewed as 

I believe that the proposed Policy reflects our 
current market position but, more importantly, 
should set us up for success over the next

 > Half of any earned bonus will be deferred 

into shares for three years. 

 > For awards under the PSP our proposal is 
to increase the maximum award under the 
Policy to 850% of base pay from the current 
650%, subject to appropriately stretching 
performance targets. This new maximum 
would apply to Mr Soriot in 2024 provided 
that it is approved by shareholders. 
 > Dr Sarin’s 2024 PSP opportunity would 

increase to 550% of base pay (from 450%).

 > At the same time, in light of feedback 
received from investors, the minimum 
shareholding requirement for each of our 
Executive Directors will increase to match 
their maximum variable pay opportunity, 
being 1,150% base pay for Mr Soriot, and 
750% base pay for Dr Sarin. 

The Committee recognises that these 
proposals are material if viewed in a UK 
context. However, the changes are necessary 
to increase the competitiveness of the 
performance-related pay opportunity in the 
context of the global and European pharma 
market. Given the size, complexity and global 
reach of AstraZeneca, the Committee does 
not consider the constituents of the FTSE 100 
to be an appropriate group against which to 
benchmark remuneration. Our approach is to 

look at remuneration opportunity amongst the 
European and global pharma peers with 
whom we compete for talent and compare 
performance and to determine a Policy which 
is highly weighted towards pay for 
performance. The charts below show our 
Executive Directors’ on-target and maximum 
opportunity relative to our defined comparator 
groups. Our proposed changes will bring 
Mr Soriot to the lower quartile of our global 
peer group, but will better reflect 
AstraZeneca’s relative position within the 
European peer group, moving up one position 
in the global and European rankings for target 
compensation and two positions at maximum 
(due to the higher proportion of pay at risk 
compared with peers). The increased PSP 
opportunity for Dr Sarin will bring her 
compensation into line with the global median 
of her peers. The importance of being able to 
offer our impactful and talented CEO a 
competitive remuneration package, has been 
a key area of interest raised by shareholders 
in consultation discussions.

The Committee is not proposing to make any 
changes to the choice of performance metrics 
and their weightings for the Annual bonus or 
the PSP in 2024, as feedback from our 
shareholders is that the metrics successfully

align pay with performance outcomes. Given 
the proposed increase in quantum, the 
Committee has rigorously reviewed the 
stretch in performance targets for 2024 to 
ensure they are appropriate and 
commensurate with delivery of excellent 
shareholder value. 

The Board considers that the proposed 
changes will enable our remuneration 
framework to be more competitive as we 
focus on the delivery of our 2030 Bold 
Ambition for our patients and shareholders. 
The emphasis on performance-related pay 
ensures that outcomes are fully aligned with 
shareholder interests as we address the need 
to attract and retain outstanding talent.

The Committee took shareholders’ feedback 
into account on the proposed changes to the 
Policy, and we would like to take this 
opportunity to thank all those who took part 
for their constructive engagement and 
support for our proposals.

Non-Executive Directors’ fees
With effect from January 2024, certain of the 
Non-Executive Directors’ fees have been 
increased. This reflects the continuing 
increase in workload and responsibilities of 
non-executive directors of large, global, 
complex, publicly listed companies, including 
the importance of the Science Committee and 
the Sustainability Committee to the Board’s 
work and the workloads of these Committees. 
AstraZeneca Non-Executive Directors’ fees 
have not been increased since January 2022. 
No Board member participated in any 
decisions relating to their own fees. Further 
detail is provided on page 118.

Additional Information

AstraZeneca aims to continue to deliver great 
medicines to patients while maintaining cost 
discipline and a flexible cost base, driving 
operating leverage and increased cash 
generation. To incentivise and reward delivery 
of great performance over the short and 
longer term, the Committee carefully 
considers the balance of science, financial 
and ESG measures between the Annual 
bonus and PSP. 

Our focus on incentivising innovative science 
aligns with our patient-centric culture, as we 
strive to push the boundaries of science to 
deliver life-changing medicines to patients. 
The 2024 performance measures are closely 
aligned with our strategic priorities, as 
shown below.

Science indices 
Our science measures incentivise the 
development of NMEs and the maximisation 
of the potential of existing medicines.

Bonus performance is assessed on pipeline 
progressions through Phase II and Phase III 
clinical trials. These reflect the outcome 
of nearer-term strategic investment decisions, 
whereas, in contrast, PSP performance is 
assessed on the volume of NMEs in 
Phase III and the registration stage, which 
reflects the outcome of longer-term strategic 
investment decisions. 

Additionally, we measure regulatory 
submissions and approvals for bonus, and 
regulatory approvals for PSP to drive the 
conversion of scientific progress into 
commercial revenue over the short term 
(bonus) and the longer term (PSP). 

Together, these science measures incentivise 
innovation and sustainable success along the 
length and breadth of the pipeline, leading to 
commercial growth.

Strategic pillar

 People and Sustainability 

We are committed to people and making a 
difference to society. Assessment of 
performance against this pillar is captured 
through a holistic review of each Executive 
Director’s individual performance (detailed on 
pages 112 and 113) as part of the final 
determination of annual bonus, including 
consideration of our progress against our 
ESG aspirations:

Total Revenue 
Our Total Revenue measure is included in the 
bonus and the PSP, reflecting the importance of 
incentivising sustainable growth in both the 
short and longer term.

Cash flow 
Ensures that we can sustain investment in 
our pipeline and Therapy Areas while at the 
same time meeting our capital allocation 
priorities. Cash flow is included in both the 
bonus and the PSP, ensuring a focus on both 
short- and longer-term cash flow generation 
and balance sheet strength.

Core EPS 
Incentivises operational efficiency and cost 
discipline, and remains a key measure of our 
profitability and a focus for our investors.

Total shareholder return (TSR) 
Assessed relative to our peer group of 
companies, the measure rewards positive 
performance that our shareholders also 
directly benefit from. This measure 
incentivises outperformance versus our peer 
group, and promotes the delivery of long-term 
sustainable returns for our shareholders.

 > Continuing to make our Company a great 
place to work by delivering our inclusion 
and diversity strategy and learning and 
development programmes.

 > Ensuring we operate in the smartest 

way and increase the speed of delivery 
of our life-changing medicines to 
patients through our Future of Work 
strategic initiative.

 > Leading the way in our efforts to improve 
access to healthcare and build health 
system resilience.

Ambition Zero Carbon 
This measure incentivises the 
elimination of our Scope 1 and Scope 2 
GHG emissions through 2025 with 
targets verified in line with the science of 
climate change, where we will innovate to 
avoid, reduce and substitute to become 
zero carbon.

How the Remuneration Committee 
ensures targets are stretching

We set stretching targets that incentivise our leaders to deliver exceptional performance, and to drive sustainable results for our patients, 
our employees and our shareholders. 2024 targets:
 > The Committee has reviewed the proposed targets against internal and external forecasts, including market consensus and peer group 

performance, and is comfortable that the level of stretch promotes truly exceptional performance in line with the delivery of our 2030 Bold Ambition. 

 > In real terms, financial performance goals under the 2024 Group scorecard and PSP would require achievement above prior year outturns 

and growth in excess of the average expected of the industry, particularly when taking the significant capital investment expected to be made 
during the performance period. 

Consistent with our approach in prior years we undertake the following robust process to setting annual bonus and PSP targets and 
assessing outcomes:

Stage 1 – 
Target setting

Stage 2 – 
Committee review 
and approval 
of targets

Science targets are based on a cohort of scientific opportunities 
specified at the start of the performance period. Opportunities 
represent potential achievements through the pipeline, from an 
early stage where our scientists work to discover new molecules, 
through to ultimately obtaining approvals and getting new 
medicines to patients. Rewarding success at each stage 
recognises the importance of creating and maintaining a 
long-term sustainable pipeline. Stretch of proposed targets is 
reviewed by the Science Committee taking into account factors 
such as the expected net present value of the pipeline and the 
anticipated financial contribution it will make, past performance, 
the external regulatory environment, and internal resourcing and 
efficiencies. Targets for realisation of these opportunities are 
ambitious. The outlook for the delivery of the pipeline is 
increasingly challenging given the rising proportion of new 
modalities and innovation, representing previously 
untested science.

Proposed targets for the Ambition Zero Carbon measure are 
reviewed and endorsed by the Sustainability Committee and 
exceed the 1.5°C Paris Agreement glide path. Our decarbonisation 
ambitions are increasingly challenging to deliver in the context of 
broader enterprise growth, particularly the higher supply 
volumes required to fulfil demand for our medicines.

Financial Targets metrics align with the Company’s Mid-Term 
Plan (MTP), which sets out the financial framework for delivering 
our ambitious strategy over a three-year period. The MTP 
process includes detailed business reviews, during which plans 
and efficiencies of each unit are challenged, leading to a 
proposed MTP for the Board to review and challenge. The 
Committee sets targets based on the Board-approved MTP, 
considering consensus expectations, independent analytics 
and anticipated challenges and opportunities. Whilst Total 
Revenue and Core EPS targets are set at budget exchange 
rates at the beginning of the performance period and evaluated 
at those rates at the end of the performance period (so that any 
beneficial or adverse movements in currency do not impact 
reward outcomes), the Committee also compares targets 
against prior plans at constant exchange rates, to ensure that 
new targets incentivise ambitious levels of growth. Where 
consensus figures do not align with internal forecasts, the 
Committee seeks to understand why a difference exists (such 
as differences in assumed capital expenditure). This range of 
data is used by the Committee to ensure the stretching nature 
of performance targets is robustly tested. Additionally, the PSP 
TSR measure is designed to reward strong performance relative 
to our peers.

The Committee thoroughly reviews and challenges targets 
proposed by management, working in partnership with the 
Science and Sustainability Committees to ensure targets are 
stretching and robust.

The Committee is provided with considerable supporting 
material for each metric and receives briefings from senior 
leaders across AstraZeneca. The science measures are reviewed 
and endorsed by the Science Committee, with a focus on 
ensuring that the targets will result in long-term sustainable value 
creation, and the Committee reviews and approves the full 
cohort of opportunities. The ESG metric within the PSP is aligned 
to our Ambition Zero Carbon goal and reflects the importance of 
eliminating GHG emissions in our Scope 1 and Scope 2 
operations through 2025.

The Ambition Zero Carbon metric has been reviewed and 
endorsed by our Sustainability Committee. 

Committee members participate in the full Board discussions 
on the strategy, MTP and budget, which form the basis for the 
targets. The Committee considers how proposed financial 
targets align with the MTP and budget; prior years’ outcomes 
(in absolute terms and against target); how the ambition has 
changed from the prior MTP and budget; external guidance the 
Company has provided or plans to give; consensus from 
external financial analysts and factors it may be impacted by; 
and the underlying assumptions. Statistical analysis conducted 
by the Committee’s independent adviser is also used to assess 
the proposals. This includes an assessment of historical levels 
of performance volatility.

Stage 3 – 
Performance 
assessment

At the end of the period, final performance against each metric is 
assessed. Outcomes are calculated based on performance 
against each weighted metric. Each performance measure is 
assessed on a standalone basis, so that underperformance 
against one measure cannot be compensated for by 
overperformance against another. Data for the metrics is taken 
from the Group’s financial reports which are reviewed by the 
Audit Committee and approved by the Board.

Stage 4 – 
Determination of 
Executive Directors’ 
bonuses

For annual bonus, the fairness of the formulaic Group scorecard 
outcome is considered in the context of overall business 
performance and the experience of shareholders. Such 
considerations include TSR performance and each Executive 
Director’s personal impact on the delivery of the strategy, wider 
ESG performance and other organisational achievements, such 
as inclusion and diversity targets and the realisation of 
technology-based milestones. Each year, there are important 
individual deliverables beyond the scorecard metrics which are 
taken into account when determining individual bonuses.

The Science Committee independently considers and informs 
the Committee whether science achievements represent a fair 
and balanced outcome, reflecting genuine achievements and 
pipeline progression. Ambition Zero Carbon outcomes are 
validated by the Sustainability Committee. Apart from Cash 
flow, which is set at actual rates of exchange, financial metrics 
are set at budget rates of exchange and evaluated at those 
rates at year end, which means they are not directly comparable 
year-on-year. The Committee is, however, provided with data to 
allow it to conduct year-on-year analyses.

Having considered the Group scorecard outcome, overall 
business performance, the experience of shareholders and 
individual performance, as detailed from page 112, the 
Committee carefully determines a final bonus outcome for each 
Executive Director that is considered fair and appropriate for the 
year’s performance, and is in the best interests of shareholders.

alongside the remuneration that will be paid to Executive Directors during 2024.

Executive Directors’ realised pay for 2023 (single total figure of remuneration)
The table below sets out all elements of realised pay receivable by the Executive Directors in respect of the year ended 31 December 2023,
alongside comparator figures for 2022. This includes the vesting of PSP awards from 2021 following the three-year performance period. These
shares are subject to a further two-year holding period. The significant increase in AstraZeneca’s share price over the period of grant to vest has
provided the Executive Directors with a significant increase in value of the equity components of their reward. £3,945,583 of Mr Soriot’s and
£374,506 of Dr Sarin’s 2023 realised pay is attributable to share price increases. The benefit of the increased share price has also been
experienced by shareholders.

2023 Group scorecard assessment
Performance against the 2023 Group scorecard is set out below. 

Audited

The Group scorecard is used in the determination of bonus payouts for all AstraZeneca employees. Each metric within the scorecard is 
assessed on a standalone basis and has a defined payout range.

Performance below the specified threshold level for a metric will result in 0% payout for that metric. 100% of target bonus will pay out for 
on-target performance, and 200% of target bonus will pay out for performance at or above maximum. Performance between threshold and 
maximum is assessed on a pro rata basis. Maximum bonus payouts for the CEO and CFO for 2023 were capped at 250% and 200% of base 
pay respectively. The payout range for each metric is capped in line with each Executive Director’s maximum bonus opportunity to ensure 
underperformance against one metric cannot be compensated for by overachievement against another. The table below shows the scorecard 
formulaic outcomes for the CEO and CFO as a percentage of target bonus.

Annual bonus continued

In 2023, the Growth and Therapy Area Leadership measure was based on Total Revenue. The Total Revenue and Core EPS measures are both 
set and evaluated at budget exchange rates at the beginning of the year and evaluated at those rates at the end of the performance period, so 
that any beneficial or adverse movements in currency, which are outside the Company’s control, do not impact reward outcomes. The Cash flow 
measure is set and evaluated at the actual exchange rate and is evaluated by reference to net cash flow from operating activities less capital 
expenditure, adding back proceeds from disposal of intangible assets, to be fully transparent with all elements easily derived from the Group IFRS 
Cash Flow Statement. 

Overall assessment
During 2023, the Executive Directors’ individual performance was assessed in the following key areas which align with the Company’s objectives. 

Audited

Pascal Soriot

Mr Soriot has skillfully steered AstraZeneca through another successful year. Commercial execution across all therapy areas and regions was very strong, 
underpinned by robust manufacturing and supply. Scientific performance in 2023 saw several significant positive read outs and regulatory approvals, including the 
launch of three new medicines that will contribute to the delivery of the Company’s 2030 Bold Ambition: Airsupra, Truqap and Wainua. Mr Soriot continues to lead 
the Company to drive Growth Through Innovation in science, with over a third of our pipeline now representing new modalities in 2023, reinforcing the 
transformative potential of our industry leading pipeline. Mr Soriot also oversaw the identification and signing of a number of impactful business development 
transactions during the year, including the licensing of a novel GLP-1 asset from Eccogene for obesity, the transaction with CinCor and proposed acquisition of 
Gracell Biotechnologies, which are expected to further accelerate delivery in cell therapy and oncology. 

Throughout 2023, Mr Soriot maintained a strong financial position for AstraZeneca, delivering yet another year of growth in revenue and profitability. The 
Committee also considered Mr Soriot’s leadership across other dimensions of performance: 

Demonstrating 
leadership to support 
developments in global 
life sciences

Mr Soriot has continued to drive change through a diverse set of external engagements with world leaders including senior government 
officials from the US, Canada, China and Sweden, enhancing strategic partnerships and catalysing innovation, demonstrating his 
thought leadership, his ability to drive global change and his influence on key issues.

He was the only private sector CEO to deliver a keynote speech at Climate Week in the presence of HM King Charles III and delivered a 
key note speech on Public – Private Partnerships for Healthcare Climate Action at COP28 in Dubai. He also attended both the American 
Society of Clinical Oncology (ASCO) and the European Society for Medical Oncology (ESMO) where he had the opportunity to engage 
with the scientific community, highlighting pivotal data that strengthens our confidence that we will replace conventional chemotherapy 
for many patients with advanced lung and breast cancers. 

Leading in 
Environmental, Social & 
Governance (ESG) 
performance 

Mr Soriot continued to advocate for an uncompromising sustainability agenda at AstraZeneca exemplifying, through his leadership, 
the essential role of ESG within AstraZeneca’s strategy and also the important role global leaders have in the direction of global 
decarbonisation, demonstrated by his leadership of the SMI Health Systems; and advancing climate action through his leadership and 
involvement in an industry collaboration to increase renewable energy to the industry’s supply base. His efforts have been recognised 
at COP28 and by TIME magazine which named Mr Soriot in its inaugural TIME100 Climate.

Making AstraZeneca a 
great place to work

Under Mr Soriot’s leadership, in 2023 AstraZeneca has improved or maintained its position on the ESG disclosures listings we report 
on, including receiving a Gold score from Ecovadis (previously Silver) and a step-up in the Corporate Sustainability Assessment (CSA) 
position to 4th in the sector. 

In 2023, AstraZeneca embarked on an extensive expansion of AZ Forest including forest protection and biodiversity for a cumulative 
200 million trees. It is estimated that AZ Forest will remove around 30 million tonnes of carbon dioxide from the atmosphere over 30 
years, demonstrating our commitment to environmental conservation, made possible by Mr Soriot’s leadership.

Healthy Heart Africa (HHA) continued to expand, launching in eight new countries. Over 43 million screenings have been conducted 
since the programme began, and 11,390 healthcare professionals trained. In total, over 66 million people have been reached by Access 
to Healthcare programmes.

Mr Soriot has continued to highlight the importance of having a truly diverse workforce, striving to drive a business with an inclusive 
and equitable environment where people feel that they belong, where they feel valued for the contribution they make, and empowered 
to push boundaries and innovate. Our Inclusion & Diversity (I&D) strategy, “The Power of Diversity” remained a key focus with topics 
including Clinical Trial Diversity, Cultural Intelligence, and spotlighting the work of our Employee Resource Groups (ERGs). AstraZeneca 
celebrated global I&D recognition days throughout the year including International Women’s Day, Neurodiversity Celebration Week, 
World Day for Cultural Diversity, Pride Month, International Day of the Girl and International Day for Persons with Disabilities.

Our progress was recognised externally on the 2023 Bloomberg Gender-Equality Index, Human Rights Corporation Corporate Equality 
Index, TIME World’s Best Companies, Forbes World’s Best Employers, Forbes World’s Top Companies for Women and Financial Times 
Leader in Diversity. 

Mr Soriot’s emphasis on leaders as coaches of our employees, and support for investments in lifelong learning has been key to 
providing our people with opportunities to perform, stretch, grow and take charge of their development. In 2023 AstraZeneca received 
several external, highly-respected awards for internal talent management programmes, including ‘Diversity by Design’ which won the 
Healthcare Businesswomen’s Association (HBA) Advancement. Commitment. Engagement. (ACE) Award and, alongside the 
Empowerment programme, also contributed to making AstraZeneca the Learning & Development winner of the Personnel Today 
Awards 2023.

Aradhana Sarin 

Audited

Dr Sarin continued to demonstrate her skills as a leader across the enterprise, helping to elevate a high-performance culture and driving efficiencies 
and simplification.

Performance delivery 

Under Dr Sarin’s leadership, the finance function continued to deliver strong performance and made significant steps in tax planning 
for the future, along with debt refinancing for the business building in additional flexibility to help support future business development. 
Dr Sarin was personally involved in the strategic and finance review for five major business development transactions, including CinCor, 
Pfizer Gene Therapy Portfolio, Eccogene, Icosavax and the proposed acquisition of Gracell Biotechnologies, along with providing 
guidance on negotiations, resulting in attractive terms for AstraZeneca.

Creating an enterprise-
wide impact through 
Global Business 
Services (GBS)

Under Dr Sarin’s guidance, GBS has maintained a pivotal role in AstraZeneca’s transformation. Aligned to the Future of Work, Dr Sarin 
has emphasised the need for simplifying, standardising, and scaling services so that AstraZeneca can deliver more medicines, faster 
and to more patients. 

Guided by Dr Sarin’s leadership, significant advances have been made creating efficiencies through clever use of new technology; the 
introduction of a transformational programme for data management which replaces multiple processes and uses integrated analytics 
that optimise process performance, and automated checks to ensure that data is right the first time; a new initiative on vendor demand 
which is transforming the way we search, find and buy goods and services; and an app developed and deployed which assists teams in 
Oncology Breast Cancer enabling them to make study co-location decisions – allowing studies to progress faster and removing 
complexities faced by Clinical Operations teams. All of these developments will help AstraZeneca to grow and change at speed.

Great place to work/ 
employee engagement

Dr Sarin continued to strive for increased diversity in the workplace. In June, she became the executive sponsor of AstraZeneca’s 
Network of Women.

Dr Sarin supported several I&D recognition days including World Day for Cultural Diversity and Dialogue, International Women’s Day 
and International Day of the Girl, for which she hosted a discussion panel focussing on the work of the Young Health Programme in 
driving greater equity for women and girls around the world.

Dr Sarin’s leadership style and positive influence on the team was reflected with Pulse scores showing that 90% of employees in the 
Finance function would recommend AstraZeneca as a great place to work and 91% believing that managers are committed to diversity 
and inclusion.

Final determination of Executive Directors’ bonuses
In determining the annual bonus outturn for Executive Directors, the Committee considers the formulaic Group scorecard outcome, as well as the 
overall business performance, shareholder experience and the personal contribution of the individual Executive Director. A description of the 
Executive Directors’ personal achievements is detailed above. 

Audited

Given the contributions made by both Mr Soriot and Dr Sarin in 2023 as outlined above, the Committee determined the bonus outturns for both 
Executive Directors should be 159% of target (or 79.5% of maximum), in line with the formulaic Group scorecard outcome.

Deferred Bonus Plan (DBP)
Half of each Executive Director’s pre-tax annual bonus is ordinarily deferred under the DBP. In respect of the bonus deferred, the Executive 
Director is granted a conditional award over shares. No further performance conditions apply to DBP shares. One half of the bonus earned in 
respect of performance during 2022 was deferred and details of the consequent DBP awards granted in 2023 are shown below. One half of the 
Executive Directors’ bonus earned in respect of performance during 2023 has been deferred and the consequent DBP awards are expected to be 
granted in March 2024.

The 2021 PSP awards granted to Mr Soriot on 5 March 2021 and 14 May 2021, to take account of the revised limits for the PSP which were 
approved by shareholders at the Company’s 2021 AGM, are due to vest and be released on 5 March 2026 and 14 May 2026 on completion 
of a further two-year holding period. The 2021 PSP award was granted to Dr Sarin on 13 August 2021 following her appointment as CFO on 
1 August 2021. The award made to Dr Sarin was pro-rated to reflect that she took up the role part way through 2021. Her award is due to vest on 
13 August 2026 on completion of a further two-year holding period. Performance over the period from 1 January 2021 to 31 December 2023 
will result in 88% of the awards vesting, based on the following assessment of performance. The 2021 PSP targets were reviewed in light of 
the enlarged Group following the acquisition of Alexion. The Science and Innovation, Growth and Therapy Area Leadership, Ambition Zero 
Carbon and Cash flow targets were all amended in line with the Committee’s approach of ensuring performance targets are not materially 
more or less stretching as a result of the transaction and continue to incentivise strong delivery. No amendments were made to the TSR 
performance measure.

Long-term incentives

The Growth and Therapy Area Leadership 
target (measuring Total Revenue) is set at 
budget exchange rates at the beginning of the 
performance period and evaluated at those 
rates at the end of the performance period, so 
that any beneficial or adverse movements in 
currency, which are outside the Company’s 
control, do not impact reward outcomes.

The Cash flow measure is assessed 
using cumulative net cash flow from 
operating activities less capital expenditure, 
adding back proceeds from disposal of 
intangible assets.

which is therefore commercially sensitive. The other original targets were disclosed in the Company’s annual report for the 
year ended 31 December 2020.

PSP awards granted during 2023
During 2023, conditional awards of shares were granted to the Executive Directors with face values equivalent to 650% of base pay for Mr Soriot 
and 450% of base pay for Dr Sarin under the PSP. Face value is calculated using the grant price, being the average closing share price over the 
three dealing days preceding grant. 

Performance will be assessed over the period from 1 January 2023 to 31 December 2025 against the measures outlined below to determine the 
proportion of the award that vests. A further two-year holding period will then apply before vesting, which is scheduled to occur on the fifth 
anniversary of grant.

The 2023 PSP performance measures focus on scientific, ESG, commercial and financial performance over the three-year performance period. 
The five performance metrics attached to the 2023 PSP awards are detailed below. Twenty per cent of the award will vest if the threshold level of 
performance is achieved; the maximum level of performance must be achieved under each measure for 100% of the award to vest. 

Relative total shareholder return (TSR) (20% of award)
TSR performance is assessed against a predetermined peer group of global pharmaceutical companies and consists of AbbVie, Amgen, Astellas, 
BMS, Daiichi Sankyo, Eli Lilly, Gilead, GSK, Johnson & Johnson, Merck KGaA, Moderna, MSD, Novartis, Novo Nordisk, Pfizer, Roche, Sanofi and 
Takeda. The rank which the Company’s TSR achieves over the performance period will determine how many shares will vest under this measure.

Net Cash flow (20% of award)
The Cash flow measure is assessed using cumulative net cash flow from operating activities less capital expenditure adding back proceeds from 
disposal of intangible assets. The level of vesting under this measure is based on a scale between a threshold target and an upper target.

Growth and Therapy Area Leadership (20% of award)
For PSP awards granted in 2023, the Growth and Therapy Area Leadership metric is Total Revenue. Disclosing the threshold and maximum 
hurdles for this measure could be construed to constitute financial guidance, which is not the Company’s intention. The Growth and Therapy Area 
Leadership (Total Revenue) measure is thus considered to be commercially sensitive and will be disclosed following the end of the performance 
period, in the 2025 Directors’ Remuneration Report. This measure is evaluated by reference to budget exchange rates.

Science and Innovation: First approvals and NME volume over three years (30% of award)
Performance is assessed using dual indices which measure NME Phase III/registrational volume and regulatory events, allowing disclosure of 
targets at the beginning of the performance period.

Regulatory events measure NME and major life-cycle management approvals (taking into account the first approval over the performance 
period). NME Phase III/registrational volume measures the total NME pipeline volume at the end of the performance period. These two items 
ensure that management is assessed on both R&D late-stage delivery (approvals) and also future pipeline sustainability (volume). 

Disclosing the threshold and maximum hurdles for the Growth and Therapy Area Leadership (Total Revenue) measure could be construed to 
constitute financial guidance, which is not the Company’s intention. The Total Revenue measure is thus considered to be commercially 
sensitive and will be disclosed following the end of the performance period.

The Total Revenue measure is evaluated by reference to budget exchange rates such that beneficial or adverse movements in currency, which 
are outside the Company’s control, do not impact reward outcomes. The Cash flow measure is evaluated using net cumulative cash flow from 
operating activities less capital expenditure adding back proceeds from disposal of intangible assets. The companies in the TSR comparator 
group are shown on page 125. 

The Cash flow measure is assessed using cumulative net cash flow from operating activities less capital expenditure adding back proceeds 
from disposal of intangible assets. Capital expenditure is expected to increase by more than 50% during the performance period, driven by 
investment in several major manufacturing capabilities such as API, inhaled products, monoclonal antibodies and cell therapy.

Our Ambition Zero Carbon measure is based on our Scope 1 and Scope 2 emissions reductions from our 2015 baseline. Further detail on our 
commitment can be found on page 148.

As described on page 107, the Committee takes into account a wide range of data to ensure that the stretching nature of PSP hurdles is 
robustly tested and that financial targets are aligned with the Company’s Mid-Term Plan. The Committee takes consensus and exchange rates 
into account when determining the appropriate level of stretch.

PSP awards are expected to be granted to the Executive Directors in March 2024. The PSP award to be granted to Dr Sarin will be equivalent to 
550% of base pay. The PSP award to be granted to Mr Soriot will be equivalent to 650% of base pay. Subject to the approval of our proposed 
Directors’ Remuneration Policy and amended rules of the PSP at the Company’s AGM on 11 April 2024, a further PSP award will be granted to 
Mr Soriot equivalent to 200% of base pay, bringing Mr Soriot’s total PSP award for 2024 in line with the maximum opportunity under the Policy.

Leif Johansson retired from the Board on 27 April 2023. Mr Johansson’s single total figure includes office costs (invoiced in Swedish kronor) of 
£21,955 for the period in 2023 during which he was Chair of the Board and £69,524 for 2022. From 1 May 2023, the Chair of the Board did not 
receive office costs. 

Non-Executive Directors’ fee structure
The Non-Executive Directors’ fees effective from January 2024 are set out in the table below, alongside the fees applicable during 2023. Fees for 
the Non-Executive Directors (other than the Chair of the Board) are determined by the Chair and the Executive Directors. No Board member 
participated in any decisions relating to their own fees.

The fee structure is reviewed, but not necessarily increased every two years. The Non-Executive Directors’ fees have not been increased since 
January 2022. The Chair’s fee was separately reviewed in July 2022 and increased with effect from May 2023. It is next due for review in 2024.
With effect from January 2024, increases have been made to the basic Board fee for Non-Executive Directors (excluding the Chair), the senior 
independent Non-Executive Director’s fee, the Chairs’ fees for Board Committees (excluding the Nomination and Governance Committee in 
respect of which no additional fees are paid), as well as the fees for membership of the Science Committee and the Sustainability Committee. 
In the latest review, the overall size and complexity of the AstraZeneca Group was considered, together with the continuing increase in workload, 
responsibilities, and time commitment for non-executive directors of global, publicly listed companies, in part driven by changes in the corporate 
governance and regulatory landscape in multiple jurisdictions. The fees for the Chairs of the Science Committee and the Sustainability 
Committee, as well as membership fees for these Committees, have been increased to reflect the contribution of these Committees to the 
sustained future growth of the Company. 

The latest review also considered independently-sourced market data for FTSE 30 and FTSE 10 companies, to ensure that the level of 
AstraZeneca’s fees do not hinder the recruitment of Directors of the right experience and calibre for a Group of our scale in a global market.

Directors’ shareholdings

Minimum shareholding requirements
The CEO and CFO are each required to build a shareholding to satisfy their respective minimum shareholding requirements (MSR), each within 
five years of their dates of appointment or, if the MSR is increased at any time, within five years of that increase. The MSR for 2023 are set out 
below. Shares that count towards the MSR are shares beneficially held by the Executive Director and their connected persons and share awards 
that are not subject to further performance conditions. Share awards included are DBP shares in deferral periods, and PSP and AstraZeneca 
Investment Plan (AZIP) shares in holding periods, on a net-of-tax basis. 

Audited

A further post-employment shareholding requirement applies to Executive Directors. For two years following cessation of employment, 
Executive Directors are required to hold shares to the value of the shareholding requirement that applied at the cessation of their employment; 
or, in cases where the individual has not had sufficient time to build up shares to meet their guideline, the actual level of shareholding at cessation. 
The post-cessation requirement will be maintained through self-certification, with the Committee keeping this approach under review.

Non-Executive Directors are encouraged to build up, over a period of three years, a shareholding in the Company with a value approximately 
equivalent to the basic annual fee for a Non-Executive Director (£95,000 during 2023) or, in the case of the Chair, approximately equivalent to his 
basic annual fee (£800,000 during 2023). All Non-Executive Directors who had served for a period of three years or more as at 31 December 2023 
met this expectation, based on the three-month average closing share price for the period ended 31 December 2023 (10,401 pence).

Payments to former Directors
Audited
Marc Dunoyer was granted a PSP award in 2021, whilst in the position of CFO and Executive Director of AstraZeneca PLC. Mr Dunoyer stepped 
down as an Executive Director on 1 August 2021, part way through the 2021 PSP performance period, but remained a member of the SET. 
Consistent with other participants in the PSP, performance over the period 1 January 2021 to 31 December 2023 will result in 88% of Mr 
Dunoyer’s award granted in 2021 vesting on completion of a further two-year holding period. This represents 8,868 shares vesting when pro-rated 
to reflect the performance period during which Mr Dunoyer was an Executive Director (1 January 2021 to 1 August 2021).

Payments for loss of office
During 2023, no payments were made to Directors for loss of office.

Remuneration in the wider context
In our Corporate Governance Report on page 81, we explain in detail how the Board has chosen to engage with AstraZeneca’s workforce, and 
how important engagement with our employees is if we are to be a great place to work and continue to deliver outstanding performance. The 
Directors believe that the Board as a whole should continue to take responsibility for gathering the views of the workforce. Consequently, instead 
of implementing one of the three methods for workforce engagement prescribed in the 2018 UK Corporate Governance Code, the Board chose to 
enhance and develop the long-standing channels of engagement which already exist in the organisation to ensure that the Board continues to 
understand the global workforce’s views on a wide variety of topics, including matters relating to remuneration.

The Committee communicates with, and receives feedback from, employees through a variety of channels, including meetings with high-potential 
employees and attending site visits, both virtually and in person. This allows the Committee to communicate with employees on remuneration 
matters where appropriate. Committee members review wide-ranging data on reward across our global workforce, as well as broader information 
on workforce trends and culture, which is also provided to the full Board. The Committee receives in-depth reports throughout the year on 
colleague pay, benefits, incentives, performance management approach and broader talent policies at AstraZeneca to ensure that the Committee 
is informed of wider workforce remuneration when making executive pay decisions. Decisions of the Committee affecting employees, such as the 
annual Group scorecard outcomes, are shared with employees through internal communications as well as through the Directors’ Remuneration 
Report. Additionally, we publish materials on executive remuneration and its implementation for employees on our intranet site. In the event that 
more significant changes to workforce remuneration are proposed, active engagement with employee representative groups provides feedback 
to help the Committee understand the impact upon the broader workforce. 

When reviewing executive remuneration, the Committee takes into consideration our global workforce, looking to ensure the global total reward 
offering is competitive, compelling and aligned to our business performance, while supporting a culture where everyone feels valued and 
included, as outlined in the table on page 122. People and Sustainability is one of our three strategic priorities, and we explain in our Business 
Review from page 43 the role that reward plays in developing a diverse culture that encourages and rewards innovation, entrepreneurship and 
high performance. In carrying out its responsibilities and when setting the Policy, the Committee has taken into account the principles of the UK 
Corporate Governance Code and the factors outlined within Provision 40 as described in the table below. 

Area

Our approach

Clarity
Remuneration arrangements should be transparent and 
promote effective engagement with shareholders and 
the workforce.

The Committee believes the remuneration structures under both the current and proposed Directors’ 
Remuneration Policy, and those for the wider workforce as set out below, are clearly understood. The 
Committee regularly engages with employees and shareholders and considers their feedback when 
reviewing the Directors’ Remuneration Policy and implementation. 

Simplicity
Remuneration structures should avoid complexity and their 
rationale and operation should be easy to understand.

We operate a simple remuneration framework for our executives across both fixed and variable pay 
which is, where possible, aligned with the wider workforce. The purpose, structure and strategic 
alignment of each element of pay has been clearly laid out in our Directors’ Remuneration Policy.

Risk
Remuneration arrangements should ensure reputational 
and other risks from excessive rewards, and behavioural 
risks that can arise from target-based incentive plans, are 
identified and mitigated.

Predictability
The range of possible values of rewards to individual 
directors and any other limits or discretions should be 
identified and explained at the time of approving the Policy.

Proportionality
The link between individual awards, the delivery of strategy 
and the long-term performance of the company should be 
clear. Outcomes should not reward poor performance.

Alignment to culture
Incentive schemes should drive behaviours consistent 
with company purpose, values and strategy.

We seek to ensure alignment with long-term shareholder interests and to mitigate any potential risk 
through several mechanisms within our approach to executive remuneration. These include the 
two-year holding period under the PSP on vesting, 50% mandatory deferral into shares for three years 
for any annual bonus award, operation of malus and clawback provisions as summarised in our 
Directors’ Remuneration Policy, and a shareholding requirement for two years post-cessation 
of employment. 

The Committee set out under the proposed Directors’ Remuneration Policy (and our current Policy 
approved in May 2021) the range of possible values under specific performance scenarios.

As set out on page 108, the Committee follows a robust target-setting and assessment process 
to ensure variable pay outcomes under the annual bonus and PSP are proportional to our 
wider performance.

Our Directors’ Remuneration Policy operated as intended in terms of Company performance 
and quantums during 2023, supporting the delivery of our strategy and another exceptional year 
for AstraZeneca.

The Committee believes that the remuneration structures in place are aligned to the Company’s 
performance culture and values and ensure the successful delivery of our strategy, with alignment 
between strategy and reward set out on page 107. For example, alongside the formulaic outcome, our 
annual bonus scheme for Executive Directors includes a holistic assessment of their performance and 
broader ESG factors, further reinforcing the importance of our Purpose and Values.

Summary of remuneration structure for employees below the Board

Element

Policy features for the wider workforce

Base pay

Our base pay is the basis for a competitive total reward 
package for all employees, and we review base pay annually. 
This review takes account of country budget, relevant market 
comparators, the skills, capabilities, knowledge and experience 
of each individual, relative to peers within the Company, and 
individual contribution.

In setting the budget each year, we consider affordability as well 
as assessing how employee base pay is currently positioned 
relative to inflation, market rates, forecasts of any further market 
increases, and turnover.

Comparison with Executive Director  
and Senior Executive Team (SET) remuneration

The base pay of our Executive Directors and SET forms the basis 
of their total remuneration, and we review their base pay annually.

The primary purpose of the review is to ensure base pay remains 
competitive and reflects the contribution each individual makes to 
the organisation.

Pensions and benefits

We offer market-aligned wellbeing benefit packages reflecting 
market practice in each country in which we operate. 

Where appropriate, we offer elements of personal benefit choice 
to our employees.

The benefit packages of our Executive Directors and SET are 
broadly aligned with the wider workforce of the country in which 
they are employed. Pension allowances for current UK Executive 
Directors are in line with the wider UK workforce. 

Annual bonus

With the exception of our sales representatives receiving 
sales-related incentives, our global workforce participates in the 
same annual cash bonus plan as the Executive Directors and 
SET, with the same Group scorecard performance measures 
outlined on page 111. Achievement against the scorecard 
creates a bonus pool from which all awards are made. 

The ranges for Executive Directors and the SET align with the 
wider workforce at 0-200% of target. Half of any award to an 
Executive Director under the plan is subject to deferral into shares 
subject to a three-year holding period. One sixth of any award to 
the SET under the plan is deferred into shares subject to a 
three-year holding period.

Long-term 
incentives

For employees within our commercial organisation, the 
country-level share of the global bonus pool also takes into 
account country performance against KPIs.

Individual outcomes are based on manager assessment of 
contribution against individual objectives and peers. Awards are 
based on a 0-200% target range.

The PSP is operated with a three-year performance period for 
employees at Vice-President and Senior Vice-President level, 
with the same performance measures that apply to Executive 
Director and SET PSP awards (outlined from page 115).

A proportion of our workforce below this level is eligible to be 
considered for other long-term incentive awards, such as 
restricted stock awards. 35% of our global employee population 
are eligible to receive an award under our Long-term 
incentive plans.

PSP awards to Executive Directors and the SET are granted 
under the same plan as PSP awards granted to Vice-Presidents 
and Senior Vice-Presidents. PSP awards to Executive Directors 
and the SET are subject to a two-year holding period following 
the three-year performance period.

Change in Director remuneration compared to other employees
In the table below, as per the requirements of the Companies (Directors’ Remuneration Policy and Directors’ Remuneration Report) Regulations 
2019, changes to the base pay (or fees), taxable benefits and annual bonus of Directors are compared to employees for the previous financial 
year. The regulations require comparison between the remuneration of each Director and that of all employees of the parent company on a 
full-time equivalent basis. As AstraZeneca PLC has no direct employees, and in line with our disclosure approach in prior years to changes in 
employee remuneration, the selected comparator group is comprised of employees in the UK, US and Sweden who represent approximately 
40% of our total employee population. We consider that this group is representative of the Group’s major science, business and enabling units. 
These employee populations are also well balanced in terms of seniority and demographics.

CEO and employee pay ratios
The table below sets out the ratios of the CEO’s realised pay to the equivalent pay for the lower quartile, median and upper quartile UK employees 
(calculated on a full-time equivalent basis). The ratios have been calculated in accordance with the Companies (Miscellaneous Reporting) 
Regulations 2018 (the Regulations).

The comparison with UK employees is specified by the Regulations. This group represents approximately 12% of our total employee population. 
The Regulations provide flexibility to adopt one of three methods of calculation; we continue to use Option A which is a calculation based on all 
UK employees on a full-time equivalent basis as we consider this to be the most appropriate method of comparison and in line with the 
calculation of CEO’s realised pay (shown on page 109 for 2023). The ratios are based on total pay, which includes base pay, benefits, bonus and 
Long-term incentive (LTI) awards with all elements adjusted on a full-time equivalent basis if required. Our calculations are in line with the single 
figure methodology for UK employees where possible, with quartile data determined as at 31 December 2023. Calculations for UK employees are 
based on actual base pay and benefits data for the year, with estimates only used for annual bonus outcomes and LTI dividend equivalents. 
These estimates are based on the 2023 bonus budget and projected payouts, and anticipated dividends on LTI awards, respectively. No elements 
of pay have been excluded from the calculation, which has been determined following the approach of previous years.

1	 The	prior	years’	figures	have	not	been	restated	for	subsequent	share	price	changes	(as	shown	in	the	CEO	realised	pay	for	2023	table	on	page	109).

The pay ratios at each quartile were higher in 2023 when compared to last year, due to a combination of significant share price appreciation over 
the performance period of the CEO’s 2021 Performance Share Plan award (representing 23% of the overall single figure), which was granted at a 
higher face value than the 2020 award (650% of base pay versus 550%), and a lower overall bonus pool for employees in 2023 based on 
Scorecard performance impacting total pay.  

Given the Committee’s focus on ensuring CEO pay is performance-driven (and as demonstrated again this year), the majority of the single figure 
is comprised of variable pay and therefore may vary significantly year-on-year due to annual bonus and PSP outcomes, as well as share price 
movements. The Committee therefore also considers the CEO pay ratio without the LTI impact. When excluding LTI, the pay ratio of the CEO 
compared to the median UK employee is 52:1 – in line with the trend across prior years.

The Committee remains mindful of the debate on executive pay and seeks to ensure that when determining the remuneration of the CEO it finds 
the right balance when rewarding performance in a highly competitive global executive talent market. It believes the median ratio is consistent 
with the pay and progression policies for UK employees, which ensures our total reward offering is competitive and compelling, and aligned to 
individual and business performance as set out on page 121. 

Relative importance of spend on pay
The table below shows the remuneration paid to all employees in the Group, including the Executive Directors, and expenditure on shareholder

Governance
Committee membership
The Committee members as at 31 December 2023 were Sheri McCoy (Chair of the Committee), Philip Broadley, Nazneen Rahman and Michel 
Demaré. Ms Rahman joined the Committee on 1 May 2023. Leif Johansson was also a member of the Committee until he retired from the Board 
on 27 April 2023. The Deputy Company Secretary acts as secretary to the Committee. The Committee met six times in 2023 and members’ 
attendance records are set out on page 77. During the year, the Committee was materially assisted, except in relation to their own remuneration, 
by the CEO; the CFO; the SVP, Finance, Group Controller & Head of Global Finance Services; the SVP, Group Planning & Finance Business 
Partnering; the SVP, Global Portfolio/Project Management and Strategic Planning; the VP, Global SHE & Operations Sustainability; the Chief 
Human Resources Officer, Chief Compliance Officer and General Counsel; the SVP, Reward, Inclusion and Talent Acquisition; the Senior Director 
Executive Reward; the Company Secretary; the Deputy Company Secretary; and the Non-Executive Directors forming the Science and 
Sustainability Committees. The Committee’s independent adviser attended all Committee meetings.

Independent adviser to the Committee
The Committee reappointed Willis Towers Watson (WTW) as its independent adviser. WTW were first appointed in September 2018, following 
a tender process undertaken in 2018. The tender process involved submission of written proposals, followed by shortlisted candidates being 
interviewed by both Committee members and members of the Company’s management. WTW’s service to the Committee during 2023 was 
provided on a time spent basis at a cost to the Company of £252,322, excluding VAT. During 2023, WTW also provided pensions advice and 
administration, and advice and support to management including market data to assist in the annual employee pay review and global pay survey 
data. WTW have no other connection with the Company or individual Directors. The Committee reviewed the potential for conflicts of interest 
related to WTW and judged that there were no conflicts. WTW is a member of the Remuneration Consultants Group, which is responsible for 
the stewardship and development of the voluntary code of conduct in relation to executive remuneration consulting in the UK. The principles 
on which the code is based are transparency, integrity, objectivity, competence, due care and confidentiality. WTW adheres to the code.

Malus and clawback
The Committee regularly reviews the Company’s approach to malus and clawback and market practice in this area, and our Global Standard on 
Malus and Clawback sets out the trigger events and the time periods these provisions may apply to. As a condition of annual bonus and 
Performance Share Plan awards, the Committee seeks active acceptance of the malus and clawback terms applicable each year before any 
payment or grant is made to an individual. Additionally, the Committee’s practice is to fully document and evidence any application of malus or 
clawback to show that it has not acted arbitrarily, capriciously or irrationally in making any determination. This allows the Committee to:

 > Reduce the amount of bonus or PSP payable, or clawback some or all of any award in the circumstances and periods as set out within our 

Global Standard on Malus and Clawback.

 > Cancel bonus eligibility.
 > Prevent vesting of the PSP and/or DBP awards by holding the shares in AstraZeneca’s LTI nominee platform to prevent transactions.

Shareholder voting at the AGM
At the Company’s AGM on 27 April 2023, shareholders voted in favour of a resolution to approve the Annual Statement of the Chair of the

Changes to Remuneration Policy and its implementation
The table below summarises the main proposed changes to the Directors’ Remuneration Policy (the Policy), the intended changes to 
implementation of the Policy in 2024 and the rationale for each change.

The full Policy that shareholders will be asked to approve is set out from page 128.

2024 Policy Summary

Element

Proposed change to Policy

Implementation in 2024

Rationale for change

Base pay

No change.

Increase for CEO or CFO in line with the workforce.

Pension

No change.

Pension allowance of 11% of base pay, aligned with 
the wider UK workforce.

Annual bonus

Increase maximum opportunity 
from 250% to 300% of base 
pay.

CEO bonus:

 > Target: 150% of base pay (2023: 125%)
 > Max: 300% of base pay (2023: 250%)

CFO bonus:

 > Target: 100% of base pay (No change)
 > Max: 200% of base pay (No change)

Increased maximum opportunity to bring 
AstraZeneca in line with relevant market pay levels, 
reflecting the size, scope and ambition of the 
Company, enabling market competitive opportunities 
underpinned by exceptional performance.

Any shares awarded under the 
Deferred Bonus Plan (DBP) will 
now ordinarily be retained in the 
event of a resignation of an 
Executive Director and vest at 
the end of the relevant deferral 
period, with the Committee 
retaining its discretion to lapse 
awards on resignation should it 
deem it necessary to do so. 

Simplifies the operation of the DBP and aligns 
Executive Directors with the treatment of deferred 
shares for the other members of the Senior Executive 
Team (SET). The Committee currently has discretion 
to allow awards to be retained by an Executive 
Director following their resignation, but the default 
treatment under the previous Policy is for any awards 
to lapse.

Performance Share 
Plan (PSP)

Increase maximum opportunity 
from 650% to 850% of base 
pay.

Increase CEO PSP award from 650% to 850% of 
base pay.

Recognition of CEO’s and CFO’s criticality to 
future business success and delivery of our 2030 
Bold Ambition.

Shareholding 
requirements

Continuing to close the gap to market pay levels and 
address the pay compression issue within the 
competitive global and European pharmaceutical 
talent pool.

Increased weighting on long-term performance and 
further shareholder alignment with a greater 
emphasis on variable pay, reflecting the size, scope 
and ambition of the Company, enabling market 
competitive opportunities underpinned by 
exceptional performance.

Ensures further alignment with shareholders during 
and post-employment. 

Increase CFO PSP award from 450% to 550% of 
base pay.

Increase shareholding requirements to mirror the 
maximum value of their variable pay opportunity 
(annual bonus and long-term incentives):

 > Shareholding requirement for CEO increases 

from 650% to 1,150% of base pay 

 > Shareholding requirement for CFO increases 

from 450% to 750% of base pay

Executive Directors will have a period of five years 
to build a shareholding to meet this requirement.

For two years following cessation of employment, 
Executive Directors are required to hold shares to 
the value of their shareholding requirement that 
applied at the cessation of their employment; or, in 
cases where the individual has not had sufficient 
time to build up shares to meet their guideline, the 
actual level of shareholding at cessation.

Remuneration Policy
This section sets out the Policy proposed for approval by shareholders at the Company’s AGM on 11 April 2024. Subject to shareholder approval, 
the Policy is intended to remain in effect for three years from the 2024 AGM. The previous page summarises how the new Policy differs from the 
Policy which was approved by shareholders at the 2021 AGM. 

Setting the Policy
The Remuneration Committee (the Committee) is responsible for setting overall remuneration policy and makes decisions about specific 
remuneration arrangements in the broader context of employee remuneration throughout the Group. The Committee reviews remuneration data 
for the wider workforce at several points during the year, including ratios of average employee pay to senior executive pay; bonus and base pay 
data; as well as gender and geographical data in relation to base pay and variable compensation. This includes a workforce remuneration review 
to understand the ways in which reward is differentiated by contribution across the population.

Remuneration for all roles within the organisation is benchmarked against that for comparable roles in similar organisations and in the employee’s 
local market. Executive Directors’ remuneration is benchmarked against global and European pharmaceutical peer groups. In reviewing the base 
pay of Executive Directors, the Committee considers the overall level of any base pay increases being awarded to employees in the Executive 
Director’s local market in the relevant year. In setting, reviewing and implementing the Policy, the Committee seeks independent advice and 
ensures that no Director makes decisions relating to their own remuneration. The Committee connects with the Audit Committee to ensure that 
the Group’s remuneration policies and practices achieve the right balance between appropriate incentives to reward good performance, 
management of risk, and the pursuit of the Company’s strategic objectives.

The Board as a whole takes responsibility for gathering the views of AstraZeneca’s workforce, and does so through multiple channels of 
engagement. While the Committee does not consult employees specifically when setting the Policy, the Company engages with employees, 
either on a Group-wide basis or in the context of smaller focus groups, to solicit feedback generally on a wide range of matters, including pay. 
Details of our approach to executive remuneration and its implementation are available to employees on our intranet site, Nucleus. Many 
employees are also shareholders in the Company and therefore have the opportunity to vote on the Policy at the 2024 AGM. 

In all aspects of its work, the Committee considers both the external environment in which the Company operates and the guidance issued by 
organisations representing institutional shareholders. It consults the Company’s major investors on general and specific remuneration matters 
and provides opportunities for representatives of those investors to meet the Chair of the Committee and other Committee and Board members. 
It is the Company’s policy to seek input from major shareholders on an ad hoc basis when significant changes to remuneration arrangements are 
proposed. A thorough consultation process was undertaken as this Policy was developed, with investors’ feedback on the Committee’s proposals 
influencing the final Policy. The Company’s shareholders are encouraged to attend the AGM and any views expressed will be considered by 
Committee members. 

Legacy arrangements
The Committee may approve remuneration payments and payments for loss of office on terms that differ to the terms in the Policy where the 
terms of the payment were agreed before the Policy came into effect or were agreed at a time when the relevant individual was not a Director of 
the Company (provided that, in the opinion of the Committee, the agreement was not entered into in consideration for the individual becoming a 
Director of the Company). This includes the exercise of any discretion available to the Committee in connection with such payments. For these 
purposes, payments include the Committee satisfying awards of variable remuneration, including share awards, in line with the terms agreed at 
the time the award was granted.

Minor amendments
The Committee may make minor amendments to the arrangements for Directors described in the Policy without shareholder approval for 
regulatory, exchange control, tax or administrative purposes or to take account of a change in legislation.

and contribution 

 > the individual’s skills and experience 
 > internal relativities

Benefits

Purpose and link to strategy

Operation

Maximum opportunity

Intended to provide a market-
competitive benefits package 
sufficient to attract, retain and 
develop high-calibre individuals

The maximum value of the benefits available will be 
equivalent to the cost to the Company of the suite of 
benefits available in the local market at the time. 

The value of the support towards the costs of 
relocation, professional fees and other costs will be the 
reasonable costs associated with the Executive 
Director’s particular circumstances.

The maximum value of the directors’ and officers’ 
liability insurance and third-party indemnity insurance is 
the cost at the relevant time. 

While the Committee has not set an overall level of 
benefit provision, the Committee keeps the benefit 
policy and benefit levels under review. 

UK Executive Directors may be provided with a fund, the value of 
which is based on a range of benefits, including private medical 
provision for themselves, partner and children; life assurance; 
company car; additional holidays; and other additional benefits made 
available by the Company from time to time that the Committee 
considers appropriate based on the Executive Director’s 
circumstances. A Director may choose to take a proportion or the 
entirety of the fund as cash.

Non UK-based Executive Directors will receive a range of benefits (or a 
fund of equivalent value) comparable to those typically offered in their 
local market. Depending on local market practices, they may be able 
to elect to take the fund as cash or elect to take one or more of these 
benefits and take the balance as cash. 

At its discretion, the Committee may consider support towards 
reasonable costs associated with relocation and/or provide an 
allowance towards reasonable fees for professional services such as 
legal, tax, property and financial advice. The Company may also fund 
the cost of a driver and car for Executive Directors and any expenses 
deemed to be taxable which are reasonably incurred in the course of 
the Company’s business, together with any taxes thereon.

The Company provides directors’ and officers’ liability insurance and 
an indemnity to the fullest extent permitted by law and the 
Company’s Articles. 

Pension

Maximum opportunity

Provision of retirement benefits 
to attract, retain and develop 
high-calibre individuals

UK-based Executive Directors receive a pension allowance based on a 
percentage of base pay, which the Director may elect to pay into a 
pension scheme (or an equivalent arrangement) or take as cash.

The maximum pension allowance that may be provided 
to UK-based Executive Directors shall be capped at a 
level in line with the pension arrangements of other 
UK employees.

Non UK-based Executive Directors will receive an allowance for the 
purpose of providing retirement benefits in line with local market 
practice. A non UK-based Executive Director may be offered the 
opportunity to elect to take some or all of the allowance as cash.

The maximum value that may be provided to non 
UK-based Executive Directors will be aligned with 
employees in the relevant local market.

Variable elements of remuneration: annual bonus and Long-term incentive (LTI)

Annual bonus and Deferred Bonus Plan (DBP)

Purpose and link to strategy

Operation

Maximum opportunity

The maximum annual bonus amount that can be 
awarded is equivalent to 300% of base pay.

The annual bonus incentivises 
and rewards short-term 
performance against Group 
targets and individual objectives 
that are closely aligned to the 
Company’s strategy

The deferred share element 
of the annual bonus is designed 
to align Executive Directors’ 
interests with those of 
shareholders

Annual bonus awards are conditional on performance. Performance is 
measured over one year and the bonus, if awarded, is paid after the 
year end. Normally, half of the bonus is delivered in cash and half is 
delivered in shares, which are deferred for three years under the DBP. 
DBP awards may consist of Ordinary Shares or American Depositary 
Shares (ADSs) depending on the country in which the Director is 
based. In line with the approach for other employees, a Director may 
be offered the opportunity to elect to defer part of their cash bonus 
into pension. 

Stretching Group targets are set annually by the Committee based on 
the key strategic priorities for the year. The performance targets form a 
Group scorecard, which is closely aligned to the Company’s strategy, 
and are currently designed to reward scientific, commercial and 
financial delivery. Performance is assessed in relation to each 
performance target on a standalone basis. A threshold level of 
performance is specified; if performance falls below this level, there 
will be no payout for that proportion of the award. 

Payout levels are determined by the Committee after the year end, 
based on performance against the Group scorecard targets as well as 
each Executive Director’s individual performance. The Committee may 
use its discretion to ensure that a fair and balanced outcome is 
achieved, taking into account the overall performance of the Company 
and the experience of shareholders.

On vesting of the deferred shares, additional shares (or cash) 
equivalent in value to the dividends that would have been paid during 
the deferral period will be awarded to the Director. These additional 
shares (or cash) may be calculated on a cumulative dividend 
reinvestment basis or otherwise.

Malus and clawback provisions apply to the annual bonus and shares 
awarded under the DBP, as set out within the AstraZeneca Global 
Standard on Malus and Clawback. The triggers whereby the 
Committee has the discretion to apply malus and/or clawback include: 

a)  serious misconduct; 
b)  material misstatement or restatement of the audited results of the 

Group; or 

c)  AstraZeneca suffering:

i)  significant reputational damage;
ii)  a material adverse effect on its financial position; or 
iii) a material adverse effect on its business opportunities and 

prospects for sustained performance or profitability.

Long-term incentive (LTI): Performance Share Plan (PSP)

Purpose and link to strategy

Operation

Maximum opportunity

The PSP is designed to align 
the variable pay of Executive 
Directors with the successful 
execution of the Company’s 
strategy over the longer term

PSP awards are conditional awards and may be granted over Ordinary 
Shares or ADSs depending on the country in which the Director is 
based. Vesting is dependent on the achievement of stretching 
performance targets and continued employment, as further described 
in the Treatment of LTI and Deferred Bonus Plan awards on cessation 
of employment section on page 136.

The maximum market value of shares that may be 
awarded under the PSP in respect of any year is 
equivalent to 850% of the participant’s annual base pay 
at the date of grant.

Stretching performance targets are set by the Committee at the 
beginning of the relevant performance period. Performance measures 
are closely aligned to the Company’s strategy and are currently 
designed to reward scientific, ESG, commercial and financial success. 
The Committee will consult with major shareholders in advance if it 
proposes any material changes to the PSP performance measures.

When selecting the performance measures for each award, the 
Committee weights the performance measures as it considers 
appropriate, taking into account strategic priorities. The Committee’s 
intention is to exercise appropriate judgement both when setting 
performance targets and assessing formulaic outcomes, in particular 
so that the experience of shareholders over time is taken into account.

Performance is normally assessed over a three-year period 
commencing on 1 January in the year of grant. Shares are subject to a 
two-year holding period following the performance period, so vesting 
takes place on the fifth anniversary of grant. During the holding period, 
no further performance measures apply.

Typically, 20% of the proportion of a PSP award linked to a 
performance measure will vest on achievement of the threshold 
level of performance and 100% will vest if the maximum level of 
performance is achieved in full. For relative measures (such as 
relative total shareholder return (TSR)) the threshold performance will 
be performance at or above median, and maximum performance 
will usually be set as achievement of performance at the upper 
quartile level of the peer group. Where a performance measure 
permits, there will be further vesting points between threshold and 
maximum vesting levels.

The Committee may (acting fairly and reasonably) adjust or waive a 
performance target if an event occurs that causes it to believe that the 
performance target is no longer appropriate.

Additional shares (or cash) equivalent in value to the dividends that 
would have been paid on the vesting shares during the performance 
and holding periods will be awarded to the Director. These additional 
shares (or cash award) may be calculated on a cumulative dividend 
reinvestment basis or otherwise.

Malus and clawback provisions apply to all PSP awards, as set out 
within the AstraZeneca Global Standard on Malus and Clawback. 
The triggers whereby the Committee has the discretion to apply malus 
and/or clawback include: 

a)  serious misconduct; 
b)  material misstatement or restatement of the audited results of 

the Group; or 

c)  AstraZeneca suffering:

i)  significant reputational damage; 
ii)  a material adverse effect on its financial position; or 
iii) a material adverse effect on its business opportunities and 

prospects for sustained performance or profitability.

The Company operates an HM Revenue & Customs (HMRC)-
approved SIP whereby UK employees, including Executive Directors, 
may elect to save a regular amount to be used to purchase shares. 
The Company currently grants one matching share in respect of every 
four shares purchased by the participant.

Participants may contribute up to £150 per month from 
pre-tax pay or such other maximum amount as 
determined by the Company within the parameters of 
applicable legislation.

Save As You Earn Share Option Scheme (SAYE)

Purpose and link to strategy

Operation

Maximum opportunity

Encouraging employee share 
ownership

The Company operates an HMRC-approved SAYE whereby UK 
employees, including Executive Directors, may save a regular amount 
over three or five years and are granted options to purchase shares at 
the end of the saving period. A maximum discount of 20% to the 
market price prevailing at the date of the commencement of the 
scheme applies to the option price.

Participants may save up to £500 per month from 
post-tax pay or such other maximum amount as 
determined by the Company within the parameters of 
applicable legislation.

The maximum opportunity available to participants in a 
non UK-based all-employee share scheme will be 
determined by the Company within the parameters of 
applicable legislation.

Differences in remuneration policy for other employees 
The Company’s approach to determining and reviewing the base pay of the Executive Directors and the employee population as a whole is the 
same. On an annual basis, the base pay for individual roles are reviewed in the context of the external market. AstraZeneca participates in annual 
global compensation surveys, which provide benchmarking data for all roles within the organisation, ensuring a robust base pay review process 
for all roles. The Company seeks to provide an appropriate range of competitive benefits, including healthcare and pension, to all employees 
(including Executive Directors) in the context of their local market. 

Employees globally may be eligible for LTI awards in the form of the PSP and/or restricted stock units depending on their level and market. The 
occupants of senior roles in the Company are currently eligible for PSP awards – these are the leaders who have the ability to directly influence 
the execution of the Company’s strategic goals. A proportion of each Senior Executive Team (SET) member’s annual bonus is deferred into shares 
under the DBP. An LTI award may be used for the same purpose as described above on the recruitment of employees, or for employees other 
than Directors, for retention.

Approach to recruitment remuneration for Executive Directors
On the recruitment of a new Executive Director, the Committee seeks to pay no more than is necessary to attract and retain the best candidate 
available, within the limits of our approved Policy. The Committee will offer a remuneration package that it considers appropriate in the particular 
circumstances of the recruitment, giving due regard to the interests of the Company’s shareholders and taking into account factors such as 
typical market practice, existing arrangements for the other Executive Directors, internal relativities and market positioning.

The pharmaceutical industry is global, and future Executive Directors might be recruited from organisations with pay structures and practices that 
differ from AstraZeneca’s usual Policy. The Committee believes that it is in the interests of shareholders for it to retain an element of flexibility in its 
approach to recruitment to enable it to attract the best candidates; however, this flexibility is limited. 

The Committee may find it necessary to compensate a new recruit for forfeiture of entitlements as a consequence of the recruit leaving their 
previous employment to join AstraZeneca. There is no limit to the value of such compensation arrangements, however the Committee will 
rigorously consider the appropriate value so as not to pay more than the compensation being forfeited. The Committee will seek to offer a 
package weighted towards equity in the Company, and will usually seek to use the PSP as the primary vehicle for buy-out awards where possible; 
however, the precise nature of the compensation arrangement will depend on the type of entitlement being forfeited. The arrangement might 
therefore comprise a combination of cash, share awards granted under the PSP (subject to the Policy maximum), and other restricted shares. The 
Committee may introduce a one-off arrangement as permitted under Listing Rule 9.4.2 in order to deliver a restricted share award. Malus and 
clawback provisions would normally apply to buy-out awards, for the same reasons as detailed under the DBP and PSP.

Restricted share awards will only be granted as part of the recruitment arrangements to compensate for loss of remuneration opportunities 
suffered on leaving previous employment. 

The Committee considers whether the lost incentives were subject to performance targets and their probability of vesting. The normal approach 
is to seek broadly to mirror the timing of vesting and application of performance targets of the compensation being forfeited. For example, a 
buy-out award may be granted without performance conditions where the foregone compensation was not subject to performance testing, 
however the Committee may apply appropriate performance measures if it considers it appropriate.

The Committee may allow a restricted share award to vest in tranches at different dates. If no performance targets are attached to a 
compensatory award, it will vest in full if the individual remains in employment on the vesting date. On vesting, additional shares (or cash) 
equivalent in value to the dividends that would have been paid during the vesting period will be awarded to the Director. These additional shares 
(or cash) may be calculated on a cumulative dividend reinvestment basis or otherwise.

Remuneration Policy 
continued

All other aspects of a new recruit’s compensation opportunity will be subject to the maximum variable pay stated in the Policy table. In the case of 
Group employees who are promoted internally to the position of Executive Director, the Committee expects to honour all remuneration 
arrangements entered into before the promotion. 

The Company may reimburse the costs of financial planning, legal and tax advice and reasonable costs incurred on recruitment, including 
relocation support.

Service contracts for Executive Directors
Save as noted below, it is not intended that service contracts for new Executive Directors will contain terms that are materially different from those 
summarised below or contained in the Policy. The contractual obligations below are applicable to each of the current Executive Directors unless 
stated otherwise. Copies of the Executive Directors’ service contracts can be inspected at the Company’s Registered Office.

Notice period

The service contracts of Executive Directors do not have a fixed term but the Company may terminate employment by giving not 
less than 12 months’ written notice. The Company may agree on appointment that any notice given by the Company will not 
expire prior to the second anniversary of the commencement date of the Executive Director’s appointment. Executive Directors 
may terminate their employment on 12 months’ written notice.

Payments in lieu of notice

The Company may terminate an Executive Director’s contract at any time with immediate effect and pay a sum in lieu of notice. 
This sum will consist of (i) the base pay that they would have been entitled to receive during the notice period and, (ii) the cost to 
the Company of funding the benefit arrangements for this period, including the Company’s contribution in respect of pension.

Garden leave

The Company has the right to place the Executive Director on ‘garden leave’.

Summary termination

The Company may terminate employment summarily in particular defined circumstances, such as gross misconduct, with no 
further payment.

Payments in lieu of holiday

If, on termination, the Executive Director has exceeded their accrued holiday entitlement, the value of this excess may be 
deducted by the Company from any sums payable. If the Executive Director has unused holiday entitlement, the Committee has 
discretion to require the Executive Director to take such unused holiday during any notice period or make a payment in lieu of it 
calculated in the same way as the value of any excess holiday.

Directors’ and officers’ 
liability insurance

Directors’ and officers’ liability insurance and an indemnity, to the fullest extent permitted by law and the Company’s Articles, 
is provided for the duration of an Executive Director’s employment and for a minimum of five years following termination. 

Principles of payment for loss of office for Executive Directors
The Company does not make additional payments for loss of office, other than, as appropriate, payments in lieu of notice as described above, or 
payments in respect of damages if the Company terminates an Executive Director’s service contract in breach of contract (taking into account, as 
appropriate, the Director’s responsibility to mitigate any losses). The Committee has discretion to award payments in certain circumstances, as 
set out on the following page, depending on the nature of the termination and the Executive Director’s performance. The LTI plans are governed 
by plan rules, which define how individual awards under those plans should be treated upon termination of employment and corporate activity, 
including sale of a business outside the Group. The treatment of awards in these circumstances will be determined according to the rules and 
subject to Committee discretion. Aside from the reasons relating to corporate activity, generally, awards under LTI plans will be allowed to vest for 
those Executive Directors who leave the Company in circumstances such as ill health, injury, disability, redundancy or retirement, or any other 
reason the Committee considers appropriate, or where employment terminates by reason of the Executive Director’s death (see the table on 
page 136 for further information). Awards that are allowed to vest will typically be pro-rated for time, subject to the Committee’s discretion. In 
addition to any payment in lieu of notice, the individual components of remuneration and other payments which may be payable on loss of office 
are set out on the following pages, subject to the terms of any applicable bonus rules or share plan rules. No awards will vest where an individual 
has been dismissed for cause.

Annual bonus 
At the discretion of the Committee, an Executive Director may receive a bonus for the performance year in which they leave the Company. 
Typically, this sum will reflect a bonus pro-rated for the part of the year in which they worked. This will depend on the circumstances, including an 
assessment of performance against the scorecard and the Executive Director’s performance in the relevant period and the circumstances of their 
departure, and may be in such proportion of cash and/or shares as the Committee will determine. The deferred share element of previous 
bonuses granted, and any deferred share element of the bonus awarded in respect of the departing year, may still vest for the benefit of the 
departing Executive Director at the end of the period of deferral. The Committee has the discretion to accelerate and/or retain the deferral period 
and allow shares to vest for the benefit of the Executive Director on their departure and/or in accordance with the vesting schedule as the case 
may be. 

LTI plans
The LTI plan rules envisage circumstances under which some, all or none of the shares held under LTI plans will vest in connection with departure. 
The exact timing and number of shares vesting will depend on the circumstances, including the reason for leaving (as set out in the table on the 
next page) and may be subject to Committee discretion, depending on what it considers to be fair and reasonable in the circumstances. 

Restricted share awards
The treatment on termination will depend upon the terms of the individual Executive Director’s awards on recruitment. The Committee has 
discretion to determine the treatment at the time of departure based on what it considers to be fair and reasonable in the circumstances.

Non-statutory redundancy payments
Executive Directors are not entitled to non-statutory redundancy payments.

Pension allowance and other benefits
Pension allowance and other benefits for Executive Directors will be payable up to the termination date and/or as part of a payment in lieu of 
notice as described on page 134.

Payments in relation to statutory rights
The amount considered reasonable to pay by the Committee in respect of statutory rights may be included in the overall termination payment.

Payments required by law
The Committee reserves the right to make any other payments in connection with an Executive Director’s cessation of office or employment 
where the payments are made in good faith in discharge of an existing legal obligation (or by way of damages for breach of such an obligation), 
or by way of settlement of any claim arising in connection with the cessation of an Executive Director’s office or employment.

Mitigation
The departing Executive Director will be required to mitigate their loss by using reasonable efforts to secure new employment.

Professional fees
The Company may pay an amount considered reasonable by the Committee in respect of fees for legal and tax advice, and outplacement 
support for the departing Executive Director.

Deferred Bonus Plan 
(Annual bonus)

Awards will vest at the end of the relevant deferral period, 
unless the Committee decides otherwise.

In the case of dismissal for gross misconduct, the awards will 
lapse. In other circumstances, the shares will be retained in full 
and vest at the end of the deferral period, unless the 
Committee decides otherwise.

PSP

Where cessation of employment occurs within three years of 
the date of grant, awards will vest, pro rata, to the time elapsed 
between the date of grant of the award and the date of 
cessation of employment, after the end of the performance 
period, to the extent that the performance target(s) measured 
over the performance period has been met.

Where cessation of employment occurs within three years of 
the date of grant, ordinarily awards will lapse unless the 
Committee exercises its discretion to preserve all or part of an 
award and apply the default treatment for leavers by mutual 
agreement as described in this table. This discretion will not be 
exercised in the case of dismissal for gross misconduct.

However, the Committee has discretion to permit the award to 
vest immediately on cessation of employment to the extent that 
the performance target(s) has, in the opinion of the Committee,
been satisfied from the date of grant to the date of cessation 
of employment.

However, if the Committee believes that exceptional 
circumstances warrant this, it may exercise its discretion to 
vest the award on another basis.

Where cessation of employment occurs during any holding 
period, the award will vest in respect of all the shares that 
continue to be subject to the award as soon as practicable 
following the cessation of employment. However, the 
Committee has discretion to require the award to vest only at 
the end of the holding period.

In relation to awards granted at the time of the Executive 
Director’s recruitment to the Company in compensation for any 
awards or bonuses forfeited at their previous employer, the 
award will vest on the date their employment ceases. The 
Committee will, in its discretion, determine the proportion of 
shares which vests, and (unless exceptional circumstances 
apply) take into account the period elapsed between the date 
of grant and the date of cessation of employment.

Where cessation of employment occurs during any holding 
period, the award will vest in respect of all the shares that 
continue to be subject to the award as soon as practicable 
following the cessation of employment. However, the 
Committee has discretion to require the award to vest only at 
the end of the holding period. This discretion will not be 
exercised in the case of dismissal for gross misconduct and 
the award will lapse on termination.

Ordinarily awards will lapse unless the Committee exercises its 
discretion to preserve all or part of an award.

Preparation of the Financial Statements  
and Directors’ Responsibilities

The Directors are responsible for preparing this Annual 
Report and Form 20-F Information and the Group and 
Parent Company Financial Statements in accordance 
with applicable law and regulations.

Company law requires the Directors to prepare 
Financial Statements for each financial year. Under 
that law the Directors have prepared the Group 
Financial Statements in accordance with UK-adopted 
international accounting standards and with the 
requirements of the Companies Act 2006 as applicable 
to companies reporting under those standards and 
Parent Company Financial Statements in accordance 
with United Kingdom Generally Accepted Accounting 
Practice (United Kingdom Accounting Standards, 
comprising FRS 101 ‘Reduced Disclosure Framework’, 
and applicable law). In preparing the Group Financial 
Statements, the Directors have also elected to comply 
with IFRS Accounting Standards as issued by the 
International Accounting Standards Board (IASB) and 
International Accounting Standards as adopted by the 
European Union.

Under company law, the Directors must not approve 
the Financial Statements unless they are satisfied that 
they give a true and fair view of the state of affairs of 
the Group and Parent Company and of their profit or 
loss for that period. In preparing each of the Group and 
Parent Company Financial Statements, the Directors 
are required to:

 > select suitable accounting policies and 

then apply them consistently

 > make judgements and estimates that are 

reasonable and prudent

 > for the Group Financial Statements, 

state whether they have been prepared in 
accordance with UK-adopted International 
Accounting Standards

 > for the Parent Company Financial Statements, 

state whether FRS 101 has been followed, subject 
to any material departures disclosed and explained 
in the Parent Company Financial Statements
 > prepare the Financial Statements on the going 

concern basis unless it is inappropriate to presume 
that the Group and the Parent Company will 
continue in business.

The Directors are responsible for keeping adequate 
accounting records that are sufficient to show and 
explain the Parent Company’s transactions and 
disclose with reasonable accuracy at any time the 
financial position of the Parent Company and enable 
them to ensure that its Financial Statements comply 
with the Companies Act 2006. They have general 
responsibility for taking such steps as are reasonably 
open to them to safeguard the assets of the Group and 
to prevent and detect fraud and other irregularities.

Under applicable law and regulations, the Directors 
are also responsible for preparing a Directors’ Report, 
Strategic Report, Directors’ Remuneration Report, 
Corporate Governance Report and Audit Committee 
Report that comply with that law and those regulations.

The Directors are responsible for the maintenance 
and integrity of the corporate and financial information 
included on our website. Legislation in the UK 
governing the preparation and dissemination of 
Financial Statements may differ from legislation in 
other jurisdictions.

Directors’ responsibility statement 
pursuant to DTR 4
The Directors confirm that to the best 
of our knowledge:

 > the Financial Statements, prepared in accordance 
with the applicable set of accounting standards, 
give a true and fair view of the assets, liabilities, 
financial position and profit or loss of the Company 
and the undertakings included in the consolidation 
taken as a whole

 > the Directors’ Report includes a fair review of the 
development and performance of the business 
and the position of the issuer and the undertakings 
included in the consolidation taken as a whole, 
together with a description of the principal risks 
and uncertainties that they face.

Directors’ Annual Report on Internal  
Controls over Financial Reporting

The Directors are responsible for establishing and 
maintaining adequate internal control over financial 
reporting. AstraZeneca’s internal control over 
financial reporting is designed to provide reasonable 
assurance over the reliability of financial reporting 
and the preparation of consolidated financial 
statements in accordance with generally accepted 
accounting principles. 

Due to its inherent limitations, internal control 
over financial reporting may not prevent or detect 
misstatements. Projections of any evaluation of 
effectiveness to future periods are subject to the 
risks that controls may become inadequate 
because of changes in conditions, or that the 
degree of compliance with the policies or 
procedures may deteriorate.

The Directors assessed the effectiveness of 
AstraZeneca’s internal control over financial reporting 
as at 31 December 2023 based on the criteria set forth 
by the Committee of Sponsoring Organizations of the 
Treadway Commission in Internal Control-Integrated 
Framework (2013). Based on this assessment, internal 
control over financial reporting is effective. 

PricewaterhouseCoopers LLP, an independent 
registered public accounting firm, has audited the 
effectiveness of internal control over financial reporting 
as at 31 December 2023 and has issued an unqualified 
report thereon.

Report on the audit of the 
financial statements
Opinion
In our opinion:

 > AstraZeneca PLC’s Group financial statements and 

Company financial statements (the “financial 
statements”) give a true and fair view of the state 
of the Group’s and of the Company’s affairs as at 
31 December 2023 and of the Group’s profit and 
the Group’s cash flows for the year then ended;
 > the Group financial statements have been properly 

prepared in accordance with UK-adopted 
international accounting standards as applied in 
accordance with the provisions of the Companies 
Act 2006;

 > the Company financial statements have been 
properly prepared in accordance with United 
Kingdom Generally Accepted Accounting Practice 
(United Kingdom Accounting Standards, including 
FRS 101 “Reduced Disclosure Framework”, and 
applicable law); and

 > the financial statements have been prepared in 

accordance with the requirements of the 
Companies Act 2006.

We have audited the financial statements, included 
within the Annual Report and Form 20-F Information 
2023 (the “Annual Report”), which comprise: the 
Consolidated Statement of Financial Position and the 
Company Balance Sheet as at 31 December 2023; the 
Consolidated Statement of Comprehensive Income, 
the Consolidated Statement of Cash Flows, the 
Consolidated and Company Statements of Changes in 
Equity for the year then ended; the Group and 
Company Accounting Policies; and the Notes to the 
Group and Company Financial Statements.

Our opinion is consistent with our reporting to the 
Audit Committee.

Separate opinion in relation to International 
Accounting Standards as adopted by the 
European Union
As explained in the Group Accounting Policies to the 
financial statements, the Group, in addition to applying 
UK-adopted international accounting standards, has 
also applied International Accounting Standards as 
adopted by the European Union.

In our opinion, the Group financial statements have 
been properly prepared in accordance with 
International Accounting Standards as adopted by 
the European Union.

Separate opinion in relation to IFRS 
Accounting Standards as issued by the IASB
As explained in the Group Accounting Policies to the 
financial statements, the Group, in addition to applying 
UK-adopted international accounting standards, has 
also applied IFRS Accounting Standards as issued by 
the International Accounting Standards Board (IASB).

In our opinion, the Group financial statements have 
been properly prepared in accordance with IFRS 
Accounting Standards as issued by the IASB.

Basis for opinion
We conducted our audit in accordance with 
International Standards on Auditing (UK) (“ISAs (UK)”) 
and applicable law. Our responsibilities under ISAs 
(UK) are further described in the Auditors’ 
responsibilities for the audit of the financial statements 
section of our report. We believe that the audit 
evidence we have obtained is sufficient and 
appropriate to provide a basis for our opinion.

Independence
We remained independent of the Group in accordance 
with the ethical requirements that are relevant to our 
audit of the financial statements in the UK, which 
includes the FRC’s Ethical Standard, as applicable 
to listed public interest entities, and we have fulfilled 
our other ethical responsibilities in accordance with 
these requirements.

To the best of our knowledge and belief, we declare 
that non-audit services prohibited by the FRC’s Ethical 
Standard were not provided.

Other than those disclosed in Note 31, we have 
provided no non-audit services to the Company or its 
controlled undertakings in the period under audit.

Our audit approach
Overview
Audit scope
 > We identified eight reporting components which 

required a full scope audit of their complete financial 
information, either due to their size or risk 
characteristics. These components are the principal 
operating units in the US (two components), the UK, 
Sweden, China (two components) and Ireland, as 
well as the Company. One or more individual 
balances for certain of these reporting components 
were audited by our team based in Poland (for 
research and development and inventory) and our 
team in Malaysia (property, plant and equipment), 
as these are the locations where the accounting 
records reside.

 > We also included Japan and Germany as two 

additional reporting components which had one or 
more individual balances that were considered 
significant to the Group’s financial statements. For 
these components our work was solely focussed on 
revenue, accounts receivable and journals testing.
 > We also identified five shared service centres where 

audit procedures were performed over certain 
shared service functions for IT general controls and 
transaction processing. Audit procedures were 
performed centrally in relation to various balances 
and activities accounted for and managed centrally 
including: goodwill, intangible assets (excluding 
software), pension obligations, centralised cash, 
borrowings and financial instruments, taxation, 
other investments and litigation matters, as well as 
the consolidation.

 > The above procedures accounted for 72% of the 

Group’s revenue and 72% of the Group’s absolute 
profit before tax.

Key audit matters
 > Recognition and measurement of accruals for 
Managed Care, Medicaid and Medicare Part D 
rebates on US Product Sales (excluding Rare 
Diseases) (Group)

 > Impairment assessment of the product, marketing 
and distribution rights and other intangibles (Group)
 > Recognition and measurement of legal provisions 
and disclosure of contingent liabilities (Group)
 > Recognition, measurement and disclosure of tax 
liabilities for uncertain tax treatments (Group)
 > Valuation of defined benefit obligations in the UK 

and Sweden (Group)

 > Distributable reserves in the Company (Parent)

Materiality
 > Overall Group materiality: $440m (2022: $400m) 
based on approximately 5% of profit before tax 
after adding back intangible asset impairment 
charges (Note 10), fair value movements and 
discount unwind on contingent consideration and 
other payables assumed from the Alexion 
acquisition (Note 20), the discount unwind on the 
Acerta Pharma share purchase liability (Note 3), the 
discount unwind on certain other payables arising 
from intangible asset acquisitions (Note 3), material 
legal net settlements (Note 21), the unwind of the fair 
value adjustment to Alexion inventories (Note 2) and 
restructuring charges relating to the Post Alexion 
Acquisition Group Review (Note 2).

 > Overall Company materiality: $110m (2022: $100m) 
based on 0.2% of net assets as constrained by the 
allocation of overall Group materiality.

 > Performance materiality: $330m (2022: $300m) 
(Group) and $82.5m (2022: $75m) (Company).

The scope of our audit
As part of designing our audit, we determined 
materiality and assessed the risks of material 
misstatement in the financial statements.

Key audit matters
Key audit matters are those matters that, in the 
auditors’ professional judgement, were of most 
significance in the audit of the financial statements of 
the current period and include the most significant 
assessed risks of material misstatement (whether or 
not due to fraud) identified by the auditors, including 
those which had the greatest effect on: the overall 
audit strategy; the allocation of resources in the audit; 
and directing the efforts of the engagement team. 
These matters, and any comments we make on the 
results of our procedures thereon, were addressed in 
the context of our audit of the financial statements as a 
whole, and in forming our opinion thereon, and we do 
not provide a separate opinion on these matters.

This is not a complete list of all risks identified by 
our audit.

The key audit matters below are consistent with 
last year.

Key audit matter

How our audit addressed the key audit matter

Recognition and measurement of accruals for Managed Care, Medicaid and 
Medicare Part D rebates on US Product Sales (excluding Rare Diseases) 
(Group)
Refer to the Audit Committee Report, Group Accounting Policies and Notes 1 
and 20 in the Group financial statements.

In the US the Group recognises revenue on Product Sales under various 
commercial and government mandated contracts and reimbursement 
arrangements that include rebates, of which the most significant are Managed 
Care, Medicaid and Medicare Part D relating to US Product Sales.

Rebates provided to customers under these arrangements are accounted for as 
variable consideration, and recognised as a reduction to revenue, for which 
unsettled amounts are accrued. At the time Product Sales are invoiced, rebates 
and deductions that the Group expects to pay, are estimated. There is significant 
management estimation in determining the accruals in the US. Assumptions 
used to estimate the rebates are monitored and adjusted regularly in light of 
contractual and legal obligations, historical trends, past experience and 
projected market conditions.

We evaluated the design and tested the operating effectiveness of controls 
relating to the recognition and measurement of the accruals for the Managed 
Care, Medicaid and Medicare Part D. We determined that we could rely on these 
controls for the purposes of our audit. 

We:

 > developed an independent estimate of the Managed Care, Medicaid and 

Medicare Part D accruals using the terms of the specific rebate programmes 
and/or contracts with customers, historical revenue data; market demand and 
market conditions in the US; third party information on inventory held by direct 
and indirect customers; and the historical trend of actual rebate claims paid; 

 > compared our independent estimates to the accruals recorded by 

management; 

 > assessed the effect of any adjustments to prior years’ accruals in the current 

year’s results; and 

 > tested actual payments made and rebate claims processed by the Group, and 
evaluated those claims for consistency with the contractual and mandated 
terms of the Group’s arrangements.

The US Rebates, chargebacks, returns and other revenue accruals liability 
(excluding Rare Diseases) at 31 December 2023 amounted to $4,926m (2022: 
$3,822m), principally consisting of rebates related to Managed Care, Medicaid 
and Medicare Part D.

We utilised our in-house experts with specialised skills and knowledge to assist 
in assessing the compliance of the Group’s Medicaid rebate policies against the 
regulatory policies, and subsequently evaluating the Group’s calculation of the 
Medicaid drug rebate.

Impairment assessment of the product, marketing and distribution rights 
and other intangibles (Group)
Refer to the Audit Committee Report, Group Accounting Policies and Note 10 in 
the Group financial statements.

The Group has product, marketing and distribution rights and other intangible 
assets (hereafter referred to as the intangible assets) totalling $37,587m at 31 
December 2023 (2022: $38,890m). Those intangible assets under development 
and not available for use are tested annually for impairment and other intangible 
assets are tested when there is an indication of impairment loss or reversal.

The recoverability of the carrying value of cash generating units (to which the 
intangible assets belong) depends on future cash flows and/or the outcome of 
research and development (‘R&D’) activities including decisions by the Group to 
terminate development. The determination of the recoverable amounts include 
significant estimates, which are highly sensitive and depend upon key 
assumptions including the outcome of R&D activities, probability of technical 
and regulatory success, market volume, share and pricing (to derive peak year 
sales), the amount and timing of projected future cash flows and sales erosion 
curves following patent expiry. Changes in these assumptions could have an 
impact on the recoverable amount of the Group’s intangible assets.

During 2023, $434m (2022: $241m) of net impairment charges were 
recorded (of which $417m (2022: $95m) was recorded in Research and 
development expenses and $17m (2022: $146m) within Selling, general 
and administrative costs).

Based on the procedures performed, we considered the accruals to be 
reasonable. We evaluated the disclosures in Notes 1 and 20 of the Group 
financial statements, and considered them to be appropriate.

We evaluated the design and tested the operating effectiveness of controls over 
management’s assessment of the impairment of intangible assets. We 
determined that we could rely on these controls for the purposes of our audit.

For those assets or cash generating units in the scope of our audit we: 

 > tested management’s process for assessing whether there is an indication of 

impairment and the process for determining the recoverable amount; 

 > tested the completeness and accuracy of the models as well as the underlying 

data used in the models, which included reconciling the cash flows to the 
Board approved Group level budgets and forecasts; and 

 > evaluated the significant assumptions used by management in determining 

future cash flows, including the probability of technical and regulatory 
success, peak year sales and sales erosion curves.

In evaluating the reasonableness of management’s assumptions we: 

 > compared significant assumptions to external data and benchmarks; and 
 > performed a retrospective comparison of forecasted revenues and costs to 

actual performance. 

We utilised our in-house valuation experts to assist with the evaluation of the 
probability of technical and regulatory success.

Based on the procedures performed, we determined that the net impairment 
charge recorded for intangible assets was reasonable. We evaluated the 
disclosures in Note 10 of the Group financial statements, and considered them 
to be appropriate.

Recognition and measurement of legal provisions and disclosure of 
contingent liabilities (Group)
Refer to the Audit Committee Report, Group Accounting Policies, Notes 21 
and 30 in the Group financial statements.

We evaluated the design and tested the operating effectiveness of controls in 
respect of the recognition and measurement of legal proceedings and related 
disclosures. We determined that we could rely on these controls for the 
purposes of our audit.

The Group is involved in various legal proceedings, including actual or 
threatened litigation and actual or potential government investigations relating to 
employment matters, product liability, commercial disputes, pricing, sales and 
marketing practices, infringement of IP rights and the validity of certain patents 
and competition laws. As at 31 December 2023 the Group held provisions of 
$1,016m (2022: $161m) in respect of legal claims and settlements (together, legal 
provisions) and disclosed the more significant legal proceedings as contingent 
liabilities in Note 30.

There is significant judgement by management when assessing the timing and 
likelihood of loss being incurred and whether a legal provision can be reasonably 
estimated and recorded or if a contingent liability needs to be disclosed. 
Management’s assessment of the amounts concerned relies heavily on 
estimates and assumptions.

We enquired of internal legal counsel and where appropriate external legal 
counsel. We obtained and evaluated letters of audit enquiry with the Group’s 
internal and external legal counsel for significant litigation. We have inspected 
certain external legal documents. We tested the completeness of management’s 
assessment of both the identification of legal proceedings and possible 
outcomes of each significant legal claim. We evaluated the reasonableness of 
management’s assessment regarding whether an adverse outcome is probable 
and estimated reliably. We evaluated management’s judgement regarding the 
proceedings set out as contingent liabilities within Note 30.

Based on the procedures performed, for the provisions recorded and contingent 
liabilities disclosed, we considered them to be reasonable. We evaluated the 
disclosures in Notes 21 and 30 of the Group financial statements, and 
considered them to be appropriate.

Key audit matter

How our audit addressed the key audit matter

Recognition, measurement and disclosure of tax liabilities for uncertain tax 
treatments (Group)
Refer to the Audit Committee Report, Group Accounting Policies and Note 30 
in the Group financial statements.

The Group faces a number of audits and reviews in jurisdictions around the 
world and, in some cases, is in dispute with tax authorities.

At 31 December 2023 the total net tax liability recognised in respect of uncertain 
tax treatments is $1,336m (2022: $830m). The Group estimates the potential for 
additional liabilities where the possibility of the additional liabilities falling due is 
more than remote and at 31 December 2023 this was $679m (2022: $734m).

Tax liabilities recognised for uncertain tax treatments require management to 
make key judgements with respect to the outcome of current and potential future 
tax audits, reviews and disputes with tax authorities, and actual results could 
vary from these estimates.

Valuation of defined benefit obligations in the UK and Sweden (Group)
Refer to the Audit Committee Report, Group Accounting Policies and Note 22 
in the Group financial statements.

The Group has defined benefit obligations of $7,907m at 31 December 2023 
(2022: $8,108m), which is significant in the context of the overall balance sheet. 
The Group’s most significant schemes are in the UK and Sweden, which 
comprise 86% of the Group’s defined benefit obligations.

The valuation of pension plan obligations requires significant estimation in 
determining appropriate assumptions such as mortality (for the UK scheme 
only), discount rates and inflation levels (for both the UK and Sweden schemes). 
Movements in these assumptions can have a material impact on the 
determination of the defined benefit obligations. Management uses external 
actuaries to assist in determining the assumptions.

We evaluated the design and tested the operating effectiveness of controls in 
respect of the recognition and measurement of uncertain tax treatments. We 
determined that we could rely on these controls for the purposes of our audit.

We tested the completeness of management’s assessment of the identification 
of tax liabilities and evaluated management’s process for estimating the possible 
outcomes of each tax liability. We obtained the status and results of tax audits 
and discussions with the relevant tax authorities. With the assistance of our local 
and international tax specialists, we:

 > evaluated management’s assessment of the technical merits of tax treatments 
(including where relevant evaluating any advice received from the Group’s 
external advisors) and estimates of the amount of tax benefit expected to be 
sustained; 

 > tested the completeness and accuracy of the information used in the 

determination of the probability of different outcomes for uncertain tax 
treatments and the estimation of the liability for those tax treatments; and 

 > evaluated the reasonableness of significant assumptions related to the 

outcome of tax audits and assumptions relating to the most likely amount or 
expected value depending on the resolution of the uncertainty.

Based on the procedures performed, we considered the tax liabilities to be 
reasonable. We evaluated the disclosures in Note 30 of the Group financial 
statements, and considered them to be appropriate.

We evaluated the design and tested the operating effectiveness of controls in 
respect of the assumptions used and accuracy of the Group’s most significant 
defined benefit obligations. We determined that we could rely on these controls 
for the purposes of our audit.

We used actuarial experts to assess whether the assumptions used in 
calculating the defined benefit obligations for the UK and Sweden were 
reasonable. Our actuarial experts assisted in developing an independent 
expectation of the defined benefit obligations for the UK and Sweden. Our 
experts evaluated whether the mortality assumptions (UK scheme only) and the 
discount rates and inflation rates (for both the UK and Sweden schemes) were: 

 > consistent with the specifics of each plan and where relevant considering 

national information; 

 > consistent with independently developed estimates; and 
 > in line with other companies’ recent external reporting. 

We evaluated the calculations prepared by management’s external actuaries 
which included testing the completeness and accuracy of the underlying data. 
In order to evaluate the reasonableness of management’s estimate, our experts 
also compared the independent estimate to management’s estimate.

Based on the procedures performed, we considered management’s key 
assumptions to be within reasonable ranges. We evaluated the disclosures 
in Note 22 of the Group financial statements, and considered them to 
be appropriate.

Key audit matter

How our audit addressed the key audit matter

Distributable reserves in the Company (Parent)
Refer to the Company Statement of Changes in Equity in the Company 
financial statements.

The directors review and disclose the level of distributable reserves of the 
Company annually and aim to maintain distributable reserves that provide 
adequate cover for dividend payments. At 31 December 2023, the overwhelming 
majority of the Profit and loss account reserve of $17,640m (31 December 2022: 
all of $7,458m) was available for distribution, subject to filing the Company 
financial statements with Companies House.

There is judgement when determining the profits available for distribution by 
reference to guidance on realised and distributable profits in accordance with 
Companies Act 2006 issued by the Institute of Chartered Accountants in 
England and Wales and the Institute of Chartered Accountants of Scotland in 
April 2017.

We obtained and audited the analysis of distributable reserves.

We used our distributable reserves experts to assess whether judgements made 
were appropriate and the analysis was aligned with the relevant technical 
guidance on the determination of realised profits under the Companies Act 2006. 
We assessed whether there is qualifying consideration in determining whether 
the Profit and loss account reserve is distributable.

Based on our procedures, we noted no exceptions and considered the directors’ 
judgement in determining the profits available for distribution, and the related 
disclosures, to be appropriate.

How we tailored the audit scope
We tailored the scope of our audit to ensure that we 
performed enough work to be able to give an opinion 
on the financial statements as a whole, taking into 
account the structure of the Group and the Company, 
the accounting processes and controls, and the 
industry in which they operate.

The Group operates in over 100 countries and the size 
of operations within each territory varies. In 
establishing the overall approach to the Group audit, 
we determined the type of work that needed to be 
performed by us, as the Group engagement team, or 
component auditors within PwC UK and other PwC 
network firms operating under our instruction. Where 
the work was performed by component auditors, we 
determined the level of involvement we needed to have 
in the audit work in these territories to be able to 
conclude whether sufficient appropriate audit 
evidence had been obtained as a basis for our opinion 
on the Group financial statements as a whole.

We identified eight reporting components which 
required a full scope audit of their complete financial 
information, either due to their financial significance to 
the Group or specific risk characteristics. These 
components are the principal operating units in the US 
(two components), China (two components), the UK, 
Sweden, and Ireland, as well as the Company.

We also identified a further two reporting components 
which both had individual financial statement line item 
balances that were considered significant to the 
Group’s financial statements. For these components 
our work was solely focussed on the audit of revenue 
and accounts receivable. The two components also 
performed journal testing in support of an overall 
Group significant risk.

Within our overall Group scope we performed 
procedures at five of AstraZeneca’s Shared Service 
Centres (SSCs); Warsaw, Kuala Lumpur, Delhi, Cluj and 
San Jose. The testing procedures performed at the 
SSCs included controls testing and IT general controls 
testing. In addition to the work performed by the SSCs 
a number of centralised audit procedures were 

performed by the Group audit team. These procedures 
primarily related to the audit of goodwill, intangible 
assets (excluding software), pension obligations, 
centralised cash, borrowings and financial 
instruments, taxation, other investments, litigation 
matters, and the Group consolidation.

Our Group engagement team’s involvement in the 
oversight of the reporting components and SSCs was 
continuous throughout the audit process. As part of 
our cycle of in person oversight we visited; China and 
the US (covering both components in each country), 
Sweden and Ireland and were in regular contact with 
our UK component team in Cambridge. We also visited 
the SSCs in Poland and India.

In addition to these on site visits, regular virtual 
meetings with the component auditors were held, 
whereby we performed reviews of the component 
auditors’ planned response to significant risks, and 
reviewed the component auditors working papers. The 
work that is performed at the SSCs is overseen by the 
Group engagement team, and follows the same review 
and oversight process as the components. Alongside 
our team oversight we attended meetings with local 
management.

The impact of climate risk on our audit
In planning and executing our audit, we considered the 
potential impact of climate change on the Group’s 
business and the financial statements. The Group has 
set out its intention — as part of the Ambition Zero 
Carbon programme – to achieve net zero greenhouse 
gas emissions by maximising energy efficiency, 
shifting to renewable energy sources and investing in 
nature-based removals to compensate for any residual 
GHG footprint.

As a part of our audit we made enquiries of 
management to understand the extent of the potential 
impact of the physical and transitional climate change 
risk on the Group financial statements. We also 
discussed the climate change initiatives and 
commitments from Ambition Zero Carbon and other 
initiatives to reduce CO2 emissions, and the impact 
these have on the Group including on future cash flow 

forecasts. This includes the committed investment to 
the ‘AZ Forest’ through 2030 and the continued 
commitment to develop next-generation respiratory 
inhalers with near-zero global warming potential 
propellants for the pMDI inhaled medicines portfolio.

Management considers that the impact of climate 
change does not give rise to a material financial 
statement impact. With the assistance of our climate 
change experts we evaluated management’s risk 
assessment and understood the Group’s governance 
processes including the Sustainability Committee. We 
performed an audit risk assessment of how the impact 
of the Group’s commitments in respect of climate 
change including Ambition Zero Carbon may affect the 
financial statements and our audit.

We challenged the extent to which climate change 
considerations including the expected cash flows from 
the initiatives and commitments had been reflected, 
where appropriate, in management’s impairment 
assessment process, going concern assessment and 
viability assessment. We found that climate change 
impacts are included within management’s forecasts 
although the initiatives and commitments did not have 
a material impact including on our key audit matters. 
We assessed the consistency of other information 
disclosed in the Annual Report with the Group financial 
statements, and with our knowledge obtained from 
the audit.

Materiality
The scope of our audit was influenced by our 
application of materiality. We set certain quantitative 
thresholds for materiality. These, together with 
qualitative considerations, helped us to determine the 
scope of our audit and the nature, timing and extent of 
our audit procedures on the individual financial 
statement line items and disclosures and in evaluating 
the effect of misstatements, both individually and in 
aggregate on the financial statements as a whole.

Based on our professional judgement, we determined 
materiality for the financial statements as a whole 
as follows:

Financial statements – Group

Financial statements – Company

Overall materiality

$440m (2022: $400m).

$110m (2022: $100m).

How we determined it

Rationale for 
benchmark applied

Approximately 5% of profit before tax after adding back intangible asset 
impairment charges (Note 10), fair value movements and discount unwind on 
contingent consideration and other payables assumed from the Alexion 
acquisition (Note 20), the discount unwind on the Acerta Pharma share purchase 
liability (Note 3), the discount unwind on certain other payables arising from 
intangible asset acquisitions (Note 3), material legal net settlements (Note 21), 
the unwind of the fair value adjustment to Alexion inventories (Note 2) and 
restructuring charges relating to the Post Alexion Acquisition Group Review 
(Note 2)

The reported profit of the Group can fluctuate due to intangible asset impairment 
charges, fair value and discount unwind movements on contingent consideration, 
the discount unwind on the Acerta Pharma share purchase liability, the discount 
unwind on certain other payables arising from intangible asset acquisitions, 
material legal net settlements, the unwind of the fair value adjustment to Alexion 
inventories and the restructuring costs resulting from the Post Alexion Acquisition 
Group Review. These amounts are prone to year on year volatility and are not 
necessarily reflective of the operating performance of the Group and as such they 
have been excluded from the benchmark amount. Our approach and relevant 
adjustments are consistent with the prior year.

0.2% of net assets as constrained by the allocation 
of overall Group materiality

We have considered the nature of the business of 
AstraZeneca PLC (being a holding Company for 
investment activities) and have determined that net 
assets are an appropriate basis for the calculation of 
the overall materiality level.

Financial Statements / Independent auditors’ report to the members of AstraZeneca PLC

AstraZeneca Annual Report & Form 20-F Information 2023

145

Independent auditors’ report to  
the members of AstraZeneca PLC  
continued

For each component in the scope of our Group audit, 
we allocated a materiality that is less than our overall 
Group materiality. The range of materiality allocated 
across components was between $45m and $250m.

We use performance materiality to reduce to an 
appropriately low level the probability that the 
aggregate of uncorrected and undetected 
misstatements exceeds overall materiality. 
Specifically, we use performance materiality in 
determining the scope of our audit and the nature and 
extent of our testing of account balances, classes of 
transactions and disclosures, for example in 
determining sample sizes. Our performance materiality 
was 75% (2022: 75%%) of overall materiality, 
amounting to $330m (2022: $300m) for the Group 
financial statements and $82.5m (2022: $75m) for the 
Company financial statements.

In determining the performance materiality, we 
considered a number of factors – the history of 
misstatements, risk assessment and aggregation 
risk and the effectiveness of controls – and concluded 
that an amount at the upper end of our normal range 
was appropriate.

We agreed with the Audit Committee that we would 
report to them misstatements identified during our 
audit above $22m (Group audit) (2022: $20m) and 
$22m (Company audit) (2022: $20m) as well as 
misstatements below those amounts that, in our view, 
warranted reporting for qualitative reasons.

Conclusions relating to going concern
Our evaluation of the directors’ assessment of the 
Group’s and the Company’s ability to continue to 
adopt the going concern basis of accounting included:

 > agreeing the underlying cash flow projections to 

Board approved Group level budgets and forecasts, 
assessing how these forecasts are compiled, and 
assessing the accuracy of management’s forecasts;

 > evaluating the key assumptions within 

management’s forecasts and ensuring that such 
assumptions are consistent with those modelled in 
relation to impairments;

 > considering liquidity and available financial 

resources;

 > assessing whether the stress testing performed by 

management appropriately considered the principal 
risks facing the business; and

 > evaluating the feasibility of management’s mitigating 

actions in the stress testing scenarios and 
performing our own sensitivities.

Based on the work we have performed, we have not 
identified any material uncertainties relating to events 
or conditions that, individually or collectively, may cast 
significant doubt on the Group’s and the Company’s 
ability to continue as a going concern for a period of at 
least twelve months from when the financial 
statements are authorised for issue.

In auditing the financial statements, we have 
concluded that the directors’ use of the going concern 
basis of accounting in the preparation of the financial 
statements is appropriate.

However, because not all future events or conditions 
can be predicted, this conclusion is not a guarantee as 
to the Group’s and the Company’s ability to continue 
as a going concern.

In relation to the directors’ reporting on how they have 
applied the UK Corporate Governance Code, we have 
nothing material to add or draw attention to in relation 
to the directors’ statement in the financial statements 

about whether the directors considered it appropriate 
to adopt the going concern basis of accounting.

Our responsibilities and the responsibilities of the 
directors with respect to going concern are described 
in the relevant sections of this report.

Reporting on other information
The other information comprises all of the information 
in the Annual Report other than the financial 
statements and our auditors’ report thereon. The 
directors are responsible for the other information. 
Our opinion on the financial statements does not cover 
the other information and, accordingly, we do not 
express an audit opinion or, except to the extent 
otherwise explicitly stated in this report, any form of 
assurance thereon.

In connection with our audit of the financial 
statements, our responsibility is to read the other 
information and, in doing so, consider whether the 
other information is materially inconsistent with the 
financial statements or our knowledge obtained in the 
audit, or otherwise appears to be materially misstated. 
If we identify an apparent material inconsistency or 
material misstatement, we are required to perform 
procedures to conclude whether there is a material 
misstatement of the financial statements or a material 
misstatement of the other information. If, based on the 
work we have performed, we conclude that there is a 
material misstatement of this other information, we are 
required to report that fact. We have nothing to report 
based on these responsibilities.

With respect to the Strategic Report and Directors’ 
Report, we also considered whether the disclosures 
required by the UK Companies Act 2006 have 
been included.

Based on our work undertaken in the course of the 
audit, the Companies Act 2006 requires us also 
to report certain opinions and matters as 
described below.

Strategic Report and Directors’ Report
In our opinion, based on the work undertaken in the 
course of the audit, the information given in the 
Strategic Report and Directors’ Report for the year 
ended 31 December 2023 is consistent with the 
financial statements and has been prepared in 
accordance with applicable legal requirements.

In light of the knowledge and understanding of the 
Group and Company and their environment obtained 
in the course of the audit, we did not identify any 
material misstatements in the Strategic Report and 
Directors’ Report.

Directors’ Remuneration
In our opinion, the part of the Directors’ Remuneration 
Report to be audited has been properly prepared in 
accordance with the Companies Act 2006.

Corporate governance statement
The Listing Rules require us to review the directors’ 
statements in relation to going concern, longer-term 
viability and that part of the corporate governance 
statement relating to the Company’s compliance with 
the provisions of the UK Corporate Governance Code 
specified for our review. Our additional responsibilities 
with respect to the corporate governance statement as 
other information are described in the Reporting on 
other information section of this report.

Based on the work undertaken as part of our audit, we 
have concluded that each of the following elements of 
the corporate governance statement, included within 

the Corporate Governance Overview, Corporate 
Governance Report, Nomination and Governance 
Committee Report, Science Committee Report, 
Sustainability Committee Report and Audit Committee 
Report is materially consistent with the financial 
statements and our knowledge obtained during the 
audit, and we have nothing material to add or draw 
attention to in relation to:

 > The directors’ confirmation that they have carried 
out a robust assessment of the emerging and 
principal risks;

 > The disclosures in the Annual Report that describe 
those principal risks, what procedures are in place 
to identify emerging risks and an explanation of how 
these are being managed or mitigated;

 > The directors’ statement in the financial statements 
about whether they considered it appropriate to 
adopt the going concern basis of accounting in 
preparing them, and their identification of any 
material uncertainties to the Group’s and 
Company’s ability to continue to do so over a period 
of at least twelve months from the date of approval 
of the financial statements;

 > The directors’ explanation as to their assessment of 
the Group’s and Company’s prospects, the period 
this assessment covers and why the period is 
appropriate; and

 > The directors’ statement as to whether they have a 
reasonable expectation that the Company will be 
able to continue in operation and meet its liabilities 
as they fall due over the period of its assessment, 
including any related disclosures drawing attention 
to any necessary qualifications or assumptions.

Our review of the directors’ statement regarding the 
longer-term viability of the Group and Company was 
substantially less in scope than an audit and only 
consisted of making inquiries and considering the 
directors’ process supporting their statement; 
checking that the statement is in alignment with the 
relevant provisions of the UK Corporate Governance 
Code; and considering whether the statement is 
consistent with the financial statements and our 
knowledge and understanding of the Group and 
Company and their environment obtained in the 
course of the audit.

In addition, based on the work undertaken as part of 
our audit, we have concluded that each of the following 
elements of the corporate governance statement is 
materially consistent with the financial statements and 
our knowledge obtained during the audit:

 > The directors’ statement that they consider the 

Annual Report, taken as a whole, is fair, balanced 
and understandable, and provides the information 
necessary for the members to assess the Group’s 
and Company’s position, performance, business 
model and strategy;

 > The section of the Annual Report that describes the 
review of effectiveness of risk management and 
internal control systems; and

 > The section of the Annual Report describing the 

work of the Audit Committee.

We have nothing to report in respect of our 
responsibility to report when the directors’ statement 
relating to the Company’s compliance with the Code 
does not properly disclose a departure from a relevant 
provision of the Code specified under the Listing Rules 
for review by the auditors.

Responsibilities for the financial statements 
and the audit
Responsibilities of the directors for the 
financial statements
As explained more fully in the Preparation of the 
Financial Statements and Directors’ Responsibilities 
section, the directors are responsible for the 
preparation of the financial statements in accordance 
with the applicable framework and for being satisfied 
that they give a true and fair view. The directors are 
also responsible for such internal control as they 
determine is necessary to enable the preparation of 
financial statements that are free from material 
misstatement, whether due to fraud or error.

In preparing the financial statements, the directors are 
responsible for assessing the Group’s and the 
Company’s ability to continue as a going concern, 
disclosing, as applicable, matters related to going 
concern and using the going concern basis of 
accounting unless the directors either intend to 
liquidate the Group or the Company or to cease 
operations, or have no realistic alternative but to do so.

Auditors’ responsibilities for the audit of the 
financial statements
Our objectives are to obtain reasonable assurance 
about whether the financial statements as a whole are 
free from material misstatement, whether due to fraud 
or error, and to issue an auditors’ report that includes 
our opinion. Reasonable assurance is a high level of 
assurance, but is not a guarantee that an audit 
conducted in accordance with ISAs (UK) will always 
detect a material misstatement when it exists. 
Misstatements can arise from fraud or error and are 
considered material if, individually or in the aggregate, 
they could reasonably be expected to influence the 
economic decisions of users taken on the basis of 
these financial statements.

Irregularities, including fraud, are instances of 
non-compliance with laws and regulations. We design 
procedures in line with our responsibilities, outlined 
above, to detect material misstatements in respect of 
irregularities, including fraud. The extent to which our 
procedures are capable of detecting irregularities, 
including fraud, is detailed below.

Based on our understanding of the Group and 
industry, we identified that the principal risks of 
non-compliance with laws and regulations related to 
patent protection, product safety (including but not 
limited to the US Food and Drug Administration 
regulation, the European Medicines Agency, the UK 
Medicines and Healthcare products Regulatory 
Agency, China Food and Drug Administration), 
antibribery and competition law (including but not 
limited to the Foreign Corrupt Practices Act, the 
Proceeds of Crime Act and the provisions set out by 
the National Healthcare Security Administration in 
China), and we considered the extent to which 
non-compliance might have a material effect on the 
financial statements. We also considered those laws 
and regulations that have a direct impact on the 
financial statements such as the Companies Act 2006 
and tax legislation. We evaluated management’s 
incentives and opportunities for fraudulent 
manipulation of the financial statements (including the 
risk of override of controls), and determined that the 
principal risks were related to journal entries to 
manipulate financial results and potential management 
bias in accounting estimates. The Group engagement 
team shared this risk assessment with the component 
auditors so that they could include appropriate audit 
procedures in response to such risks in their work. 

Audit procedures performed by the Group 
engagement team and/or component auditors 
included:

 > Evaluation and testing of the design and operating 
effectiveness of management’s controls to prevent 
and detect irregularities;

 > Discussions with VP Group Internal Audit, the 
Deputy Chief Compliance Officer, the Head of 
Global Investigations and the Group’s General 
Counsel and Deputy General Counsels along with 
other members of Group legal and external counsel 
where applicable, including consideration of known 
or suspected instances of non-compliance with 
laws and regulations and fraud;

 > Assessment of matters reported on the Group’s 

whistleblowing helpline and the results of 
management’s investigation of such matters;

 > Challenging assumptions made by management in 
its significant accounting estimates, in particular in 
relation to the recognition and measurement of 
certain rebate accruals in the US (excluding Rare 
Diseases), the impairment of intangible assets 
(excluding goodwill and software development 
costs), the recognition and measurement of legal 
provisions and disclosure of contingent liabilities, 
the recognition and measurement of uncertain tax 
treatments, and the valuation of the defined benefit 
obligations (see related key audit matters above); 
and

 > Identifying and testing the validity of journal entries, 
in particular any journal entries posted with unusual 
account combinations, and consolidation journals.

There are inherent limitations in the audit procedures 
described above. We are less likely to become aware 
of instances of non-compliance with laws and 
regulations that are not closely related to events and 
transactions reflected in the financial statements. Also, 
the risk of not detecting a material misstatement due 
to fraud is higher than the risk of not detecting one 
resulting from error, as fraud may involve deliberate 
concealment by, for example, forgery or intentional 
misrepresentations, or through collusion.

Our audit testing might include testing complete 
populations of certain transactions and balances, 
possibly using data auditing techniques. However, it 
typically involves selecting a limited number of items 
for testing, rather than testing complete populations. 
We will often seek to target particular items for testing 
based on their size or risk characteristics. In other 
cases, we will use audit sampling to enable us to draw 
a conclusion about the population from which the 
sample is selected.

A further description of our responsibilities for the audit 
of the financial statements is located on the FRC’s 
website at: www.frc.org.uk/auditorsresponsibilities. 
This description forms part of our auditors’ report.

Use of this report
This report, including the opinions, has been prepared 
for and only for the Company’s members as a body

 Consolidated Statement of Cash Flows

151

AstraZeneca Annual Report & Form 20-F Information 2023Corporate GovernanceAdditional InformationFinancial StatementsStrategic ReportGroup Accounting Policies

Basis of accounting and preparation 
of financial information
The Consolidated Financial Statements 
have been prepared under the historical cost 
convention, modified to include revaluation to 
fair value of certain financial instruments and 
pension plan assets and liabilities as described 
below, in accordance with UK-adopted 
international accounting standards and with 
the requirements of the Companies Act 2006 
as applicable to companies reporting under 
those standards. The Consolidated Financial 
Statements also comply fully with IFRS 
Accounting Standards as issued by the 
International Accounting Standards Board 
(IASB) and International Accounting Standards 
as adopted by the European Union.

Collaboration Revenue arising from 
collaborative arrangements where the Group 
retains a significant ongoing economic interest 
and receives upfront amounts and event-
triggered milestones, which arise from the 
licensing of intellectual property, will continue 
to be reported as Collaboration Revenue. In 
collaboration arrangements either AstraZeneca 
or the collaborator acts as principal in sales to 
the end customer. Where AstraZeneca acts as 
principal, AstraZeneca records 100% of sales 
to the end customer within Product Sales. The 
updated presentation reflects the increasing 
importance of income arising from share of 
gross profit arrangements where collaboration 
partners are responsible for booking revenues 
in some or all territories.

The Consolidated Financial Statements are 
presented in US dollars, which is the Company’s 
functional currency.

In preparing their individual financial statements, 
the accounting policies of some overseas 
subsidiaries do not conform with IASB-
issued IFRSs. Therefore, where appropriate, 
adjustments are made in order to present the 
Consolidated Financial Statements on a 
consistent basis.

New accounting requirements
Other than noted below, amendments to 
accounting standards issued by the IASB and 
adopted in the year ended 31 December 2023 
did not have a material impact on the result or 
financial position of the Group.

IAS 12
On 23 May 2023, the IASB issued an 
amendment to IAS 12 ‘Income Taxes’ to clarify 
how the effects of the global minimum tax 
framework should be accounted for and 
disclosed effective 1 January 2023. This was 
endorsed by the UK Endorsement Board on 
19 July 2023 and has been adopted by the 
Group for 2023 reporting. The Group has 
applied the exemption to recognising and 
disclosing information about deferred tax 
assets and liabilities related to Pillar 2 
income taxes.

Alliance and Collaboration Revenue
Effective 1 January 2023, the Group has 
updated the presentation of Total Revenue on 
the face of the Statement of Comprehensive 
Income to include Alliance Revenue as a 
separate element to Collaboration Revenue. 
Alliance Revenue, previously reported within 
Collaboration Revenue, comprises income 
related to sales made by collaboration partners, 
where AstraZeneca is entitled to a share of 
gross profits, share of revenues or royalties, 
which are recurring in nature while the 
collaboration arrangement remains in place. 
Alliance Revenue does not include Product 
Sales where AstraZeneca is leading 
commercialisation in a territory. 

152

The comparative revenue reported in the 
years to 31 December 2022 and 31 December 
2021 has been retrospectively adjusted to 
reflect the new split of Total Revenue, resulting 
in Alliance Revenue being reported for the 
year to 31 December 2022 of $755m and to 
31 December 2021 of $388m, however the 
combined total of Alliance Revenue and 
Collaboration Revenue is equal to the 
previously reported Collaboration Revenue 
total for each prior year.

Basis for preparation of Financial 
Statements on a going concern basis
The Group has considerable financial resources 
available. As at 31 December 2023, the Group 
has $12.7bn in financial resources (Cash and 
cash equivalent balances of $5.8bn and 
undrawn committed bank facilities of $6.9bn, 
of which $2.0bn are available until February 
2025 and the remaining $4.9bn are available 
until April 2026, (in February 2024 these 
facilities were extended to April 2029), with only 
$5.4bn of borrowings due within one year).

The Group’s revenues are largely derived from 
sales of medicines covered by patents, which 
provide a relatively high level of resilience 
and predictability to cash inflows, although 
government price interventions in response to 
budgetary constraints are expected to 
continue to adversely affect revenues in some 
of our significant markets. The Group, 
however, anticipates new revenue streams 
from both recently launched medicines and 
those in development, and the Group has a 
wide diversity of customers and suppliers 
across different geographic areas.

Consequently, the Directors believe that, overall, 
the Group is well placed to manage its business 
risks successfully. Accordingly, they continue 
to adopt the going concern basis in preparing 
the Annual Report and Financial Statements.

Estimates and judgements
The preparation of the Financial Statements in 
conformity with generally accepted accounting 
principles requires management to make 
estimates and judgements that affect the 
reported amounts of assets and liabilities at 
the date of the Financial Statements and the 

reported amounts of revenues and expenses 
during the reporting period. Actual results 
could differ from those estimates.

The accounting policy descriptions set out the 
areas where judgements and estimates need 
exercising, the most significant of which 
include the following Key Judgements 
Significant Estimates

The Group has assessed the impact of climate 
risk on its financial reporting. The impact 
assessment was primarily focused on the 
valuation and useful lives of intangible assets 
and the identification and valuation of provisions 
and contingent liabilities, as these are judged 
to be the key areas that could be impacted by 
climate risks. No material accounting impacts 
or changes to judgements or other required 
disclosures were noted.

 Key Judgements are those judgements 

made in applying the Group’s accounting 
policies that have a material effect on the 
amounts of assets and liabilities recognised 
in the Financial Statements.

 A Significant Estimate has a significant 
risk of material adjustment to the carrying 
amounts of assets and liabilities within the 
next financial year.

Financial risk management policies are detailed 
in Note 28 to the Financial Statements from 
page 195.

AstraZeneca’s management considers the 
following to be the material accounting policies 
in the context of the Group’s operations.

Revenue
Revenue comprises Product Sales, Alliance 
Revenue and Collaboration Revenue.

Revenue excludes inter-company revenues 
and value-added taxes. 

AstraZeneca Annual Report & Form 20-F Information 2023Financial Statements 
 
 
 
Product Sales 
Product Sales represent net invoice value less 
estimated rebates, returns and chargebacks, 
which are considered to be variable 
consideration and include significant estimates. 
Sales are recognised when the control of the 
goods has been transferred to a third party. 
This is usually when title passes to the 
customer, either on shipment or on receipt of 
goods by the customer, depending on local 
trading terms. Revenue is not recognised in 
full until it is highly probable that a significant 
reversal in the amount of cumulative revenue 
recognised will not occur.

Rebates are amounts payable or credited to 
a customer, usually based on the quantity or 
value of Product Sales to the customer for 
specific products in a certain period. Product 
sales rebates, which relate to Product Sales 
that occur over a period of time, are normally 
issued retrospectively.

At the time Product Sales are invoiced, rebates 
and deductions that the Group expects to 
pay are estimated based upon assumptions 
developed using contractual terms, historical 
experience and market-related information. 
The rebates and deductions are recognised 
as variable consideration and recorded as a 
reduction to revenue with an accrual recorded. 
These rebates typically arise from sales 
contracts with government payers, third-party 
managed care organisations, hospitals, 
long-term care facilities, group purchasing 
organisations and various state programmes.

In markets where returns are significant, 
estimates of the quantity and value of goods 
which may ultimately be returned are accounted 
for at the point revenue is recognised. Our 
returns accruals are based on actual experience 
over the preceding 12 months for established 
products together with market-related 
information such as estimated stock levels 
at wholesalers and competitor activity which 
we receive via third-party information services. 
For newly launched products, we use rates 
based on our experience with similar products 
or a predetermined percentage. 

When a product faces generic competition, 
particular attention is given to the possible 
levels of returns and, in cases where the 
circumstances are such that the level of 
Product Sales are considered highly probable 
to reverse, revenues are only recognised when 
the right of return expires, which is generally on 
ultimate prescription of the product to patients.

The methodology and assumptions used to 
estimate rebates and returns are monitored 
and adjusted regularly in the light of contractual 
and legal obligations, historical trends, past 
experience and projected market conditions. 
Once the uncertainty associated with returns 
is resolved, revenue is adjusted accordingly.

Under certain collaboration agreements 
which include a profit sharing mechanism, our 
recognition of Product Sales depends on which 
party acts as principal in sales to the end 
customer. In the cases where AstraZeneca 
acts as principal, we record 100% of sales 
to the end customer. In the cases where 
AstraZeneca does not act as principal, we 
record the share of gross profits received 
within Alliance Revenue.

Contracts relating to the supply of certain 
Vaccines & Immune Therapies medicines 
relating to the COVID-19 pandemic include 
conditions whereby payments are receivable 
from customers in advance of the delivery of 
product. Such amounts are held on the balance 
sheet as contract liabilities until the related 
revenue is recognised, generally upon product 
delivery. Certain of these contracts contain 
further provisions that restrict the use of 
inventory manufactured in specified supply 
chains to specified customers, resulting in an 
enforceable right to payment as the activities 
are performed. Under IFRS 15, such contracts 
require revenue to be recognised over time 
using an appropriate and reasonably 
measurable method to measure progress. 
Revenue is recognised on these contracts 
based on the proportion of product delivered 
compared to the total contracted volumes.

Certain arrangements include bill-and-hold 
arrangements under which the Group invoices 
a customer for a product but retains physical 
possession of the product until it is transferred 
to the customer at a point in time in the future. 
For these types of arrangements, an 
assessment is made to determine when the 
performance obligation has been satisfied, 
which is when control of the product is 
transferred to the customer. If the customer has 
obtained control of the product even though 
that product remains in the Group’s physical 
possession, the performance obligation to 
transfer a product has been satisfied and 
Product Sales are recognised. Control is 
considered to have transferred when the 
reason for the bill-and-hold arrangement is 
substantive, the product can be identified 
separately as belonging to the customer, the 
product is ready for physical transfer to the 
customer and AstraZeneca is unable to use 
or sell the product to another customer.

Alliance Revenue
Alliance Revenue comprises income arising 
from the ongoing operation of collaborative 
arrangements related to sales made by 
collaboration partners, where AstraZeneca 
is entitled to a share of gross profits, share 
of revenues or royalties, which are recurring 
in nature while the collaboration agreement 
remains in place. Alliance Revenue does not 
include Product Sales where AstraZeneca 
is leading commercialisation in a territory, 
or reimbursement for AstraZeneca-incurred 
expenses such as R&D or promotion 
costs, which arise from the license of 
intellectual property.

The Group periodically enters into transactions 
where it acquires part of the rights to a product 
intangible (either on-market or in-process R&D), 
but for commercial reasons does not act as 
principal in selling the product to the customer 
and therefore does not recognise income from 
the product in the form of Product Sales. This 
may occur where, for example, a collaboration 
partner retains the right to commercialise in a 
specific territory, and has sufficient local control 
over that commercialisation to book Product 
Sales, while the Group instead receives a 
proportion of the value generated by those 
Product Sales, either in the form of a royalty, 
a share of gross profits or a share of revenues.

Where the arrangement meets the definition 
of a licence agreement, share of gross profits, 
share of revenues and sales royalties are 
recognised when achieved by applying the 
royalty exemption under IFRS 15. All other 
sales royalties are recognised when considered 
it is highly probable there will not be a 
significant reversal of cumulative income. 
The determination requires estimates to be 
made in relation to future Product Sales.

Collaboration Revenue 
Collaboration Revenue includes income arising 
from entering into collaborative arrangements 
where the Group has out-licensed (sold) certain 
rights associated with products and where 
AstraZeneca retains a significant ongoing 
economic interest in the product. Significant 
interest can include ongoing supply of finished 
goods, profit sharing arrangements or being 
principal in the sales of medicines. These 
collaborations may include development, 
manufacturing and/or commercialisation 
arrangements with the collaborator. Income 
from out-licences may take the form of upfront 
fees and milestones.

 Timing of recognition of clinical and 
regulatory milestones is considered to be 
a key judgement. There can be significant 
uncertainty over whether it is highly probable 
that there would not be a significant reversal 
of revenue in respect of specific milestones 
if these are recognised before they are 
triggered due to them being subject to the 
actions of third parties. In general, where 
the triggering of a milestone is subject to the 
decisions of third parties (e.g. the acceptance 
or approval of a filing by a regulatory 
authority), the Group does not consider that 
the threshold for recognition is met until that 
decision is made.

Where Collaboration Revenue arises from 
the licensing of the Group’s own intellectual 
property, the licences we grant are typically 
rights to use intellectual property which do 
not change during the period of the licence 
and therefore related non-conditional revenue 
is recognised at the point the licence is 
granted and variable consideration as soon 
as recognition criteria are met. 

 Group Accounting Policies

continued

Other performance obligations in the contract 
might include the supply of product. These 
arrangements typically involve the receipt of an 
upfront payment, which the contract attributes 
to the license of the intangible assets, and 
ongoing receipts for supply, which the contract 
attributes to the sale of the product we 
manufacture. In cases where the transaction 
has two or more components, we account for 
the delivered item (for example, the transfer 
of title to the intangible asset) as a separate 
unit of account and record revenue on 
delivery of that component. Where practicable, 
consideration is allocated to performance 
obligations on the basis of the standalone 
selling price of each performance obligation. 
However, where there is a licence of intellectual 
property, it is not always possible to establish 
a reliable estimate of the standalone selling 
price of the licence as they are unique. 
Therefore, in these rare situations, the 
residual approach is used to determine the 
consideration attributable to the licence.

Where fixed amounts are payable over one 
year from the effective date of a contract, an 
assessment is made as to whether a significant 
financing component exists, and if so, the 
fair value of this component is deferred and 
recognised as financing income over the 
period to the expected date of receipt.

Where control of a right to use licence for an 
intangible asset passes at the outset of an 
arrangement, revenue is recognised at the 
point in time control is transferred. Where the 
substance of a licence arrangement is that 
of a right to access rights attributable to an 
intangible asset, revenue, in the form of an 
upfront fee, is recognised over time, normally 
on a straight-line basis over the life of the 
contract. Where the Group provides ongoing 
development services, revenue in respect of 
this element is recognised over the duration 
of those services.

Where Collaboration Revenue is recorded 
and there is a related intangible asset that is 
licensed as part of the arrangement, an 
appropriate amount of that intangible asset 
is charged to Cost of sales based on an 
allocation of cost or value to the rights that 
have been licensed.

Cost of sales
Cost of sales are recognised as the 
associated revenue is recognised. Cost of 
sales include manufacturing costs, royalties 
payable on revenues recognised, movements 
in provisions for inventories, inventory 
write-offs and impairment charges in relation 
to manufacturing assets. Cost of sales also 
includes co-collaborator sharing of profit 
arising from collaborations, and foreign 
exchange gains and losses arising from 
business trading activities.

154

Research and development
Research expenditure is charged to profit and 
loss in the year in which it is incurred.

 Internal development expenditure is 
capitalised only if it meets the recognition 
criteria of IAS 38 ‘Intangible Assets’. This is 
considered a key judgement. Where regulatory 
and other uncertainties are such that the 
criteria are not met, the expenditure is 
charged to profit and loss and this is almost 
invariably the case prior to approval of the 
drug by the relevant regulatory authority. 
Where, however, recognition criteria are 
met, Intangible assets are capitalised and 
amortised on a straight-line basis over their 
useful economic lives from product launch. 
At 31 December 2023, no amounts have met 
the recognition criteria.

Payments to in-license products and 
compounds from third parties for new research 
and development projects (in process research 
and development) generally take the form of 
upfront payments, milestones and royalty 
payments. Where payments made to third 
parties represent consideration for future 
research and development activities, an 
evaluation is made as to the nature of the 
payments. Such payments are expensed if they 
represent compensation for sub-contracted 
research and development services not 
resulting in a transfer of intellectual property. 
By contrast, payments are capitalised if they 
represent compensation for the transfer of 
identifiable intellectual property developed 
at the risk of the third party. Such payments 
may be made once development or regulatory 
milestones are met and may also be made 
on the basis of sales volumes once a product 
is launched. Development and regulatory 
milestone payments are capitalised as the 
milestone is triggered. Sales-related payments 
are accrued and capitalised with reference to 
the latest Group sales forecasts for approved 
indications at the present value of expected 
future cash flows. Assets capitalised are 
amortised, on a straight-line basis, over their 
useful economic lives from product launch. 

 The determination of useful economic 
life is considered to be a key judgement. 
On product launch, the Group makes a 
judgement as to the expected useful 
economic life with reference to the expiry 
of associated patents for the product, 
expectation around the competitive 
environment specific to the product and 
our detailed long-term risk-adjusted sales 
projections compiled annually across the 
Group and approved by the Board.

The useful economic life can extend beyond 
patent expiry dependent upon the nature 
of the product and the complexity of the 
development and manufacturing process. 
Significant sales can often be achieved post 
patent expiration.

Intangible assets
Intangible assets are stated at cost less 
accumulated amortisation and impairments. 
Intangible assets relating to products in 
development are subject to impairment testing 
annually. All Intangible assets are tested for 
impairment when there are indications that 
the carrying value may not be recoverable. 
The determination of the recoverable amounts 
include key estimates which are highly sensitive 
to, and depend upon, key assumptions as 
detailed in Note 10 to the Financial Statements 
from page 172.

Impairment reviews have been carried out on 
all Intangible assets that are in development 
(and not being amortised), all major intangible 
assets acquired during the year and all other 
intangible assets that have had indicators of 
impairment during the year. Recoverable 
amount is determined as the higher of value-in-
use or fair value less costs to sell using a 
discounted cash flow calculation, with the 
products’ expected cash flows risk-adjusted 
over their estimated remaining useful economic 
life. Sales forecasts and specific allocated 
costs (which have both been subject to 
appropriate senior management review and 
approval) are risk-adjusted and discounted 
using appropriate rates based on our post-tax 
weighted average cost of capital or for fair value 
less costs to sell, a required rate of return for a 
market participant. Our weighted average cost 
of capital reflects factors such as our capital 
structure and our costs of debt and equity.

Any impairment losses are recognised 
immediately in Operating profit. Intangible 
assets relating to products which fail during 
development (or for which development 
ceases for other reasons) are also tested for 
impairment and are written down to their 
recoverable amount (which is usually nil).

If, subsequent to an impairment loss being 
recognised, development restarts or other 
facts and circumstances change indicating 
that the impairment is less or no longer exists, 
the value of the asset is re-estimated and its 
carrying value is increased to the recoverable 
amount, but not exceeding the original value, 
by recognising an impairment reversal in 
Operating profit.

Government grants
Government grants are recognised in the 
Consolidated Statement of Comprehensive 
Income so as to match with the related 
expenses that they are intended to compensate. 
Where grants are received in advance of the 
related expenses, they are initially recognised 
in the Consolidated Statement of Financial 
Position under Trade and other payables as 
deferred income and released to net off 
against the related expenditure when incurred. 

AstraZeneca Annual Report & Form 20-F Information 2023Financial StatementsEach contract is assessed to determine 
whether there are both grant elements and 
supply of product which need to be separated. 
In each case, the contracts set out the specified 
terms for the supply of the product and the 
provisions for funding for certain costs, 
primarily research and development associated 
with the IP. It is considered whether there are 
any conditions for the funding to be refunded. 
The consideration in the contract is allocated 
between the grant and supply elements. 
The standalone selling price for the supply 
of products is determined by reference to 
observed prices with other customers. The 
amount allocated as a government grant is 
determined by reference to the specific agreed 
costs and activities identified in the contract 
as not directly attributable to the supply of 
product. Government grants are recorded 
as an offset to the relevant expense in the 
Consolidated Statement of Comprehensive 
Income and are capped to match the relevant 
costs incurred.

Other operating income and expense
Other operating income and expense is 
generated from activities outside of the 
Group’s normal course of business, which 
includes Other income from divestments of or 
full out-license of assets and businesses 
including royalties and milestones where the 
Group does not retain a significant continued 
interest. Where the arrangement meets the 
definition of a licence agreement, sales 
milestones and sales royalties are recognised 
when achieved by applying the royalty 
exemption under IFRS 15. All other milestones 
and sales royalties are recognised when it is 
considered highly probable that there will not 
be a significant reversal of cumulative income. 
The determination requires estimates to be 
made in relation to future Product Sales.

Joint arrangements and associates
The Group has arrangements over which it 
has joint control and which qualify as joint 
operations or joint ventures under IFRS 11 
‘Joint Arrangements’. For joint operations, the 
Group recognises its share of revenue that it 
earns from the joint operations and its share of 
expenses incurred. The Group also recognises 
the assets associated with the joint operations 
that it controls and the liabilities it incurs under 
the joint arrangement. For joint ventures and 
associates, the Group recognises its interest in 
the joint venture or associate as an investment 
and uses the equity method of accounting.

Employee benefits
The Group accounts for pensions and other 
employee benefits (principally healthcare) 
under IAS 19 ‘Employee Benefits’. In respect 
of defined benefit plans, obligations are 
determined using the projected unit credit 
method and are discounted to present value 
by reference to market yields on high-quality 
corporate bonds, while plan assets are 
measured at fair value. Given the extent of the 
assumptions used to determine the value of 
scheme assets and scheme liabilities, these 

 Group Accounting Policies

are considered to be significant estimates. 
The operating and financing costs of such plans 
are recognised separately in profit; current 
service costs are spread systematically over 
the lives of employees and financing costs are 
recognised in full in the periods in which they 
arise. Remeasurements of the net defined 
benefit pension liability, including actuarial 
gains and losses, are recognised immediately 
in Other comprehensive income.

Where the calculation results in a surplus to 
the Group, the recognised asset is limited 
to the present value of any available future 
refunds from the plan or reductions in 
future contributions to the plan subject to 
consideration of the effect any minimum 
funding requirement for future service has 
on the benefit available as a reduction in 
future contributions.

Payments to defined contribution plans are 
recognised in profit as they fall due.

Taxation
The current tax payable is based on taxable 
profit for the year. Taxable profit differs from 
reported profit because taxable profit 
excludes items that are either never taxable or 
tax deductible or items that are taxable or tax 
deductible in a different period. The Group’s 
current tax assets and liabilities are calculated 
using tax rates that have been enacted or 
substantively enacted by the reporting date.

Deferred tax is provided using the balance 
sheet liability method, providing for temporary 
differences between the carrying amounts of 
assets and liabilities for financial reporting 
purposes and the amounts used for taxation 
purposes. Deferred tax liabilities are recognised 
unless they arise from the initial recognition 
(other than in a business combination) of assets 
and liabilities in a transaction that affects 
neither the taxable profit nor the accounting 
profit. Deferred tax liabilities are not recognised 
to the extent they arise from the initial 
recognition of non-tax deductible goodwill. 
Deferred tax assets are recognised to the 
extent that there are future taxable temporary 
differences or it is probable that future taxable 
profit will be available against which the asset 
can be utilised. This requires judgements to 
be made in respect of the availability of future 
taxable income.

No deferred tax asset or liability is recognised 
in respect of temporary differences associated 
with investments in subsidiaries and branches 
where the Group is able to control the timing 
of reversal of the temporary differences and it 
is probable that the temporary differences will 
not reverse in the foreseeable future. 

The Group’s deferred tax assets and liabilities 
are calculated using tax rates that are 
expected to apply in the period when the 
liability is settled or the asset realised based 
on tax rates that have been enacted or 
substantively enacted by the reporting date. 

Deferred tax liabilities relating to assets 
recognised because of a business combination 
which may qualify for intellectual property 
incentives are measured at the relevant 
statutory tax rate. Deferred tax assets and 
liabilities are offset in the Consolidated 
Statement of Financial Position if, and only if, 
the taxable entity has a legally enforceable 
right to set off current tax assets and liabilities, 
and the Deferred tax assets and liabilities 
relate to taxes levied by the same taxation 
authority on the same taxable entity.

Liabilities for uncertain tax positions require 
management to make judgements of potential 
exposures in relation to tax audit issues. 
Tax benefits are not recognised unless the 
tax positions will probably be accepted by 
the tax authorities. This is based upon 
management’s interpretation of applicable laws 
and regulations and the expectation of how 
the tax authority will resolve the matter. Once 
considered probable of not being accepted, 
management reviews each material tax benefit 
and reflects the effect of the uncertainty in 
determining the related taxable result. 

Liabilities for uncertain tax positions are 
measured using either the most likely amount 
or the expected value amount depending on 
which method the entity expects to better 
predict the resolution of the uncertainty.

Further details of the estimates and 
assumptions made in determining our recorded 
liability for transfer pricing contingencies and 
other tax contingencies are included in Note 30 
to the Financial Statements from page 204.

Share-based payments
All plans have been classified as equity settled 
after assessment. The grant date fair value 
of the market-based performance elements of 
employee share plan awards is calculated 
using a modified Monte Carlo model, with 
other elements at market price. In accordance 
with IFRS 2 ‘Share-based Payment’, the 
resulting cost is recognised in profit on a 
straight-line basis over the vesting period 
of the awards. The value of the charge is 
adjusted to reflect expected and actual levels 
of awards vesting, except where the failure 
to vest is as a result of not meeting a market 
condition. Cancellations of equity instruments 
are treated as an acceleration of the vesting 
period and any outstanding charge is 
recognised in profit immediately.

Cash outflows relating to the vesting of share 
plans for our employees are recognised within 
operating activities, as they relate to employee 
remuneration. The cash flows relating to 
replacement awards issued to employees as 
part of the Alexion acquisition (see Note 27 
from page 193) are classified within investing 
activities, as they are part of the aggregate 
cash flows arising from obtaining control of 
the subsidiary.

Property, plant and equipment
The Group’s policy is to depreciate the 
difference between the cost of each item of 
Property, plant and equipment and its residual 
value over its estimated useful life on a 
straight-line basis. Assets under construction 
are not depreciated until the asset is available 
for use, at which point the asset is transferred 
into either Land and buildings or Plant and 
equipment, and depreciated over its 
estimated useful economic life.

Reviews are made annually of the estimated 
remaining lives and residual values of individual 
productive assets, taking account of 
commercial and technological obsolescence as 
well as normal wear and tear. It is impractical 
to calculate average asset lives exactly. 
However, the useful economic lives range from 
approximately 10 to 50 years for buildings, 
and three to 15 years for plant and equipment. 
All items of Property, plant and equipment are 
tested for impairment when there are indications 
that the carrying value may not be recoverable. 
Any impairment losses are recognised 
immediately in Operating profit.

Leases
The Group’s lease arrangements are principally 
for property, most notably a portfolio of office 
premises and employee accommodation, and 
for a global car fleet, utilised primarily by our 
sales and marketing teams.

The lease liability and corresponding 
right-of-use asset arising from a lease are 
initially measured on a present value basis. 
Lease liabilities include the net present value 
of the following lease payments:

>  fixed payments, less any lease 

incentives receivable

>  variable lease payments that depend on an 
index or a rate, initially measured using the 
index or rate as at the commencement date

>  the exercise price of a purchase option if 

the Group is reasonably certain to exercise 
that option

>  payments of penalties for terminating the 
lease, if the lease term reflects the Group 
exercising that option, and

>  amounts expected to be payable by the 
Group under residual value guarantees.

Right-of-use assets are measured at cost 
comprising the following:

>  the amount of the initial measurement of 

lease liability

>  any lease payments made at or before 

the commencement date less any lease 
incentives received

>  any initial direct costs, and
>  restoration costs. 

156

Judgements made in calculating the lease 
liability include assessing whether arrangements 
contain a lease and determining the lease term. 
Lease terms are negotiated on an individual 
basis and contain a wide range of different 
terms and conditions. Property leases will 
often include an early termination or extension 
option to the lease term. Fleet management 
policies vary by jurisdiction and may include 
renewal of a lease until a measurement 
threshold, such as mileage, is reached. 
Extension and termination options have been 
considered when determining the lease term, 
along with all facts and circumstances that may 
create an economic incentive to exercise an 
extension option, or not exercise a termination 
option. Extension periods (or periods after 
termination options) are only included in the 
lease term if the lease is reasonably certain to 
be extended (or not terminated).

The lease payments are discounted using 
incremental borrowing rates, as in the majority 
of leases held by the Group the interest rate 
implicit in the lease is not readily identifiable. 
Calculating the discount rate is an estimate 
made in calculating the lease liability. This rate 
is the rate that the Group would have to pay to 
borrow the funds necessary to obtain an asset 
of similar value to the right-of-use asset in a 
similar economic environment with similar 
terms, security and conditions. To determine 
the incremental borrowing rate, the Group 
uses a risk-free interest rate adjusted for 
credit risk, adjusting for terms specific to the 
lease including term, country and currency. 

The Group is exposed to potential future 
increases in variable lease payments that are 
based on an index or rate, which are initially 
measured as at the commencement date, with 
any future changes in the index or rate excluded 
from the lease liability until they take effect. 
When adjustments to lease payments based 
on an index or rate take effect, the lease 
liability is reassessed and adjusted against the 
right-of-use asset.

Lease payments are allocated between 
principal and finance cost. The finance cost 
is charged to the Consolidated Statement of 
Comprehensive Income over the lease period 
so as to produce a constant periodic rate of 
interest on the remaining balance of the 
liability for each period.

Payments associated with short-term leases of 
Property, plant and equipment and all leases 
of low-value assets are recognised on a 
straight-line basis as an expense in the 
Consolidated Statement of Comprehensive 
Income. Short-term leases are leases with a 
lease term of 12 months or less. Low-value 
leases are those where the underlying asset 
value, when new, is $5,000 or less and 
includes IT equipment and small items of 
office furniture.

Contracts may contain both lease and 
non-lease components. The Group allocates 
the consideration in the contract to the lease 
and non-lease components based on their 
relative standalone prices. 

Right-of-use assets are generally depreciated 
over the shorter of the asset’s useful life and 
the lease term on a straight-line basis. If the 
Group is reasonably certain to exercise a 
purchase option, the right-of-use asset is 
depreciated over the underlying asset’s useful 
life. It is impractical to calculate average asset 
lives exactly. However, the total lives range from 
approximately 10 to 50 years for buildings, 
and three to 15 years for motor vehicles and 
other assets.

There are no material lease agreements under 
which the Group is a lessor.

Business combinations and goodwill
In assessing whether an acquired set of 
assets and activities is a business or an asset, 
management will first elect whether to apply 
an optional concentration test to simplify the 
assessment. Where the concentration test is 
applied, the acquisition will be treated as the 
acquisition of an asset if substantially all of 
the fair value of the gross assets acquired 
(excluding cash and cash equivalents, 
deferred tax assets, and related goodwill) is 
concentrated in a single asset or group of 
similar identifiable assets. 

Where the concentration test is not applied, 
or is not met, a further assessment of whether 
the acquired set of assets and activities is a 
business will be performed.

 The determination of whether an 
acquired set of assets and activities is a 
business or an asset can be judgemental, 
particularly if the target is not producing 
outputs. Management uses a number of 
factors to make this determination, which 
are primarily focused on whether the 
acquired set of assets and activities include 
substantive processes that mean the set is 
capable of being managed for the purpose 
of providing a return. Key determining 
factors include the stage of development 
of any assets acquired, the readiness and 
ability of the acquired set to produce outputs 
and the presence of key experienced 
employees capable of conducting activities 
required to develop or manufacture the 
assets. Typically, the specialised nature of 
many pharmaceutical assets and processes 
is such that until assets are substantively 
ready for production and promotion, there 
are not the required processes for a set of 
assets and activities to meet the definition 
of a business in IFRS 3.

AstraZeneca Annual Report & Form 20-F Information 2023Financial StatementsOn the acquisition of a business, fair values 
are attributed to the identifiable assets and 
liabilities. Attributing fair values is a key 
judgement; refer to Note 27 to the Financial 
Statements from page 193 for additional 
details. Contingent liabilities are also recorded 
at fair value unless the fair value cannot be 
measured reliably, in which case the value is 
subsumed into goodwill. Where fair values of 
acquired contingent liabilities cannot be 
measured reliably, the assumed contingent 
liability is not recognised but is disclosed in 
the same manner as other contingent liabilities. 

Where not all of the equity of a subsidiary 
is acquired, the non-controlling interest is 
recognised either at fair value or at the 
non-controlling interest’s proportionate 
share of the net assets of the subsidiary, 
on a case-by-case basis. Put options over 
non-controlling interests are recognised as a 
financial liability, with a corresponding entry 
in either Retained earnings or against non-
controlling interest reserves on a case-by-
case basis.

The timing and amount of future contingent 
elements of consideration is an estimate. 
Contingent consideration, which may include 
development and launch milestones, revenue 
threshold milestones and revenue-based 
royalties, is fair valued at the date of acquisition 
using decision-tree analysis with key inputs 
including probability of success, consideration 
of potential delays and revenue projections 
based on the Group’s internal forecasts. 
Unsettled amounts of consideration are held 
at fair value within payables with changes in 
fair value recognised immediately in profit.

Goodwill is the difference between the fair value 
of the consideration and the fair value of net 
assets acquired.

Goodwill arising on acquisitions is capitalised 
and subject to an impairment review, both 
annually and when there is an indication that 
the carrying value may not be recoverable.

The Group’s policy up to and including 
1997 was to eliminate Goodwill arising upon 
acquisitions against reserves. Under IFRS 1 
‘First-time Adoption of International Financial 
Reporting Standards’ and IFRS 3 ‘Business 
Combinations’, such Goodwill will remain 
eliminated against reserves.

Subsidiaries
A subsidiary is an entity controlled, directly 
or indirectly, by AstraZeneca PLC. Control is 
regarded as the exposure or rights to the 
variable returns of the entity when combined 
with the power to affect those returns. Control 
is normally evidenced by holding more than 
50% of the share capital of the company, 
however other agreements may be in place that 
result in control where they give AstraZeneca 
finance decision-making authority over the 
relevant activities of the company.

The financial results of subsidiaries are 
consolidated from the date control is 
obtained until the date that control ceases.

Inventories
Inventories are stated at the lower of cost and 
net realisable value. The first in, first out or an 
average method of valuation is used. For 
finished goods and work in progress, cost 
includes directly attributable costs and certain 
overhead expenses (including depreciation). 
Selling expenses and certain other overhead 
expenses (principally central administration 
costs) are excluded. Net realisable value is 
determined as estimated selling price less all 
estimated costs of completion and costs to be 
incurred in selling and distribution.

Write-downs of inventory occur in the general 
course of business and are recognised in 
Cost of sales for launched or approved 
products and in Research and development 
expense for products in development.

Assets held for sale
Non-current assets are classified as Assets 
held for sale when their carrying amount is 
to be recovered principally through a sale 
transaction and a sale is considered highly 
probable. A sale is considered highly probable 
only when the appropriate level of management 
has committed to the sale.

Assets held for sale are stated at the lower 
of carrying amount and fair value less costs 
to sell. Where there is a partial transfer of a 
non-current asset to held for sale, an allocation 
of value is made between the current and 
non-current portions of the asset based on 
the relative value of the two portions, unless 
there is a methodology that better reflects the 
asset to be disposed of.

Assets held for sale are neither depreciated 
nor amortised.

Trade and other receivables
Financial assets included in Trade and other 
receivables are recognised initially at fair value. 
The Group holds the Trade receivables with the 
objective to collect the contractual cash flows 
and therefore measures them subsequently at 
amortised cost using the effective interest 
method, less any impairment, based on 
expected credit losses.

Trade receivables that are subject to debt 
factoring arrangements are derecognised if 
they meet the conditions for derecognition 
detailed in IFRS 9 ‘Financial Instruments’.

Trade and other payables
Financial liabilities included in Trade and other 
payables are recognised initially at fair value. 
Subsequent to initial recognition they are 
measured at amortised cost using the effective 
interest method. Contingent consideration 
payables are held at fair value within Level 3 of 
the fair value hierarchy as defined in Note 12.

Financial instruments
The Group’s financial instruments include 
Lease liabilities, Trade and other receivables 
and payables, liabilities for contingent 
consideration and put options under business 
combinations, and rights and obligations 
under employee benefit plans which are dealt 
with in specific accounting policies.

The Group’s other financial instruments include:

>  Cash and cash equivalents
>  Fixed deposits
>  Other investments
>  Bank and other borrowings
>  Derivatives.

Cash and cash equivalents
Cash and cash equivalents comprise cash in 
hand, current balances with banks and similar 
institutions, and highly liquid investments 
with maturities of three months or less when 
acquired. They are readily convertible into 
known amounts of cash and are held at 
amortised cost under the hold to collect 
classification, where they meet the hold to 
collect ‘solely payments of principal and 
interest’ test criteria under IFRS 9. Those 
not meeting these criteria are held at fair 
value through profit or loss. Cash and cash 
equivalents in the Consolidated Statement 
of Cash Flows include unsecured bank 
overdrafts at the balance sheet date where 
balances often fluctuate between a cash and 
overdraft position.

Fixed deposits
Fixed deposits, principally comprising funds 
held with banks and other financial institutions, 
are initially measured at fair value, plus direct 
transaction costs, and are subsequently 
measured at amortised cost using the 
effective interest method at each reporting 
date. Changes in carrying value are 
recognised in the Consolidated Statement 
of Comprehensive Income.

Other investments
Investments are classified as fair value through 
profit or loss (FVPL), unless the Group makes 
an irrevocable election at initial recognition 
for certain non-current equity investments to 
present changes in Other comprehensive 
income (FVOCI). If this election is made, there 
is no subsequent reclassification of fair value 
gains and losses to profit or loss following the 
derecognition of the investment.

Bank and other borrowings
The Group uses derivatives, principally interest 
rate swaps, to hedge the interest rate exposure 
inherent in a portion of its fixed interest rate 
debt. In such cases the Group will either 
designate the debt as FVPL when certain 
criteria are met or as the hedged item under 
a fair value hedge.

continued

If the debt instrument is designated as FVPL, 
the debt is initially measured at fair value (with 
direct transaction costs being included in profit 
as an expense) and is remeasured to fair value 
at each reporting date with changes in carrying 
value being recognised in profit (along with 
changes in the fair value of the related 
derivative), with the exception of changes in 
the fair value of the debt instrument relating to 
own credit risk which are recorded in Other 
comprehensive income in accordance with 
IFRS 9. Such a designation has been made 
where this significantly reduces an accounting 
mismatch which would result from recognising 
gains and losses on different bases.

Cash collateral pledged to counterparties is 
recognised as a financial asset and is included 
in current Other investments within the 
Consolidated Statement of Financial Position. 
Cash collateral received is included in 
Movement in short-term borrowings within 
financing activities in the Consolidated Cash 
Flow Statement. Cash collateral paid is included 
in Movements in short-term investments within 
investing activities in the Consolidated Cash 
Flow Statement. The cash flow presentation of 
cash paid and received follows the Consolidated 
Statement of Financial Position presentation 
of the financial asset and financial liability that 
is recognised from posting the collateral.

If the debt is designated as the hedged item 
under a fair value hedge, the debt is initially 
measured at fair value (with direct transaction 
costs being amortised over the life of the debt) 
and is remeasured for fair value changes in 
respect of the hedged risk at each reporting 
date with changes in carrying value being 
recognised in profit (along with changes in the 
fair value of the related derivative).

Foreign currencies
Foreign currency transactions, being 
transactions denominated in a currency other 
than an individual Group entity’s functional 
currency, are translated into the relevant 
functional currencies of individual Group 
entities at average rates for the relevant 
monthly accounting periods, which 
approximate to actual rates.

If the debt is designated in a cash flow hedge, 
the debt is measured at amortised cost 
(with gains or losses taken to profit and direct 
transaction costs being amortised over the 
life of the debt). The related derivative is 
remeasured for fair value changes at each 
reporting date with the portion of the gain 
or loss on the derivative that is determined to 
be an effective hedge recognised in Other 
comprehensive income. The amounts that have 
been recognised in Other comprehensive 
income are reclassified to profit in the same 
period that the hedged forecast cash flows 
affect profit. The reclassification adjustment is 
included in Finance expense in the Consolidated 
Statement of Comprehensive Income.

Other interest-bearing loans are initially 
measured at fair value (with direct transaction 
costs being amortised over the life of the loan) 
and are subsequently measured at amortised 
cost using the effective interest method at each 
reporting date. Changes in carrying value are 
recognised in the Consolidated Statement of 
Comprehensive Income.

Derivatives
Derivatives are initially measured at fair value 
(with direct transaction costs being included 
in profit as an expense) and are subsequently 
remeasured to fair value at each reporting 
date. Changes in carrying value of derivatives 
not designated in hedging relationships are 
recognised in profit or loss. 

The Group has agreements with some bank 
counterparties whereby the parties agree to 
post cash collateral, for the benefit of the other, 
equivalent to the market valuation of all of the 
derivative positions above a predetermined 
threshold. Cash collateral received from 
counterparties is included within current 
Interest-bearing loans and borrowings within the 
Consolidated Statement of Financial Position. 

158

Monetary assets and liabilities arising from 
foreign currency transactions are retranslated 
at exchange rates prevailing at the reporting 
date. Exchange gains and losses on loans and 
on short-term foreign currency borrowings 
and deposits are included within Finance 
expense. Exchange differences on all other 
foreign currency transactions are recognised 
in Operating profit in the individual Group 
entity’s accounting records.

Non-monetary items arising from foreign 
currency transactions are not retranslated in the 
individual Group entity’s accounting records.

In the Consolidated Financial Statements, 
income and expense items for Group entities 
with a functional currency other than US 
dollars are translated into US dollars at 
average exchange rates, which approximate 
to actual rates, for the relevant accounting 
periods. Assets and liabilities are translated at 
the US dollar exchange rates prevailing at the 
reporting date. Exchange differences arising 
on consolidation are recognised in Other 
comprehensive income.

If certain criteria are met, non-US dollar-
denominated loans or derivatives are 
designated as net investment hedges of foreign 
operations. Exchange differences arising on 
retranslation of net investments, and of foreign 
currency loans which are designated in an 
effective net investment hedge relationship, are 
recognised in Other comprehensive income in 
the Consolidated Financial Statements. Foreign 
exchange derivatives hedging net investments 
in foreign operations are carried at fair value. 
Effective fair value movements are recognised 
in Other comprehensive income, with any 
ineffectiveness taken to profit. Gains and 
losses accumulated in the translation reserve 
will be recycled to profit and loss when the 
foreign operation is sold.

Provisions
Provisions are recognised when there is either 
a legal or constructive present obligation as a 
result of a past event, it is probable that an 
outflow of economic resources will be required 
to settle the obligation and a reliable estimate 
can be made of the amount of the obligation. 
If the effect of the time value of money is 
material, provisions are discounted at the 
relevant pre-tax discount rate. Where provisions 
are discounted, the increase in the provision 
resulting from the passage of time is recognised 
as a finance cost.

Litigation and environmental liabilities
AstraZeneca is involved in legal disputes, the 
settlement of which may involve cost to the 
Group. A provision is made where an adverse 
outcome is probable and associated costs, 
including related legal costs, can be estimated 
reliably. Determining the timing of recognition 
of when an adverse outcome is probable is 
considered a key judgement, refer to Note 30 
to the Financial Statements from page 204.

Where it is considered that the Group is more 
likely than not to prevail, or in the extremely 
rare circumstances where the amount of the 
legal liability cannot be estimated reliably, 
legal costs involved in defending the claim are 
charged to the Consolidated Statement of 
Comprehensive Income as they are incurred.

Where it is considered that the Group has a 
valid contract which provides the right to 
reimbursement (from insurance or otherwise) 
of legal costs and/or all or part of any loss 
incurred or for which a provision has been 
established, the amount expected to be 
received is recognised as an asset only when 
it is virtually certain.

AstraZeneca is exposed to environmental 
liabilities relating to its past operations, 
principally in respect of soil and groundwater 
remediation costs. Provisions for these costs 
are made when there is a present obligation 
and where it is probable that expenditure on 
remedial work will be required and a reliable 
estimate can be made of the cost.

Restructuring
Restructuring costs are incurred in programmes 
that are planned and controlled by the Group 
which materially change either the scope of a 
business undertaken by the Group, or the 
manner in which that business is conducted.

A provision for restructuring costs is recognised 
when a detailed formal plan is in place and 
has either been announced to those affected 
or has started to be implemented. The general 
recognition criteria for provisions must also be 
met, as described in the Provisions policy.

AstraZeneca Annual Report & Form 20-F Information 2023Financial StatementsImpairment
The carrying values of non-financial assets, 
other than Inventories and Deferred tax assets, 
are reviewed at least annually to determine 
whether there is any indication of impairment. 
For Goodwill, Intangible assets under 
development and for any other assets where 
such indication exists, the asset’s recoverable 
amount is estimated based on the greater of 
its value in use and its fair value less cost to 
sell. In assessing the recoverable amount, the 
estimated future cash flows, adjusted for the 
risks associated with the probability of success 
specific to each asset, as well as inflationary 
impacts, are discounted to their present value 
using a nominal discount rate that reflects 
current market assessments of the time 
value of money, the general risks affecting 
the pharmaceutical industry and other risks 
specific to each asset. For the purpose of 
impairment testing, assets are grouped 
together into the smallest group of assets 
that generates cash inflows from continuing 
use that are largely independent of the cash 
flows of other assets. Impairment losses are 
recognised immediately in the Consolidated 
Statement of Comprehensive Income.

Applicable accounting standards 
and interpretations issued but not 
yet adopted
At the date of authorisation of these financial 
statements, certain new accounting standards 
and amendments were in issue relating to the 
following standards and interpretations but 
not yet adopted by the Group: 

>  amendments to IAS 1 ‘Presentation of 

Financial Statements’, effective for periods 
beginning on or after 1 January 2024 – 
endorsed by the UK Endorsement Board 
(UKEB) on 21 July 2023

>  amendments to IFRS 16 ‘Leases’, effective 
for periods beginning on or after 1 January 
2024 – endorsed by the UKEB on 
11 May 2023

>  amendments to IAS 7 ‘Statement of Cash 
Flows’ and IFRS 7 ‘Financial Instruments: 
Disclosures’, effective for periods beginning 
on or after 1 January 2024 – endorsed by 
the UKEB on 28 November 2023

>  amendments to IAS 21 ‘The Effects of 
Changes in Foreign Exchange Rates’, 
effective for periods beginning on or 
after 1 January 2025 – not endorsed by 
the UKEB.

These new standards, amendments and 
interpretations are not expected to have a 
significant impact on the Group’s net results.

 Rebates and chargebacks in the US 

The major market where estimates are seen as significant is the US. When invoicing Product Sales in the US, we estimate the rebates and chargebacks 
we expect to pay and we consider there to be a significant estimate associated with the rebates for Managed Care, Medicaid and Medicare Part D. 
The total adjustment in respect of prior year net US Product Sales revenue in 2023 was 1.0% (2022: 1.3%; 2021: 1.5%); this represents the difference 
between our prior year estimates for rebates and chargebacks against actual amounts paid for the US business. The most significant of these relate 
to the Medicaid and state programmes with an adjustment in respect of prior year net US Product Sales revenue in 2023 of 0.3% (2022: 0.5%; 
2021: 0.4%) and Managed Care and Medicare of 0.5% (2022: 0.8%; 2021: 0.7%).

The adjustment in respect of the prior year net US Product Sales revenue, excluding the Rare Disease therapy area in 2023, was 1.4% (2022: 1.6%; 
2021: 1.8%), with Medicaid and state programmes of 0.4% (2022: 0.6%; 2021: 0.5%) and Managed Care and Medicare of 0.7% (2022: 1.1%; 2021: 0.8%).

These values demonstrate the level of sensitivity; further meaningful sensitivity is not able to be provided due to the large volume of variables that 
contribute to the overall rebates, chargebacks, returns and other revenue accruals. These variables include assumptions in respect of aggregate 
future sales levels, segment mix and customers’ contractual performance, and in addition for Managed Care, US Medicaid and Medicare Part D, the 
channel inventory levels, and assumptions related to lag time. These assumptions are built up on a product-by-product and customer-by-customer 
basis, taking into account specific contract provisions coupled with expected performance, and are then aggregated into a weighted average rebate 
accrual rate for each of our products. Accrual rates are reviewed and adjusted on an as-needed basis. There may be further adjustments when 
actual rebates are invoiced based on utilisation information submitted to AstraZeneca (in the case of contractual rebates) and claims/invoices are 
received (in the case of regulatory rebates and chargebacks).

2 Operating profit
Operating profit includes the following significant items:

Cost of sales
In 2023, Cost of sales includes a charge of $114m (2022: charge of $3,484m) in relation to the release, in line with sales, of fair value uplift to inventory 
that was recognised under IFRS 3 ‘Business Combinations’ upon the acquisition of Alexion (see Note 27).

During the year, $nil government grants were recognised within Cost of sales (2022: $nil; 2021: $290m). The grants recognised in 2021 related to 
funding of manufactured Vaxzevria product for the US government, which expired prior to being accepted by the FDA. 

Selling, general and administrative expense
In 2023, Selling, general and administrative expense includes a charge of $520m (2022: charge of $182m; 2021: charge of $42m) resulting from changes 
in the fair value of contingent consideration arising from the acquisition of the diabetes alliance from BMS. These adjustments reflect revised 
estimates for future sales performance for the products acquired and, as a result, revised estimates for future royalties payable.

In 2023, Selling, general and administrative expense also includes a charge of $1,013m (2022: charge of $789m; 2021: charge of $48m) relating to 
a number of legal proceedings, including settlements in various jurisdictions in relation to several marketed products (see Note 30).

Research and development expense: Government grants
During the year $74m (2022: $113m; 2021: $531m) of government grants were recognised within Research and development expense. The grants 
recognised relate to funding for Research and development and related expenses for COVID-19 mAbs of $nil (2022: $112m; 2021: $222m) and 
Vaxzevria of $74m (2022: $1m; 2021: $309m).

Gains on disposal of intangible assets in 2023 includes $241m on disposal of commercial rights to Pulmicort Flexhaler to Cheplapharm in the US.

Gains on disposal of intangible assets in 2021 includes $317m on disposal of rights to Crestor in over 30 countries in Europe, except in the UK 
and Spain.

Net gains/(losses) on disposal of other non-current assets in 2022 includes a $125m gain in respect of the Waltham R&D site sale and leaseback 
in MA, US (see Note 8).

Gains on disposal of investments in associates and joint ventures in 2021 relates to the disposal of the 26.7% ownership in Viela Bio, as part of the 
acquisition of Viela Bio by Horizon Therapeutics plc. AstraZeneca received cash proceeds and profit of $776m upon closing, with the profit recorded 
as Other operating income.

As part of the total consideration received in respect of the agreement to sell US rights to Synagis in 2019, $400m in total has been received related 
to the rights to participate in the future cash flows from the US profits or losses for Beyfortus (nirsevimab), with $190m cash inflows in 2023 primarily 
relating to a cash receipt from Sobi following achievement of a regulatory milestone. At 31 December 2022, the full amount of $522m was recognised 
as a financial liability within non-current Other payables (the Profit Participation Liability) as the Group had not fully transferred the risks and rewards 
of the underlying cash flows arising from Beyfortus to Sobi. All associated cash flows have been presented within investing activities as the Group 
has received the cash in exchange for agreeing to transfer future cash flows relating to an intangible asset. In 2023, the contractual relationship 
between AstraZeneca and Sobi relating to future sales of Beyfortus in the US was replaced by a royalty relationship between Sanofi and Sobi. 
As a result, the Profit Participation Liability was extinguished and derecognised from the Consolidated Statement of Financial Position, with a gain 
of $712m recorded in Other operating income and expense. In 2021, as a result of the Probability of Technical/Regulatory Success unwind, an 
increase of $114m to the Profit Participation Liability was recorded with the cost recorded in Other operating expense.

Restructuring costs
During 2023, the Group has incurred $467m of net restructuring costs, of which $362m resulted from activities that are part of the Post Alexion 
Acquisition Group Review (PAAGR), bringing the cumulative charges under this programme to $2,067m. Costs in 2023 included $109m within Cost 
of sales due to the rationalisation of our manufacturing capacity and footprint across certain production sites, $207m within Selling, general and 
administrative expense in relation to HR, Finance, IT & other integration costs as well as some severance costs, $212m within Research and 
development expense in relation to the transformation of clinical, regulatory and other R&D data and systems, partially offset by income of $61m 
in Other operating income and expense generated from the disposal of assets impacted by the restructuring.

In conjunction with the acquisition of Alexion in 2021, the enlarged Group initiated the PAAGR; a global restructuring programme aimed at integrating 
systems, structure and processes, optimising the global footprint and prioritising resource allocations and investments. During 2023, the Group has 
identified all remaining activities and finalised the scope of the programme. This includes the commencement of work on the planned upgrade of 
the Group’s Enterprise Resource Planning IT systems (Axial Project), which is expected to be substantially complete by the end of 2030. The Group 
has also continued to progress other legacy restructuring programmes.

Total restructuring costs in 2023 includes an impairment charge to Property, plant and equipment of $7m (2022: reversal of $4m; 2021: charge of 
$343m), impairment of Right-of-use assets of $13m (2022: $nil; 2021: $nil) and no impairment of Intangible assets (software development costs) 
(2022: reversal $17m; 2021: charge of $16m).

The tables below show the costs that have been charged in respect of restructuring programmes by cost category and type. Severance provisions 
are detailed in Note 21.

The reported tax rate in the year was 14% and included a favourable adjustment of $828m to deferred taxes arising from a UK group company 
undertaking a routine intragroup purchase of certain intellectual property. This intragroup purchase resulted in additional amortisable tax basis in 
the UK which can be fully utilised against forecast UK taxable profits. Deferred tax has been recognised on this additional tax basis in the year. 
This is offset by updates to tax liabilities following progress of reviews by tax authorities and administrative appeal processes and derecognition 
of deferred tax assets following changes to forecast taxable income of specific subsidiaries.

The income tax paid for the year was $2,366m.

Taxation has been provided at current rates on the profits earned for the years covered by the Group Financial Statements. The 2023 prior year 
current tax adjustment relates mainly to tax accrual to tax return adjustments and updates to provisions for tax contingencies. The 2022 prior 
year current tax adjustment relates mainly to tax accrual to tax return adjustments and updates to provisions for tax contingencies. The 2021 
prior year current tax adjustment relates mainly to tax accrual to tax return adjustments. 

The 2023 prior year deferred tax adjustment relates mainly to tax accrual to tax return adjustments and adjustments to the recognition of deferred 
tax assets. The 2022 prior year deferred tax adjustments relate mainly to tax accrual to tax return adjustments and updates to provisions for tax 
contingencies. The 2021 prior year deferred tax adjustments relate mainly to tax accrual to tax return adjustments and updates to estimates of 
prior year tax liabilities following settlements with tax authorities.

To the extent that dividends remitted from overseas subsidiaries, joint ventures and associates are expected to result in additional taxes, appropriate 
amounts have been provided for. Unremitted earnings or differences in the carrying value and tax basis of investments may be liable to additional 
taxes if distributed as dividends or on a liquidation event. Deferred tax is provided for such differences in relation to Group entities where management 
is intending to remit earnings in the foreseeable future. The aggregate amount of gross temporary differences associated with investments in 
subsidiaries, partnerships and branches for which deferred tax liabilities have not been recognised totalled approximately $7,565m at 31 December 
2023, $3,221m of which has a corresponding deductible temporary difference of the same gross value which is not recognised as it is not probable 
of reversing in the foreseeable future but on which different tax rates apply.

Factors affecting future tax charges
As a group with worldwide operations, AstraZeneca is subject to several factors that may affect future tax charges, principally the levels and mix 
of profitability in different jurisdictions, transfer pricing regulations, tax rates imposed and tax regime reforms. On 11 July 2023, Finance (No.2) 
Act 2023 was enacted in the UK, introducing a global minimum effective tax rate of 15%. The legislation implements a domestic top-up tax and a 
multinational top-up tax, effective for accounting periods starting on or after 31 December 2023. A Pillar 2 Effective Tax Rate (ETR) is calculated 
for every jurisdiction in which the Group operates and Pillar 2 Income Taxes will arise when the Pillar 2 ETR is less than 15%. Pillar 2 Income Taxes 
could be payable in the UK, or the local jurisdiction if it has introduced a Qualifying Domestic Minimum top-up Tax. AstraZeneca is continuing to 
monitor potential impacts as further guidance is published by the OECD and territories implement legislation to enact the rules. Management has 
performed an assessment of the impact of the UK’s Pillar 2 rules based on our 2023 data and no Pillar 2 Income Taxes are expected to arise for 
most jurisdictions in which the Group operates. It is anticipated that AstraZeneca may, in some jurisdictions, incur additional tax liabilities, but the 
effect on the reported tax charge is reasonably estimated to be immaterial.

The Group has applied the exemption under the IAS 12 ‘Income Taxes’ amendment for recognising and disclosing information about deferred tax 
assets and liabilities related to top-up income taxes.

Tax reconciliation to UK statutory rate
The table below reconciles the UK statutory tax charge to the Group’s total tax charge/(credit):

an	internal	reorganisation	to	integrate	the	Alexion	organisation	which	took	place	in	2022	and	a	credit	of	$65m	relating	to	the	reduction	of	tax	liabilities	arising	from	adjustments	on	expiry	of	
the	relevant	statute	of	limitations.	Other	items	in	2021	relate	to	a	net	credit	of	$299m	relating	to	the	reduction	of	tax	liabilities	arising	from	updates	to	estimates	of	prior	year	tax	liabilities	
following	settlements	with	tax	authorities	and	on	expiry	of	the	relevant	statute	of	limitations	partially	offset	by	a	provision	for	transfer	pricing	and	other	contingencies.

AstraZeneca is domiciled in the UK but operates in other countries where the tax rates and laws are different to those in the UK. The impact on 
differences in effective overseas tax rates on the Group’s overall tax charge is noted above. Profits arising from our manufacturing operation in 
Puerto Rico are granted special status and are taxed at a reduced rate compared with the normal rate of tax in that territory under a tax incentive 
grant continuing until 2031. The Group receives intellectual property incentives in certain jurisdictions, resulting in a reduction to the tax charge in 
the income statement of $367m in 2023.

Includes	deferred	tax	assets	of	$507m	on	liabilities	in	respect	of	intangibles	and	$188m	on	lease	liabilities	in	respect	of	right-of-use	assets.

1	
2	 Untaxed	reserves	relate	to	taxable	profits	where	the	tax	liability	is	deferred	to	later	periods.
3	 The	deferred	tax	liability	of	$4,174m	relates	to	deferred	tax	on	purchase	accounting	adjustments	arising	from	the	acquisition	of	Alexion	(Note	27).	Accrued	expenses	includes	the	deferred	

tax	on	the	purchase	accounting	of	inventory.	

4	 The	Income	statement	movement	in	2023	includes	$828m	arising	from	a	UK	company	undertaking	an	intragroup	purchase	of	certain	intellectual	property	(see	page	164	for	further	details).	
The	Income	statement	movement	in	2022	includes	the	aforementioned	net	adjustment	to	deferred	taxes	of	$876m	arising	on	the	internal	legal	entity	reorganisation	to	integrate	the	Alexion	
organisation,	the	majority	of	which	arises	on	Intangibles,	Property,	plant	and	equipment.

5	 The	Group	recognises	deferred	tax	assets	to	the	extent	that	there	are	either	taxable	temporary	differences	or	that	it	is	probable	that	sufficient	future	taxable	profits	will	arise,	against	which	
these	deductible	temporary	differences	can	be	utilised.	The	US	includes	a	net	deferred	tax	asset	of	$142m	and	the	UK	includes	a	net	deferred	tax	asset	of	$1,723m	as	at	31	December	2023	
which	includes	tax	losses	and	other	deductible	temporary	differences.	The	Group	has	performed	an	assessment	of	recovery	of	deferred	tax	assets	and	for	these	respective	entities,	the	Group	
has	forecasted	future	taxable	profits	and	considers	that	it	is	probable	that	sufficient	future	taxable	profits	will	arise	against	which	these	deductible	temporary	differences	can	be	utilised.	
In	arriving	at	these	forecasts,	the	Group	has	reviewed	the	Group-level	budgets	and	forecasts	and	the	ability	of	those	entities	to	generate	future	income	from	developing	and	commercialising	
products,	including	local	tax	laws	and	the	scheduling	of	reversal	of	deductible	temporary	differences.	Deferred	tax	assets	are	recognised	on	the	basis	there	is	sufficient	forecast	future	taxable	
profits	arising	from	the	performance	of	on-market	products	and	pipeline	assets,	including	Imfinzi.	For	the	UK,	losses	are	forecast	to	be	utilised	within	five	years.	For	the	US,	recognised	
deferred	taxes	on	losses	and	other	items	are	forecast	to	be	utilised	within	15	years.	It	is	considered	that	these	sources	of	income	are	sufficiently	predictable	or	diversified	to	support	these	
recognition	periods.	A	sensitivity	assessment	has	been	performed	which	shows	that	a	change	in	profit	of	10%	results	in	an	immaterial	adjustment	to	the	amount	of	deferred	tax	asset	
recognised.	Assessing	the	availability	of	future	taxable	income	to	support	recognition	of	deferred	tax	assets	relies	upon	our	Group	forecasts	and	changes	in	these	Group	forecasts	will	
impact	the	recoverability	of	deferred	tax	assets.	To	the	extent	that	there	are	neither	taxable	temporary	differences	nor	sufficient	taxable	profits,	no	deferred	tax	asset	is	recognised	and	
details	of	unrecognised	deferred	tax	assets	are	included	in	the	table	below.

The earnings figures used in the calculations above are post-tax. The weighted average number of Ordinary Shares in issue is calculated by taking 
the number of Ordinary Shares outstanding each day weighted by the number of days that those shares were outstanding.

6 Segment information
The Group has reviewed its assessment of reportable segments under IFRS 8 ‘Operating Segments’ and concluded that the Group continues to 
have one reportable segment.

 This determination is considered to be a Key Judgement and this judgement has been taken with reference to the following factors:

1 The level of integration across the different functions of the Group’s pharmaceutical business:
AstraZeneca is engaged in a single business activity of pharmaceuticals and the Group does not have multiple operating segments. AstraZeneca’s 
pharmaceuticals business consists of the discovery and development of new products, which are then manufactured, marketed and sold. All 
of these functional activities take place (and are managed) globally on a highly integrated basis. These individual functional areas are not 
managed separately.

2 The identification of the Chief Operating Decision Maker (CODM) and the nature and extent of the financial information reviewed by the CODM:
The SET, established and chaired by the CEO, is the vehicle through which the CEO exercises the authority delegated to him from the Board for 
the management, development and performance of AstraZeneca as a whole. It is considered that the SET is AstraZeneca’s Chief Operating Decision 
Making body (as defined by IFRS 8). The operation of the SET is principally driven by the management of the Commercial operations, R&D, 
manufacturing and supply and enabling functions. All significant operating decisions are undertaken by the SET. While members of the SET have 
responsibility for implementation of decisions in their respective areas, operating decision making is at SET level as a whole. Where necessary, 
these are implemented through cross-functional sub-committees that consider the Group-wide impact of a new decision. For example, product 
launch decisions would be initially considered by the SET and, on approval, passed to an appropriate sub team for implementation. The ability 
of the enterprise to develop, produce, deliver and commercialise a wide range of pharmaceutical products are central to the SET decision-
making process. 

In assessing performance, the SET reviews financial information on an integrated basis for the Group as a whole, substantially in the form of, and 
on the same basis as, the Group’s IFRS Financial Statements. The high upfront cost of discovering and developing new products, coupled with 
the relatively insignificant and stable unit cost of production, means that there is not the clear link that exists in many manufacturing businesses 
between the revenue generated on an individual product sale and the associated cost and hence margin generated on a product. Consequently, 
the profitability of individual drugs or classes of drugs is not considered a key measure of performance for the business and is not monitored by 
the SET. The focus of additional financial information reviewed is at brand sales and Gross Margin level within specific geographies. Expenditure 
analysis is completed for the science units, operations and enabling functions; there is no allocation of these centrally managed Group costs to 
the individual product or brands. The bonus of SET members’ continues to be derived from the Group scorecard outcome as discussed in our 
Directors’ Remuneration Report.

3 How resources are allocated:
Resources are allocated on a Group-wide basis according to need. In particular, capital expenditure, in-licensing, and R&D resources are allocated 
between activities on merit, based on overall therapeutic considerations and strategy under the aegis of the Group’s Early-Stage Product 
Committees and Late-Stage Product Committees.

Product Sales are recognised when control of the goods has been transferred to a third party. A significant proportion of this is upon delivery of 
the products to wholesalers. One wholesaler (2022: one; 2021: one) individually represented greater than 10% of Product Sales. The value of Product 
Sales to this wholesaler was $6,513m (2022: $5,387m; 2021: $4,862m).

Impairment charges in 2021 totalling $343m were recognised for Plant and equipment and Assets in course of construction due to the rationalisation 
of our manufacturing capacity and footprint across certain production sites as a result of restructuring programmes, including the PAAGR (see 
Note 2). These charges were recognised in Cost of sales. The revised carrying value of the impacted assets is $nil, under fair value less costs to sell.

The interest expense on lease liabilities included within Finance expense was $33m (2022: $24m; 2021: $22m). 

The total cash outflow for leases in 2023 was $301m (2022: $268m; 2021: $262m).

The Group has entered into lease contracts that have not yet commenced. The nominal value of estimated future lease payments under these lease 
contracts approximates $1,615m as of 31 December 2023. Of this value, $1,348m relates to a property lease in the US which is expected to commence 
in 2026 with a lease term of 15 years.

In 2022 the Group entered into a sale and leaseback agreement in relation to the Waltham R&D site in MA, US. Prior to the sale, the carrying value 
of the Property, plant and equipment was $124m. Cash proceeds of $265m were received, recorded within Disposal of property, plant and equipment 
within the Consolidated Statement of Cash Flows, and a gain on disposal of $125m was recorded within Other operating income and expense 
within the Consolidated Statement of Comprehensive Income. A lease liability and a corresponding right-of-use asset were recorded of $28m and 
$13m, respectively.

Goodwill is tested for impairment at the operating segment level, this being the level at which goodwill is monitored for internal management purposes. 
As detailed in Note 6, the Group does not have multiple operating segments and is engaged in a single business activity of pharmaceuticals.

Recoverable amount is determined on a fair value less costs to sell basis using the market value of the Company’s outstanding Ordinary Shares. 
Our market capitalisation is compared to the book value of the Group’s net assets and this indicates a significant surplus at 31 December 2023 
(and 31 December 2022 and 31 December 2021). No goodwill impairment was identified.

Impairment charges and reversals
We perform a rigorous impairment trigger assessment for all our intangible assets. Intangible assets under development and not available for use 
are tested annually for impairment and other intangible assets are tested when there is an indication of impairment loss or reversal. Where testing 
is required, the recoverable amount of the assets is estimated in order to determine the extent of the impairment loss or reversal. Where it is not 
possible to estimate the recoverable amount of an individual asset, the Group estimates the recoverable amount of the Cash Generating Unit (CGU) 
to which it belongs. The Group considers that as the intangible assets are linked to individual products and that product cash flows are considered 
to be largely independent of other product cash flows, the CGU for intangibles is at the product level. Group-level budgets and forecasts include 
forecast capital investment and operational impacts related to sustainability projects, as well as inflationary impacts, and form the basis for the 
value in use models used for impairment testing.

An asset’s recoverable amount is determined as the higher of an asset’s or CGU’s fair value less costs to sell or value in use, in both cases using 
discounted cash flow calculations where the asset’s expected post-tax cash flows are risk-adjusted over their estimated remaining period of 
expected economic benefit. Where the value in use approach is used, the post-tax risk-adjusted cash flows are discounted using AstraZeneca’s 
post-tax weighted average cost of capital (7.5% for 2023, 7% for 2022 and 2021) which is a nominal rate. There is no material difference in the 
approach taken to using pre-tax cash flows and a pre-tax rate compared to post-tax cash flows and a post-tax rate, as required by IAS 36. Where 
fair value less costs to sell is used to determine recoverable value, the discount rate is assessed with reference to a market participant; this is not 
usually materially different to the AstraZeneca post-tax weighted average cost of capital of 7.5%. Intangible assets have been tested for impairment 
under the value in use basis at risk-adjusted post-tax discount rates ranging between 7.5% to 9.5%.

Notes to the Group Financial Statements

10 Intangible assets continued

 Key assumptions and significant estimates used in calculating the recoverable amounts are highly sensitive and specific to the nature of the 

Group’s activities including:

>  outcome of R&D activities
>  probability of technical and regulatory success
>  market volume, share and pricing (to derive peak year sales)
>  amount and timing of projected future cash flows
>  sales erosion curves following patent expiry.

Whilst the intangible assets portfolio is generally exposed to significant impairment risk within the next financial year, no sensitivities have been 
disclosed since no specific asset has been identified as having a significant risk of a material impairment arising from reasonably possible changes 
in key assumptions.

For assets held at fair value less costs to sell, we make appropriate adjustments to reflect market participant assessments.

In 2023, the Group recorded impairment charges of $17m in respect of launched products. Impairment charges recorded against products in 
development totalled $417m, including $244m related to ALXN1840 which was fully impaired following the decision to discontinue development.

In 2022, the Group recorded impairment charges of $146m in respect of launched products. Impairment charges recorded against products in 
development totalled $172m due to decisions made to terminate the related activities.

In 2021, the Group recorded impairment charges of $603m in respect of launched products, including Bydureon ($469m, revised carrying amount 
of $50m) under value in use model, roxadustat ($121m, revised carrying amount of $215m) under value in use model and other launched products 
totalling $13m. 

Impairment charges recorded against products in development in 2021, based on fair value less costs to sell, totalled $1,464m, principally Ardea 
($1,172m) which was fully impaired following the decision to discontinue development of verinurad. The remaining impairments relate to full 
impairments of various products in development, due to either management’s decision to discontinue development as part of a Group-wide 
portfolio prioritisation review, or due to the outcome of research activities.

The Group has performed an assessment on assets which have had impairments recorded in previous periods to determine if any reversals of 
impairments were required. No impairment reversals were recorded in 2023. Impairment reversals of $94m were recorded in 2022, including $77m 
in respect of products in development. No impairment reversals were recorded in 2021. 

When launched products are partially impaired, the carrying values of these assets in future periods are particularly sensitive to changes in forecast 
assumptions, including those assumptions set out above, as the asset is impaired down to its recoverable amount.

The intangible asset baxdrostat recognised on acquisition of CinCor Pharma, Inc. in 2023 was assessed under the optional concentration test 
in IFRS 3 and was determined to be an asset acquisition, as substantially all of the value of the gross assets acquired was concentrated in this 
single asset.

The acquisition of Pfizer’s pre-clinical rare disease gene therapy portfolio in 2023 was assessed under IFRS 3 and the transaction was treated as 
an asset acquisition.

On 1 November 2023, AstraZeneca entered into an agreement with Cellectis, a clinical-stage biotechnology company, to accelerate the development 
of next generation therapeutics in areas of high unmet medical need, including oncology, immunology and rare diseases. Under the terms of the 
agreement, AstraZeneca contributed $80m in funds and holds a 22% interest in the associate entity.

On 29 January 2021, AstraZeneca entered into an agreement with IHP Holdings Limited to create and run an online platform (iHospital) offering 
consultations with physicians, repeat prescriptions and e-pharmacy in China. The agreement resulted in the formation of a new entity, IHP HK 27 
Holdings Limited. AstraZeneca contributed $30m in initial funds and holds a 50% interest in the associate entity. 

On 1 December 2020, AstraZeneca and China International Capital Corporation (CICC) entered into an agreement to set up a Global Healthcare 
Industrial Fund to drive healthcare system innovation by leveraging local capital and accelerating China-related innovation incubation. The agreement 
resulted in the formation of a new entity, Wuxi AstraZeneca-CICC Venture Capital Partnership (Limited Partnership). AstraZeneca holds a 22% 
interest in the associate entity and contributed $1m in initial funds in 2020, with contributions of $45m and $21m made in 2021 and 2022 respectively. 

On 23 September 2021, AstraZeneca entered into an agreement with VaxEquity Limited to collaborate and develop self-amplifying RNA technology 
with the aim of generating treatments for target diseases. AstraZeneca contributed $14m in initial funds and holds a 40% interest in the associate entity. 

On 23 February 2018, AstraZeneca entered into an agreement with a consortium of investors to form a new, US-domiciled standalone company 
called Viela Bio. In February 2021, AstraZeneca agreed to divest its 26.7% ownership in Viela Bio, as part of the acquisition of Viela by Horizon 
Therapeutics plc. AstraZeneca received cash proceeds and profit of $776m upon closing with the profit recorded as Other operating income. In 2021, 
prior to divestment, the Group provided transitional research and development services to Viela Bio, comprising $1m of passed-through third-party 
costs incurred by the Group on behalf of Viela Bio. 

On 27 November 2017, AstraZeneca entered into a joint venture agreement with Chinese Future Industry Investment Fund (FIIF), to discover, develop 
and commercialise potential new medicines to help address unmet medical needs globally, and to bring innovative new medicines to patients in 
China more quickly. The agreement resulted in the formation of a joint venture entity based in China, Dizal (Jiangsu) Pharmaceutical Co., Limited 
(Dizal). Since its establishment, AstraZeneca has contributed $80m in cash to the joint venture entity and has a 27% interest in the joint venture. 

On 1 December 2015, AstraZeneca entered into a joint venture agreement with Fujifilm Kyowa Kirin Biologics Co., Ltd. to develop a biosimilar using 
the combined capabilities of the two parties. The agreement resulted in the formation of a joint venture entity based in the UK, Centus Biotherapeutics 
Limited (Centus). Since its establishment, AstraZeneca has contributed $135m in cash to the joint venture entity and has a 50% interest in the joint 
venture. On 26 April 2023, Centus entered a voluntary liquidation process.

All investments are accounted for using the equity method. At 31 December 2023, unrecognised losses in associates and joint ventures totalled 
$140m (2022: $92m; 2021: $73m) which have not been recognised due to the investment carrying value reaching $nil value.

Joint contractual arrangements were entered into between AstraZeneca and Daiichi Sankyo Company Limited (Daiichi Sankyo); in March 2019 for 
the co-development and co-commercialisation of Enhertu and in July 2020 for the co-development and co-commercialisation of Dato-DXd. Each 
party shares global pre-tax net income from the collaboration on a 50:50 basis (with the exception of Japan where Daiichi Sankyo maintains exclusive 
rights and AstraZeneca receives a royalty). The joint operation is not structured through a separate legal entity, and it operates from AstraZeneca 
and Daiichi Sankyo’s respective principal places of business.

Other investments held at FVOCI include equity securities which are not held for trading and which the Group has irrevocably elected at initial 
recognition to recognise in this category. Other investments held at FVPL mainly comprise fixed income securities that the Group holds to sell.

The fair value of listed investments is based on year end quoted market prices. Fixed deposits and Cash collateral pledged to counterparties are 
held at amortised cost with carrying value being a reasonable approximation of fair value given their short-term nature.

Cash collateral pledged to counterparties relates to collateral pledged on derivatives entered into to hedge the Group’s risk exposures. In 2022, 
following significant foreign currency volatility increasing the collateral requirements, the Group revised its presentation to ‘Other investments’. 
In 2021 amounts of $47m are presented within Cash and cash equivalents.

Fair value hierarchy
The table below analyses equity securities and bonds, contained within Other investments and carried at fair value, by valuation method. The different 
levels have been defined as follows:

>  Level 1: quoted prices (unadjusted) in active markets for identical assets or liabilities 
>  Level 2: inputs other than quoted prices included within Level 1 that are observable for the asset or liability, either directly (i.e. as prices) 

or indirectly (i.e. derived from prices) 

>  Level 3: inputs for the asset or liability that are not based on observable market data (unobservable inputs).

Assets are transferred in or out of each Level on the date of the event or change in circumstances that caused the transfer.

Equity securities that are analysed at Level 3 include investments in private biotech companies. In the absence of specific market data, these unlisted 
investments are held at fair value based on the cost of investment and adjusting as necessary for impairments and revaluations on new funding 
rounds, which approximates to fair value. Movements in Level 3 investments are detailed below:

All derivatives are held at fair value and fall within Level 2 of the fair value hierarchy as defined in Note 12, except for an equity warrant which falls 
within Level 3 (valued at $12m (2022: $19m; 2021: $15m), held within Non-current assets). None of the derivatives have been reclassified in the year.

The fair value of interest rate swaps and cross currency swaps is estimated using appropriate zero coupon curve valuation techniques to discount 
future contractual cash flows based on rates at the current year end.

The fair value of forward foreign exchange contracts and currency options are estimated by cash flow accounting models using appropriate yield 
curves based on market forward foreign exchange rates at the year end. The majority of forward foreign exchange contracts for existing transactions 
had maturities of less than one month from year end.

The interest rates used to discount future cash flows for fair value adjustments, where applicable, are based on market swap curves at the reporting 
date, and were as follows:

Inventory write-downs in the year amounted to $574m (2022: $479m; 2021: $552m), principally arising from the reassessment of usage or demand 
expectations prior to inventory expiration.

AstraZeneca invests in constant net asset value funds, low-volatility net asset value funds and short-term variable net asset value funds with same day 
access for subscription and redemption. These investments fail the ‘solely payments of principal and interest’ test criteria under IFRS 9. They are 
therefore measured at FVPL, although the fair value is materially the same as amortised cost.

The fair value of fixed-rate publicly traded debt is based on year end quoted market prices; the fair value of floating rate debt is nominal value, as 
mark-to-market differences would be minimal given the frequency of resets. The carrying value of loans designated at FVPL is the fair value; this falls 
within the Level 1 valuation method as defined in Note 12. For loans designated in a fair value hedge relationship, carrying value is initially measured 
at fair value and remeasured for fair value changes in respect of the hedged risk at each reporting date. All other loans are held at amortised cost. 
Fair values, as disclosed in the table above, are all determined using the Level 1 valuation method as defined in Note 12, with the exception of 
overdrafts and lease liabilities, where fair value approximates to carrying values.

A loss of $6m was made during the year on the fair value of bonds designated as FVPL. A gain of $25m has been made on these bonds since 
designation. Under IFRS 9, the Group records the component of fair value changes relating to the component of own credit risk through Other 
comprehensive income. Changes in credit risk had no material effect on any other financial assets and liabilities recognised at fair value in the 
Group Financial Statements. The change in fair value attributable to changes in credit risk is calculated as the change in fair value not attributable 
to market risk.

The interest rates used to discount future cash flows for fair value adjustments, where applicable, are based on market swap curves at the reporting 
date, and were as follows:

Included within Rebates, chargebacks, returns and other revenue accruals are contract liabilities of $102m (2022: $87m; 2021: $99m). The revenue 
recognised in the year from opening contract liabilities is $88m, comprising $76m relating to other revenue accruals and $12m Collaboration Revenue 
contract liabilities. The major markets with Rebates, chargebacks, returns and other revenue accruals are the US where the liability at 31 December 
2023 amounted to $5,116m (2022: $3,961m; 2021: $3,172m), of which Rare Disease comprises $190m (2022: $139m; 2021: $127m), and China where 
the liability at 31 December 2023 amounted to $567m (2022: $579m; 2021: $814m).

Trade payables includes $123m (2022: $67m; 2021: $44m) due to suppliers that have signed up to a supply chain financing programme, under which 
the suppliers can elect on an invoice-by-invoice basis to receive a discounted early payment from the relationship bank rather than being paid in line 
with the agreed payment terms. If the option is taken, the Group’s liability is assigned by the supplier to be due to the relationship bank rather than 
the supplier. The value of the liability payable by the Group remains unchanged. The Group assesses the arrangement against indicators to assess 
if debts which vendors have sold to the funder under the supplier financing scheme continue to meet the definition of trade payables or should be 
classified as borrowings. At 31 December 2023, the payables met the criteria of Trade payables. The supply chain financing programme operates 
in the US, UK, Sweden, China and Germany, and as at 31 December 2023, the programme had 461 suppliers enrolled across these countries.

Vaccine contract liabilities relate to amounts received from customers, primarily government bodies, in advance of supply of product.

Deferred government grant income relates to government grants received or receivable but for which the related expenses have not been incurred.

Included within current Other payables are liabilities to Daiichi Sankyo totalling $199m (2022: $100m; 2021: $nil) resulting from the collaboration 
agreement in relation to Enhertu entered into in March 2019 and $nil (2022: $nil; 2021: $324m) in relation to Dato-DXd entered into in July 2020. 
Additionally, included within non-current Other payables are liabilities totalling $774m (2022: $1,125m; 2021: $100m) as a result of the Enhertu 
collaboration agreement and $464m (2022: $nil; 2021: $nil) as a result of the Airsupra collaboration agreement.

In November 2020, Calquence received marketing approval in the EU, which removed all remaining conditionality in respect of the Acerta Pharma 
put and call options regarding the non-controlling interest; the option was exercised in April 2021 (see Note 26). The payments will be made in similar 
annual instalments in 2022 through to 2024, with the first payment of $920m made in 2022 and the second payment of $867m made in 2023, with 
a closing liability as at 31 December 2023 of $833m (2022: $1,646m; 2021: $2,458m). Interest arising from amortising the liability is included within 
Finance expense (see Note 3). The associated cash flows are disclosed as financing activities within the Consolidated Statement of Cash Flows.

With the exception of Contingent consideration payables of $2,137m (2022: $2,222m; 2021: $2,865m) which are held at fair value within Level 3 of the 
fair value hierarchy as defined in Note 12, all other financial liabilities are held at amortised cost with carrying value being a reasonable approximation 
of fair value.

Contingent consideration arising from business combinations is fair valued using decision-tree analysis, with key inputs including the probability of 
success, consideration of potential delays and the expected levels of future revenues.

Revaluations of Contingent consideration are recognised in Selling, general and administrative expense and include an increase of $520m in 2023 
(2022: an increase of $182m; 2021: an increase of $42m) based on revised milestone probabilities, and revenue and royalty forecasts, relating to 
the acquisition of BMS’s share of the Global Diabetes Alliance. Discount unwind on the liability is included within Finance expense (see Note 3).

The discount rate used for the Contingent consideration balances range from 5% to 8%. The most significant Contingent consideration balance is 
the Global Diabetes Alliance which is discounted at 8% and is reviewed against comparable benchmarks on a regular basis.

Management has identified that reasonably possible changes in certain key assumptions, including the likelihood of achieving successful trial results, 
obtaining regulatory approval, the projected market share of the therapy area and expected pricing for launched products, may cause the calculated 
fair value of the above contingent consideration to vary materially in future years.

The contingent consideration balance relating to BMS’s share of Global Diabetes Alliance of $1,945m (2022: $2,124m; 2021: $2,544m) would increase/
decrease by $195m with an increase/decrease in sales of 10% as compared with the current estimates.

The maximum development and sales milestones payable under outstanding Contingent consideration arrangements arising on business combinations 
are as follows:

Provisions are often subject to substantial uncertainties with regard to the timing and final amounts of any payments. Once established, these amounts 
remain in Provisions even after settlement is reached and uncertainty resolved, with no transfer to Trade and other payables prior to payment. This 
is to provide more transparent disclosure of subsequent movements in brought forward and carried forward balances. Settled legal claims included 
within provisions are held at amortised cost with carrying value being a reasonable approximation of fair value.

Severance provisions arise predominantly in connection with global restructuring initiatives, including the PAAGR, which involve rationalisation of 
the global supply chain, the sales and marketing organisation, IT and business support infrastructure, and R&D. 

In conjunction with the acquisition of Alexion in 2021, the enlarged Group initiated the PAAGR; a global restructuring programme, aimed at integrating 
systems, structure and processes, optimising the global footprint and prioritising resource allocations and investments. This includes the commencement 
of work on the planned upgrade of the Group’s Enterprise Resource Planning IT systems (Axial Project). The Group has also continued to progress 
other legacy restructuring programmes.

Employee costs in connection with the initiatives are recognised in severance provisions when a detailed formal plan has been communicated to 
those employees affected. Final severance costs are often subject to the completion of the requisite consultations on the areas impacted, with the 
majority of the cost expected to be paid within one year. AstraZeneca endeavours to support employees affected by restructuring initiatives to 
seek alternative roles within the organisation. Where the employee is successful, any severance provisions will be released.

Details of the Environmental provisions totalling $112m (2022: $131m; 2021: $90m) and ongoing matters are provided in Note 30. These uncertainties 
can also cause reversal in previously established provisions once final settlement is reached.

Legal issues are often subject to substantial uncertainties with regard to the timing and final amounts of any payments. A significant proportion of 
the total legal provision, $616m (2022: $30m; 2021: $15m) due within one year and $372m (2022: $92m; 2021: $105m) due after more than one year1, 
relates to matters settled, but not paid, in previous periods, further details are provided in Note 30.

The majority of Employee benefit provisions relate to Executive Deferred Compensation Plans, which include uncertainty over the ultimate timing 
and amount of payment to be made to the executives.

Other provisions comprise amounts relating to specific contractual or constructive obligations and disputes. Included within Other provisions are 
amounts associated with long-standing product liability settlements that arose prior to the merger of Astra and Zeneca, which given the nature 
of the provision, the amounts are expected to be settled over many years; the final settlement values and timings are uncertain. Also included in 
Other provisions is an amount of $163m (2022: $165m; 2021: $185m), in relation to third-party liability and other risks (including incurred but not yet 
reported claims); the claims are considered to be uncertain as to timing and amount. Charges to Other provisions in 2023 included $87m (2022: $12m; 
2021: $243m) in relation to the PAAGR restructuring programme, which has a closing provision of $49m (2022: $143m; 2021: $243m), including $8m 
(2022: $95m; 2021: $158m) held in non-current provisions expected to be settled over time by 2025. In 2022, charges to Other provisions included 
$301m in relation to termination fees and onerous contracts with contract manufacturing organisations, the vast majority of which was settled in 2023.

No provision has been released or applied for any purpose other than that for which it was established.

22 Post-retirement pension and other defined benefit schemes
Background
This section predominantly covers defined benefit arrangements like post-retirement pension and medical plans which make up the vast bulk of 
the Group’s liabilities. However, it also incorporates other benefits which fall under IAS 19 rules and which require an actuarial valuation, including 
but not limited to: lump sum plans, long service awards and defined contribution pension plans which have some defined benefit characteristics 
(e.g. a minimum guaranteed level of benefit). In total, over 50 plans in 28 countries are covered.

The Group and most of its subsidiaries offer retirement plans which cover the majority of employees. The Group’s policy is to provide defined 
contribution (DC) orientated pension provision to its employees unless otherwise compelled by local regulation. As a result, many of these retirement 
plans are DC, where the Group contribution and resulting charge is fixed at a set level or is a set percentage of employees’ pay. However, several 
plans, mainly in the UK and Sweden, are defined benefit (DB), where benefits are based on employees’ length of service and salary. The major DB 
plans are largely legacy arrangements as they have been closed to new entrants since 2000, apart from the collectively bargained Swedish plan 
(which is still open to employees born before 1979). During 2010, following consultation with its UK employees’ representatives, the Group introduced 
a freeze on pensionable pay at 30 June 2010 levels for DB members of the UK Pension Fund. The number of active members in the Fund continues 
to decline and is now 400 employees.

The major DB plans are funded through separate, fiduciary-administered assets. The cash funding of the plans, which may from time to time involve 
payments from the Group, is designed, in consultation with independent qualified actuaries, to ensure that the assets are sufficient to meet future 
obligations as and when they fall due. The funding level is monitored by the Group and local fiduciaries, who take into account the strength of the 
Group’s covenant, local regulation, cash flows, and the solvency and maturity of the pension plan.

22 Post-retirement and other defined benefit schemes continued
Financing Principles and Funding Framework
Eighty six per cent of the Group’s total DB obligations (or 66% of net obligations) at 31 December 2023 are in schemes within the UK and Sweden. 
In these countries, the pension obligations are funded in line with the Group’s financing principles, as disclosed in prior years.

The Group has developed a long-term funding framework to implement these principles. This framework targets either full funding on a low-risk 
funding measure, or buyout with an external insurer as the pension funds mature, with affordable long-term de-risking of investment strategy along 
the way. Unless local regulation dictates otherwise, this framework determines the cash contributions payable. 

UK
The UK Pension Fund represents approximately 65% of the Group’s DB obligations at 31 December 2023. The financing principles are modified in 
light of the UK regulatory requirements (summarised below) and resulting discussions with the Trustee.

Role of Trustee and Regulation
The UK Pension Fund is governed and administered by a corporate Trustee which is legally separate from the Group. The Trustee Directors are 
comprised of representatives appointed by both the employer and employees and include an independent professional Trustee Director. The Trustee 
Directors are required by law to act in the interest of all relevant beneficiaries and are responsible in particular for investment strategy and the 
day-to-day administration of the benefits. They are also responsible for jointly agreeing with the employer the level of contributions due to the UK 
Pension Fund.

The UK pensions industry is regulated by The Pensions Regulator whose statutory objectives and regulatory powers are described on its website, 
www.thepensionsregulator.gov.uk.

The Pension Scheme Act 2021 became effective in the UK from 1 October 2021. A section of this Act places additional legal requirements on 
companies who sponsor UK defined benefit pension schemes, to monitor and assess corporate activity, with a focus on the potential impact of 
such activity on the ongoing security of these benefits. The Group maintains a framework to ensure it meets its responsibilities under the Act.

There have been two UK High Court Rulings relating to Guaranteed Minimum Pensions (GMP) equalisation in 2018 and 2020. Following the publication 
of guidance around implementation in 2021, the Trustee, with input from the Group, has now completed the equalisation of benefits for the vast 
majority of pensioner members, with the project expected to complete in 2024. Further details are set out later in this Note. An estimate of the 
impact of these changes has already been recognised in 2018 and 2020, and actual experience is in line with the estimates previously recognised.

In June 2023, the UK High Court (Virgin Media Limited v NTL Pension Trustees II Limited) ruled that certain historical amendments for contracted-
out defined benefit schemes were invalid if they were not accompanied by the correct actuarial confirmation. The judgment is subject to appeal. 
The Trustee and Group are monitoring developments and will consider if there are any implications for the UK Pension Fund, if the ruling is upheld.

Funding requirements
UK legislation requires that an actuarial valuation is completed for all DB pension schemes every three years, which compares the schemes’ 
liabilities to its assets. As part of the triennial valuation process, the Trustee and the Group must agree on a set of assumptions to value the liabilities 
and determine the contributions required, if any, to ensure the UK Pension Fund is fully funded over an appropriate time period and on a suitably 
prudent measure. The assumptions used to value the liabilities for the triennial actuarial valuation are required to be prudent, whereas the assumptions 
used to prepare an IAS 19 accounting valuation are required to be ‘best estimate’.

The last full actuarial valuation of the UK Pension Fund was carried out by a qualified actuary as at 31 March 2022 and finalised in May 2023, ahead 
of the statutory deadline. 

Under the funding assumptions used to set the statutory funding target, the key assumptions from the actuarial valuation as at 31 March 2022 (shown 
as a single-equivalent rate) were as follows: salary increases at 0% per annum (as a result of pensionable pay levels being frozen in 2010); pension 
increases at 3.64% per annum; and discount rate at 3.03% per annum. The resulting valuation of the Fund’s liabilities on that basis was £5,951m 
($7,820m) compared to a market valuation of assets at 31 March 2022 of £5,604m ($7,364m).

Aspects of the triennial actuarial valuation are governed by a long-term funding agreement, effective since October 2016, which sets out a path to 
full funding on a low-risk measure. Under this agreement, if a deficit exists, the Group is required to provide security. This security takes the form 
of a charge in favour of the Trustee over all land and buildings on the Group’s Cambridge Biomedical Campus site. This charge was enacted in 
December 2023, and provides long-term security to the Trustee in respect of the Group’s future deficit recovery contributions. The value of the 
charge is currently £317m ($404m) and it is capped at £350m ($446m). The value of the charge will vary and is expected to reduce over time, before 
falling away. Under the terms of the charge, the Trustee can only exercise its right over the ownership of the site in a Group insolvency event.

184

AstraZeneca Annual Report & Form 20-F Information 2023Financial StatementsIn relation to deficit recovery contributions, a lump sum contribution of £39m ($48m) was made in March 2023, with a further annual contribution 
of £39m ($50m) due before 31 March 2024, and each year up to March 2028.

Further progress was made over 2023 in equalising GMP for members of the UK Pension Fund. The method of equalisation converts GMP to non-
GMP pension to simplify the structure and administration of benefits. As at 31 December 2023, almost all pensioner and dependent members have 
had their benefits equalised and, for non-pensioner members, a process will be in place in 2024 to equalise their benefits at their point of retirement. 
As part of the project, a Pension Increase Exchange (‘PiE’) option was also made available to the majority of pensioner members, at the Group’s 
discretion. This option provided the member with a choice to opt for a higher pension right away, but with no, or fewer, inflation-linked increases 
in the future. Take-up of this option resulted in a reduction to expected future liabilities and a $16m past service credit was taken to the income 
statement in March 2023.

Under the governing documentation of the UK Pension Fund, any future surplus in the Fund would be returnable to the Group by refund assuming 
gradual settlement of the liabilities over the lifetime of the Fund. In particular, the Trustee has no unilateral right to wind up the Fund without Company 
consent nor does it have the power to unilaterally use surplus to augment benefits prior to wind-up. As such, there are no adjustments required in 
respect of IFRIC 14 ‘IAS 19 – The Limit on a Defined Benefit Asset, Minimum Funding Requirements and their Interaction’.

On current bases, it is expected that ongoing contributions (excluding those in respect of past service deficit contributions) during the year ending 
31 December 2024 for the UK scheme will be approximately $18m.

United States
In May 2023, AstraZeneca Pharmaceuticals LP agreed a buy-out of its qualified US Defined Benefit Pension Plan with an external insurer. All Plan 
liabilities (approximately $840m) have now been discharged (via a mix of cash payments to participants and purchase of insured annuities), with an 
impact of $1.7m on the income statement and a net Group cash contribution of approximately $25m. The Plan is wound up and the Trust is closed. 
The transaction will be completed in 2024, pending approval of Group annuity contracts from State Regulators. 

There are three remaining immaterial US post-retirement benefit plans and therefore from 2024, these will not be individually disclosed.

Sweden
The Swedish plans account for 20% of the Group’s defined benefit obligations. They are governed by Fiduciary Bodies with responsibility for the 
investment of the assets. These plans are funded in line with the Group’s financing principles and local regulations.

The Swedish defined benefit pension plans were actuarially valued at 31 December 2022, when plan obligations were estimated to amount to $1,312m 
and plan assets were $946m. The local Swedish GAAP funding position can influence contribution policy. Over 2023, for the main pension fund 
the Group did not request a reimbursement of benefit payments made throughout the year as the funding level was below 100% on the Swedish 
GAAP basis. The benefit payments over 2023, totalling approximately $47m, are therefore regarded as Group contributions.

On current bases, it is expected that ongoing contributions (excluding those in respect of past service deficit contributions) during the year ending 
31 December 2024 for Sweden will be approximately $53m.

Other defined benefit plans
The Group provides benefit plans other than pensions which have to be reported under IAS 19. These include lump sum plans, long service awards 
and defined contribution pension plans which have a guaranteed minimum benefit. However, the largest category of these ‘other’ non-pension 
plans are healthcare benefits.

In the US, and to a lesser extent in certain other countries, the Group’s employment practices include the provision of healthcare and life assurance 
benefits for eligible retired employees. As at 31 December 2023, some 2,673 retired employees and covered dependents currently benefit from 
these provisions and some 2,133 current employees will be eligible on their retirement. The Group accrues for the present value of such retiree 
obligations over the working life of the employee. In practice, these benefits will be funded with reference to the financing principles.

In the US, the Post Retirement Welfare Plan which provides retiree medical benefits has a surplus of $66m. As a result, the investment strategy 
has been fully de-risked. The Group has concluded that under current legislation, the surplus would be repayable in the future to subsidise other 
medical benefits offered to employees. 

The cost of post-retirement benefits other than pensions for the Group in 2023 was $1m (2022: $1m; 2021: $1m). Plan assets were $161m and plan 
obligations were $114m at 31 December 2023. These benefit plans have been included in the disclosure of post-retirement benefits under IAS 19.

Financial assumptions
Qualified independent actuaries have updated the actuarial valuations under IAS 19 for the major defined benefit schemes operated by the Group 
to 31 December 2023. The assumptions used may not necessarily be borne out in practice, due to the inherent financial and demographic uncertainty 
associated with making long-term projections. These assumptions reflect the changes which have the most material impact on the results of the 
Group and were as follows:

Inflation assumption

Rate of increase in salaries

Rate of increase in pensions in payment

Discount rate – defined benefit obligation

Discount rate – interest cost

Discount rate – service cost

The weighted average duration of the post-retirement scheme obligations is approximately 11 years in the UK, 16 years in Sweden and 13 years 
for the Rest of the Group (including Germany).

Demographic assumptions
The mortality assumptions are based on country-specific mortality tables. These are compared to actual experience and adjusted where sufficient 
data are available. Additional allowance for future improvements in life expectancy is included for all major schemes where there is credible data 
to support a continuing trend.

The table below illustrates life expectancy assumptions at age 65 for male and female members retiring in 2023 and male and female members 
expected to retire in 2043 (2022: 2022 and 2042 respectively).

In the UK, the Group adopted the CMI 2022 Mortality Projections Model with a 1% long-term improvement rate. No other demographic assumptions 
have changed since they were updated in 2022 following the actuarial valuation. The Group has continued to assume that 25% of members 
(2022: 25%) will transfer out of the defined benefit section of the AstraZeneca Pension Fund at the point of retirement.

In the US and Sweden, the mortality assumptions are unchanged from 2022.

186

AstraZeneca Annual Report & Form 20-F Information 2023Financial StatementsRisks associated with the Group’s defined benefit pension schemes
The UK defined benefit plan accounts for 65% of the Group’s defined benefit obligations and exposes the Group to a number of risks, the most 
significant of which are:

Risk

Description

Mitigation

Asset 
pricing risk

The Defined Benefit Obligation (DBO) is calculated using a discount rate 
set with reference to AA-rated corporate bond yields; asset returns that 
differ from the discount rate will create an element of volatility in the 
solvency ratio. Approximately 45% of the UK Pension Fund is allocated 
to growth assets. Although these growth assets are expected to 
outperform AA-rated corporate bonds in the long term, they can lead to 
volatility and mismatching risk in the short term. The allocation to growth 
assets is monitored to ensure it remains appropriate given the UK Pension 
Fund’s long-term objectives.

In order to mitigate investment risk, the Trustee invests in a suitably 
diversified range of asset classes, return drivers and investment managers. 
The investment strategy will evolve to further improve the expected risk/return 
profile as opportunities arise. De-risking of the investment strategy took 
place over 2023, as the Fund moved ahead of its long-term target, with the 
benchmark allocation to Growth Assets reducing from 62.5% to 47.5%.

The Trustee has hedged approximately 92% of unintended non-sterling, 
overseas currency risk within the UK Pension Fund assets.

Interest 
rate risk

A decrease in corporate bond yields will increase the present value 
placed on the DBO for accounting purposes.

Inflation risk 

The majority of the DBO is indexed in line with price inflation (mainly 
inflation as measured by the UK Retail Price Index (RPI) but also for 
some members a component of pensions is indexed by the UK 
Consumer Price Index (CPI)) and higher inflation will lead to higher 
liabilities (although, in the vast majority of cases, this is capped at an 
annual increase of 5%, known as Limited Price Indexation or LPI).

Life 
expectancy 

The majority of the UK Pension Fund’s obligations are to provide 
benefits for the life of the member, so increases in life expectancy 
will result in an increase in the liabilities.

The interest rate hedge of the UK Pension Fund is predominantly implemented 
via holding gilts (and gilt repurchase agreements or ‘gilt repo’) of appropriate 
duration. This hedge protects to a large degree against falls in long-term 
interest rates and the UK Pension Fund is approximately 98% hedged as a 
percentage of assets at the end of 2023 (versus target of 100%). Nonetheless, 
there remain differences in the bonds and instruments held by the UK Pension 
Fund to hedge interest rate risk on the statutory and long-term funding basis 
(gilts and gilt repo) and the bonds analysed to set the DBO discount rate on 
an accounting basis (AA corporate bonds). As such, there remains some 
mismatching risk on an accounting basis should yields on gilts diverge 
compared to AA corporate bonds.

The UK Pension Fund holds RPI index-linked gilts and gilt repo. The inflation 
hedge of the UK Pension Fund protects to some degree against higher-than-
expected inflation increases on the DBO (approximately 100% hedged as a 
percentage of assets at the end of 2023). Over 2023, work was carried out 
by the Trustee to improve the accuracy of the hedge to LPI linked liabilities.

In 2013 the Trustee entered into a longevity swap to hedge against the risk 
of increasing life expectancy over the next 75 years. The swap currently 
covers approximately 8,000 of the UK Pension Fund’s pensioners, equivalent 
to $2.4bn of Pension fund liability. A one-year increase in life expectancy 
would result in a $214m increase in pension fund obligations, which would 
be partially offset by a $108m increase in the value of the longevity swap 
and hence the pension fund assets. 

Cash flow and 
liquidity risk

The UK Pension Fund is maturing and cash flow negative. Assets 
are liquidated to meet benefit outgo and potentially from time to time, 
to supplement the collateral pool required to post margin for 
derivative holdings.

The Trustee invests in a diversified portfolio of highly liquid assets to 
manage sequencing risk and operates a collateral management policy, 
maintaining a minimum liquidity ‘buffer’ above recommended regulatory 
guidelines, which can be quickly supplemented in an orderly manner.

There is a risk of the Trustee requesting liquidity support from the Group 
to meet margin calls or expenditure, if the liquidity position of the UK 
Pension Fund is not effectively monitored and managed.

Over 2023, in addition to the Growth and Liability Hedging portfolios, 
the Trustee allocated 7% of assets to a new, cash flow driven investment 
portfolio, consisting of investment grade corporate bonds. The purpose of 
this portfolio is to generate income to help meet the Fund’s benefit outgo. 
The portfolio is expected to grow over time as further de-risking occurs.

Other risks
There are a number of other risks of administering the UK Pension Fund which the Trustee manages with Group input. Some of the major risks 
include counterparty risks from using derivatives (mitigated by using a specialist investment manager to oversee a diversified range of counterparties 
of high standing and ensuring positions are collateralised daily). Furthermore, there are operational risks (such as paying out the wrong benefits) 
and legislative risks (such as the UK government introducing new legislation). These are mitigated so far as possible via the governance structure 
in place which oversees and administers the pension funds.

The Group’s pension plans in Sweden also manage these key risks, where relevant, in a similar way, with the local fiduciary bodies investing in a 
diversified manner and employing a framework to hedge interest rate risk where practicable.

Local fiduciary boards are aware of Environmental, Social and Governance (ESG) risks as they pertain to investment policy, and where local regulation 
allows, have policies in place to monitor and manage such risks and comply with local legislation and disclosure requirements. The Trustee of the 
UK Pension Fund published its inaugural Task Force for Climate-related Disclosures (TCFD) report in October 2023.

Assets and obligations of defined benefit schemes
The assets and obligations of the defined benefit schemes operated by the Group at 31 December 2023, as calculated in accordance with IAS 19, 
are shown below. The fair values of the schemes’ assets are not intended to be realised in the short term and may be subject to significant change 
before they are realised. The present value of the schemes’ obligations is derived from cash flow projections over long periods and is therefore 
inherently uncertain.

In consideration of current market conditions, additional sensitivities have been calculated for the UK and Sweden schemes for 2023. The effect 
on retirement benefit obligations of a 1.0% change in assumption is as follows: $525m (UK) and $210m (Sweden) if the discount rate is increased; 
$(634)m (UK) and $(254)m (Sweden) if the discount rate is decreased; $(384)m (UK) and $(240)m (Sweden) if the inflation rate is increased; and 
$363m (UK) and $201m (Sweden) if the inflation rate is decreased.

The sensitivity to the financial assumptions shown above has been estimated taking into account the approximate duration of the liabilities and the 
overall profile of the plan membership. 

The inflation sensitivity allows for the impact of a change in inflation on salary increases and pension increases (where these assumptions are 
inflation-linked). 

The salary increase sensitivity reflects the impact of an increase of only salary relative to inflation. 

The sensitivity to the life expectancy assumption is estimated based on a revised mortality assumption that extends/reduces the current life 
expectancy by one year for a particular age.

23 Reserves
Retained earnings
The cumulative amount of goodwill written off directly to reserves resulting from acquisitions, net of disposals, amounted to $595m (2022: $591m; 
2021: $615m) using year end rates of exchange.

At 31 December 2023, 1,580,137 shares, at a cost of $129m, have been deducted from Retained earnings (2022: 1,671,446 shares, at a cost of $112m; 
2021: 3,922,122 shares, at a cost of $239m) to satisfy future vesting of employee share plans.

There are no significant statutory or contractual restrictions on the distribution of current profits of subsidiaries; undistributed profits of prior years 
are, in the main, permanently employed in the businesses of these companies. The undistributed income of AstraZeneca companies overseas might 
be liable to overseas taxes and/or UK taxation (after allowing for double taxation relief) if they were to be distributed as dividends (see Note 4).

The cumulative loss with respect to costs of hedging is $22m (2022: loss of $3m; 2021: gain of $4m) and the loss during the year was $19m (2022: 
loss of $7m; 2021: loss of $6m).

The balance remaining in the foreign currency translation reserve from net investment hedging relationships for which hedge accounting no longer 
applied is a gain of $527m. For further detail relating to hedging balances, please see the Hedge accounting section within Note 28, from page 200.

Other reserves
The other reserves arose from the cancellation of £1,255m of share premium account by the Company in 1993 and the redenomination of share 
capital of $157m in 1999. The reserves are available for writing off goodwill arising on consolidation and, subject to guarantees given to preserve 
creditors at the date of the court order, are available for distribution.

AstraZeneca Annual Report & Form 20-F Information 2023Financial Statements26 Non-controlling interests
The Group Financial Statements at 31 December 2023 reflect equity of $23m (2022: $21m; 2021: $19m) and total comprehensive income of $6m 
(2022: $2m; 2021: $3m) attributable to the non-controlling interests in AstraZeneca Pharma India Limited, P.T. AstraZeneca Indonesia, Beijing Falikang 
Pharmaceutical (China) Co. Limited, and AstraZeneca Algeria Pharmaceutical Industries SPA.

In February 2016, AstraZeneca acquired a 55% controlling stake in Acerta Pharma where the non-controlling interest was subject to put and call 
options. The put option gave rise to a liability (see Note 20). AstraZeneca exercised its option to acquire the remaining 45% of shares in Acerta 
Pharma in April 2021.

As part of the acquisition of Alexion in July 2021, a pre-existing non-controlling interest in Caelum Biosciences was recognised (Note 27). This was 
valued at $150m, the agreed-upon exercise price for the exclusive option to acquire the remaining equity. The option was exercised on 28 September 
2021 and the acquisition of Caelum Biosciences closed shortly thereafter on 5 October 2021.

27 Acquisition of business operations
Acquisitions of business operations in 2023
On 16 January 2023, AstraZeneca completed the acquisition of Neogene Therapeutics Inc. (Neogene), a global clinical-stage biotechnology company 
pioneering the discovery, development and manufacturing of next-generation T-cell receptor therapies (TCR-Ts). The purchase price allocation exercise 
has completed, with the fair value of total consideration determined at $267m. Intangible assets of $100m and goodwill of $158m were recognised 
in the acquisition balance sheet, as well as a cash outflow of $189m net of cash acquired. Future contingent milestones-based and non-contingent 
consideration is payable to a maximum of $120m. Neogene’s results have been consolidated into the Group’s results from 16 January 2023.

Acquisitions of business operations in 2022
On 16 November 2022, AstraZeneca completed the acquisition of 100% of the issued shares of LogicBio Therapeutics, Inc. (LogicBio) based in 
Lexington, MA, US. LogicBio is a clinical-stage genetic medicine company pioneering genome editing and gene delivery platforms to address rare 
and serious diseases from infancy through adulthood. The total consideration was $72m. Cash of $68m was paid on the completion date, with $4m 
of outstanding options, which will be settled in cash, recorded in current Trade and other payables. Goodwill of $15m, assets of $82m, including 
$46m of intangible assets, and liabilities of $25m were recognised on acquisition. LogicBio’s results have been consolidated into the Group’s results 
from 16 November 2022.

Acquisitions of business operations in 2021
On 21 July 2021, AstraZeneca completed the acquisition of 100% of the issued shares of Alexion Pharmaceuticals, Inc (Alexion), based in Boston, 
MA, US. Alexion is a global biopharmaceutical company focused on serving patients and families affected by rare diseases and devastating conditions 
through the discovery, development and commercialisation of life-changing medicines.

At closing, Alexion shareholders received 2.1243 AstraZeneca American Depositary Shares (ADSs) and $60 in cash for each of their Alexion shares. 
Unvested Alexion employee share awards were converted to equivalent AstraZeneca share awards. The fair value of the purchase consideration 
was $41,058m, comprising AstraZeneca ADSs of $27,196m, cash of $13,349m and replacement employee share awards of $513m.

The Group funded the cash element of the acquisition with $8bn of new long-term debt, issued in May and June 2021, $4bn of term loans drawn in 
July 2021 under the $17.5bn committed bank facilities entered into in December 2020 to secure the acquisition financing, and existing cash balances. 
The Group cancelled the remaining $13.5bn of the facilities in June, July and October 2021. Loans and borrowings of $2.3bn acquired with Alexion 
were repaid in full shortly following completion of the acquisition. 

The acquisition was accounted for as a business combination using the acquisition method of accounting in accordance with IFRS 3 ‘Business 
Combinations’ and consequently the Alexion assets acquired, and liabilities assumed, were recorded by AstraZeneca at fair value, with the excess 
of the purchase price over the fair value of the identifiable assets and liabilities being recognised as goodwill. 

 As part of the Alexion acquisition in 2021, we identified the assets (comprising principally launched products and IPR&D post pre-clinical stage) 

and liabilities acquired. Attributing fair values to assets acquired and liabilities assumed as part of business combinations is considered to be a 
key judgement. The purchase price allocation was performed with assistance from an independent valuer to advise on the valuation techniques 
and key assumptions in the valuation, in particular in respect of the valuation of the intangible assets and inventory.

The fair value attributed to intangible assets was $26,955m and primarily represents intellectual property rights over launched products of $23,695m 
and products under development of $2,760m. These were fair valued using the multi-period excess earnings method, which uses a number of 
estimates regarding the amount and timing of future cash flows. The key assumptions in the cash flows are the probability of technical and regulatory 
success, peak year sales and revenue erosion curves. In accordance with the Group’s policy on impairment assessments as set out on page 159, 
the assets were assessed for impairment in the final quarter of 2023, 2022 and 2021. Future milestones have been included in the valuation of the 
intangible assets (as a deduction of cash flows).

The fair value of inventory, which includes raw materials, work in progress and finished goods related to the launched products was estimated at 
$6,769m, an uplift of $5,635m on the carrying value prior to the acquisition. The fair value adjustment relates only to work in progress and finished 
goods and was calculated as the estimated selling price less costs to complete and sell the inventory, associated margins on these activities and 
holding costs. As at 31 December 2023, the fair value uplift has been fully unwound.

Property, plant and equipment principally comprises the manufacturing facilities in Dublin and Athlone, Ireland and was fair valued using a cost 
approach. The estimated fair value of $1,135m represents an uplift of $111m over carrying value. 

The estimated fair value of contingent liabilities was $76m, relating to various claims and disputes in each case where there is a possible, but not 
probable, future financial exposure, and involve an assessment of the likelihood of a number of scenarios in relation to those matters. This amount 
has been included within other non-current liabilities of $697m.

The estimated fair value of trade and other receivables was $2,096m, which approximated the contractual cash flows.

The net deferred tax position reflected an adjustment of $5,215m related to the deferred tax impact of the fair value uplifts on intangible assets, 
inventories, property, plant and equipment and contingent liabilities as described above.

194

AstraZeneca Annual Report & Form 20-F Information 2023Financial StatementsGoodwill amounting to $8,287m was recognised on acquisition and is underpinned by a number of elements, which individually could not be quantified. 
Most significant among these is the premium attributable to a pre-existing, well-positioned business in the innovation-intensive, high-growth rare 
diseases market with a highly skilled workforce and established reputation. Other important elements include the potential unidentified products 
that future research and development may yield and the core technological capabilities and knowledge base of the company. Goodwill is not 
expected to be deductible for tax purposes. 

Non-controlling interests reflect Alexion’s pre-existing minority equity interest in Caelum Biosciences and have been valued at $150m, the agreed-
upon exercise price for the exclusive option to acquire the remaining equity. The option was exercised on 28 September 2021 and the acquisition 
of Caelum Biosciences closed shortly thereafter on 5 October 2021 (Note 26).

Alexion’s results have been consolidated into the Group’s results from 21 July 2021. For the period from acquisition to 31 December 2021, before 
reflecting the fair value adjustments arising on the acquisition, Alexion’s Total Revenues were $3,071m and Profit after tax was $889m. If the 
acquisition had taken effect at the beginning of the reporting period in which the acquisition occurred (1 January 2021), on a pro forma basis, after 
reflecting the fair value adjustments arising on the acquisition, the Total Revenue of the combined Group for the year ended 31 December 2021 
would have been $41,132m and the Loss after tax would have been $1,152m. This pro forma information does not purport to represent the results 
of the combined Group that actually would have occurred had the acquisition taken place on 1 January 2021 and should not be taken to be 
representative of future results.

Total acquisition-related costs of $5m (2022: $4m; 2021: $171m) have been incurred by the Group, which include advisory, legal and other 
professional fees. These costs are presented in the Statement of Comprehensive Income within Selling, general and administrative expense and 
Finance expense.

The terms of the acquisition include a retention bonus plan for legacy Alexion employees whereby up to $50m may be used for retention bonus awards 
to employees at the level of Vice President or below. In 2023, $nil costs were recorded in the Statement of Comprehensive Income (2022: $3m; 
2021: $24m). These bonuses vested and were paid six months after the acquisition, or earlier.

Upon completion of the acquisition, all unvested Alexion employee share awards were converted into AstraZeneca restricted stock awards that 
continue to have, and shall be subject to, the same terms and conditions as applied in the corresponding Alexion awards immediately prior to 
completion. Alexion Performance Stock Plan (PSU) awards that included performance-based vesting conditions were converted using the greater 
of the original target level and Alexion’s assessment of the level of achievement immediately prior to completion (subject to a limit of 175% for the 
awards granted in 2019 and a limit of 150% for the awards granted in 2020). In the year, a cost of $48m (2022: $257m; 2021: $257m) has been 
recorded in the Statement of Comprehensive Income, $nil (2022: $9m; 2021: $9m) in Cost of sales, $16m (2022: $92m; 2021: $73m) in Research 
and development expense and $32m (2022: $156m; 2021: $175m) in Selling, general and administrative expense. Payments made to the Employee 
Benefit Trust upon vesting of share awards recognised as part of the consideration for the acquisition of Alexion are recognised within investing 
activities in the Group’s Statement of Cash Flows as the cash payment relates to the settlement of the obligation that arose on the acquisition of 
Alexion that was included as part of the consideration for the acquisition.

28 Financial risk management objectives and policies
The Group’s principal financial instruments, other than derivatives, comprise bank overdrafts, loans and other borrowings, lease liabilities, current 
and non-current investments, cash and short-term deposits. The main purpose of these financial instruments is to manage the Group’s funding 
and liquidity requirements. The Group has other financial assets and liabilities such as trade receivables and trade payables, which arise directly 
from its operations.

The principal financial risks to which the Group is exposed are those of liquidity, interest rate, foreign currency and credit. Each of these is managed 
in accordance with Board-approved policies. These policies, together with the Group’s approach to capital management, are set out below.

Capital management
The capital structure of the Group consists of Shareholders’ equity (Note 24), Debt (Note 19), Other current investments (Note 12) and Cash (Note 17). 
For the foreseeable future, the Board will maintain a capital structure that supports the Group’s strategic objectives through:

>  managing funding and liquidity risk
>  optimising shareholder return
>  maintaining a strong, investment-grade credit rating.

The Group utilises factoring arrangements and bank acceptance drafts discounting for selected trade receivables. These arrangements qualify for 
full derecognition of the associated trade receivables under IFRS 9. Amounts due on invoices that have not been factored at year end, from customers 
that are subject to these arrangements, are disclosed in Note 16.

Funding and liquidity risk are reviewed regularly by the Board and managed in accordance with the policies described below.

The Board regularly reviews its shareholders’ distribution policy, which comprises a regular cash dividend and potentially a share repurchase 
component. No share repurchases have been made since 2012.

The Group’s net debt position (loans and borrowings net of Cash and cash equivalents, Other investments and Derivative financial instruments) 
has decreased from a net debt position of $22,923m at the beginning of the year to a net debt position of $22,510m at 31 December 2023.

28 Financial risk management objectives and policies continued
Liquidity risk
The Board reviews the Group’s ongoing liquidity risks annually as part of the planning process and on an ad hoc basis. The Board considers short-term 
requirements against available sources of funding, taking into account forecast cash flows. The Group manages liquidity risk by maintaining access 
to a number of sources of funding which are sufficient to meet anticipated funding requirements. Specifically, the Group uses US and European 
commercial paper, bank loans, committed bank facilities and cash resources to manage short-term liquidity and manages long-term liquidity by 
raising funds through the capital markets. At 31 December 2023, the Group was assigned short-term credit ratings of P-1 by Moody’s and A-1 by 
Standard and Poor’s. The Group’s long-term credit rating was A2 Stable outlook by Moody’s and A Stable outlook by Standard and Poor’s.

In addition to Cash and cash equivalents of $5,840m, short-term fixed income investments of $20m, less overdrafts of $203m at 31 December 2023, 
the Group has committed bank facilities of $6,875m available to manage liquidity. These committed bank facilities have no financial covenants. 
$2,000m mature in February 2025. The maturity of the $4,875m facilities was extended in February 2024 from April 2026 to April 2029. The Group 
regularly monitors the credit standing of the banks providing the facilities and currently does not anticipate any issue with drawing on the committed 
facilities should this be necessary. Advances under these facilities currently bear an interest rate per annum based on SOFR (Secured Overnight 
Financing Rate) plus a margin.

At 31 December 2023, the Group has $4,855m outstanding from debt issued under a Euro Medium Term Note programme and $19,959m under a 
SEC-registered programme. The funds made available under these facility agreements may be used for the general corporate purposes of the Group. 

The maturity profile of the anticipated future contractual cash flows including interest in relation to the Group’s financial liabilities, on an undiscounted 
basis and which, therefore, differs from both the carrying value and fair value, is as follows:

Where interest payments are on a floating rate basis, it is assumed that rates will remain unchanged from the last business day of each year ended 
31 December.

196

AstraZeneca Annual Report & Form 20-F Information 2023Financial StatementsThe Group has $2bn of bank loans that mature in July 2024 which the Group can repay before maturity at face value. Other than that, it is not expected 
that the cash flows in the maturity profile could occur significantly earlier or at significantly different amounts, with the exception of $2,137m of 
contingent consideration held within Trade and other payables (see Note 20).

Market risk
Interest rate risk
The Group maintains a Board-approved mix of fixed and floating rate debt and uses underlying debt, interest rate swaps and forward rate agreements 
to manage this mix.

The majority of surplus cash is currently invested in US dollar liquidity funds and investment-grade fixed income securities.

The interest rate profile of the Group’s interest-bearing financial instruments are set out below. In the case of current and non-current financial 
liabilities, the classification includes the impact of interest rate swaps which convert the debt to floating rate.

Foreign currency risk
The US dollar is the Group’s most significant currency. As a consequence, the Group results are presented in US dollars and exposures are managed 
against US dollars accordingly.

Translational
Approximately 60% of Group external sales in 2023 were denominated in currencies other than the US dollar, while a significant proportion of 
manufacturing, and research and development costs were denominated in pound sterling and Swedish krona. Surplus cash generated by business 
units is substantially converted to, and held centrally in, US dollars. As a result, operating profit and total cash flow in US dollars will be affected by 
movements in exchange rates.

This currency exposure is managed centrally, based on forecast cash flows. The impact of movements in exchange rates is mitigated significantly 
by the correlations which exist between the major currencies to which the Group is exposed and the US dollar. Monitoring of currency exposures 
and correlations is undertaken on a regular basis and hedging is subject to pre-execution approval.

As at 31 December 2023, before the impact of derivatives, 2% of interest-bearing loans and borrowings were denominated in pound sterling and 
16% were denominated in euros. Where there is non-US dollar debt and an underlying net investment of that amount in the same currency, the 
Group applies net investment hedging. Exchange differences on the retranslation of debt designated as net investment hedges are recognised in 
Other comprehensive income to the extent that the hedge is effective. Any ineffectiveness is taken to profit. For details of non-US dollar debt in a 
designated hedging relationship please see the Hedge accounting section within this Note 28 from page 200.

The Group holds cross-currency swaps to hedge against the impact of fluctuations in foreign exchange rates. Fair value movements on the revaluation 
of the cross-currency swaps are recognised in Other comprehensive income to the extent that the hedge is effective, with any ineffectiveness taken 
to profit.

As at 31 December 2023, the Group operates in three countries designated as hyperinflationary, being Argentina, Venezuela and Turkey. The foreign 
exchange risk of these markets has been assessed and deemed to be immaterial.

Transactional
The Group aims to hedge all its forecasted major transactional currency exposures on working capital balances, which typically extend for up to three 
months. Where practicable, these are hedged using forward foreign exchange contracts. In addition, external dividend payments in pound sterling 
to UK shareholders and in Swedish krona to Swedish shareholders are fully hedged from announcement date to payment date. Foreign exchange 
gains and losses on forward contracts transacted for transactional hedging are taken to profit or to Other comprehensive income if the contract is 
in a designated cash flow hedge.

Sensitivity analysis
The sensitivity analysis set out below summarises the sensitivity of the market value of our financial instruments to hypothetical changes in market 
rates and prices. The range of variables chosen for the sensitivity analysis reflects our view of changes which are reasonably possible over a one-year 
period. Market values are the present value of future cash flows based on market rates and prices at the valuation date. For long-term debt, an 
increase in interest rates results in a decline in the fair value of debt.

The sensitivity analysis assumes an instantaneous 100 basis point change in interest rates in all currencies from their levels at 31 December 2023, 
with all other variables held constant. Based on the composition of our long-term debt portfolio and cash reserves as at 31 December 2023, a 1% 
increase in interest rates would result in an additional $25m in interest expense on the debt and an additional $58m interest income on the cash 
reserves. The exchange rate sensitivity analysis assumes an instantaneous 10% change in foreign currency exchange rates from their levels at 
31 December 2023, with all other variables held constant. The +10% case assumes a 10% strengthening of the US dollar against all other currencies 
and the -10% case assumes a 10% weakening of the US dollar.

Each incremental 10% movement in foreign currency exchange rates would have approximately the same effect as the initial 10% detailed in the 
table below and each incremental 1% change in interest rates would have approximately the same effect as the 1% detailed in the table below.

Credit risk
The Group is exposed to credit risk on financial assets, such as cash investments, derivative instruments, and Trade and other receivables. The 
Group was also exposed in its Net asset position to its own credit risk in respect of the 2023 debentures which are accounted for at FVPL. Under 
IFRS 9, the effect of the losses and gains arising from own credit risk on the fair value of bonds designated at FVPL are recorded in Other 
comprehensive income.

Financial counterparty credit risk
The majority of the AstraZeneca Group’s cash is centralised within the Group treasury entity and is subject to counterparty risk on the principal 
invested. The level of the Group’s cash investments and hence credit risk will depend on the cash flow generated by the Group and the timing of 
the use of that cash. The credit risk is mitigated through a policy of prioritising security and liquidity over return and, as such, cash is only invested 
in high credit-quality investments. Counterparty limits are set according to the assessed risk of each counterparty and exposures are monitored 
against these limits on a regular basis.

The Group’s principal financial counterparty credit risks at 31 December 2023 were as follows:

Current assets

Cash at bank and in hand

Money market liquidity funds

Other short-term cash equivalents

Total Cash and cash equivalents (Note 17)

AstraZeneca Annual Report & Form 20-F Information 2023Financial StatementsThe majority of the Group’s cash is invested in US dollar AAA-rated money market liquidity funds. The money market liquidity fund portfolios are 
managed by six external third-party fund managers to maintain an AAA rating. The Group’s investments represent no more than 10% of each overall 
fund value. There were no other significant concentrations of financial credit risk at the reporting date.

All financial derivatives are transacted with commercial banks, in line with standard market practice. The Group has agreements with some bank 
counterparties whereby the parties agree to post cash collateral, for the benefit of the other, equivalent to the market valuation of the derivative 
positions above a predetermined threshold. The carrying value of such cash collateral held by the Group at 31 December 2023 was $215m (2022: $89m; 
2021: $93m) and the carrying value of such cash collateral posted by the Group at 31 December 2023 was $102m (2022: $162m; 2021: $47m).

The impairment provision for other financial assets at 31 December 2023 was immaterial.

Trade receivables
Trade receivable exposures are managed locally in the operating units where they arise and credit limits are set as deemed appropriate for the 
customer. The Group is exposed to customers ranging from government-backed agencies and large private wholesalers to privately owned pharmacies, 
and the underlying local economic and sovereign risks vary throughout the world. Where appropriate, the Group endeavours to minimise risks by 
the use of trade finance instruments such as letters of credit and insurance. The Group applies the expected credit loss approach to establish an 
allowance for impairment that represents its estimate of expected losses in respect of Trade receivables.

The Group applies the IFRS 9 simplified approach to measuring expected credit losses which uses a lifetime expected loss allowance to Trade 
receivables. To measure expected credit losses, Trade receivables have been grouped based on shared credit characteristics and the days past due.

The expected loss rates are based on payment profiles over a period of 36 months before 31 December 2023, 31 December 2022 or 31 December 
2021 respectively and the corresponding historical credit losses experienced within this period. The historical loss rates are adjusted to reflect 
current and forward-looking information on macroeconomic factors affecting the ability of the customer to settle the receivables.

On that basis, the loss allowance was determined as follows:

31 December 2021

Expected loss rate

Gross carrying amount ($m)

Loss allowance ($m)

31 December 2022

Gross carrying amount ($m)

Trade receivables are written off where there is no reasonable expectation of recovery.

Impairment losses on Trade receivables are presented as net impairment losses within Operating profit, any subsequent recoveries are credited 
against the same line.

In the US, sales to three wholesalers accounted for approximately 80% of US sales (2022: three wholesalers accounted for approximately 73%; 
2021: three wholesalers accounted for approximately 94%).

Given the profile of our customers, including large wholesalers and government-backed agencies, no further credit risk has been identified with the 
Trade receivables not past due other than those balances for which an allowance has been made. The income statement credit or charge is recorded 
in Operating profit.

28 Financial risk management objectives and policies continued
Hedge accounting
The Group uses foreign currency borrowings, foreign currency forwards and swaps, currency options, interest rate swaps and cross-currency 
interest rate swaps for the purpose of hedging its foreign currency and interest rate risks. The Group may designate certain financial instruments 
as fair value hedges, cash flow hedges or net investment hedges in accordance with IFRS 9. Hedge effectiveness is determined at the inception 
of the hedge relationship, and through periodic prospective effectiveness assessments to ensure that an economic relationship exists between 
the hedged item and hedging instrument. Sources of hedge effectiveness will depend on the hedge relationship designation but may include:

>  a significant change in the credit risk of either party to the hedging relationship
>  a timing mismatch between the hedging instrument and the hedged item
>  movements in foreign currency basis spread for derivatives in a fair value hedge
>  a significant change in the value of the foreign currency-denominated net assets of the Group in a net investment hedge.

The hedge ratio for each designation will be established by comparing the quantity of the hedging instrument and the quantity of the hedged item 
to determine their relative weighting; for all of the Group’s existing hedge relationships the hedge ratio has been determined as 1:1. Designated 
hedges are expected to be effective and therefore the impact of ineffectiveness on profit is not expected to be material. The accounting treatment 
for fair value hedges and debt designated as FVPL is disclosed in the Group Accounting Policies section from page 152.

The following table represents the Group’s continuing designated hedge relationships under IFRS 9.

Key controls applied to transactions in derivative financial instruments are to use only instruments where good market liquidity exists, to revalue 
all financial instruments regularly using current market rates and to sell options only to offset previously purchased options or as part of a risk 
management strategy. The Group is not a net seller of options, and does not use derivative financial instruments for speculative purposes. The Group 
held no options during the reporting period.

Severance costs of $123m are not included above (2022: $227m; 2021: $238m).

The charge for share-based payments in respect of share plans is $579m (2022: $619m; 2021: $615m). Payments made to the Employee Benefit 
Trust upon vesting of share awards are recognised within operating cash flows, reflecting the substance of the arrangement in place between the 
Group and the Trust. The plans are equity settled.

The Directors believe that, together with the basic salary system, the Group’s employee incentive schemes provide competitive and market-related 
packages to motivate employees. They should also align the interests of employees with those of shareholders, as a whole, through long-term 
share ownership in the Company. The Group’s current US, UK and Swedish schemes are described below; other arrangements apply elsewhere.

Bonus and share plans
US 
In the US, there are two employee short-term performance bonus plans in operation to differentiate and reward strong individual performance. 
Performance bonuses are paid in cash. The AstraZeneca Performance Share Plan and the AstraZeneca Global Restricted Share Plan operate in 
respect of relevant employees in the US. AstraZeneca ADRs necessary to satisfy the awards are purchased on the market or funded via a trust.

UK
The AstraZeneca UK Performance Bonus Plan 
Employees of participating AstraZeneca UK companies are invited to participate in this bonus plan, which rewards strong individual performance. 
Bonuses are paid in cash.

The AstraZeneca UK All-Employee Share Plan 
The Company offers UK employees the opportunity to buy Partnership Shares (Ordinary Shares). Employees may invest up to £150 a month to 
purchase Partnership Shares in the Company at the current market value. In 2010, the Company introduced a Matching Share element, the first 
award of which was made in 2011. Currently one Matching Share is awarded for every four Partnership Shares purchased. Partnership Shares and 
Matching Shares are held in the HM Revenue & Customs (HMRC)-approved All-Employee Share Plan. At the Company’s AGM in 2002, shareholders 
approved the issue of new shares for the purposes of the All-Employee Share Plan.

Sweden 
In Sweden, an all-employee performance bonus plan is in operation, which rewards strong individual performance. Bonuses are paid 50% into a 
fund investing in AstraZeneca equities and 50% in cash. The AstraZeneca Executive Annual Bonus Scheme, the AstraZeneca Performance Share 
Plan and the AstraZeneca Global Restricted Stock Plan all operate in respect of relevant AstraZeneca employees in Sweden.

Other bonus and share plans that operate across the Group are described below.

The AstraZeneca Executive Annual Bonus Scheme 
This scheme is a performance bonus scheme for Directors and senior employees who do not participate in the AstraZeneca UK Performance 
Bonus Plan. Annual bonuses are paid in cash and reflect both corporate and individual performance measures. The Remuneration Committee has 
discretion to reduce or withhold bonuses if business performance falls sufficiently short of expectations in any year such as to make the payment 
of bonuses inappropriate. 

The AstraZeneca Deferred Bonus Plan 
This plan was introduced in 2006 and is used to defer a portion of the bonus earned under the AstraZeneca Executive Annual Bonus Scheme into 
Ordinary Shares in the Company for a period of three years. The plan currently operates only in respect of Executive Directors and members of 
the SET (with awards granted as AstraZeneca ADRs for members of SET employed within the US). Awards of shares under this plan are typically 
made in March each year, the first award having been made in February 2006.

The AstraZeneca Performance Share Plan 
This plan was approved by shareholders in 2020 for a period of 10 years (subsequently amended by approval of shareholders in 2021) and replaces 
the 2014 AstraZeneca Performance Share Plan. Generally, awards can be granted at any time, but not during a closed period of the Company. 
The first grant of Performance Share Plan awards was made in May 2014 under the 2014 AstraZeneca Performance Share Plan. Awards granted 
under the plan vest after three years, or in the case of Executive Directors and members of the SET, after an additional two-year holding period, 
and is subject to the achievement of performance conditions. For awards granted to all participants in 2023, vesting is subject to a combination 
of measures focused on science and innovation, revenue growth, financial performance and carbon reduction. The Remuneration Committee has 
responsibility for agreeing any awards under the plan and for setting the policy for the way in which the plan should be operated, including agreeing 
performance targets and which employees should be eligible to participate.

The AstraZeneca Investment Plan 
This plan was introduced in 2010 and approved by shareholders at the 2010 AGM. The final grant of awards under this plan took place in March 
2016. Awards granted under the plan vest after eight years and are subject to performance conditions measured over a period of four years. 

The AstraZeneca Global Restricted Stock Plan 
The Global Restricted Stock Plan (GRSP) was introduced in 2010. This plan provides for the grant of restricted stock unit (RSU) awards to selected 
below SET-level employees and is used in conjunction with the AstraZeneca Performance Share Plan to provide a mix of RSUs and performance 
share units (PSUs). Awards typically vest on the third anniversary of the date of grant and are contingent on continued employment with the 
Company. The Remuneration Committee has responsibility for agreeing any awards under the plan and for setting the policy for the way in which 
the plan should be operated. 

The AstraZeneca Restricted Share Plan 
This plan was introduced in 2008 and provides for the grant of restricted share unit (RSU) awards to key employees, excluding Executive Directors. 
Awards are made on an ad hoc basis with variable vesting dates. The plan has been used five times in 2023 to make awards to 305 employees. 
The Remuneration Committee has responsibility for agreeing any awards under the plan and for setting the policy for the way in which the plan 
should be operated. 

202

AstraZeneca Annual Report & Form 20-F Information 2023Financial StatementsThe AstraZeneca Extended Incentive Plan 
This plan was introduced in 2018 and provides for the grant of awards to key employees, excluding Executive Directors. Awards are made on an 
ad hoc basis and 50% of the award will normally vest on the fifth anniversary of grant, with the balance vesting on the tenth anniversary of grant. 
The award can be subject to the achievement of performance conditions. The Remuneration Committee has responsibility for agreeing any awards 
under the plan and for setting the policy for the way in which the plan should be operated, including agreeing performance targets (if any) and which 
employees should be invited to participate.

Alexion employee share award plan
At acquisition in 2021 Alexion employee share awards were converted into AstraZeneca restricted stock awards that continue to have, and shall be 
subject to, the same terms and conditions as applied in the corresponding Alexion awards immediately prior to completion. The fair value at the 
grant date was $57.54 and of the 15,220,000 shares outstanding at 31 December 2021, 8,627,000 were exercised and 980,000 were forfeited during 
2022. During 2022, Alexion employees had the option to defer awards due to vest in July 2022 until February 2023 when they would also receive 
an additional vest equivalent to 15% of the shares deferred. As a result, 1,780,000 shares were deferred, resulting in an additional 267,000 shares 
being issued with a grant date fair value of $65.62, that vested in 2023. During 2023, 2,060,000 shares vested, 531,000 were forfeited/cancelled 
and the closing balance of these awards as of 31 December 2023 was 3,022,000.

The weighted average fair value for awards granted under the AstraZeneca Performance Share Plan is primarily based on the market price at the 
point of grant adjusted for the market-based performance elements which are valued using a modified version of the Monte Carlo method. The fair 
values of all other plans are set using the market price at the point of award. These awards are settled in equity including dividends accumulated 
from the date of award to vesting.

Guarantees and contingencies arising in the ordinary course of business, for which no security has been given, are not expected to result in any 
material financial loss.

Research and development collaboration payments
The Group has various ongoing collaborations, including in-licensing and similar arrangements with development partners. Such collaborations 
may require the Group to make payments on achievement of stages of development, launch or revenue milestones, although the Group generally 
has the right to terminate these agreements at no cost. The Group recognises research and development milestones as an intangible asset once 
it is committed to payment, which is generally when the Group reaches set trigger points in the development cycle. Revenue-related milestones 
are recognised as intangible assets on product launch at a value based on the Group’s long-term revenue forecasts for the related product. The 
table below indicates potential development and revenue-related payments that the Group may be required to make under such collaborations.

The table includes all potential payments for achievement of milestones under ongoing research and development arrangements. Revenue-related 
milestone payments represent the maximum possible amount payable on achievement of specified levels of revenue as set out in individual contract 
agreements, but exclude variable payments that are based on unit sales (e.g. royalty-type payments) which are expensed as the associated sale 
is recognised. The table excludes any payments already capitalised in the Financial Statements for the year ended 31 December 2023 which have 
been capitalised with reference to the latest Group sales forecasts for approved indications.

The future payments we disclose represent contracted payments and, as such, are not discounted and are not risk-adjusted. As detailed in the 
Risk section from page 54, the development of any pharmaceutical product candidate is a complex and risky process that may fail at any stage 
in the development process due to a number of factors (including items such as failure to obtain regulatory approval, unfavourable data from key 
studies, adverse reactions to the product candidate or indications of other safety concerns). The timing of the payments is based on the Group’s 
current best estimate of achievement of the relevant milestone.

Environmental costs and liabilities
The Group’s expenditure on environmental protection, including both capital and revenue items, relates to costs that are necessary for implementing 
internal systems and programmes, and meeting legal and regulatory requirements for processes and products. This includes investment to conserve 
natural resources and otherwise minimise the impact of our activities on the environment. 

They are an integral part of normal ongoing expenditure for carrying out the Group’s research, manufacturing and commercial operations and are 
not separated from overall operating and development costs. There are no known changes in legal, regulatory or other requirements resulting in 
material changes to the levels of expenditure for 2021, 2022 or 2023.

In addition to expenditure for meeting current and foreseen environmental protection requirements, the Group incurs costs in investigating and cleaning 
up legacy land and groundwater contamination. In particular, AstraZeneca has environmental liabilities at some currently or formerly owned, leased 
and third-party sites. 

In the US, Zeneca Inc., and/or its indemnitees, have been named as potentially responsible parties (PRPs) or defendants at a number of sites where 
Zeneca Inc. is likely to incur future environmental investigation, remediation, operation and maintenance costs under federal, state, statutory or 
common law environmental liability allocation schemes (together, US Environmental Consequences). Similarly, Stauffer Management Company LLC 
(SMC), which was established in 1987 to own and manage certain assets of Stauffer Chemical Company acquired that year, and/or its indemnitees, 
have been named as PRPs or defendants at a number of sites where SMC is likely to incur US Environmental Consequences. 

AstraZeneca has also given indemnities to third parties for a number of sites outside the US. These environmental liabilities arise from legacy operations 
that are not currently part of the Group’s business and, at most of these sites, remediation, where required, is either completed or in progress. 
AstraZeneca has made provisions for the estimated costs of future environmental investigation, remediation, operation and maintenance activity 
beyond normal ongoing expenditure for maintaining the Group’s R&D and manufacturing capacity and product ranges, where a present obligation 
exists, it is probable that such costs will be incurred and they can be estimated reliably. With respect to such estimated future costs, there were 
provisions at 31 December 2023 in the aggregate of $112m (2022: $131m; 2021: $90m), mainly relating to the US. Where we are jointly liable or 
otherwise have cost-sharing agreements with third parties, we reflect only our share of the obligation. Where the liability is insured in part or in 
whole by insurance or other arrangements for reimbursement, an asset is recognised to the extent that this recovery is virtually certain. 

It is possible that AstraZeneca could incur future environmental costs beyond the extent of our current provisions. The extent of such possible 
additional costs is inherently difficult to estimate due to a number of factors, including: (1) the nature and extent of claims that may be asserted in the 
future; (2) whether AstraZeneca has or will have any legal obligation with respect to asserted or unasserted claims; (3) the type of remedial action, 
if any, that may be selected at sites where the remedy is presently not known; (4) the potential for recoveries from or allocation of liability to third 
parties; and (5) the length of time that the environmental investigation, remediation and liability allocation process can take. As per our accounting 
policy on page 158, Provisions for these costs are made when there is a present obligation and where it is probable that expenditure on remedial 
work will be required and a reliable estimate can be made of the cost. Notwithstanding and subject to the foregoing, we estimate the potential 
additional loss for future environmental investigation, remediation, remedial operation and maintenance activity above and beyond our provisions 
to be, in aggregate, between $114m and $191m (2022: $113m and $188m; 2021: $99m and $165m) which relates mainly to the US.

204

AstraZeneca Annual Report & Form 20-F Information 2023Financial StatementsLegal proceedings
AstraZeneca is involved in various legal 
proceedings considered typical to its 
business, including actual or threatened 
litigation and actual or potential government 
investigations relating to employment matters, 
product liability, commercial disputes, pricing, 
sales and marketing practices, infringement of 
IP rights, and the validity of certain patents 
and competition laws. The more significant 
matters are discussed below.

Most of the claims involve highly complex 
issues. Often these issues are subject to 
substantial uncertainties and, therefore, the 
probability of a loss, if any, being sustained 
and/or an estimate of the amount of any loss 
is difficult to ascertain.

We do not believe that disclosure of the 
amounts sought by plaintiffs, if known, would 
be meaningful with respect to these legal 
proceedings. This is due to a number of 
factors, including (i) the stage of the 
proceedings (in many cases trial dates have 
not been set) and the overall length and extent 
of pre-trial discovery; (ii) the entitlement of the 
parties to an action to appeal a decision; (iii) 
clarity as to theories of liability, damages and 
governing law; (iv) uncertainties in timing of 
litigation; and (v) the possible need for further 
legal proceedings to establish the appropriate 
amount of damages, if any.

While there can be no assurance regarding 
the outcome of any of the legal proceedings 
referred to in this Note 30, based on 
management’s current and considered view of 
each situation, we do not currently expect 
them to have a material adverse effect on our 
financial position including within the next 
financial year. This position could of course 
change over time, not least because of the 
factors referred to above.

 Assessments as to whether or not to 
recognise provisions or assets, and of the 
amounts concerned, usually involve a series of 
complex judgements about future events and 
can rely heavily on estimates and assumptions. 
AstraZeneca believes that the provisions 
recorded are adequate based on currently 
available information and that the insurance 
recoveries recorded will be received. However, 
given the inherent uncertainties involved in 
assessing the outcomes of these cases, and in 
estimating the amount of the potential losses 
and the associated insurance recoveries, we 
could in the future incur judgments or insurance 
settlements that could have a material adverse 
effect on our results in any particular period.

IP claims include challenges to the Group’s 
patents on various products or processes and 
assertions of non-infringement of patents. 
A loss in any of these cases could result in loss 
of patent protection on the related product.

The consequences of any such loss could be 
a significant decrease in Product Sales, which 
could have a material adverse effect on our 
results. The lawsuits filed by AstraZeneca for 
patent infringement against companies that 
have filed abbreviated new drug applications 
(ANDAs) in the US, seeking to market generic 
forms of products sold by the Group prior to the 
expiry of the applicable patents covering these 
products, typically also involve allegations of 
non-infringement, invalidity and unenforceability 
of these patents by the ANDA filers. In the event 
that the Group is unsuccessful in these actions 
or the statutory 30-month stay expires before 
a ruling is obtained, the ANDA filers involved 
will also have the ability, subject to FDA 
approval, to introduce generic versions of the 
product concerned.

AstraZeneca has full confidence in, and will 
vigorously defend and enforce, its IP.

In cases that have been settled or 
adjudicated, or where quantifiable fines and 
penalties have been assessed and which are 
not subject to appeal (or other similar forms of 
relief), or where a loss is probable and we are 
able to make a reasonable estimate of the 
loss, we generally indicate the loss absorbed 
or make a provision for our best estimate of 
the expected loss.

Where it is considered that the Group is more 
likely than not to prevail, legal costs involved 
in defending the claim are charged to profit as 
they are incurred.

Over the course of the past several years, 
including in 2023, a significant number of 
commercial litigation claims in which 
AstraZeneca is involved have been resolved, 
particularly in the US, thereby reducing potential 
contingent liability exposure arising from such 
litigation. Similarly, in part due to patent litigation 
and settlement developments, greater certainty 
has been achieved regarding possible generic 
entry dates with respect to some of our patented 
products. At the same time, like other companies 
in the pharmaceutical sector and other 
industries, AstraZeneca continues to be subject 
to government investigations around the world.

Where it is considered that the Group has a 
valid contract which provides the right to 
reimbursement (from insurance or otherwise) 
of legal costs and/or all or part of any loss 
incurred or for which a provision has been 
established, and we consider recovery to be 
virtually certain, the best estimate of the 
amount expected to be received is recognised 
as an asset.

Patent litigation
Legal proceedings brought against AstraZeneca 
for which a provision has been taken
Imfinzi and Imjudo
US and ROW patent proceedings
In February 2022, in Japan, Ono Pharmaceuticals 
filed a lawsuit in Tokyo District Court, Civil 
Division against AstraZeneca alleging that 
AstraZeneca’s marketing of Imfinzi in Japan 
infringed several of their patents. 

 Notes to the Group Financial Statements

In March 2022, Bristol-Myers Squibb Co. and 
E.R. Squibb & Sons, LLC filed a lawsuit in the 
US District Court for the District of Delaware 
(District Court) against AstraZeneca alleging 
that AstraZeneca’s marketing of Imfinzi 
infringed several of their patents. In April 2023, 
Bristol-Myers Squibb Co., E.R. Squibb & Sons, 
LLC, Tasuku Honjo, Ono Pharmaceutical Co., 
Ltd., and the Dana-Farber Cancer Institute Inc. 
filed a separate lawsuit in the District Court 
against AstraZeneca alleging that AstraZeneca’s 
marketing of Imfinzi infringed another of 
their patents. 

In January 2023, Bristol-Myers Squibb Co. 
and E.R. Squibb & Sons, LLC filed a lawsuit 
in the District Court against AstraZeneca 
alleging that AstraZeneca’s marketing of 
Imjudo infringed two of their patents. 

In July 2023, AstraZeneca entered into a global 
settlement agreement with Bristol-Myers 
Squibb Co., E.R. Squibb & Sons, LLC, and 
Ono Pharmaceutical Co., Ltd. that resolves 
all patent disputes between the companies 
relating to Imfinzi and Imjudo. In June 2023, 
a provision was taken totaling $510m.

These matters are now concluded.

Legal proceedings brought against AstraZeneca 
considered to be contingent liabilities
Enhertu
US patent proceedings
In October 2020, Seagen Inc. (Seagen) filed 
a complaint against Daiichi Sankyo Company, 
Limited (Daiichi Sankyo) in the US District Court 
for the Eastern District of Texas (District Court) 
alleging that Enhertu infringes a Seagen patent. 
AstraZeneca co-commercialises Enhertu with 
Daiichi Sankyo, Inc. in the US. After trial in April 
2022, the jury found that the patent was infringed 
and awarded Seagen $41.82m in past damages. 
In July 2022, the District Court entered final 
judgment and declined to enhance damages 
on the basis of wilfulness. In October 2023, 
the District Court entered an amended final 
judgment that requires Daiichi Sankyo to pay 
Seagen a royalty of 8% on US sales of Enhertu 
from April 1, 2022, through November 4, 2024, in 
addition to the past damages previously awarded 
by the Court. AstraZeneca and Daiichi Sankyo 
have appealed the District Court’s decision.

In December 2020 and January 2021, 
AstraZeneca and Daiichi Sankyo, Inc. filed 
post-grant review (PGR) petitions with the US 
Patent and Trademark Office (USPTO) alleging, 
inter alia, that the Seagen patent is invalid for 
lack of written description and enablement. 
The USPTO initially declined to institute the 
PGRs, but, in April 2022, the USPTO granted 
the rehearing requests, instituting both PGR 
petitions. Seagen subsequently disclaimed 
all patent claims at issue in one of the PGR 
proceedings. In July 2022, the USPTO reversed 
its institution decision and declined to institute 
the other PGR petition. AstraZeneca and Daiichi 
Sankyo, Inc. requested reconsideration of the 
decision not to institute review of the patent.

Product liability litigation 
Legal proceedings brought against AstraZeneca 
for which a provision has been taken
Nexium and Losec/Prilosec
US proceedings
AstraZeneca has been defending lawsuits 
brought in federal and state courts involving 
claims that plaintiffs have been diagnosed with 
various injuries following treatment with proton 
pump inhibitors (PPIs), including Nexium and 
Prilosec. Most of the lawsuits alleged kidney 
injury. In August 2017, the pending federal court 
cases were consolidated in a multidistrict 
litigation (MDL) proceeding in the US District 
Court for the District of New Jersey for 
pre-trial purposes. In addition to the MDL 
cases, there were cases alleging kidney injury 
filed in Delaware and New Jersey state courts.

In addition, AstraZeneca has been defending 
lawsuits involving allegations of gastric cancer 
following treatment with PPIs, including one 
such claim in the US District Court for the 
Middle District of Louisiana (Louisiana 
District Court).

In October 2023, AstraZeneca resolved all 
pending claims in the MDL, as well as all 
pending claims in Delaware and New Jersey 
state courts, for $425m, for which a provision 
has been taken. The only remaining case is 
the one pending in the Louisiana District 
Court. The Court in that case has postponed 
trial, which was previously scheduled to begin 
in April 2024. No new trial date has been set.

Nexium and Losec/Prilosec
Canada proceedings
In Canada, in July and August 2017, 
AstraZeneca was served with three putative 
class action lawsuits. Two of the lawsuits 
have been dismissed, one in 2019 and one in 
2021. The third lawsuit seeks authorisation to 
represent individual residents in Canada who 
allegedly suffered kidney injuries from the use 
of proton pump inhibitors, including Nexium 
and Losec. 

Caelum Trade Secrets Litigation
US proceedings
AstraZeneca has been defending a matter 
filed by the University of Tennessee Research 
Foundation in the US District Court for the 
Eastern District of Tennessee (District Court) 
related to CAEL-101. In October 2023, 
AstraZeneca filed a motion for summary 
judgment on all claims and awaits a decision by 
the District Court. Trial is currently scheduled 
for September 2024. 

Onglyza and Kombiglyze
US proceedings 
In the US, AstraZeneca is defending various 
lawsuits alleging heart failure, cardiac injuries, 
and/or death from treatment with Onglyza or 
Kombiglyze. In August 2022, the US District 
Court for the Eastern District of Kentucky, 
presiding over the consolidated federal cases, 
granted AstraZeneca’s motion for summary 
judgment, which plaintiffs have appealed to 
the US Court of Appeals for the Sixth Circuit. 
In the California state court proceeding, the 
trial court granted summary judgment for 
AstraZeneca, which the California appellate 
court affirmed. The California Supreme Court 
has declined further review, so the California 
state court proceeding has concluded.

Anti-Terrorism Act Civil Lawsuit
US proceedings
In the US, in October 2017, AstraZeneca and 
certain other pharmaceutical and/or medical 
device companies were named as defendants 
in a complaint filed in the US District Court for 
the District of Columbia (District Court) by US 
nationals (or their estates, survivors, or heirs) 
who were killed or wounded in Iraq between 
2005 and 2013. The plaintiffs allege that the 
defendants violated the US Anti-Terrorism 
Act and various state laws by selling 
pharmaceuticals and medical supplies to the 
Iraqi Ministry of Health. In July 2020, the District 
Court granted AstraZeneca’s and the other 
defendants’ motion to dismiss the lawsuit, which 
the DC Circuit Court of Appeals (the Appellate 
Court) reversed in January 2022. In February 
2023, the Appellate Court denied a request for 
en banc review. In June 2023, AstraZeneca 
and the other defendants filed a petition for 
review by the United States Supreme Court.

Definiens
Germany proceedings
In Germany, in July 2020, AstraZeneca received 
a notice of arbitration filed with the German

Definiens AG (the Sellers) regarding the 2014 
Share Purchase Agreement (SPA) between 
AstraZeneca and the Sellers. The Sellers claim 
that they are owed approximately $140m in 
earn-outs under the SPA. The arbitration hearing 
took place in March 2023 and final post-hearing 
written briefs were submitted in June 2023. In 
December 2023, the arbitration panel made a 
final award of $46.43m in favour of the Sellers. 
AstraZeneca is considering its options. 

Employment Litigation
US proceedings 
In December 2022, AstraZeneca was served 
with a lawsuit filed by seven former employees 
in the US District Court for the District of 
Delaware (District Court) asserting age, religion, 
and disability discrimination claims related to 
AstraZeneca’s vaccination requirement. In March 
2023, AstraZeneca filed a motion to dismiss the 
religious and disability discrimination claims and 
a motion to strike the class and collective claims. 
That motion is fully briefed and the parties are 
awaiting a decision by the District Court.

Pay Equity Litigation
US proceedings 
AstraZeneca was defending a putative class 
and collective action matter in the US District 
Court for the Northern District of Illinois (District 
Court) brought by three named plaintiffs, who 
are former AstraZeneca employees. The case 
involved claims under the federal and Illinois 
Equal Pay Acts, with the plaintiffs alleging they 
were paid less than male employees who 
performed substantially similar and/or equal 
work. In January 2023, the District Court granted 
AstraZeneca’s motion to dismiss plaintiffs’ 
complaint. In March 2023, plaintiffs filed a 
Second Amended Complaint. AstraZeneca 
moved to dismiss the Second Amended 
Complaint in April 2023. The motion to dismiss 
was denied in October 2023, and the parties 
are proceeding with discovery.

Seroquel XR (Antitrust Litigation)
US proceedings
In 2019, AstraZeneca was named in several 
related complaints brought in the US District 
Court for the Southern District of New York 
(District Court), including several putative 
class action lawsuits that were purportedly 
brought on behalf of classes of direct

purchasers or end payors of Seroquel XR, 
that allege AstraZeneca and generic drug 
manufacturers violated US antitrust laws when 
settling patent litigation related to Seroquel XR. 
In July 2022, in response to AstraZeneca’s 
motion to dismiss, the District Court dismissed 
all claims relating to the settlement with one 
of the generic manufacturers but denied the 
motion with respect to all claims relating to 
the second generic manufacturer and allowed 
those claims to proceed. Trial is currently 
scheduled for May 2025. 

Legal proceedings brought against AstraZeneca 
which have been concluded
Alexion Shareholder Litigation
US proceedings 
In December 2016, putative securities class 
action lawsuits were filed in the US District 
Court for the District of Connecticut (District 
Court) against Alexion and certain officers and 
directors (collectively, defendants), on behalf of 
purchasers of Alexion publicly traded securities 
during the period 30 January 2014 through 
26 May 2017. The amended complaint alleged 
that defendants engaged in securities fraud, 
including by making misrepresentations and 
omissions in their public disclosures concerning 
Alexion’s Soliris sales practices, management 
changes, and related investigations. In August 
2021, the District Court issued a decision 
denying in part defendants’ motion to dismiss 
the matter. The Court granted plaintiffs’ motion 
for class certification in April 2023. In August 
2023, the parties reached a settlement in 
principle of this matter. In September 2023, 
the court granted preliminary approval of the 
class settlement. A provision was taken in 
September 2023. The court granted final 
approval of the class settlement in December 
2023, and the matter is now concluded.

AZD1222 Securities Litigation
US proceedings
In January 2021, putative securities class action 
lawsuits were filed in the US District Court for 
the Southern District of New York (District Court) 
against AstraZeneca PLC and certain officers, 
on behalf of purchasers of AstraZeneca publicly 
traded securities during a period later amended 
to cover 15 June 2020 through 29 January 
2021. The Amended Complaint alleges that 
defendants made materially false and misleading 
statements in connection with the development 
of AZD1222, AstraZeneca’s vaccine for the 
prevention of COVID-19. In September 2022, 
the District Court granted AstraZeneca’s 
motion to dismiss the Amended Complaint 
with prejudice. In May 2023, the US Court of 
Appeals for the Second Circuit affirmed the 
dismissal. The matter is now concluded. 

Portola Shareholder Litigation
US proceedings
In connection with Alexion’s July 2020 
acquisition of Portola Pharmaceuticals, Inc. 
(Portola), Alexion assumed litigation to which 
Portola is a party. In January 2020, putative 
securities class action lawsuits were filed in 
the US District Court for the Northern District 
of California against Portola and certain officers 
and directors (collectively, defendants), on 
behalf of purchasers of Portola publicly traded 
securities during the period 8 January 2019 
through 26 February 2020. The operative 
complaints alleged that defendants made 
materially false and/or misleading statements 
or omissions with regard to Andexxa. In June 
2022, the parties reached a settlement in 
principle of this matter. In March 2023, the 
court granted final approval of the settlement. 
The matter is now concluded.

Government investigations/proceedings

340B Qui Tam
US proceedings
In July 2023, AstraZeneca was served with an 
unsealed civil lawsuit brought by a qui tam 
relator on behalf of the United States, several 
states, and the District of Columbia in the 
US District Court for the Central District 
of California. The complaint alleges that 
AstraZeneca violated the US False Claims Act 
(FCA) and state-law analogues. In September 
2023, AstraZeneca filed a motion to dismiss 
the relator’s claims. In response, the relator 
filed a First Amended Complaint. In December 
2023, AstraZeneca filed a motion to dismiss 
the First Amended Complaint.

340B Administrative Proceedings
US proceedings
In September 2023, the Arkansas Insurance 
Department sent AstraZeneca an administrative 
complaint concerning compliance with 
Arkansas’s 340B Statute, which requires 
manufacturers to recognize an unlimited number 
of contract pharmacies.

Previously disclosed Administrative Dispute 
Resolution proceedings against AstraZeneca 
remain pending before the US Health Resources 
and Services Administration.

Brazilian Tax Assessment Matter 
Brazil proceedings
In connection with an ongoing matter, in August 
2019, the Brazilian Federal Revenue Service 
provided a Notice of Tax and Description of 
the Facts (the Tax Assessment) to two Alexion 
subsidiaries (the Brazil Subsidiaries), as well as 
to two additional entities – a logistics provider 
utilised by Alexion and a distributor. The Tax 
Assessment focuses on the importation of 
Soliris vials pursuant to Alexion’s free drug 
supply to patients programme in Brazil.

Alexion prevailed in the first level of 
administrative appeals in the Brazilian federal 
administrative proceeding system based on a 
deficiency in the Brazil Tax Assessment. The 
decision was subject to an automatic (ex officio) 
appeal to the second level of the administrative 
courts. In March 2023, the second level of the 
administrative courts issued a decision to 
remand the matter to the first level of 
administrative courts for a determination on 
the merits.

Texas Qui Tam
US proceedings
In December 2022, AstraZeneca was served 
with an unsealed civil lawsuit brought by qui tam 
relators on behalf of the State of Texas in Texas 
state court, which alleges that AstraZeneca 
engaged in unlawful marketing practices. In 
March 2023, AstraZeneca filed a motion to 
dismiss and a motion to transfer venue. In 
response, relators filed an Amended Petition. 
In May 2023, AstraZeneca filed a motion to 

Syntimmune
US proceedings
In connection with Alexion’s prior acquisition of 
Syntimmune, Inc., (Syntimmune) in December 
2020, Alexion was served with a lawsuit 
filed by the stockholders’ representative for 
Syntimmune in Delaware state court that 
alleged, among other things, breaches of 
contractual obligations relating to the 2018 
merger agreement. The stockholders’ 
representative alleges that Alexion failed to 
meet its obligations under the merger 
agreement to use commercially reasonable 
efforts to achieve the milestones. Alexion also 
filed a claim for breach of the representations 
in the 2018 merger agreement. A trial was held 
in July 2023 and a decision is expected in 2024.

Viela Bio, Inc. Shareholder Litigation 
US proceedings
In February 2023, AstraZeneca was served with 
a lawsuit filed in Delaware state court against 
AstraZeneca and certain officers (collectively, 
defendants), on behalf of a putative class 
of Viela Bio, Inc. (Viela) shareholders. The 
complaint alleges that defendants breached 
their fiduciary duty to Viela shareholders in the 
course of Viela’s 2021 merger with Horizon 
Therapeutics, plc. In May 2023, AstraZeneca 
filed a motion to dismiss, which is now fully 
briefed and pending before the Court.

by GlaxoSmithKline plc, (GSK)) entered into 
two worldwide, royalty-bearing patent license 
agreements with AstraZeneca related to GSK’s 
product niraparib. In May 2021, AstraZeneca 
filed a lawsuit against GSK in the Commercial 
Court of England and Wales alleging that GSK 
has failed to pay all of the royalties due on 
niraparib sales under the license agreements. 
The case was transferred to the Chancery 
Division and a trial took place in March 2023. 
In April 2023, the court issued a decision in

Turkish Ministry of Health Matter
Turkey proceedings
In Turkey, in July 2020, the Turkish Ministry 
of Health (Ministry of Health) initiated an 
investigation regarding payments to healthcare 
providers by Alexion Turkey and former 
employees and consultants. The investigation 
arose from Alexion’s disclosure of a $21.5m 
civil settlement with the US Securities & 
Exchange Commission (SEC) in July 2020 fully 
resolving the SEC’s investigation into possible 
violations of the US Foreign Corrupt Practices 
Act. In September 2021, the Ministry of Health 
completed its draft investigation report, and 
referred the matter to the Ankara Public 
Prosecutor’s Office with a recommendation 
for further proceedings against certain 
former employees.

US Congressional Inquiry
US proceedings 
In January 2024, AstraZeneca received a letter 
from the US Senate Committee on Health, 
Education, Labor and Pensions (HELP 
Committee) seeking information related to 
AstraZeneca’s inhaled Respiratory products. 
AstraZeneca intends to cooperate with 
the inquiry.

Vermont US Attorney Investigation
US proceedings 
In April 2020, AstraZeneca received a Civil 
Investigative Demand from the US Attorney’s 
Office in Vermont and the Department of 
Justice, Civil Division, seeking documents 
and information relating to AstraZeneca’s 
relationships with electronic health-record 
vendors. AstraZeneca continues to cooperate

guidance and regulations promulgated by the 
US Department of Health and Human Services.

Louisiana 340B Litigation 
US proceedings 
In August 2023, AstraZeneca filed a lawsuit 
against the State of Louisiana alleging that 
the Louisiana’s 340B statute, which requires 
manufacturers to recognize an unlimited 
number of contract pharmacies, is preempted 
on several grounds and violates the Contracts 
Clause of the U.S. Constitution. AstraZeneca 
and the State of Louisiana have moved for 
summary judgment on AstraZeneca’s claims.

COVID-19 Vaccine Supply and 
Manufacturing Inquiries
Brazil proceedings
In February 2022, a Brazilian Public 
Prosecutor filed a lawsuit against several 
defendants including the Brazilian Federal 
Government, AstraZeneca, and other 
COVID-19 vaccine manufacturers. In April 2022, 
a Brazilian Court issued an order dismissing 
the lawsuit. In October 2023, the pending 
appeal was dismissed. No further appeal was 
made. This matter is now concluded. 

Legal proceedings brought by AstraZeneca 
which have been concluded
US 340B Litigation
US proceedings 
In January 2021, AstraZeneca filed a lawsuit in 
the US District Court for the District of Delaware 
(District Court) alleging that an Advisory Opinion 
issued by the Department of Health and Human 
Services violates the Administrative Procedure 
Act. In June 2021, the District Court found in 
favour of AstraZeneca, invalidating the Advisory 
Opinion. However, in May 2021, prior to the 
District Court’s ruling, the US Government 
issued new and separate letters to AstraZeneca 
(and other companies) asserting that 
AstraZeneca’s contract pharmacy policy violates 
the 340B statute. AstraZeneca amended the 
complaint to include allegations challenging the 
letter sent in May 2021, and in February 2022, 
the District Court ruled in favour of AstraZeneca 
invalidating those letters sent by the US 
Government. In January 2023, the Court of 
Appeals affirmed the District Court’s decision 
in AstraZeneca’s favour. Final judgment was 
entered in favour of AstraZeneca in May 2023 
and this matter is now concluded. 

Other
Additional government inquiries
As is true for most, if not all, major prescription 
pharmaceutical companies, AstraZeneca is 
currently involved in multiple inquiries into drug 
marketing and pricing practices. In addition to 
the investigations described above, various law 
enforcement offices have, from time to time, 
requested information from the Group. There 
have been no material developments in 
those matters.

Tax
AstraZeneca considers whether it is probable 
that a taxation authority will accept an uncertain 
tax treatment. If it is concluded that it is not 
probable that the taxation authority will accept 
an uncertain tax treatment, where tax exposures 
can be quantified, a tax liability is recognised 
based on either the most likely amount method 
or the expected value method depending on 
which method management expects to better 
predict the resolution of the uncertainty. Tax 
liabilities for uncertain tax treatments can be 
built up over a long period of time but the 
resolution of such tax exposures usually occurs 
at a point in time, and given the inherent 

uncertainties in assessing the outcomes of these 
exposures (which sometimes can be binary in 
nature), we could, in future periods, experience 
adjustments to the liabilities recognised in 
respect of uncertain tax treatments that have 
a material positive or negative effect on our 
results in any particular period. Details of the 
movements in relation to material uncertain 
tax treatments are discussed below.

 AstraZeneca faces a number of audits 
and reviews in jurisdictions around the world 
and, in some cases, is in dispute with the tax 
authorities. The issues under discussion are 
often complex and can require many years to 
resolve. Tax liabilities recognised for uncertain 
tax treatments require management to make 
key judgements with respect to the outcome 
of current and potential future tax audits, and 
actual results could vary from these estimates. 
Management does not believe a significant 
risk of material change to uncertain tax 
positions exists in the next 12 months.

The total net tax liability recognised in the Group 
Financial Statements in respect of uncertain 
tax positions is $1,336m (2022: $830m; 2021: 
$768m). The net tax liability consists of $1,241m 
(2022: $632m; 2021: $702m) included within 
income tax payable, $441m (2022: $291m; 
2021: $(33)m) included within deferred tax 
asset, partially offset by $9m (2022: $(20)m; 
2021: $(17)m) included within deferred tax 
liabilities, and $337m (2022: $113m; 2021: 
additional $82m) included within income 
tax receivable.

Transfer pricing
The net tax liability included in the Group 
Financial Statements to cover the worldwide 
exposure to uncertain tax treatments is $401m 
(2022: $260m; 2021: $77m). The increase in the 
net tax liability for uncertain tax positions relating 
to transfer pricing of $141m compared with 2022 
is mainly as a result of an increase of tax 
liabilities arising from updates to estimates of 
prior period tax liabilities following progression 
of tax authority reviews.

These matters can be complex and 
judgemental. The liability includes uncertain 
tax treatments which are estimated using the 
expected value method and depend on 
AstraZeneca’s assessment of the likelihood of 
the approach taken by the tax authorities and 
could change in the future to reflect progress 
in tax authority reviews, the extent that any 
tax authority challenge is concluded, or 
matters lapse including following expiry of the 
relevant statutes of limitation resulting in a 
reduction in the tax charge in future periods.

For transfer pricing matters, including items 
under tax audit, AstraZeneca estimates the 
potential for additional tax liabilities above the 
amount provided where the possibility of the 
additional liabilities falling due is more than 
remote, to be up to $386m (2022: $245m; 
2021: $48m) including associated interest.

AstraZeneca Annual Report & Form 20-F Information 2023Corporate GovernanceAdditional InformationFinancial StatementsStrategic Report30 Commitments, contingent liabilities and contingent assets continued
Management believes that it is unlikely that these 
additional liabilities will arise. It is possible that 
some of these contingencies may change in the 
future to reflect progress in tax authority reviews, 
to the extent that any tax authority challenge is 
concluded or matters lapse including following 
expiry of the relevant statutes of limitation 
resulting in a reduction in the tax charge in 
future periods. Management continues to 
believe that AstraZeneca’s positions on all its 
transfer pricing positions, audits and disputes 
are robust, and that AstraZeneca has recognised 
appropriate tax balances, including 
consideration of whether corresponding relief 
will be available under Mutual Agreement 
procedures or unilaterally.

appeal processes. The liability includes tax 
liabilities in respect of uncertain tax treatments 
which are estimated using the most likely

Other uncertain tax treatments
Included in the net tax liability is $935m (2022: 
$570m; 2021: $691m) relating to a number of 
other uncertain tax treatments. The increase 
of $365m in the net tax liability relating to the 
other uncertain tax treatments mainly relates 
to an update to tax liabilities following progress 
of reviews by tax authorities and administrative 

31 Statutory and other information

For these other tax liabilities in respect of 
uncertain tax treatments, AstraZeneca estimates 
the potential for additional liabilities above the 
amount provided where the possibility of the 
additional liabilities falling due is more than 
remote, to be up to $293m (2022: $209m; 
2021: $273m) including associated interest. 
It is possible that some of these liabilities may 
reduce in the future if any tax authority challenge 
is concluded or matters lapse following expiry 
of the relevant statutes of limitation, resulting

significant other uncertain tax treatments 
where the possibility of the additional liabilities 
falling due is more than remote (2022: $280m; 
2021: $325m) including associated interest.

Timing of cash flows and interest
The Group is currently under audit in several 
countries and the timing of any resolution of 
these audits is uncertain.

It is anticipated that tax payments may be 
required in relation to a number of significant 
disputes which may be resolved over the next 
one to two years. AstraZeneca considers the tax 
liabilities set out above to appropriately reflect 
the expected value of any final settlement. 
Some of the items discussed above are not 
currently within the scope of tax authority audits 
and may take longer to resolve.

Included within other payables is a net amount 
of interest arising on tax contingencies of 
$184m (2022: $106m; 2021: $85m).

 Company Statement of Changes in Equity

217

AstraZeneca Annual Report & Form 20-F Information 2023Corporate GovernanceAdditional InformationFinancial StatementsStrategic ReportCompany Accounting Policies

Basis of presentation of 
financial information
The Company is a private limited company, 
limited by shares, incorporated and domiciled 
in England & Wales. The registered address is 
1 Francis Crick Avenue, Cambridge Biomedical 
Campus, Cambridge, CB2 0AA.

These financial statements were prepared 
in accordance with FRS 101 ‘Reduced 
Disclosure Framework’.

In preparing these financial statements, 
the Company applied the recognition, 
measurement and disclosure requirements of 
International Financial Reporting Standards as 
adopted by the UK (UK-adopted international 
accounting standards), but made amendments 
where necessary in order to comply with the 
Companies Act 2006 and to take advantage 
of FRS 101 disclosure exemptions. 

In these financial statements, the Company 
has applied the exemptions available under 
FRS 101 in respect of the following disclosures:

>  Statement of Cash Flows and related notes
>  disclosures in respect of transactions 

with wholly owned subsidiaries

>  disclosures in respect of 
capital management

>  the effects of new but not yet 

effective IFRSs

>  disclosures in respect of the compensation 

of Key Management Personnel.

As the Group Financial Statements (presented 
on pages 148 to 210) include the equivalent 
disclosures, the Company has also taken the 
exemptions under FRS 101 available in respect 
of the following disclosures:

> 

IFRS 2 ‘Share-based Payment’ in respect 
of Group settled share-based payments
>  certain disclosures required by IFRS 13 

‘Fair Value Measurement’ and the 
disclosures required by IFRS 7 ‘Financial 
Instruments: Disclosures’.

No individual profit and loss account is 
prepared as provided by section 408 of the 
Companies Act 2006.

Basis of accounting
The Company Financial Statements are 
prepared under the historical cost convention 
and on a going concern basis, in accordance 
with the Companies Act 2006.

The following paragraphs describe the 
main accounting policies, which have been 
applied consistently.

Estimates and judgements
The preparation of the Company Financial 
Statements in conformity with generally 
accepted accounting principles requires 
management to make estimates and 
judgements that affect the reported amounts of 
assets and liabilities at the date of the Financial 
Statements and the reported amounts of 
revenues and expenses during the reporting 
period. Actual results could differ from those 
estimates. There are no key judgements or 
significant estimates.

Foreign currencies
Foreign currency transactions, being 
transactions denominated in a currency other 
than the Company’s functional currency, are 
translated into US dollars at average rates 
for the relevant monthly accounting periods, 
which approximate to actual rates. 

Monetary assets and liabilities arising from 
foreign currency transactions are retranslated 
at exchange rates prevailing at the reporting 
date. Exchange gains and losses on loans and 
on short-term foreign currency borrowings 
and deposits are included within Finance 
expense. Exchange differences on all other 
foreign currency transactions are recognised 
in Operating profit.

Non-monetary items arising from foreign 
currency transactions are not retranslated in 
the Company’s accounting records.

Taxation
The current tax payable is based on taxable 
profit for the year. Taxable profit differs from 
reported profit because taxable profit excludes 
items that are either never taxable or tax 
deductible or items that are taxable or tax 
deductible in a different period. The Company’s 
current tax assets and liabilities are calculated 
using tax rates that have been enacted or 
substantively enacted by the reporting date.

Deferred tax is provided using the balance 
sheet liability method, providing for temporary 
differences between the carrying amounts of 
assets and liabilities for financial reporting 
purposes and the amounts used for taxation 
purposes. Deferred tax liabilities are recognised 
unless they arise from the initial recognition 
(other than in a business combination) of 
assets and liabilities in a transaction that 
affects neither the taxable profit nor the 
accounting profit. Deferred tax liabilities are 
not recognised to the extent they arise from 
the initial recognition of non-tax deductible 
goodwill. Deferred tax assets are recognised 
to the extent that there are future taxable 
temporary differences or it is probable that 
future taxable profit will be available against 
which the asset can be utilised. This requires 
judgements to be made in respect of the 
availability of future taxable income.

No deferred tax asset or liability is recognised 
in respect of temporary differences associated 
with investments in subsidiaries and branches 
where the Company is able to control the timing 
of reversal of the temporary differences and it 
is probable that the temporary differences will 
not reverse in the foreseeable future.

The Company’s deferred tax assets and 
liabilities are calculated using tax rates that 
are expected to apply in the period when the 
liability is settled or the asset realised based 
on tax rates that have been enacted or 
substantively enacted by the reporting date.

Liabilities for uncertain tax positions require 
management to make judgements of potential 
exposures in relation to tax audit issues. Tax 
benefits are not recognised unless the tax 
positions will probably be accepted by the tax 
authorities. This is based upon management’s 
interpretation of applicable laws and regulations 
and the expectation of how the tax authority will 
resolve the matter. Once considered probable 
of not being accepted, management reviews 
each material tax benefit and reflects the 
effect of the uncertainty in determining the 
related taxable result. 

Liabilities for uncertain tax positions are 
measured using either the most likely amount 
or the expected value amount depending on 
which method the Company expects to better 
predict the resolution of the uncertainty.

The Company has applied the exemption 
under the IAS 12 ‘Income Taxes’ amendment 
for recognising and disclosing information 
about deferred tax assets and liabilities related 
to top-up income taxes.

Investments
Fixed asset investments, including investments 
in subsidiaries, are stated at cost and reviewed 
for impairment if there are indications that the 
carrying value may not be recoverable.

Debtors
Amounts owed by Group undertakings are 
recognised initially at fair value. Subsequent 
to initial recognition they are measured at 
amortised cost using the effective interest 
method, less any impairment losses.

The recoverability of these balances has been 
assessed in accordance with IFRS 9 and no 
impairment has been identified. The amounts 
owed by Group undertakings are considered to 
have low credit risk, due to timely payment of 
interest and settlement of principal amount on 
agreed due dates, limiting the loss allowance 
to 12-month expected credit losses. 

218

AstraZeneca Annual Report & Form 20-F Information 2023Financial StatementsAmounts owed by Group undertakings are 
written off where there is no reasonable 
expectation of recovery. Impairment losses 
are presented as net impairment losses within 
Operating profit, any subsequent recoveries 
are credited against the same line.

Other payables
Liabilities included in Other payables are 
recognised initially at fair value. Subsequent 
to initial recognition they are remeasured at 
either amortised cost using the effective 
interest method or at fair value using an 
expected credit loss model.

Financial instruments
Interest-bearing loans are initially measured at 
fair value (with direct transaction costs being 
amortised over the life of the loan) and are 
subsequently measured at amortised cost 
using the effective interest method at each 
reporting date. Changes in carrying value are 
recognised in profit.

Share-based payments
The issuance by the Company to employees of 
its subsidiaries of a grant of awards over the 
Company’s shares, represents additional 
capital contributions by the Company to its 
subsidiaries. An additional investment in 
subsidiaries results in a corresponding increase 
in shareholders’ equity. The additional capital 
contribution is based on the fair value of the 
grant issued, allocated over the underlying 
grant’s vesting period, less the market cost of 
shares charged to subsidiaries in settlement 
of such share awards.

Litigation
Through the normal course of business, the 
AstraZeneca Group is involved in legal disputes, 
the settlement of which may involve cost to 
the Company. A provision is made where an 
adverse outcome is probable and associated 
costs, including related legal costs, can be 
estimated reliably. In other cases, appropriate 
disclosures are included.

Loans to subsidiaries consists of bonds which are issued externally and are issued back to Group undertakings with comparable terms on interest 
rates and are repayable on maturity, details of which are disclosed in Note 3. The recoverability of these inter-company loans has been assessed in 
accordance with IFRS 9 with no impairment identified. The inter-company balances are considered to have low credit risk due to timely payment 
of interest and settlement of principal amount on agreed due dates, limiting the loss allowance to 12-month expected credit losses. In 2023, there 
have been no credit losses (2022: $nil).

The other movements comprise $2m representing revaluation of carrying value of a guarantee provided to Group companies as explained in

All borrowings are issued with fixed interest rates, with the exception of the $2bn USD 2024 floating rate loans, which transitioned from LIBOR to 
a rate based on compounded daily USD Secured Overnight Funding Rate (SOFR) during the year. 

In addition, the Company acts as guarantor for bonds issued by its wholly owned subsidiaries, AstraZeneca Finance LLC and AstraZeneca Finance 
and Holdings Inc.. AstraZeneca Finance LLC is the issuer of $1,600m 0.700% Notes due 2024, $1,250m 1.200% Notes due 2026, $1,250m 1.750% 
Notes due 2028, $1,100m 4.875% Notes due 2028, $650m 4.900% Notes due 2030, $750m 2.250% Notes due 2031, and $500m 4.875% Notes due 
2033 (the ‘AstraZeneca Finance Notes’) and AstraZeneca Finance and Holdings Inc., had a $2bn bank loan which was repaid during 2023. Each series 
of AstraZeneca Finance Notes has been fully and unconditionally guaranteed by the Company. Each of the guarantees issued by AstraZeneca PLC 
is full and unconditional and joint and several.

The guarantee by AstraZeneca PLC of the AstraZeneca Finance Notes is the senior unsecured obligation of AstraZeneca PLC and ranks equally with 
all of AstraZeneca PLC’s existing and future senior unsecured and unsubordinated indebtedness. Each guarantee by AstraZeneca PLC is effectively 
subordinated to any secured indebtedness of AstraZeneca PLC to the extent of the value of the assets securing such indebtedness. The AstraZeneca 
Finance Notes are structurally subordinated to indebtedness and other liabilities of the subsidiaries of AstraZeneca PLC, none of which guarantee 
the AstraZeneca Finance Notes.

Vermont US Attorney Investigation
In April 2020, AstraZeneca received a Civil Investigative Demand from the US Attorney’s Office in Vermont and the Department of Justice, Civil 
Division, seeking documents and information relating to AstraZeneca’s relationships with electronic health-record vendors. AstraZeneca is 
cooperating with this enquiry.

AZD1222 Securities Litigation
In January 2021, putative securities class action lawsuits were filed in the US District Court for the Southern District of New York (District Court) 
against AstraZeneca PLC and certain officers, on behalf of purchasers of AstraZeneca publicly traded securities during a period later amended to

Related party transactions
During the period 1 January 2024 to 31 
January 2024, there were no transactions, 
loans, or proposed transactions between the 
Company and any related parties which were 
material to either the Company or the related 
party, or which were unusual in their nature or 
conditions (see also Note 31 to the Financial 
Statements on page 210).

Conflicts of interest
 The Articles enable the Directors to authorise 
any situation in which a Director has an 
interest that conflicts or has the potential to 
conflict with the Company’s interests and 
which would otherwise be a breach of the 
Director’s duty, under section 175 of the 
Companies Act 2006. The Board has a formal 
system in place for Directors to declare such 
situations to be considered for authorisation 
by those Directors who have no interest in the 
matter being considered.

In deciding whether to authorise a situation, 
the non-conflicted Directors must act in the 
way they consider, in good faith, would be 
most likely to promote the success of the 
Company, and they may impose limits or 
conditions when giving the authorisation, 
or subsequently, if they think this is 
appropriate. Situations considered by the 
Board and authorisations given are recorded 
in the Board minutes and in a register of 
conflicts maintained by the Company 
Secretary and are reviewed annually by the 
Board. The Board believes that this system 
operates effectively.

Shareholder fraud warning
Shareholders of AstraZeneca and many other 
companies have reported receiving 
unsolicited calls and correspondence relating 
to their shareholdings and investment matters. 
Shareholders are advised to be very cautious 
of any unsolicited approaches and to note that 
reputable firms authorised by the Financial 
Conduct Authority (FCA) are very unlikely to 
make such approaches. Such approaches are 
likely to be part of a ‘boiler room scam’ 
attempting to defraud shareholders.

Shareholders are advised to familiarise 
themselves with the information on 
scams available on the FCA website, 
www.fca.org.uk/consumers and within 
the FAQs in the Investors section of our 
website, www.astrazeneca.com.

Any suspected scams or fraudulent 
approaches should be reported to the FCA via 
its website and to AstraZeneca’s Ordinary 
Share registrar, using the contact details on 
this page.

For further information on 
dividends declared, see the 
Shareholder information 
section of our website,

Other than certain economic sanctions, which may be in force from time to time, there are no limitations under English law or the Articles on the

registered holders of notes or debentures of the Company or its wholly owned subsidiaries, Zeneca Wilmington Inc. and AstraZeneca Finance LLC.

Additional Information

The Directors’ Report includes information 
required to be given in accordance with the 
Companies Act 2006. 

Relevant information below, which is 
contained elsewhere in the Annual Report, 
is incorporated by cross reference herein. 

Subsidiaries and principal activities
The Company is the holding company for 
a group of subsidiaries whose principal 
activities are described in this Annual Report. 
The Group’s subsidiaries and their locations 
are set out in Group Subsidiaries and 
Holdings in the Financial Statements from 
page 211.

Branches and countries in which the 
Group conducts business 
In accordance with the Companies Act 2006, 
we disclose below countries of our 
representative, scientific or branch offices 
outside the UK established through various 
subsidiaries of the Company:

Algeria, Angola, Costa Rica, Cuba, Denmark, 
Egypt, Georgia, Ghana, Jordan, Lebanon, 
Norway, Portugal, Romania, Russia, Saudi 
Arabia, Serbia, Slovakia, Slovenia, Syria, 
Ukraine, United Arab Emirates, the US 
and Vietnam.

Disclosure of information to auditors
The Directors who held office at the date of 
approval of this Annual Report confirm that, 
so far as they are each aware, there is no 
relevant audit information of which the 
Company’s auditors are unaware; and each 
Director has taken all the steps that he 
or she ought to have taken as a Director to 
make himself or herself aware of any 
relevant audit information and to establish 
that the Company’s auditors are aware of 
that information.

Going concern accounting basis 
Information on the business environment in 
which AstraZeneca operates, including the 
factors underpinning the industry’s future 
growth prospects, is included in the Strategic 
Report. Details of the product portfolio of the 
Group are contained in the Strategic Report 
(in the Therapy Area Review from page 16). 
For information on patent expiry dates for key 
marketed products, see the Patent Expiries of 
Key Marketed Products Supplement on our 
website, www.astrazeneca.com/
annualreport2023. Our approach to product 
development is covered in detail with 
additional information by Therapy Area in the 
Strategic Report. For information on our 
development pipeline, see the Development 
Pipeline Supplement on our website,  
www.astrazeneca.com/annualreport2023.

The financial position of the Group, its cash 
flows, liquidity position and borrowing 
facilities are described in the Financial Review 
from page 58. In addition, Note 28 to the 
Financial Statements from page 195 includes 
the Group’s objectives, policies and 
processes for: managing capital; financial risk 
management objectives; details of its financial 
instruments and hedging activities; and its 
exposures to credit, market and liquidity risk. 
Further details of the Group’s cash balances 
and borrowings are included in Notes 17 and 
19 to the Financial Statements from page 178.

Having assessed the Principal Risks and other 
matters considered in connection with the 
Viability statement on page 55, the Board 
considers it appropriate to adopt the going 
concern basis of accounting in preparing the 
Annual Report and Financial Statements.

Shares
A shareholders’ resolution was passed at the 
2023 AGM authorising the Company to 
purchase its own shares. The Company did 
not purchase any of its own shares in 2023. 
On 31 December 2023, the Company did not 
hold any shares in treasury.

Rights, preferences and restrictions 
attaching to shares
As at 31 December 2023, the Company had 
1,550,162,626 Ordinary Shares and 50,000 
Redeemable Preference Shares in issue. The 
Ordinary Shares represent 99.98% and the 
Redeemable Preference Shares represent 
0.02% of the Company’s total share capital 
(these percentages have been calculated by 
reference to the 8am WM/Reuters USD/GBP 
exchange rate on 29 December 2023).

As agreed by the shareholders at the 
Company’s AGM held on 29 April 2010, the 
Articles were amended with immediate effect 
to remove the requirement for the Company to 
have an authorised share capital, the concept 
of which was abolished under the Companies 
Act 2006. Each Ordinary Share carries the 
right to vote at general meetings of the 
Company. The rights and restrictions 
attaching to the Redeemable Preference 
Shares differ from those attaching to Ordinary 
Shares as follows: 

 > The Redeemable Preference Shares carry 

no rights to receive dividends.

 > The holders of Redeemable Preference 

Shares have no rights to receive notices of, 
attend or vote at general meetings except in 
certain limited circumstances. They have 
one vote for every 50,000 Redeemable 
Preference Shares held.

 > On a distribution of assets of the Company, 
on a winding-up or other return of capital 
(subject to certain exceptions), the holders 
of Redeemable Preference Shares 
have priority over the holders of Ordinary 
Shares to receive the capital paid up on 
those shares.

 > Subject to the provisions of the Companies 
Act 2006, the Company has the right to 
redeem the Redeemable Preference Shares 
at any time on giving not less than seven 
days’ written notice.

There are no specific restrictions on the transfer 
of shares in the Company, which is governed by 
the Articles and prevailing legislation.

The Company is not aware of any agreements 
between holders of shares that may result in 
restrictions on the transfer of shares or that 
may result in restrictions on voting rights. 
The Company is also not aware of any 
arrangements under which financial rights 
are held by a person other than the holder 
of the shares.

Action necessary to change the rights of 
shareholders
In order to vary the rights attached to any 
class of shares, the consent in writing of the 
holders of three quarters in nominal value of 
the issued shares of that class or the sanction 
of a special resolution passed at a general 
meeting of such holders is required.

Changes in share capital
Changes in the Company’s Ordinary Share 
capital during 2023, including details of the 
allotment of new shares under the Company’s 
share plans, are given in Note 24 to the 
Financial Statements from page 192.

Employee share trust ownership rights
The trustee of the AstraZeneca Employee 
Benefit Trust (the EBT, the Trustee) will not 
exercise voting rights attached to shares held 
in the EBT (Shares). Any decision as to 
acceptance or rejection of an offer for Shares 
subject to subsisting awards would be made 
by the Trustee, having regard to the interests 
of award holders.

During 2023, a further employee benefit 
trust was established for the benefit of 
employees based in Canada (the Canada 
EBT). The trustees of the Canada EBT will not 
exercise voting rights attached to shares held 
in the Canada EBT.

or decrease arises unless the holding passes a notifiable threshold in accordance with rules 5.1.2 or 5.1.5 of the UK Listing Authority’s Disclosure Guidance and Transparency Rules.

2  The Company was notified at the time of the disclosure that Wellington Management Company LLP was a subsidiary of Wellington Management Group LLP and that the shareholding 

percentage notified by Wellington Management Company LLP was included within the aggregate shareholding percentage notified by Wellington Management Group LLP.

So far as the Company is aware, no other person held a notifiable interest in the issued Ordinary Share capital of the Company. No changes to 
major shareholdings were disclosed to the Company between 31 December 2023 and 31 January 2024.

So far as the Company is aware, it is neither directly nor indirectly owned or controlled by one or more corporations or by any government.

The Company does not know of any arrangements, the operation of which might result in a change in the control of the Company.

Distributions to shareholders – 
dividends for 2023
Details of our distribution policy are set out 
in the Financial Review from page 58 and 
Note 28 to the Financial Statements from 
page 195.

The Company’s dividend for 2023 of $2.90 
(227.8 pence, 30.29 SEK) per Ordinary Share 
is estimated to amount to, in aggregate, 
a total dividend payment to shareholders of 
$4,494 million. Two employee share trusts, 
AstraZeneca EBT and AstraZeneca Share 
Trust Limited, waived their rights to a dividend 
on the Ordinary Shares they hold and instead 
received nominal dividends.

Articles of Association
AstraZeneca PLC’s current Articles were 
adopted by shareholders at the Company’s 
AGM held on 27 April 2023. Any amendment 
to the Articles requires the approval of 
shareholders by a special resolution at a 
general meeting of the Company. 

Objects
The Company’s objects are unrestricted.

Directors
The Board has the authority to manage the 
business of the Company, for example, 
through powers to allot and repurchase its 
shares, subject where required to shareholder 
resolutions. Subject to certain exceptions, 
Directors do not have power to vote at Board 
meetings on matters in which they have a 
material interest.

The quorum for meetings of the Board is a 
majority of the full Board, of whom at least 
four must be Non-Executive Directors. In the 
absence of a quorum, the Directors do not 

have power to determine compensation 
arrangements for themselves or any member 
of the Board.

The Board may exercise all the powers of 
the Company to borrow money. Variation of 
these borrowing powers would require the 
passing of a special resolution of the 
Company’s shareholders.

All Directors must retire from office at the 
Company’s AGM each year and may present 
themselves for election or re-election. 
Directors are not prohibited, upon reaching 
a particular age, from submitting themselves 
for election or re-election.

General meetings
AGMs require 21 clear days’ notice to 
shareholders. Subject to the Companies Act 
2006, other general meetings require 14 clear 
days’ notice.

For all general meetings, a quorum of two 
shareholders present in person or by proxy, 
and entitled to vote on the business 
transacted, is required unless each of the 
two persons present is a corporate 
representative of the same corporation, 
or each of the two persons present is a 
proxy of the same shareholder.

For more information on dividend 
distribution, the AGM and results 
announcements, see Financial 
calendar on page 225.

Directors, see Board of Directors

All numbers as at 31 December 2023.
*  For the purposes of section 414C(8)(c)(ii) of the Companies 
Act 2006, ‘Senior Managers’ are the Senior Executive 
Team (SET), the Directors of all of the subsidiaries of the 
Company and other individuals holding named positions 
within those subsidiaries. Individuals on multiple boards 
are counted once.

Stakeholder engagement
The discussion on stakeholder engagement 
and the impact of these interactions is 
contained in Connecting with our 
stakeholders from page 84 and throughout 
the Strategic Report. This includes 
engagement with our employees, suppliers 
and other stakeholders, as well as the 
impact of our operations on the community 
and environment.

Information on how we encourage employee 
involvement in the Company’s performance is 
set out in People and Sustainability from 
page 43. Details of some of the employee 
share plans are described in the Directors’ 
Remuneration Report from page 102, and in 
Note 29 to the Financial Statements from 
page 201. All employees are provided with 
information on matters of concern to them 
through regular meetings and updates on the 
Group’s intranet and internal social media. 
‘Townhall’ meetings and Q&A sessions are 
hosted regularly by members of senior 
management, including the SET, including 
global and targeted broadcasts on internal 
social media. During 2023, these broadcasts 
provided updates on the business, including 
pipeline developments and leadership 
changes, as well as the Group’s response to 
global issues such as climate change. In 
addition, information about the Group’s 
quarterly results is shared with employees. 
These updates inform employees of the 
financial and economic factors which affect 
the performance of the Group. 

Political donations 
Neither the Company nor its subsidiaries 
made any EU political donations or incurred 
any EU political expenditure in 2023 and they 
do not intend to do so in the future in respect 
of which shareholder authority is required, or 
for which disclosure in this Annual Report is 
required, under the Companies Act 2006. 
However, to enable the Company and its 
subsidiaries to continue to support interest 
groups or lobbying organisations concerned 
with the review of government policy or law 
reform without inadvertently breaching the 
Companies Act 2006, which defines political 
donations and other political expenditure in 
broad terms, a resolution will be put to 
shareholders at the 2024 AGM, similar to that 
passed at the 2023 AGM, to authorise the 
Company and its subsidiaries to:

 > make donations to political parties or 

independent election candidates

 > make donations to political organisations 

other than political parties

 > incur political expenditure, up to an 

aggregate limit of $250,000.

Corporate political contributions in the US 
are permitted in defined circumstances under 
the First Amendment of the US Constitution 
and are subject to both federal and state laws 
and regulations. In 2023, the Group’s US 
legal entities made contributions amounting 
in aggregate to $1,687,650 (2022: $1,316,950) 
to national political organisations, state-level 
political party committees and to campaign 
committees of various state candidates. 
No corporate political donations were made 
at the federal level and all contributions 
were made only where allowed by US federal 
and state law. We publicly disclose details 
of our corporate US political contributions, 
which can be found on our website, 
www.astrazeneca-us.com/sustainability/
corporate-transparency. 

The annual corporate contributions budget is 
reviewed and approved by the US 
Vice-President, Corporate Affairs and the 
President of our US business to ensure robust 
governance and oversight. US citizens or 
individuals holding valid green cards 
exercised decision making over the 
contributions and the funds were not provided 
or reimbursed by any non-US legal entity. 
Such contributions do not constitute political 
donations or political expenditure for the 
purposes of the Companies Act 2006 and 
were made without any involvement of 
persons or entities outside the US.

Significant agreements
There are no significant agreements to which 
the Company is a party that take effect, alter 
or terminate on a change of control of the 
Company following a takeover bid. There are 
no persons with whom we have contractual or 
other arrangements, who are deemed by the 
Directors to be essential to our business.

Use of financial instruments 
The Notes to the Financial Statements, 
including Note 28 from page 195, 
include further information on our use 
of financial instruments.

Insurance and indemnities
The Company maintained directors’ and 
officers’ liability insurance cover throughout 
2023. The Directors are also able to obtain 
independent legal advice at the expense of 
the Company, as necessary, in their capacity 
as Directors.

The Company has entered into a deed of 
indemnity in favour of each Board member 
since 2006. These deeds of indemnity are still 
in force and provide that the Company shall 
indemnify the Directors to the fullest extent 
permitted by law and the Articles, in respect 
of all losses arising out of, or in connection 
with, the execution of their powers, duties and 
responsibilities as Directors of the Company 
or any of its subsidiaries. This is in line with 
current market practice and helps us attract 
and retain high-quality, skilled Directors.

Compliance requirements under Listing 
Rule 9.8.4
The only matter to report is the shareholder 
waiver of dividends on page 228.

Directors’ Report 
The Directors’ Report, which has been 
prepared in accordance with the requirements 
of the Companies Act 2006, comprises the 
following sections:

 > Chair’s Statement
 > Chief Executive Officer’s Review
 > Therapy Area Review

	Regular	review	of	the	data	is	carried	out	to	ensure	accuracy,	consistency	and	reflect	major	business	change.	This	has	led	to	
changes	in	data	in	previous	years.	The	majority	of	the	adjustments	made	are	not	material	individually,	except	for	(i)	Scope	1:	
Combustion	of	fuel	and	operations	facilities,	(ii)	Scope	2	(Location-based):	Electricity,	heat,	steam	and	cooling	purchased	for	
own	use,	(iii)	Company’s	chosen	intensity	measurement:	Scope	1	+	Scope	2	(Market-based)	emissions	reported	above	
normalised	to	million	US	dollar	revenue,	as	a	result	of	a	divestment	in	manufacturing	facility,	update	to	using	IPCC	AR5	
Global	Warming	Potentials	(GWPs)	from	IPCC	AR4	GWPs	for	calculating	process,	fugitive	and	solvent	emissions	and	
reporting	of	fuel	volume	in	US	&	EUCAN	to	represent	business	activity.	Additionally	(iv)	Total	energy	consumption	data	that	
has	also	changed.	For	(v)	most	material	changes	are:	Scope	3	Category	1	purchased	goods	and	services	(methodology	
updated	to	exclude	spend	based	emissions	associated	with	royalty	payments);	(vi)	Scope	3	Category	8	upstream	leased	assets	
(methodology	updated	to	calculate	GHG	emissions	in	leased	office	space	based	on	internal	benchmark	for	office	space	energy	
consumption	from	mixed-use	space);	(vii)	Scope	3	Category	11	use	of	sold	products	(methodology	update	to	reflect	IPCC	AR5	
GWPs	from	AR4	GWPs	for	calculating	emissions	associated	with	the	patient	use	of	sold	inhalation	products);	and	(viii)	Scope	
3	Category	12	end	of	life	treatment	of	sold	products	(methodology	updated	to	reflect	GHG	emissions	accounted	for	in	Scope	3	
Category	11	use	of	sold	products	and	remove	double	counting	of	GHG	emissions).
	Included	in	this	section	are	GHGs	from	direct	fuel	combustion,	process	and	engineering	emissions	at	our	sites	and	from	fuel	
use	in	our	vehicle	fleet.
	GHGs	from	imported	electricity	are	calculated	using	the	GHG	Protocol	Scope	2	Guidance	(January	2015)	requiring	dual	
reporting	using	two	emissions	factors	for	each	site	–	Market-based	and	Location-based.	Our	corporate	emissions	reporting	
and	targets	follow	the	Market-based	approach.	We	have	used	the	GHG	Protocol	Corporate	Accounting	and	Reporting	
Standard	(revised	edition).	Emission	factors	for	electricity	have	been	derived	from	the	International	Energy	Agency,	USEPA	
eGRID,	US	Green-e	and	the	Association	of	Issuing	Bodies	databases	and	for	all	other	fuels	and	emission	sources	from	the	
2006	IPCC	Guidelines	for	National	Greenhouse	Gas	Inventories.
	The	aggregate	of:	(i)	the	annual	quantity	of	energy	consumed	from	activities	for	which	the	Company	is	responsible,	including	
the	combustion	of	fuel	at	a	facility	or	the	operation	of	any	facility;	and	(ii)	the	annual	quantity	of	energy	consumed	resulting	
from	the	purchase	of	electricity,	heat,	steam	or	cooling	by	the	Company	for	its	own	use.
	Under	the	Companies	(Directors’	Report)	and	Limited	Liability	Partnerships	(Energy	and	Carbon	Report)	Regulations	2018,	
the	Company	needs	to	disclose	what	proportion	of	this	figure	relates	to	energy	use	in	the	UK	and	offshore	area.	For	2023,	the	
proportion	of	total	global	energy	and	emissions	originating	from	AstraZeneca’s	UK	and	offshore	area	footprint	were	as	
follows:	energy	use	295	GWh	(20%);	Scope	1	site	energy	and	road	fleet	emissions	28	ktCO2e	(14%);	Scope	2	site	imported	
energy	emissions	using	Market-based	accounting	0	ktCO2e	(0%)	and	Scope	2	site	imported	energy	emissions	using	
Location-based	accounting	17	ktCO2e	(9%).	In	the	period	covered	by	the	report	AstraZeneca	has	installed	LED	lighting,	
upgraded	chillers,	improved	controls	for	heating,	ventilation	and	air	conditioning	systems,	continued	improvements	for	the	
combined	heat	and	power	plant,	and	maintained	ISO	50001	certification	at	the	Macclesfield	facility,	UK.	At	the	manufacturing	
site	in	Liverpool,	UK	new	efficient	electric	steam	boilers	have	been	installed.

volunteer studies.

Phase II – the phase of clinical research which includes the controlled 
clinical activities conducted to evaluate the effectiveness of the drug in 
patients with the disease under study and to begin to determine the

Phase IIa studies, which tend to be designed to assess dosing 
requirements, and Phase IIb studies, which tend to assess safety 
and efficacy.

Phase III – the phase of clinical research which is performed to gather 
additional information about effectiveness and safety of the drug, often 
in a comparative setting, to evaluate the overall benefit/risk profile of

Certain of these factors are discussed in more

should be construed as a profit forecast.

Inclusion of Reported performance, 
Core financial measures and constant 
exchange rate growth rates 
AstraZeneca’s determination of non-GAAP 
measures, together with our presentation of 
them within our financial information, may 
differ from similarly titled non-GAAP 
measures of other companies.

Statements of competitive position, 
growth rates and sales
In this Annual Report, except as otherwise 
stated, market information regarding the 
position of our business or products relative 
to its or their competition is based upon 
published statistical sales data for the 
12 months ended 30 September 2023 
obtained from IQVIA, a leading supplier of 
statistical data to the pharmaceutical industry. 
Unless otherwise noted, for the US, dispensed 
new or total prescription data and audited 
sales data are taken, respectively, from IQVIA 
National Prescription Audit and IQVIA National 
Sales Perspectives for the 12 months ended 
31 December 2023; such data are not 
adjusted for Medicaid and similar rebates. 
Except as otherwise stated, these market 
share and industry data from IQVIA have been 
derived by comparing our sales revenue with 
competitors’ and total market sales revenues 
for that period, and except as otherwise 
stated, growth rates are given at CER. 

For the purposes of this Annual Report, 
unless otherwise stated, references to the 
world pharmaceutical market or similar 
phrases are to the 55 countries contained 
in the IQVIA database, which amounted to 
approximately 94% (in value) of the countries 
audited by IQVIA. Changes in data 
subscriptions, exchange rates and 
subscription coverage, as well as restated 
IQVIA data, have led to the restatement of 
total market values for prior years.
