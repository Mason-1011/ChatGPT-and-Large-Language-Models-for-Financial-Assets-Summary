Introduction

“ Good governance underpins 
any successful enterprise...”

 “This Report reviews 
AstraZeneca’s 
governance and the 
work of the Board’s 
Committees.”

well as the Sustainability Committee, had an 
important role considering the potential and 
enacted regulations by the US, EU and UK on 
sustainability reporting, as well as the ongoing 
assessments of double materiality topics for 
AstraZeneca under EU regulations, to ensure 
that we are prepared for new sustainability 
reporting regulations which you will see 
reflected in AstraZeneca’s 2024 Annual 
Report. The Sustainability Committee also 
reviewed progress against our Ambition Zero 
Carbon targets and programmes.

Euan and the Science Committee had a 
particularly busy year in reviewing our R&D 
strategy and science capabilities as well as 
studying the scientific case for the numerous 
acquisitions and licensing opportunities that 
were undertaken during 2023.

A particular responsibility of the Remuneration 
Committee in 2023 was to review and update 
our Remuneration Policy, which can be found 
from page 127 and will be proposed for 
approval by our shareholders at the AGM in 
April. In doing so, we are introducing some 
changes the Board believes are in the best 
interests of the Group and its shareholders, 
and which will incentivise management to 
deliver our ambitious strategy. 

Good governance underpins any successful 
enterprise and I look forward to continuing my 
role in ensuring that AstraZeneca’s future 
growth and prospects are accompanied and 
enabled by good governance overseen by a 
skilled and diverse Board of Directors.

Michel Demaré
Chair

It’s a pleasure to be introducing AstraZeneca’s 
Corporate Governance Report for the first 
time as Chair.

Our Strategic Report provides an update on 
how AstraZeneca is delivering its Growth 
Through Innovation strategy, including how we 
attract, retain and develop talented people as 
our employees. This Report reviews 
AstraZeneca’s governance and the work of 
the Board’s Committees.

I would like to begin by thanking my fellow 
Directors for the support they have given me 
in my first year as Chair and welcoming Anna 
Manz who became a Non-Executive Director 
and member of the Audit Committee in 
September. She brings extensive cross-sector 
business skills and knowledge to the Board, 
having held international roles in North 
America and Asia Pacific and served as an 
executive and non-executive in large, listed 
companies.

I also want to recognise the role that all the 
Directors play in carrying out their 
responsibilities as members of our Board 
Committees. I am particularly grateful to the 
chairs of the Committees for the diligent and 
committed way in which they carry out their 
duties, especially Philip Broadley who, in 
addition to his important role as Chair of the 
Audit Committee, performs the role of our 
senior independent Non-Executive Director. 
Finally, I would like to thank Euan Ashley who 
assumed the role as Chair of the Science 
Committee during the year.

I would urge readers to read the reports from 
the individual Committee Chairs that give an 
indication of the depth and breadth of their 
work on behalf of shareholders. This 
Governance Report also reports on how we 
consider the interests of our stakeholders and 
engage with them in determining our strategy.

The Audit Committee has a key role in 
monitoring the integrity of our financial 
reporting and management of risk. Cyber risk 
and cyber security have been, and continue to 
be, a particular focus of their activity in recent 
years. During 2023, the Audit Committee as

Additional Information

The Directors are collectively responsible 
for the success of the Group. The Board 
maintains and periodically reviews a list 
of matters that can only be approved by the 
Board. Matters that have not been expressly 
reserved to the Board in this way are 
delegated to the CEO or one of the Board’s 
five Committees. The diagram below 
illustrates this governance structure. 

The Board’s responsibilities include setting 
our strategy and policies, overseeing risk 
and corporate governance, and monitoring 
progress towards meeting our objectives and 
annual plans. It is accountable to our 
shareholders for the proper conduct of the 
business and our long-term success, and 
seeks to represent the interests of all 
stakeholders. 

The CEO, CFO and SET take the lead in 
developing our strategy; proposals are 
reviewed and constructively challenged by 
the Board, before the strategy is approved.

Governance structure

The Board has delegated some of its powers to the CEO and operates with the assistance of five Committees:

Statement of compliance 
Our statement of compliance below describes 
how we applied the principles in the 2018 UK 
Corporate Governance Code (the Code) for the 
year ended 31 December 2023. A copy of the 
Code can be found on the Financial Reporting 
Council’s (FRC) website, www.frc.org.uk. 
Throughout the accounting period we have 
complied with all the provisions of the Code 
other than provision 21, which relates to the 
Board’s annual performance evaluation. 
Our approach to the Board’s performance 
evaluation for 2023 is described on page 89.

Additional information for 
Swedish shareholders
The Company is incorporated under the laws 
of England and Wales and its shares are listed 
on the London Stock Exchange, Nasdaq 
Stockholm and the Nasdaq Global Select 
Market in the US. In accordance with the 
Company’s listing on the London Stock 
Exchange, it applies the principles set out in 
the Code. As a result of its listing on Nasdaq 
Stockholm and in accordance with Swedish 
regulations, the Company is required to 
disclose the material ways in which its 
corporate governance practices differ from 
those applied by Swedish companies 
following the Swedish Corporate Governance 
Code (the Swedish Code). The Company has 
made available on its website 
www.astrazeneca.com/investor-relations/
corporate-governance.html a summary of the 
material ways in which the corporate 
governance practices applied by the Company 
differ from the principles of the Swedish Code. 
In addition, as required by Swedish regulations, 
the Company has also made available on its 
website a general description of the main 
differences in minority shareholders’ rights 
between the Company’s place of domicile (the 
UK) and Sweden, where the Company’s 
shares are also admitted to trading.

1. Board leadership and 
Company purpose 
A. Board’s role 
The Board’s role is to promote the long-term 
sustainable success of the Company. The 
Directors’ diverse range of skills, experience 
and industry knowledge, and ability to 
exercise independent and objective 
judgement, help the Board to operate 
effectively in its oversight of delivery of the 
Group’s strategy, generation of shareholder 
value and contributions to wider society. 

The Board’s effective operation is 
underpinned by a sound governance 
structure, described on page 77. Through 
a programme of regular Board and Board 
Committee meetings, Directors receive 
information on AstraZeneca’s financial 
performance, the R&D pipeline and critical 
business issues. The Board is accountable 
to our shareholders for the proper conduct 
of the business and our long-term success 
and seeks to represent the interests of 
all stakeholders. 

B. Purpose, culture and strategy
The Board believes that our Purpose, to push 
the boundaries of science to deliver life-
changing medicines, positions AstraZeneca 
for long-term sustainable success. 

Our Code of Ethics and our Values underpin 
the behaviours that support our culture.

G. Board composition, independence and 
division of responsibilities 
The composition of the Board is set out on 
pages 78 and 79. The majority of the Board 
consists of independent Non-Executive 
Directors. Directors’ independence is 
considered annually by the Board, as 
described on page 83. 

The Board is responsible for setting our 
strategy and policies, overseeing risk and 
corporate governance, and monitoring 
progress towards meeting our objectives and 
annual plans. The Board conducts an annual 
review of the Group’s overall strategy.

C. Resources and controls 
The Board ensures that the necessary 
resources are in place to help the Company 
meet its objectives and measure its 
performance against them. 

The Group Internal Audit and Compliance 
functions provide quarterly reports to the 
Audit Committee on their activities and 
annual reviews of key themes, processes 
and systems (including arrangements for 
whistleblowing). The Board has full oversight 
of these matters by way of the Audit 
Committee Chair’s reports to the Board after 
each Committee meeting. Board members 
are also able to access the information 
provided to the Audit Committee.

The Board has a formal system in place for 
Directors to declare a conflict, or potential 
conflict, of interest.

D. Stakeholder engagement 
The Board aims to ensure a good dialogue is 
maintained with shareholders, so that their 
views are understood and considered. The 
Board also engages with and considers wider 
stakeholder groups, including the workforce, 
in its decision making. 

E. Workforce policies 
Based on our Values, expected behaviours 
and key policy principles, the Code of Ethics 
empowers employees to make decisions in 
the best interests of the Group, the Company, 
society and the patients we serve. It is 
applicable to the Group worldwide, including 
the Board.

2. Division of responsibilities 
F. Chair of the Board
Michel Demaré, our Non-Executive Chair, 
is responsible for the Board’s overall 
effectiveness in directing the Company. 
Mr Demaré was first appointed to the 
Board in 2019 and was considered to be 
independent on his appointment as Chair 
in April 2023. 

The Directors are collectively responsible for 
the success of the Group. The roles of the 
Board, Board Committees, Chair, senior 
independent Non-Executive Director and CEO 
are documented, as are the Board’s reserved 
powers and delegated authorities. The 
Board’s responsibilities and the governance 
structure by which it delegates authority are 
outlined in the Corporate Governance 
Overview on page 77. 

The Board maintains a list of matters that are 
reserved to, and can only be approved by, the 
Board. These include: the appointment, 
termination and remuneration of any Director; 
approval of the annual budget; approval of any 
item of fixed capital expenditure or any proposal 
for the acquisition or disposal of an investment 
or business which exceeds $300 million; the 
raising of capital or loans by the Company 
(subject to certain exceptions); the giving of 
any guarantee in respect of any borrowing of 
the Company; and allotting shares of the 
Company. Matters that have not been 
expressly reserved to the Board are delegated 
to the Committees of the Board or the CEO. 

H. Non-Executive Directors’ role 
and time commitment 
The Non-Executive Directors exercise 
objective judgement in respect of Board 
decisions, providing scrutiny and challenge 
and holding management to account. 
Non-Executive Directors offer strategic 
guidance and specialist advice based on their 
breadth of experience and knowledge. The 
Non-Executive Directors regularly meet 
without the Executive Directors or other 
management present.

Corporate Governance Report
Compliance with the UK 
Corporate Governance Code continued

The Company’s senior independent Non-
Executive Director serves as a sounding 
board for the Chair and as an intermediary for 
the other Directors when necessary. The 
senior independent Non-Executive Director is 
also available to shareholders if they have 
concerns that contact through the normal 
channels of Chair or Executive Directors has 
failed to resolve, or for which such contact is 
inappropriate. Philip Broadley was appointed 
senior independent Non-Executive Director on 
1 March 2021. 

As well as their work in relation to formal 
Board and Board Committee meetings, 
Non-Executive Directors commit time 
throughout the year to meetings and 
telephone calls with various levels of executive 
management and other key stakeholders, 
visits to AstraZeneca’s sites throughout the 
world (whether in person or virtually) and, for 
new Directors, induction sessions and site 
visits. The Chair and individual Board 
members ensure that Board members’ time 
commitment to the Company is sufficient to 
fulfil their duties as Directors and fully 
discharge their obligations to shareholders, 
particularly in the case of the Chairs of Board 
Committees. For the Chair of the Board, 
generally, as a basic commitment, it is 
expected that they would need to devote 
about 40% of their time or the equivalent of 
not less than 90 days per annum in the 
fulfilment of their duties.

When contemplating taking up additional 
appointments, Non-Executive Directors 
consult the Chair to ensure thought is given to 
any potential impact on their time commitment 
to AstraZeneca. Careful consideration is given 
to the nature of the potential appointment and 
the type of company involved (for example, 
whether the company is a public listed 
company or privately held), to help assess the 
likely time requirement. For significant 
additional appointments, the full Board would 
typically be involved in this process. 

    For more information on:

Committee Report, see from 
page 90.

 External audit, see page 96 
and Note 31 to the Financial 
Statements, on page 210. 

  Internal Audit, see page 96.

our business risks, our 
procedures for identifying our 
emerging risks, how we describe 
our Principal Risks and 
uncertainties, and our Viability 
statement, see Risk management 
and controls on the following 
page, and the Risk Overview 
from	page	54.

 The Remuneration Committee’s 
work, see page 102.

In 2023, Aradhana Sarin was appointed as 
an independent director of Anheuser-Busch 
InBev and Philip Broadley was appointed as a 
Non-Executive Director and Chair-designate 
of Lancashire Holdings Limited. These 
appointments were considered and approved 
by the Board on the basis that they would not 
prevent or reduce the ability of either to 
perform their roles for AstraZeneca to the 
required standard.

The performance of the Non-Executive 
Directors is assessed annually as part of the 
Board’s performance evaluation, as described 
on page 89. 

Subject to specific Board approval, Executive 
Directors and SET members may accept 
external appointments as non-executive 
directors of other companies and retain any 
related fees paid to them, provided that such 
appointments are not considered by the 
Board to prevent or reduce the ability of the 
executive to perform his or her role within the 
Group to the required standard.

I. Company Secretary 
The Company Secretary is responsible to the 
Chair for ensuring that all Board and Board 
Committee meetings are properly conducted, 
that the Directors receive appropriate 
information prior to meetings to enable them 
to make an effective contribution and that 
governance requirements are considered and 
implemented. The 2023 Board performance 
evaluation set out on page 89 provides details 
of the effective operation of the Board.

3. Composition, succession and evaluation 
J. Appointments and succession planning 
The Nomination and Governance Committee 
and, where appropriate, the full Board, 
regularly review the composition of the Board 
and the status of succession to both SET- and 
Board-level positions. Directors have regular 
contact with, and access to, succession 
candidates for SET positions. The Committee 
also recognises the importance of diversity 
when considering potential appointments. 

There is a formal, rigorous and transparent 
procedure for appointments to the Board. The 
Nomination and Governance Committee 
Report details changes in Board composition 
during the year, and the appointment and 
induction processes, from page 90.

In accordance with Article 66 of the Articles of 
Association of the Company (the Articles), all 
Directors retire at each AGM and may offer 
themselves for re-election by shareholders. 
The Notice of AGM will give details of those 
Directors seeking election or re-election.

K. Skills, experience and knowledge 
When the Nomination and Governance 
Committee reviews the composition of the 
Board and its Committees, it uses a matrix 
that records the skills and experience of 
current Board members and compares this 

with the skills and experience it believes are 
appropriate to the Company’s overall business 
and strategic needs, both now and in 
the future. 

The Committee is also mindful of Directors’ 
lengths of tenure and the need to refresh 
Board membership over time.

L. Board evaluation 
In 2023, the Board undertook an internal 
Board performance evaluation. More 
information on the evaluation process, 
including the results and actions taken, can be 
found on page 89.

4. Audit, risk and internal control 
M. Internal and external audit 
The Audit Committee is responsible for 
reviewing the relationship and independence 
of our external auditor, 
PricewaterhouseCoopers LLP (PwC). The 
Committee maintains a policy for the 
pre-approval of all audit services and 
audit-related services undertaken by the 
external auditor, the principal purpose of 
which is to ensure that the independence of 
the external auditor is not impaired. A tender 
of audit services will be conducted in 2024 
with any change taking effect from 2027. 
More information can be found on page 101.

The Audit Committee also reviews the 
independence and effectiveness of Group 
Internal Audit.

N. Fair, balanced and 
understandable assessment 
The Board considers this Annual Report, 
taken as a whole, to be fair, balanced and 
understandable, and provides the information 
necessary for shareholders to assess 
AstraZeneca’s position and performance, 
business model and strategy. The Board’s 
assessment is described on page 100. 

The Board and the Audit Committee review 
the Company’s quarterly financial results 
announcements to ensure they present a fair, 
balanced and understandable assessment of 
the Company’s position and prospects to 
shareholders.

O. Risk management 
The Board is responsible for the Company’s 
risk management system and internal 
controls, and their effectiveness. The Board 
delegates some responsibilities for risk 
management oversight to the Audit 
Committee, such as quarterly reviews of the 
Company’s principal and key active risks. 
During 2023, the Directors continued to review 
the effectiveness of our system of controls, 
risk management (including a robust 
assessment of the emerging and principal 
risks) and high-level internal control 
processes. This included an annual 
Governance and Assurance Report to all 
Directors, which is considered in detail by the 
Audit Committee and reviewed by the Board.

Additional Information

Any areas of concern are highlighted in the 
Audit Committee Chair’s update to Directors 
at the relevant Board meeting and discussed 
by the Board. The Report is based on a full 
year-end review of the Company’s risk and 
control processes (incorporating financial, 
operational and compliance controls) and 
findings from assurance processes. 

The Directors believe that the Group maintains 
an effective, embedded system of internal 
controls and complies with the FRC’s 
guidance entitled ‘Guidance on Risk 
Management, Internal Control and Related 
Financial and Business Reporting’.

5.	Remuneration	
P. Remuneration policies and practices 
The Remuneration Committee is responsible 
for determining, approving and reviewing the 
Company’s global remuneration principles 
and frameworks, to ensure that they support 
the strategy of the Company and are designed 
to promote long-term sustainable success. 

Non-Executive Directors’ independence
In December 2023, the Board considered the 
independence of the Non-Executive Directors, 
other than the Chair of the Board, for the 
purposes of the Code and the Nasdaq Listing 
Rules. Taking into account the recommendations 
set out in the Code and the Nasdaq Listing 
Rules, the Board considers that all the 
Non-Executive Directors except Marcus 
Wallenberg are independent. Marcus 
Wallenberg was appointed as a Director of 
Astra in May 1989 and subsequently became 
a Director of the Company in 1999. He is a 
Non-Executive Director of Investor AB, which 
has a 3.33% interest in the issued share 
capital of the Company as at 7 February 2024. 
For these reasons – his overall length of tenure 
and relationship with a significant shareholder 
– the Board does not believe that he can be 
determined independent under the Code. 
However, the Board believes that he has 
brought, and continues to bring, considerable 
business experience and makes a valuable 
contribution to the work of the Board. 

Q. Developing executive remuneration policy 
The Remuneration Committee routinely 
reviews the Directors’ Remuneration Policy 
and executive remuneration arrangements to 
ensure they continue to promote the delivery 
of the long-term strategy and support the 
Company’s ability to recruit and retain 
executive talent to deliver against that 
strategy. The Committee also considers 
remuneration arrangements in the context of 
corporate governance best practice and 
arrangements for the wider workforce, and 
regularly consults with its major investors on 
remuneration proposals. No Director is 
involved in determining their own 
remuneration arrangements or outcomes.

R. Remuneration outcomes and 
independent judgement 
To ensure it maintains independent judgement 
when determining remuneration outcomes, 
the Remuneration Committee considers a 
range of data including detailed business and 
individual performance information. The 
Committee also consults with other Board 
Committees to utilise their expertise when 
determining performance outcomes.

Further information on Directors’ 
appointments
Chair of the Board
Mr Demaré was appointed as Chair of 
the Board at the conclusion of the 2023 AGM, 
following Mr Johansson’s retirement, and he 
was considered independent upon appointment. 

As well as being a Non-Executive Director 
of AstraZeneca and Chair of the Board’s 
Sustainability Committee, Nazneen Rahman 
is the Director of the Sustainable Medicines 
Partnership (SMP), a multi-stakeholder, 
not-for-profit collaboration with the aim of 
advancing the environmental sustainability of 
medicines. AstraZeneca is a strategic 
collaborator in the SMP. Dr Rahman has 
recused herself from acting as the lead 
contact for the SMP in its relationship with 
AstraZeneca, and this relationship, including 
project work and overall programme 
management, is handled by other members 
of the SMP team. 

Risk management and controls
Global Compliance and Group Internal 
Audit (GIA) 
Through our compliance programme and 
three lines of defence risk management 
framework (line management; Risk and 
Compliance functions; GIA), Global 
Compliance helps the Group achieve its 
priorities and do business the right way. 
It takes a global approach that addresses 
key risk areas, including those related to 
third parties and anti-bribery/anti-corruption. 
Its work helps us to reinforce compliant 
behaviours through our Code of Ethics, 
policies, training, advice and guidance. 
We also conduct risk assessment activities 
and foster a culture where individuals can 
raise concerns.

We take alleged compliance breaches and 
concerns seriously. We investigate and take 
appropriate disciplinary and remediation 
action to address and prevent reoccurrence 
through internal functions and external 
advisers. Depending on breach severity, the 
Group may need to disclose and/or report the 
incident to a regulatory or government 
authority.

Global Compliance provides assurance 
insights to the Audit Committee on 
compliance matters. GIA carries out a range 
of audits and periodically reviews the 
assurance activities of other Group functions.

The results from these activities are reported 
to the Audit Committee. Global Compliance 
and GIA share outcomes and coordinate 
reporting on compliance matters throughout 
the organisation. GIA is established by the 
Audit Committee on behalf of the Board and 
acts as an independent and objective 
assurance function guided by a philosophy of 
adding value to improve the operational 
control framework of the Group. The scope of 
GIA’s responsibilities encompasses, but is not 
limited to, the examination and evaluation of 
the adequacy and effectiveness of the 
Group’s governance, risk management and 
internal control processes in relation to the 
Group’s defined goals and objectives. 

Among others, internal control objectives 
considered by GIA include:

 > Compliance with significant policies, plans, 

procedures, laws and regulations. 

 > Consistency of operations or programmes 
with established objectives and goals, and 
effective performance. 
 > Safeguarding of assets.

Based on its activity, GIA is responsible for 
reporting significant risk exposures and 
control issues identified to the Board and to 
senior management, including fraud risks, 
governance issues and other matters needed 
or requested by the Audit Committee. It may 
also evaluate specific operations at the 
request of the Audit Committee or 
management, as appropriate.

Corporate Governance Report
Connecting with our stakeholders  
continued

In addition to the principal stakeholders described on pages 84 and 85, the Board considers the following stakeholder groups important for the 
business operations and strategic direction of the Company.

Community
Wherever we work in the world, we aim to make a 
positive impact on people and the communities in 
which they live through our community investment.

We aim to advance patient health, increase access 
to care, drive science innovation and build healthy 
and resilient communities for all.

Employees
Successfully acquiring, retaining and developing a 
talented and diverse workforce is critical to 
achieving our 2030 Bold Ambition. Our employees 
are a key part of our strategy and we are committed 
to being a great place to work. More information is 
included on pages 44 and 45.

Health authorities 
We engage regulators globally about the 
manufacture, development, review, approval and 
marketing of our products.

How the Board engages with stakeholders

The stakeholder table on pages 84 and 85 
sets out management’s main interactions with 
certain key stakeholders. Feedback from 
these interactions is provided to the Board in 
a variety of ways, which allows the Board to 
understand the key interests of stakeholders 
and consider them in its decision-making 
process. 

The Board undertakes additional direct 
engagement with stakeholders to better 
understand their interests and concerns, so 
these can be factored into its decision making.

Examples of the Board’s engagement are set 
out in the following columns. Information on 
how stakeholders and other factors were 
considered in the Board’s principal decisions 
in 2023 is set out on the following page.

Full Board/Other
 > During 2023, a number of Directors, 

including the Chair, the CEO and the CFO, 
met investors at roadshows and in 
one-on-one meetings.

 > The Chair hosted receptions focused on 

shareholder engagement, including events 
in the UK and Sweden.

 > The 2023 AGM was held in London, which 
allowed those shareholders able to attend 
to interact with, and ask questions of, the 
Board. All Directors were present at the 
meeting.

Governments
AstraZeneca partners closely with governments 
around the world to promote health, support 
healthcare research and innovation, facilitate 
equitable access to innovative care solutions, and 
build resilient and sustainable healthcare systems.

Multilateral and non-governmental organisations 
(NGOs) 
AstraZeneca partners with multilateral organisations 
and NGOs to deliver science-based health 
programming that addresses global health issues 
and supports the delivery of the UN Sustainable 
Development Goals. AstraZeneca’s commitment to 
reduce health inequity has also been demonstrated 
by donations to support patients in medically 
underserved communities and humanitarian settings 
through disaster relief efforts.

Media
An active and constructive relationship with the 
media is important to build trust with the Company’s 
key stakeholders by transparently reporting on the 
Group’s activities, including the results of key trials 
and business updates, as well as seeking to 
enhance and protect the reputation of the 
organisation.

Suppliers and third-party providers
AstraZeneca collaborates with a broad range of 
partners to support the development, manufacturing 
and delivery of life-changing medicines to patients 
across the world. Data led and technology driven, 
the Global Procurement function facilitates 
collaboration with diverse and ethical suppliers, 
pursuing some of the most ambitious sustainability 
targets in the industry to dramatically reduce carbon 
emissions throughout the supply chain.

Additional Information

Set out below are examples of how key stakeholders, Section 172(1) duties and other matters are considered by the Board when making its 
Principal Decisions in 2023. 

Principal Decisions in 2023

2023 Group Funding Plan
In January 2023, the Board reviewed and 
approved the Group’s 2023 funding plan. 

The Board considered: investors; and the 
long-term success of the Company.

How the Board had regard to these matters:
 > Reviewed the expected funding 

requirements for the year ahead as well as 
the medium- and long-term funding and 
liquidity prospects.

 > Discussed the Group’s capital allocation 
priorities, the long-term strategy and the 
measures required to deliver the strategy, 
including investment in the pipeline and 
potential external acquisitions to further 
strengthen the pipeline. The Board 
considered the benefit of these investments 
for patients and investors, alongside the 
potential impact of acquiring debt.

 > Considered the Group’s liquidity position 

and the expectations of investors regarding 
the progressive dividend policy.

Board Committees’ composition 
and succession planning
During 2023, the Board reviewed and made 
the following appointments:

Executive Director and member of the 
Audit Committee.

The Board considered: investors; the long-term 
success of the Company; and maintaining 
high standards of business conduct.

How the Board had regard for these matters:
 > Engaged with a number of AstraZeneca’s 

largest shareholders for them to hear about 
the search processes and to understand 
their views.

 > Considered the Board’s diversity, time 

commitments of the candidates and other 
relevant UK Corporate Governance Code 
provisions, as well as other Board-level 
succession planning considerations.
 > Reviewed the experience of potential 
candidates and met those who were 
shortlisted to evaluate which individuals had 
the skills required to support management 
in the continued delivery of value to 
shareholders and life-changing medicines 
to patients, while also maintaining high 
standards of business conduct.

 > Considered the succession requirements of 

the Board, the length of tenure of the 
current Non-Executive Directors and the 
independence requirements as set out in 
the UK Corporate Governance Code, and 
the importance of ensuring a smooth and 
orderly transition. 

 > Considered the continuity and reassurance 
the appointments provided to management 
and investors, and had regard to the likely 
consequences of the decision in the 
long term and the interests of those 
most affected.

Acquisitions and collaborations 
to strengthen the pipeline 
During 2023, the Board considered, and 
approved, a number of transactions to 
strengthen the Group’s pipeline and 
accelerate the development of potentially 
life-changing medicines. These included the 
acquisition of CinCor Pharma; the acquisition 
of a rare disease gene therapy portfolio and 
technologies from Pfizer; the research and 
collaboration agreement with Quell 
Therapeutics; the approval of the equity 
investment and global research and 
collaboration agreement in cell and gene 
therapy with Cellectis; the approval of the 
in-licensing of AZD5004 from Eccogene; the 
acquisition of Gracell Biotechnologies; and 
the acquisition of Icosavax. 

The Board considered: investors; the 
long-term success of the Company; 
employees; patients; and maintaining high 
standards of business conduct.

How the Board had regard to these matters:
 > Reviewed the unmet medical need and 
considered how the transactions would 
further strengthen the Group’s pipeline.
 > Considered the benefits to patients if the 

Group was able to accelerate the 
development of novel treatments, which 
could potentially deepen clinical responses 
and improve patient outcomes.

 > Considered the financial impact of the 

transactions on the Group’s viability and 
capital allocation priorities, alongside the 
financial benefits from the acquisitions if the 
technologies were successful.

Divestment of Pulmicort Flexhaler in the US
During 2023, the Board approved the 
divestment of Pulmicort Flexhaler in the US 
to Cheplapharm.

The Board considered: investors; the 
long-term success of the Company; patients; 
and maintaining high standards of 
business conduct.

How the Board had regard to these matters:
 > Considered the Company’s long-term 

strategy, the status of Pulmicort intellectual 
property in the US and the potential impact 
this may have on revenue, as well as the 
investment required in the pipeline to 
ensure the development of further life-
changing medicines.

 > Recognised the importance in ensuring that 
appropriate arrangements were in place to 
ensure the continued supply of medicines 
to patients.

 > Considered the financial benefit of the 
divestment and how this could be 
reinvested, to further benefit patients 
and shareholders.

Settlement of patent litigation
In July 2023, the Board approved the 
settlement of the patent litigation with 
Bristol-Myers Squibb and related parties 
relating to Imfinzi and Imjudo. 

The Board considered: investors; the 
long-term success of the Company; and 
maintaining high standards of business conduct.

How the Board had regard to these matters:
 > Reviewed the financial impact of the 

settlement and the potential benefits and 
risks of continuing with the litigation.

 > Considered the settlement value compared 
to the cost of continued litigation and the 
potential size of damages which were 
being sought.

 > The time and efforts required from 

management in continuing to defend the 
litigation and the potential distraction this 
could create.

Board’s reserved powers and delegation 
of authority to the CEO
In May 2023, the Board reviewed its reserved 
powers and delegation of authority to the 
CEO, and made the following changes:

Engaging with our workforce
AstraZeneca is committed to being a great 
place to work. Engagement with employees is 
an important element in ensuring an 
environment in which all employees are 
respected, where openness is valued, 
diversity celebrated and every voice heard. 
We rely on our global workforce to uphold our 
Values, deliver our strategic priorities and 
work to sustain and improve short- and 
long-term performance. For AstraZeneca, 
‘global workforce’ includes our full-time and 
part-time employees, fixed-term workers and 
external contractors working full- or part-time, 
anywhere in the world.

The Directors believe that the Board as a 
whole should be responsible for engaging 
with and understanding the views of the 
workforce. Consequently, the Board has 
chosen not to implement any of the three 
methods set out in the Code. Instead, it uses 
various mechanisms and long-standing 
communication channels in place across the 
Group that enable and facilitate engagement 
with the global workforce. These include the 
Board’s review of the global workforce Pulse 
survey and the biannual Workforce Culture 
and Employee Engagement Report; Board 
members hosting ‘townhall’ meetings for the 
workforce, including Q&A sessions; and 
review of data relating to talent, development, 
inclusion and diversity initiatives, and online 
social media channels. Directors also visit our 
sites and carry out virtual engagements, 
which facilitate understanding of business 
operations and also provide opportunities for 
interactions between Directors and the 
workforce, including engagement with 
high-potential employees. Where required, 
issues or concerns raised by the workforce 
are fed back to management and discussed 
by the Board. Whenever relevant, the Board 
considers the views of the workforce and the 
potential impact on the workforce when it 
makes key decisions.

Engaging with the wider workforce can present 
challenges due to the size of the workforce and 
the global footprint, as well as the variety of 
roles throughout the organisation. In addition to 
in-person engagements, virtual engagements 
help to ensure that individual Directors, as 
well as Board and Board Committees, have 
the opportunity to meet with a range of 
employees from across the global workforce, 
and to hear and understand their views.

The Board believes that this alternative 
approach continues to be the best model of 
engagement for the Group and ensures that 
the Board has access to the views of the 
workforce regardless of location and provides 
meaningful information and data that the 
Board can use when considering the impact 
of strategic decisions on employees. 
Additionally, the chosen mechanisms allow all 
Directors to engage with a wider cross-
section of the global workforce.

Workforce culture
During 2023, the Board reviewed the biannual 
Workforce Culture and Employee Engagement 
Report, which demonstrated how our Values 
and behaviours are embedded throughout all 
levels of the workforce. The report contains a 
summary metric dashboard which is divided 
into categories reflecting AstraZeneca’s 
Values and behaviours. Where the Board has 
concerns that the culture does not reflect our 
Values, the Board seeks assurances from 
management that remedial action has been 
taken and, where necessary, requests senior 
management’s attendance at Board meetings 
to discuss corrective actions.

92%

of employees took part in the November 2023 
Pulse survey.

‘Townhall’ meetings, ‘fireside chats’ and 
‘Ask me anything’ discussions
Both Non-Executive Directors and Executive 
Directors regularly participate in meetings 
with sites, or large groups of the workforce 
– either virtually or in person. These enable 

direct engagement between the Board and 
employees, including Q&A sessions, such as 
the Chair ‘fireside chat’. During the year, 
among other events, the Board hosted 
in-person ‘townhall’ meetings for employees 
in Japan and US sites, which were also 
broadcast to other sites in the region to 
increase reach and participation.

Employee opinion surveys (Pulse)
Twice a year, employees are invited to take 
part in an opinion survey, which seeks their 
views of the business. The results are reviewed 
by management and trends are monitored. 
The results are shared with the Board, which 
enables the Directors to understand the views 
and sentiments of the workforce.

89%

of employees stated they believe strongly in 
AstraZeneca’s future direction and key 
priorities in the November 2023 Pulse survey.

Site visits 
During 2023, Directors visited various Group 
sites across the world, including those in 
India, Dubai, Japan, the US, the UK and the 
Alexion campus in Dublin, Ireland. The 
majority of visits were in person but, to 
maximise engagement opportunities, 
some were virtual, including those to the 
AstraZeneca businesses in the Nordics, 
Spain and Taiwan.

Additional Information

As part of the Board performance 
evaluation, Directors were asked to 
consider the following areas:

 > Board composition
 > Stakeholder oversight
 > Board dynamics
 > Board Committees
 > Strategic oversight
 > Risk oversight
 > Succession planning and 

people oversight
 > Priorities for change

2023 overview 
The UK Corporate Governance Code states 
that there should be an annual evaluation of 
the performance of the board, its committees, 
the chair and individual directors and that, for 
larger listed companies such as AstraZeneca, 
this should be externally-facilitated at least 
every three years. The Company was due to 
have an externally-facilitated evaluation 
in 2023. 

The Board elected to postpone the externally-
facilitated review until 2024 and instead run an 
internal performance evaluation in 2023. This 
was considered to be a proportionate 
approach in light of the change in Chair during 
the year. Given the 27 April 2023 effective date 
of appointment of Michel Demaré as Board 
Chair, the Board concluded that it would be a 
better use of time and resources for the next 
externally-facilitated annual performance 
review to take place in 2024, so that at least 
the first 12 to 18 months of the Board’s work 
under the new Chair could be taken into 
account.

The internal evaluation was run via a web-
based survey covering a wide range of topics 
that were broadly similar to topics from 
previous evaluations. A report was prepared 
using the answers to this survey which was 
discussed by the Board at its meeting in 
December 2023, and was used by the Chair 
as the basis for individual conversations with 
each Board member prior to the full 
Board discussion.

As part of each Director’s individual 
discussion with the Chair during the Board 
evaluation, his or her contribution to the work 
of the Board and personal development needs 
were considered. Directors’ training needs are 
met by a combination of: internal 
presentations and updates, and external 
speaker presentations, as part of Board and 
Board Committee meetings; specific training 
sessions on particular topics, where required; 
and the opportunity for Directors to attend 
external courses at the Company’s expense, 
should they wish to do so.

The Nomination and Governance Committee 
also reviews the composition of the Board to 
ensure that it has the appropriate expertise, 
while also recognising the importance of 
diversity. For more information on the 
Nomination and Governance Committee’s 
work, see the Nomination and Governance 
Committee Report from page 90.

2023 outcomes and actions against prior 
year recommendations
 > The Board continues to operate effectively 
with an atmosphere that enables candid 
discussion. Its relationship with 
management, including the CEO, CFO and 
SET, was highly rated.

 > Each Director continues to perform 

effectively and demonstrate commitment 
to their role, as does the Chair (whose 
evaluation by Board members, absent the 
Chair, was led by the senior independent 
Non-Executive Director). 

 > The composition of the Board was 

highly rated.

 > The Board has a good understanding of 
the views and requirements of its key 
stakeholders. 

 > All of the Board’s Committees continue 

to operate effectively.

 > The Board’s contribution to strategy 

development, oversight of the R&D pipeline 
and effectiveness in monitoring and 
considering key external developments 
were highly rated. The Board oversees 
risk effectively.

Succession planning and people oversight 
continues to be a key area of focus. Key 
priorities for 2024 included strategy, financial 
performance and capital allocation, 
monitoring the R&D pipeline, market-specific 
and geopolitical issues, and Board and SET 
succession planning. To address areas 
highlighted by the 2022 annual Board 
performance evaluation, various steps were 
taken during 2023, including:

 > The re-establishment – following the 
COVID-19 pandemic – of a strong 
programme of in-person Board meetings, 
including site visits, balanced with some 
Board meetings being held virtually to 
reduce the Board’s carbon footprint and the 
need for Directors to undertake 
intercontinental travel.

 > Focusing the Nomination and Governance 

Committee’s work regarding Non-Executive 
Director succession planning on addressing 
the needs of the Board in the period to 
2026, when four current Non-Executive 
Directors will reach nine years’ tenure, with 
the appointment of Anna Manz in 
September 2023 being the first tangible 
outcome of this work.

 > Continued routine work by the Nomination 
and Governance Committee to plan for 
future CEO succession, including reviews of 
both internal and external potential 
candidate options.

 > Arranging a session to enable the Board to 
review how management was approaching 
drug pricing legislation in the US.

On behalf of the Nomination and Governance 
Committee (the Committee), I am pleased to 
present the Committee’s report on its 
activities during 2023.

Committee’s role
The Committee works on behalf of the full 
Board to review the composition of the Board 
and its Committees and carry out succession 
planning for all Board positions, including taking 
the lead in the search for and recruitment of 
new Directors. The Committee ensures the 
Board has an appropriate balance of 
expertise, experience and diversity. A matrix 
that records the skills and experience of 
current Board members is one of the main 
tools used by the Committee to do this. 

The Nomination and Governance 
Committee’s terms of reference 
are available on our website, 
www.astrazeneca.com.

The matrix is shown in the charts to the left.

Decisions relating to the appointment of 
Directors are made by the entire Board based 
on the Committee’s recommendations, taking 
into account the merits of the candidates and 
the relevance of their background and 
experience, measured against objective criteria, 
with care taken to ensure appointees have 
enough time to devote to the Board’s business.

Board and Board Committee changes 
during the year
Following the retirement of Leif Johansson 
from the Board at the end of the AGM on 
27 April 2023, I was appointed Chair of the 
Board. In addition, I also assumed the role of 
Chair of this Committee. Further details about 
the Chair succession process are set out in 
the 2022 annual report.

In April, the Board appointed Euan Ashley as 
Chair of the Science Committee, in 
succession to Nazneen Rahman, effective 
1 June 2023, with Nazneen remaining a 
member of the Science Committee. Euan was 
appointed as a member of the Nomination 
and Governance Committee, effective the 
same date. The Board appointed Nazneen 
Rahman as a member of the Remuneration 
Committee, effective 1 May 2023. 

In May, the Board appointed Anna Manz as a 
Non-Executive Director and a member of the 
Audit Committee with effect from 1 September 
2023. The appointment process was led by 
the Committee and involved Anna meeting 
with multiple Directors. Anna brings extensive 
cross-sector business skills and knowledge to 
the Board, having held international roles in 
North America and Asia-Pacific and served as 
an executive and non-executive in large, listed 
companies. Anna’s significant financial and 
strategic leadership experience, including in 
areas such as risk, treasury and accounting, 
will enable her to fully contribute to the work 
of our Audit Committee.

Inclusion and diversity
The Board views all aspects of diversity among 
Board members as important considerations 
when reviewing its composition. The Board 
also aims to maintain a balance in terms of the 
range of experience and skills of individual 
Board members, which includes relevant 
international business, pharmaceutical industry 
and financial experience, and appropriate 
scientific and regulatory knowledge. The 
biographies of Board members set out on 
pages 78 and 79 give more information about 
current Directors in this respect.

The Board has adopted an Inclusion and 
Diversity Policy (the Policy), which is 
applicable to the Board and its Committees. 
The Policy reinforces the Board’s ongoing 
commitment to all aspects of diversity and to 
fostering an inclusive environment in which 
each Director feels valued and respected. 
Although the Board appoints candidates 
primarily based on merit and the relevance of 
their background and experience, measured 
against objective criteria, it recognises that an 
effective Board, with a broad strategic 
perspective, requires diversity. The Policy 
provides a commitment to use at least one 
professional search firm that has signed up to 
the ‘Voluntary Code of Conduct for Executive 
Search Firms’, to help recruit Directors from a 
broad, qualified group of candidates, to 
increase diversity of thinking and perspective. 
The Board’s approach to inclusion and 
diversity continues to yield successful results. 

As at 31 December 2023, 31% of the 
Company’s full Board identifies as an ethnic 
minority, 45% of the Company’s Non-
Executive Directors are women, and women 
make up 46% of the full Board. The 
information presented in the following tables 
was collected on a self-reporting basis. The 
Board, SET and Company Secretary were 
provided with the prescribed table, and asked 
to complete based on how they identify. The 
Board is pleased that the Company meets the

updated diversity policy targets as specified 
in the FCA’s Policy Statement on Diversity and 
inclusion on company boards and executive 
management, which was published in 
April 2022:

 > 46% of the Board are women, above the 

target of at least 40%.

 > Following the appointment of Aradhana 
Sarin as CFO, the Company meets the 
policy target that at least one of the Chair 
of the Board, Chief Executive Officer, senior 
independent Non-Executive Director or 
Chief Financial Officer be a woman.

 > The Board satisfies the target of at least 
one member of the Board being from a 
non-white ethnic minority background.

As well as being considered in decisions 
about succession and Board appointments, 
inclusion and diversity is integrated across our 
Code of Ethics and associated workforce policy 
for the organisation as a whole. We were 
named 2nd ranking Healthcare company in 
the FTSE 100 for women on boards and in 
leadership in the FTSE Women Leaders 
Review. For the year ended 31 December 
2023, following the retirement of Katarina 
Ageborg in January 2023 and Sharon Barr’s 
appointment as Executive Vice-President, 
BioPharmaceuticals R&D in August 2023, 
women represented 43% of the SET and its 
leadership teams.

Ongoing training and development
On her appointment as an independent 
Non-Executive Director, Anna Manz 
commenced an ongoing tailored induction 
programme to provide an understanding of 
the Group and which reflects Anna’s existing 
expertise and Committee membership. Key 
areas of the induction programme include:

 > Meetings with members of the Board, SET 

and other senior management.

 > Meeting with external legal advisers.
 > Meeting with the external auditors.
 > Access to a digital reading room which 
provides information on the Group, 
including financial performance, pipeline 
information, key Company policies, investor 
and analyst reports, media updates and 
guidance on directors’ duties and listed 
company requirements.

In addition to arranging comprehensive 
induction programmes when new Non-
Executive Directors are appointed to the 
Board, the Committee recognises the

Diversity Policy can be read

importance of continuing development and 
training opportunities for all Directors. We are 
committed to developing a culture of lifelong 
learning throughout our organisation. Specific 
sessions with internal and external experts are 
periodically arranged for the full Board, to 
ensure that Directors have access to 
specialist knowledge across a broad range of 
areas to support their strategic decision 
making. For example, this year Board 
members participated in a roundtable event 
with key external experts in the areas of lung 
cancer and ATTR during the Board meeting in 
Tokyo, Japan to discuss the latest science 
and clinical research in those areas.

At least annually, I discuss with each Director 
his or her contribution to the work of the 
Board and personal development needs. 
Directors’ training needs are met by: a 
combination of internal presentations and 
updates, and external speaker presentations, 
as part of Board and Board Committee 
meetings; specific training sessions on 
particular topics, where required; and the 
opportunity for Directors to attend external 
courses at the Company’s expense, should 
they wish to do so. Directors are encouraged 
to visit the Group’s sites, providing 
opportunities to meet local management and 
tour AstraZeneca facilities. Virtual visits are 
also arranged to allow further interactions with 
employees and sites. These visits further 
Directors’ understanding of the Group’s 
business and operations, as well as provide 
an insight into the particular challenges faced 
locally and opportunities to engage directly 
with employees and other stakeholders.

Succession planning
The Committee considers both planned and 
unplanned (unanticipated) succession 
scenarios. The Committee split the majority of 
its time on this topic in 2023 between 
succession planning for Non-Executive 
Directors, successfully concluding the 
recruitment of Anna Manz in September and 
continued routine succession planning for the 
role of CEO, which included desktop research 
relating to potential external candidates and 
reviewing the strengths and areas of 
development for potential internal candidates. 
Korn Ferry and Lygon Group assisted the 
Committee with its succession planning work 
this year. Korn Ferry undertakes executive 
search assignments for the Company but has 
no other connection with AstraZeneca or its 
individual Directors.

Corporate governance
The Committee advises the Board periodically 
on significant developments in corporate 
governance and the Company’s compliance 
with the UK Corporate Governance Code. 
Further information on our corporate 
governance arrangements, including the 
Company’s statement of compliance with the 
Code during the year, is set out from page 81.

Chair’s introduction
The Science Committee’s (the Committee) 
core role is to provide assurance to the Board 
regarding the quality, competitiveness and 
integrity of the Group’s R&D activities. 
Our dialogue with AstraZeneca’s R&D leaders 
and other scientist employees, as well as 
visits to our R&D sites throughout the world, 
allows us to review and assess:

 > The approaches we adopt in respect of our 

chosen therapy areas. 

 > The scientific technology and R&D 

capabilities we deploy. 

 > AstraZeneca R&D strategic science 
capabilities: including multi-omics and 
bioinformatics, and AI and computational 
strategies. This was supported by further 
in-person presentations from AstraZeneca 
scientists on site at Cambridge, UK 
covering across all R&D areas. 
 > Acquisitions and in-licensing 

agreements: review for the Board the 
scientific case for acquisition and licensing 
opportunities, including:
 – Acquisition of CinCor Pharma, Inc., 
adding baxdrostat (CIN-107) to the 
cardiorenal portfolio.

 > The scientific strategy for maintaining our 

 – Exclusive global licence agreement with 

pipeline and competitiveness. 

 > The decision-making processes for R&D 

projects and programmes. 

 > The quality of our scientists, their career 
opportunities and talent development. 

 > Benchmarking against industry and 

scientific best practice, where appropriate.

We also periodically review important 
bioethical issues and assist in the formulation 
of appropriate policies in relation to such 
issues, agreeing these on behalf of the Board. 
The Committee also considers future trends in 
medical science and technology, and reviews, 
on behalf of the Board, the R&D aspects of 
specific business development or acquisition 
proposals, advising the Board on its conclusions.

Activities during the year
The Committee met nine times during 2023, 
both virtually and face to face. Our key areas 
of focus included:

 > Company strategy and strategic 
priorities for R&D: including key 
prioritised science platforms across R&D 
(Oncology, BioPharmaceuticals and Rare 
Disease) and areas of focus for long-term 
success, including business development 
strategy and external trends impacting 
R&D investment. 

KYM Biosciences, for CMG901, a 
potential first-in-class ADC targeting 
Claudin 18.2.

 – Acquisition of Neogene Therapeutics 

Inc., a global clinical-stage biotechnology 
company pioneering the discovery, 
development and manufacturing of 
next-generation TCR-Ts.

 – Purchase and licence agreement for a 
portfolio of pre-clinical gene therapy 
programmes and enabling technologies 
from Pfizer Inc.

 > R&D in China: The Committee had an 

in-person meeting with AstraZeneca China 
R&D and Business Development leadership 
to discuss external R&D landscape, 
innovation opportunities and future plans.
 > Clinical Trials Operations strategies: a 
review of Clinical Operations focusing on 
challenges and opportunities driven by 
internal changes and external factors.
 > Corporate scorecard outturn and goal 
setting: providing insight and feedback to

and Operations Sustainability.

Chair’s introduction
The Sustainability Committee (the Committee) 
continued its important work during 2023 to 
oversee the execution of the Company’s 
sustainability strategy. In addition to this 
important function, the Committee’s other 
roles are:

 > To oversee the Company’s disclosures 

relating to sustainability and communication 
of our sustainability activities with our 
stakeholders. 

 > To monitor developments and best practice 
and provide input to the Board and other 
Board Committees on sustainability matters 
as required.

 > To advise the Remuneration Committee on 

the Company’s performance against 
sustainability metrics and targets.

Committee meetings and other informal 
interactions with employees allow Committee 
members to engage closely with those 
charged with executing our sustainability 
strategy. This helps us develop a deeper 
understanding of sustainability initiatives, their 
progress, who executes them, and how this is 
done, to share with the wider Board.

Activities during the year
During 2023, the Committee met twice 
formally. In addition, the Committee facilitated 
a deep dive session for the full Board focusing 
on developments in laws and regulations 
relating to sustainability reporting and 
progress against our Ambition Zero Carbon 
(AZC) targets and programmes. To enhance 
our understanding of the sustainability 
initiatives in action at AstraZeneca and hear 
colleagues’ personal perspectives, the 
Committee invited employees to its meetings 
who were involved in workstreams and 
projects from across our sustainability 
strategy. This included hearing from R&D 
scientists in Macclesfield, UK about their work 
to recover and reuse solvents which are a 
material contributor to our carbon footprint 

and a briefing paper relating to the rollout of 
electronic patient information leaflets.

Our focus areas during the year included:

 >  How numerous regulations, including the 
IFRS Sustainability Disclosure Standards, 
European Sustainability Reporting 
Standards and Corporate Sustainability 
Reporting Directive (CSRD), would impact 
the Company’s reporting on sustainability 
matters and the measures being taken to 
ensure the Company has a single source of 
sustainability-related data. 

 > The establishment and oversight of a new 

Sustainability Steering Committee 
comprised of representatives from Finance, 
Sustainability, Compliance, HR and 
Government Affairs which will be 
accountable to both the Committee and 
the Audit Committee to ensure consistency 
over all aspects of sustainability across 
the business.

 > The establishment and development of a 
health equity strategy which aims to build 
on existing access to healthcare 
programmes to enable more equitable 
health outcomes across the globe.
 > Oversight of the conduct of the CSRD 

double materiality assessment.

 > Supporting the Remuneration Committee in 
its consideration of how the delivery of our 
ESG priorities is incentivised, and reviewing 
performance against our ESG remuneration 
targets relating to AZC.

 > Overseeing engagement with investors on 

sustainability-related matters and reviewing 
AstraZeneca’s external disclosures.

 Member of the Committee until

  on 1 September 2023. 

Chair’s introduction
On behalf of the Audit Committee 
(the Committee) I am pleased to present 
the Committee’s report on its activities and 
the significant matters we considered 
during 2023.

In 2023, following his election as Chair of 
the Board, Michel Demaré stepped down 
as a member of the Committee immediately 
following the AGM in April. My thanks go to 
Michel for his valuable contributions to the 
Committee’s work over the past few years. 
We also welcomed Anna Manz as a member 
of the Committee following her appointment 
to the Board in September. Anna brings 
wide-ranging, international experience from 
a number of industries, and has already 
begun to make effective contributions to 
the work of the Committee. 

The Committee believes that it has carried 
out its responsibilities effectively throughout 
the year, and to a high standard, providing 
independent oversight. It has had good 
support from AstraZeneca personnel and 
PwC, the Company’s auditors. 

The Committee’s main responsibilities 
include monitoring the integrity of financial 
reporting and formal announcements 
relating to financial performance, reviewing 
the effectiveness of internal controls and 
risk management systems, and overseeing 
the external and internal audit processes. 

The Committee continues to apply 
appropriate challenge to the Company’s 
management; for example, the Committee 
challenged the timing of recognition of 
provisioning for certain legal items and their 
presentation as non-core items. This matter 
was subject to robust discussions and 
scrutiny from the Committee before it was 
satisfied with management’s approach.

The Committee’s agenda continues to be 
driven by the Company’s key active risks and 
key strategic programmes which are 
considered at every Committee meeting, and 
inform the Committee’s agenda of in-depth 
sessions which, this year, have included 
sessions on:

 > Our Operations function, as we continue 
to evolve our supply chain capabilities.

 > Our IT/IS function, to gain a better 

understanding of how we seek to mitigate 
cybersecurity threats.

 > The China market environment and 
healthcare industry trends, the 
enforcement environment, and how risks 
are being proactively managed.

 > How the Company seeks to mitigate the 
impact of inflationary pressures across 
the business.

 > Organisational activities to support the 

Company’s 2030 Bold Ambition.

These sessions allowed the Committee to 
continue exploring specific aspects of risks in 
their ‘real world’ business contexts, in direct 
dialogue with people in the business that 
have responsibility for managing these risks. 

The Committee also spent considerable time 
keeping ourselves updated on developments 
in the reporting and regulatory environment, 
including the proposed governance and audit 
reforms in the UK, SEC updated interpretations 
on non-GAAP measures reporting, and 
sustainability-related reporting.

This year, we continued our approach of a 
combination of in-person and virtual Committee 
meetings and interactions with colleagues 
from across the organisation. Of particular 
note this year were the Committee’s in-person 
visits to AstraZeneca’s manufacturing site in 
Speke, UK, and to the AstraZeneca and 
Alexion UK marketing companies. I also made 
in-person visits to the marketing companies in 
India and the Gulf Cooperation Cluster (GCC) 
in Dubai and a visit to the Global Innovation 
and Technology Centre in Chennai, India. 
These interactions, along with the in-depth 
sessions I refer to above, have allowed 
Committee members to maximise our 
engagement with colleagues across the 
business, deepen our understanding of the 
priorities and challenges facing many different 
markets and business areas, and hear a wide 
range of employees’ views directly.

We hope you find the Committee’s Report 
useful and informative, and, as ever, 
I welcome any feedback.

Corporate Governance

 
Committee overview
Committee composition
In December 2023, the Board determined the 
Committee met the UK, US and Swedish 
composition requirements by virtue of Philip 
Broadley and Anna Manz having recent and 
relevant financial experience for the purpose 
of the UK Corporate Governance Code (the 
Code), having competence in accounting and/
or auditing for the purpose of the Disclosure 
and Transparency Rules, being financial 
experts for the purposes of the Sarbanes-
Oxley Act, and having expertise in accounting 
and auditing for the purposes of the Swedish 
Corporate Governance Code and Swedish 
Companies Act. The Board determined that all 
members of the Committee are independent 
for the purposes of the Code and that the 
Committee members as a whole have 
competence relevant to the sector in which 
the Company operates, by virtue of their 
experience of working in science-driven, 
healthcare and/or pharmaceutical industries, 
or as a result of their tenure with AstraZeneca. 
The Committee members’ qualifications, skills 
and experience are detailed in their 
biographies on pages 78 and 79 and meeting 
attendance is shown on page 77.

Role of the Committee
The Committee’s main responsibilities include 
monitoring the integrity of financial reporting 
and formal announcements relating to financial 
performance, reviewing the effectiveness of 
internal controls and risk management 
systems, and overseeing the external and 
internal audit processes. The Committee 
reports to the Board the principal matters it 
considers and any significant concerns it has 
or that have been reported to it. Further 
information about the Committee’s role and 
work during the year is set out in this Audit 
Committee Report.

Activities during the year 
Financial reporting
Effective internal controls, appropriate 
accounting practices and policies, and the 
exercise of experienced judgement by the 
Committee and the Board underpin 
AstraZeneca’s financial reporting integrity. 

Strategic Report

Financial Statements

Additional Information

The Committee’s activities in this area in 
2023 included:

 > Reviewing key elements of the Financial 

Statements and the estimates and 
judgements contained in the Group’s 
financial disclosures, as well as considering 
the appropriateness of management’s and 
the external auditor’s analysis and 
conclusions on judgemental accounting 
matters. The significant financial reporting 
issues considered are described in detail in 
the table from page 98. Further information 
on the significant accounting matters 
considered is included in the Financial 
Review under Critical accounting policies 
and estimates from page 72 and within our 
Group Accounting Policies from page 152. 

 > Considering the completeness and 

accuracy of the Group’s reported financial 
performance against its internal and 
external key performance indicators.

 > Reviewing the preparation of the Directors’ 
Viability statement and considering the 
adequacy of the analysis supporting the 
assurance provided by that statement, as 
well as the going concern assessment and 
adoption of the going concern basis in 
preparing this Annual Report and the 
Financial Statements. 

 > Reviewing quarterly updates from both 

management and PwC on the programme 
of activities relating to control over financial 
reporting and the effectiveness of testing 
that has been performed across the internal 
control environment. 

 > Considering the external auditor’s reports 

on its audit of the Group Financial 
Statements, as well as reports from 
management, Group Internal Audit (GIA), 
Global Compliance and the external auditor 
on the effectiveness of our system of 
internal controls and, in particular, our 
internal control over financial reporting. This 
included consideration of compliance with 
applicable provisions of the Sarbanes-
Oxley Act – in particular, the status of 
compliance with the programme of internal 
controls over financial reporting 
implemented pursuant to section 404 of 
that Act. 

 > Discussing financial reporting 

considerations in relation to significant 
transactions that occurred in the year, the 
valuation and presentation of the defined 
benefit pension arrangements, impairment 
of intangible assets, restructuring 
programmes and the presentation of 
collaboration and alliance revenues. The 
Committee also reviewed developments in 
sustainability reporting requirements and 
the Company’s activities, governance 
frameworks and approach in compliance 
with enacted and emerging regulations in 
relation to sustainability.

Risk identification and management
The Committee continued its regular reviews 
of the Group’s approach to risk management, 
the operation of its risk reporting framework 
and risk mitigation. This included 
consideration of the manner in which the risk 
management process was embedded in the 
Group such that the Committee could be 
assured that management’s accountability for 
risks was clear and functioning effectively.

The Company’s risk framework, described 
further from page 54, provides the context for 
the Committee to consider the Directors’ 
Viability statement which is underpinned by 
the assurance provided through a ‘stress test’ 
analysis under which key profitability, liquidity 
and funding metrics are tested against severe 
downside scenarios.

Each of these scenarios assumes that the 
associated risks crystallise and that 
management will take mitigating actions 
against those risks. The Committee 
considered in detail the validity of each 
scenario. This included obtaining additional 
analysis from management as to the indirect 
or unintended consequences of its proposed 
mitigating actions including, for example, 
assessing the likely response of a broader 
range of stakeholders. The Committee also 
assessed whether the proposed mitigations 
were viable.

The Committee is updated on key active and 
emerging risks facing the Company through a 
quarterly risk management report from the 
CFO. The likelihood of each of the risks 
materialising and its potential impact was 
monitored by the Committee and the reports 
from the CFO enabled the Committee to track 
the trend applicable to each risk compared to 
the previous quarter. The composition and 
profile of these risks informs the Committee’s 
agenda of in-depth sessions. For example, an 
upward trend, in terms of the likelihood and 
potential impact of the risk, was noted for the 
key active risk relating to IT, cyber risk and 
data security, therefore the Committee spent 
additional time with representatives from the 
IT function to understand those risks and the 
actions being undertaken to mitigate them.

More information on the basis of 
preparation of Financial 
Statements on a going concern 
basis is set out on page 227 and 
in the Financial Statements on 
page 152.

Further information on the 
significant financial reporting 
issues considered is set out in the 
table from page 98.

Further information about the 
Principal Risks faced by the 
Group and the Viability statement

Cyber risk, digital security and information 
governance
Our approach to identifying, assessing and 
managing material cybersecurity risks 
(including those that result from the use of 
third parties in business processes and data 
management) is integrated within our 
Group-wide approach to managing risk. 
Failure in information technology or 
cybersecurity has been identified as a 
Principal Risk. Mitigations are in place to 
manage these risks, and these are monitored, 
and their effectiveness regularly reported, for 
example in KPI dashboards provided to 
management and the Committee. Incidents 
are managed and reported using the 
cybersecurity incident management 
framework which in turn is connected to the 
Group’s crisis management framework. 
Cybersecurity risks are overseen by the 
Committee, who perform an in-depth review 
annually. Their reviews are supported by 
senior management, the VP, Group Internal 
Audit (GIA) and other assurance or providers 
as required. Cybersecurity risks (including 
previous incidents) have not materially 
affected our business strategy, results of 
operations or financial condition.

Sustainability reporting and 
climate-related risk
The Committee is responsible for overseeing 
sustainability-related disclosures that are 
linked to the Financial Statements, which 
includes the TCFD Summary Statement and 
the EU Taxonomy disclosures in this Annual 
Report and the extended TCFD Statement 
published separately. These statements are 
also reviewed by the Sustainability Committee, 
to support the Committee’s review. 

The Committee received updates in the 
current year regarding the proposed and/or 
enacted regulations by the US, EU, UK and 
the International Sustainability Standards 
Board (ISSB) on sustainability reporting, as 
well as the ongoing assessment of potential 
double materiality topics for the Company 
under EU regulations.

For further information, see IT 
and IS resources on page 41.

For more information on our Code 
of Ethics, see page 49, and on 
Anti-bribery and anti-corruption, 
see page 39. 

AstraZeneca’s Modern Slavery 
Act Statement is available on our 
website, www.astrazeneca.com.

Legal and Compliance
The Committee’s activities in this area 
included reviewing:

 > Quarterly reports from the Legal function to 
monitor the status of significant litigation 
matters and governmental investigations.
 > Quarterly reports from Global Compliance 
to provide oversight of key compliance 
incidents (both substantiated and 
unsubstantiated), possible trends and the 
dispersion of incidents across our business 
functions and management hierarchy. The 
reports included corrective actions taken so 
that the Committee could assess the 
effectiveness of controls, and monitor and 
ensure timely remediation. 
 > Reporting on compliance with 

AstraZeneca’s Code of Ethics to ensure 
high ethical standards and that 
AstraZeneca operates within the law in all 
countries where we operate. 

 > The monitoring, review, education and 

improvements made to support assurance 
that the risk of modern slavery and human 
trafficking is eliminated, to the fullest extent 
possible, from AstraZeneca’s supply chain.

Internal Audit 
The Committee reviewed GIA’s activities, 
including:

 >  Reviewing quarterly reports of work carried 
out by GIA, including the status of follow-up 
actions with management. In 2023, GIA 
provided assurance over compliance with 
significant policies, plans, procedures, laws 
and regulations, as well as risk-based 
audits across a broad range of key business 
activities and continued its thematic 
reporting to the business. The 2023 audit 
plan was aligned to our key active risks and 
wider risk taxonomy. Separate meetings are 
arranged to discuss follow-up actions in 
more depth with specific teams, when 
required by the Committee.

 >  Carrying out the annual effectiveness 

review of GIA in late 2023 by considering its 
performance against the internal audit plan 
and key activities.

 >  Approving the 2024 internal audit plan, 

which is aligned to our key active risks and 
wider risk taxonomy. 

 >  Considering the geographic presence, 
reach and capabilities of GIA and the 
appropriateness of the Group’s resource 
allocation for this vital assurance function.

The Committee noted the continued 
contributions of GIA in supporting and 
delivering value to the business and the 
Committee during the year. The Committee 
supports GIA’s continued efforts to deploy its 
resources in line with the shape and size of 
the overall organisation and was satisfied with 
the quality, experience and expertise of the 
GIA function. 

An independent External Quality Assessment 
of GIA is performed every five years and was 
last performed in 2021.

External audit
The Company’s external auditor, PwC, 
provided quarterly reports to the Committee 
over key audit and accounting matters, and 
business processes, internal controls and 
IT systems.

The Committee oversaw the conduct, 
performance and quality of the external audit, 
in particular through its review and challenge 
of the coverage of the external auditor’s audit 
plan and subsequent monitoring of progress 
against it. The Committee maintained regular 
contact with PwC through formal and informal 
reporting and discussion throughout the year, 
with a continued focus on maintaining audit 
efficiency and quality. The Committee also 
sought management’s feedback on the 
conduct of the audit and considered the level 
of and extent to which the auditors challenged 
management’s assumptions. The Committee 
also received a formal letter and report from 
the Financial Reporting Council (FRC) 
following the joint FRC and Public Company 
Accounting Oversight Board (PCAOB) 
inspection of PwC’s 2022 audit of 
AstraZeneca. The FRC’s inspection was rated 
as “Good” (the highest rating possible) and 
there were no ‘Key’ or ‘Other’ findings. 
The FRC also recognised a number of areas 
of good practice in relation to the conduct of 
the audit. 

A number of interactions took place between 
Committee members and PwC during the 
year, outside of formal Committee meetings, 
to enhance the Committee’s understanding of 
the audit process including the Committee 
Chair joining PwC’s Account Planning 
Workshop to meet face-to-face with PwC 
team members responsible for auditing 
AstraZeneca’s global entities.

Additional Information

The Committee reviewed audit and non-audit 
fees of the external auditor during the year, 
including the objectivity and independence 
of the external auditor through the application 
of the Audit and Audit-Related Services 
Approval Policy, as described further on 
page 100.

Engagement with employees and 
other stakeholders
The Committee regularly interacts with 
members of management below the SET and 
seeks wider engagement with the Group’s 
employees and other stakeholders, during 
deep dive sessions at formal Committee 
meetings and as separate engagements.

Committee members undertook a mixture of 
in-person and virtual interactions with a wide 
range of teams from across the organisation, 
including: Information Technology and 
Information Security; Operations and 
Procurement; Human Resources; Global 
Business Services; the AstraZeneca and 
Alexion marketing companies in the UK; 
the Speke, UK manufacturing site; and the 
marketing companies for the GCC and India.

The breadth of these interactions is crucial as 
it enhances the Committee’s understanding of 
the business and provides valuable insights 
into the key issues and challenges relating to, 
and current and emerging risks associated 
with, our activities in these areas. The 
Committee welcomes the opportunity to 
engage directly with employees in these 
meetings which provide an opportunity to 
gauge employee sentiment and hear their 
views directly. The Committee also uses 
these interactions to communicate the 
importance it attaches to compliance and 
our ‘Speak Up’ culture.

Reporting and regulatory environment 
The Committee has kept abreast of 
developments in the reporting and regulatory 
environment. This has included consideration 
of the proposed governance and audit 
reforms in the UK, SEC updates on clawbacks 
and non-GAAP reporting, consultations on 
sustainability-related reporting requirements 
in a number of jurisdictions, and requirements 
to disclose further information about diversity 
and inclusion on company boards in the UK 
from 2023. 

The Committee was also briefed on thematic 
reviews published by the FRC during the year, 
including those on fair-value-measurement 
and climate-related metrics and targets.

Ensuring the quality of external financial 
reporting to shareholders and other 
stakeholders remains paramount to the 
Committee. This includes its assessment of 
the annual reports to ensure that, taken as a 
whole, they are fair, balanced and 
understandable (for which the process is 
described on page 100). External validation of 
the Annual Report is an important indicator of 
the quality of our reporting. The Committee 
was pleased with the feedback from the FRC 
that it received in 2023 on the 2022 
Annual Report:

 > The FRC undertook a routine corporate 

reporting review of the 2022 Annual Report 
and did not raise any questions or queries 
that required further correspondence, 
which the Committee consider a reflection 
of the quality financial reporting and 
compliance undertaken by AstraZeneca. 
The FRC highlighted some areas where 
reporting could be further enhanced which 
management and the Committee have 
considered in preparing this Annual Report. 
 > The FRC also reviewed our reporting in the 

context of the 2018 UK Corporate 
Governance Code and raised no significant 
points in this respect. 

 > In the FRC’s 2022/2023 Annual Review of 

Corporate Governance Reporting, the FRC 
highlighted the following aspects of the 
2022 Annual Report as examples of best 
practice: (i) how the impact of 
AstraZeneca’s learning culture contributed 
positively to retention and promotion rates 
and more accurate succession planning; 
and (ii) how AstraZeneca’s strategy and 
KPIs in relation to scientific measures are 
linked to remuneration.

 > The FRC Lab’s report on business 

model-focused reporting highlighted our 
‘Life-cycle of a medicine’ text and diagram 
in the 2022 Annual Report (an updated 
version of which appears on page 11 of this 
Annual Report) as a best practice example 
of how an issuer can better meet investor 
needs, particularly for a reader who is not a 
pharmaceutical expert.

Committee performance
The Committee conducted the annual 
evaluation of its own performance, referring to 
the Committee-specific results of a Board 
performance review survey prepared by the 
Company Secretary’s team. The results were 
reported to and discussed with the 
Committee and the Board. The overall results 
of the survey were positive and noted the 
Committee’s efforts and focus.

Significant financial reporting issues considered by the Committee in 2023

Matter considered

Valuation of intangible
assets

   See Financial Review 
from page 58 and 
Note 10 to the 
Financial Statements 
from page 172.

The Group carries significant intangible assets on its 
Consolidated Statement of Financial Position arising from the 
acquisition of businesses and intellectual property (IP) rights to 
medicines in development and on the market. Each quarter, the 
CFO reports on the carrying value of the Group’s intangible 
assets as well as the specific assets identified as at risk of 
impairment. In respect of intangible assets that are identified as 
at risk of impairment, the Committee receives information on the 
difference between the carrying value and management’s 
current estimate of discounted future cash flows for these 
products (the headroom). Products will be identified as ‘at risk’ 
because the headroom is small or, for medicines in 
development, there is a significant potentially adverse event 
such as the publication of clinical trial results which could 
significantly alter management’s forecasts for the product. The 
reviews also cover the impact on any related contingent 
consideration arising from previous business combinations.

Committee’s conclusion and response

The Committee considered the impairment reviews of the 
Group’s intangible assets. Impairments of $17 million arose in 
relation to launched products, and $417 million arose in relation 
to products in development.

The Committee assured itself of the integrity of the Group’s 
accounting policy and models for its assessment and valuation 
of its intangible assets, including understanding the key 
assumptions and sensitivities within those models. The 
Committee also considered the internal and external estimates 
and forecasts for the Group’s cost of capital relative to the 
broader industry. The Committee was satisfied that the Group 
had appropriately accounted for the identified impairments.

Revenue recognition

   See Financial Review 
from page 58 and 
Note 1 to the 
Financial Statements 
from page 160.

The US is our largest single market and accounted for 42% of 
our Total Revenue in 2023. Revenue recognition, particularly in 
the US, is affected by rebates, chargebacks, returns, other 
revenue accruals and cash discounts.

The Committee pays attention to management’s estimates of 
these items, its analysis of any unusual movements and their 
impact on revenue recognition.

In 2023, a new category of revenue termed Alliance Revenue 
was included on the face of the Statement of Comprehensive 
Income, and comparative information re-presented. Alliance 
Revenue includes profit shares, revenue shares or royalties from 
defined collaborative arrangements, and was previously a 
sub-category of Collaboration Revenue.

The Committee receives regular reports from management and 
the external auditor on this complex area. The US market 
remains highly competitive with diverse marketing and pricing 
strategies adopted by the Group and its peers.

The Committee recognised the close monitoring and control by 
management of the overall gross-to-net deductions.

The Committee was consulted on the proposed update to 
presentation of Alliance and Collaboration Revenues, and 
aligned on the usefulness of enhanced disclosures of Alliance 
Revenues for better visibility and reflect differences in revenue 
profiles for Alliance and Collaboration Revenues. The 
Committee also discussed the accounting considerations for 
key milestones in Collaboration Revenue.

Alternative performance 
measures (APMs)

   See Financial Review 
from page 58.

Litigation and 
contingent liabilities

   See Note 30 to the 
Financial Statements 
from page 204.

AstraZeneca reports APMs to provide helpful supplementary 
information to the IFRS measures to enable a better 
understanding of the Group’s financial performance and 
position.

The Committee carefully considered management’s 
presentation of the non-core items and noted that the 
presentation was consistent with prior years for the items.

Accounting for the acquisition of Alexion in 2021 resulted in 
more significant items being classified as non-core, which 
continue impacting performance in the current year, especially 
relating to the unwind of fair value uplift of inventory and 
amortisation of allocated fair value of purchased intangible 
assets. The fair value uplift of inventory was fully unwound in 
the year, hence the amortisation of intangibles will remain the 
material non-core item from the acquisition transaction. There 
were some significant one-off legal settlements in the year 
which were classified as non-core items in line with the 
Group’s policy. 

Management carefully analyses the presentation of various 
items to ensure it is fair and balanced, and follows guidelines 
issued by the European Securities and Markets Authority and 
the SEC, as well as FRC thematic reviews.

AstraZeneca is involved in various legal proceedings 
considered typical to its business and the pharmaceutical 
industry as a whole, including litigation and investigations 
relating to product liability, commercial disputes, infringement 
of IP rights, the validity of certain patents, antitrust law, and 
sales and marketing practices.

In the current period, net legal provisions of $1,020 million were 
recorded for three legal proceedings within non-core items once 
the criteria for recognising a provision were met.

The Committee further considered management’s assessment 
and recommendation to present the $1,020 million legal 
provision costs as non-core items, and concurred with 
management that the presentation was appropriate due to their 
significance and consistent with classification in prior years.

The Committee reviewed proposed disclosures for non-GAAP 
items in line with the various regulatory guidance and 
concurred with management that the presentation enabled 
additional helpful guidance.

Of the matters the Committee considered in 2023 the more 
significant included: the settlements in the Nexium and Prilosec 
product liability litigation, the Imfinzi patent litigation and the 
Alexion shareholder litigation. 

The Committee carefully considered the timing of recognition 
and presentation of these provisions and concurred with 
management’s assessment. The Committee was also satisfied 
that the Group was effectively managing its litigation risks 
including seeking appropriate remedies and continuing to 
defend its IP rights vigorously.

Significant financial reporting issues considered by the Committee in 2023 continued

The Group has business activities around the world and incurs a 
substantial amount and variety of business taxes. AstraZeneca 
pays corporate income taxes, customs duties, excise taxes, 
stamp duties, employment and many other business taxes in all 
jurisdictions where due. In addition, we collect and pay 
employee taxes and indirect taxes such as value-added tax. The 
taxes the Group pays and collects represent a significant 
contribution to the countries and societies in which we operate. 
Tax risk can arise from unclear laws and regulations as well as 
differences in their interpretation.

Committee’s conclusion and response

The Committee reviews the Group’s approach to tax, including 
governance, risk management and compliance, tax planning, 
dealings with tax authorities and the level of tax risk the Group 
is prepared to accept.

During 2023, the Committee considered the tax accounting 
implications of a UK Group company’s intragroup purchase of 
certain intellectual property as well as developments in certain 
uncertain tax positions in the year. The Committee considered 
the analysis provided by management and concurred with the 
presentation and reporting of these items.

The Committee was satisfied with the Group’s practices 
regarding tax liabilities, including, most notably, its response to 
developments in the corporate income tax environment.

www.astrazeneca.com.

Segmental reporting 

   See the Key 
Judgement within 
Note 6 to the Financial 
Statements from 
page 167.

Management has reviewed the developments in the year and 
determined the Group continues to operate as a single segment 
based on key decisions on resource allocation and performance 
monitoring being carried out at a Group level by the SET.

The Committee received reports from management regarding 
considerations for segmental reporting based on the current 
operations and management of the business.

There were no significant changes in the Group’s business 
during the year, with the Alexion integration continuing as 
envisioned.

The Committee considered the analysis provided by 
management and concurred with management that 
presenting AstraZeneca’s performance under one segment 
was appropriate.

Retirement benefits

   See Financial Review 
from page 58 and Note 
22 to the Financial 
Statements from 
page 183.

Accounting for defined benefit pension and other post-
retirement benefits remains an important area of focus. The 
present value of these liabilities is sensitive to changes in 
long-term interest rates, future inflation and mortality 
expectations. The assumptions used to value the liabilities for 
the Group’s main post-retirement benefit obligations are 
updated every quarter along with asset valuations. 

The Committee was satisfied that the Group’s contribution 
policy and actuarial assumptions used to value liabilities were 
appropriate during the year. The Committee monitors the 
funding level of the Group’s defined benefit obligations on a 
quarterly basis, alongside key developments. The Committee 
also received a separate update from the Global Pensions team 
covering key activities over the year. 

The Group is cognisant of the wider regulatory environment and 
local requirements around funding levels and contributions. In 
May 2023, the triennial actuarial valuation as at 31 March 2022 
for the UK defined benefit pension scheme was agreed with 
AstraZeneca Pensions Trustee Limited (the Trustee of the UK 
pension scheme) and submitted to the Pensions Regulator. In 
December 2023, the Group enacted a charge over the 
Company’s Cambridge Biomedical Campus site, to provide 
long-term security to the AstraZeneca Pension Fund.

The Committee was reassured by the Group’s engaged and 
balanced approach to managing the risks associated with its 
defined benefit obligations, noting the completion of the 
actuarial valuation ahead of the statutory deadline. The 
Committee reviewed and concurred with management’s 
accounting and presentation of pension balances.

The Committee is cognisant of the need to adhere to local 
funding regulations and noted the security provided by the 
Group, which underwrites obligations to members.

Guaranteed Minimum Pensions (GMP) equalisation is now 
largely complete and most UK retirees were offered flexibility 
to reshape their benefit through a Pension Increase Exchange 
option.

In May 2023, the Group executed a buy-out of its qualified US 
Defined Benefit Pension Plan with an external insurer. All Plan 
liabilities have been discharged and the Plan has been 
wound-up.

The Committee was satisfied with the progress made on GMP 
equalisation, noting the additional flexibility offered.

The Committee was satisfied with the process and outcome of 
the US buy-out, noting that it reduces long-term financial risk to 
the Group and provides security to participants.

Audit Committee 
Report  
continued

Fair, balanced and 
understandable assessment
As in previous years, at the instruction of the 
Board, the Committee undertook an 
assessment of this Annual Report to ensure 
that, taken as a whole, it is fair, balanced and 
understandable and provides the information 
necessary for shareholders to assess the 
Company’s position and performance, 
business model and strategy. The Committee 
reviewed the Company’s governance 
structure and assurance mechanisms for the 
preparation of this Annual Report and, in 
particular, the contributor and SET member 
verification process. The Committee received 
an early draft of this Annual Report to review 
its proposed content and the structural 
changes from the prior year and to undertake 
a review of the reporting for the year, following 
which the Committee members provided their 
individual and collective feedback. In addition, 
in accordance with its terms of reference, the 
Committee (alongside the Board) took an 
active part in reviewing the Company’s 
quarterly announcements and considered the 
Company’s other public disclosures which are 
managed through its Disclosure Committee 
(the Committee was updated on matters 
considered by the Disclosure Committee 
regularly throughout the year). To aid its 
review further, the Committee also received 
a summary of the final Annual Report’s 
content, including AstraZeneca’s successes 
and setbacks during the year and an 
indication of where they were disclosed 
within the document.

The processes described above allowed the 
Committee to provide assurance to the Board 
to assist it in making the statement required of 
it under the Code, which is set out from 
page 81.

Internal controls
Information on the Company’s internal 
controls is included in the Audit, risk and 
internal control section in the Corporate 
Governance Report on page 82. During the 
period covered by this Annual Report there 
was no change in our internal control over 
financial reporting that occurred that has 
materially affected, or is reasonably likely to 
materially affect, our internal control over 
financial reporting.

The CFO (supported by the SVP Finance, 
Group Controller & Head of Global Finance 
Services), monitors the status of all services 
being provided by the external auditor. 
Authority to approve work exceeding the 
pre-agreed annual fee limits and for any 
individual service above the clearly trivial 
threshold is delegated to the Chair of the 
Committee together with one other 
Committee member in the first instance. 
A standing agenda item at Committee 
meetings covers the operation of the 
pre-approval procedures and regular reports 
are provided to the full Committee.

All services other than the pre-approved audit 
and audit-related services, require approval 
by the Committee on a case-by-case basis. 
In 2023, PwC provided audit services 
including interim reviews of the results of the 
Group for the period ended 30 June 2023 and 
audit-related and other assurance services. 

The increase to the statutory audit fee for 
2023 is largely driven by inflationary increases. 

Fees for audit-related and other assurance 
services amounted to 6% of the fees payable 
to PwC for audit services in 2023 (2022: 4%). 
The Committee is mindful of the 70% 
non-audit services fee cap under EU 
regulation, together with the overall proportion 
of fees for audit and audit-related services in 
determining whether to pre-approve such 
services. Fees for audit-related and other 
assurance services payable to PwC in 2023 
were 7% (2022: 6%) of average audit fees over 
2020 to 2022 (2022: 2019 to 2021). 

PwC were better placed than any alternative 
provider to provide these services in terms of 
their familiarity with the Company’s business, 
skills, capability and efficiency with which they 
could deliver the relevant services. All such 
services were either within the scope of the 
pre-approved services set out in the Policy or 
were presented to Committee members for 
pre-approval and all such services were 
permitted by the FRC Ethical Standard.

At the January 2024 Committee meeting, 
the CFO presented the conclusions of the 
evaluation by the CEO and CFO of the 
effectiveness of our disclosure controls and 
procedures that is required by Item 15(a) of 
Form 20-F as at 31 December 2023. Based 
on their evaluation, the CEO and the CFO 
concluded that, as at that date, the Company 
maintained an effective system of disclosure 
controls and procedures. 

External auditor
PwC is the Company’s external auditor. 
In April 2023, PwC was reappointed as the 
Company’s auditor for the financial year 
ended 31 December 2023, its seventh 
consecutive year as auditor, having first 
been appointed for the financial year ended 
31 December 2017, following a competitive 
tender carried out in 2015. Sarah Quinn 
continued as the lead audit partner at PwC 
for 2023 following her appointment in 
January 2022.

Audit, audit-related and other assurance 
services provided by the external auditor
The Committee maintains the Audit and 
Audit-Related Services Approval Policy (the 
Policy) for the pre-approval of all audit 
services, audit-related services and other 
assurance services undertaken by the 
external auditor. The principal purpose of the 
Policy is to ensure that the independence of 
the external auditor is not impaired.

The pre-approval procedures permit certain 
audit and audit-related services to be 
performed by the external auditor, subject to 
annual fee limits agreed with the Committee 
in advance. Pre-approved audit and 
audit-related services below the clearly trivial 
threshold (within the overall annual fee limit) 
are subject to case-by-case approval by the 
SVP Finance, Group Controller & Head of 
Global Finance Services.

Pre-approved audit services included services 
in respect of the annual financial statement 
audit (including quarterly and half-year 
reviews), attestation opinion under section 
404 of the Sarbanes-Oxley Act, statutory 
audits for subsidiary entities, and other 
procedures to be performed by the 
independent auditor in order to form an 
opinion on the Group’s Consolidated Financial 
Statements. The pre-approved audit-related 
services, which the Committee believes are 
services reasonably related to the 
performance of the audit or review of the 
Company’s Financial Statements, included 
certain services required by law or regulation, 
such as financial statement audits of 
employee benefit plans and capital market 
transactions. The Policy prohibits any tax 
services. Audit-related services included the 
assurance in relation to tax regulatory 
certificates required to be issued by the 
external auditor.

Additional Information

In order to comply with UK legal requirements 
regarding the auditor’s tenure and audit 
tendering, the external audit must be put out 
to tender before the 2027 financial year. In late 
2023, the Committee decided to commence 
the tender process for the audit mandate for 
the 2027 financial year. This will ensure 
sufficient time to carry out the process and, 
in the event that a new auditor is appointed, 
clear any conflicts and ensure a new auditor 
builds up the necessary knowledge and 
business familiarity to ensure the delivery of 
an effective audit. PwC is eligible to re-tender 
for the audit and has indicated its willingness 
to be one of the firms included in the tender. 
The Committee will lead the tender process 
and has approved an inclusive, competitive 
and transparent process by which the tender 
will be conducted to determine a high-quality 
audit delivery provider.

Regulation
The Committee considers that the Company 
has complied with the Competition and 
Markets Authority’s Statutory Audit Services 
for Large Companies Market Investigation 
(Mandatory Use of Competitive Tender 
Processes and Audit Committee 
Responsibilities) Order 2014 in respect of its 
financial year commencing 1 January 2023.

Assessing external audit effectiveness
In accordance with its normal practice, the 
Committee considered the performance of 
PwC and its compliance with the 
independence criteria under the relevant 
statutory, regulatory and ethical standards 
applicable to auditors. The Committee 
assessed PwC’s effectiveness principally 
against four key factors, namely: judgement; 
mindset and culture; skills, character and 
knowledge; and quality control. As part of that 
assessment, it also took account of the views 
of senior management within the Finance 
function and regular Committee attendees. 

As part of the Committee’s assessment of the 
quality of the audit, the Committee focused on 
the auditor’s effective use of experts and 
technology as well as appropriate challenge of 
management’s judgements especially in 
relation to areas of significant financial 
reporting issues (as described in the table 
from page 98). Areas that were reviewed by 
the Committee included PwC’s extensive and 
detailed review of the valuations and 
assumptions related to defined benefit 
pension valuations and the UK group 
company intragroup purchase of certain IP, 
assumptions and calculations over Gross to 
Net Product Sales, legal settlements in the 
year, intangible asset assumptions used in 
cashflow modelling, and the recognition and 
measurement of uncertain tax liabilities.

The Committee concluded that the PwC audit 
was effective for the financial year ended 
31 December 2023. In February 2024, the 
Committee recommended to the Board the 
reappointment of PwC as the Company’s 
auditor for the financial year ending 
31 December 2024. Accordingly, a resolution 
to reappoint PwC as auditor will be put to 
shareholders at the Company’s AGM in 
April 2024.

   The role of the Remuneration 
Committee is set out in its terms 
of reference, available at 
www.astrazeneca.com. 

On behalf of the Board, I am pleased 
to present AstraZeneca’s Directors’ 
Remuneration Report for the year ended 
31 December 2023. 

At the beginning of the year, we announced 
the launch of our inspiring new 2030 Bold 
Ambition. Since launch, significant progress 
has already been made towards delivering 
on our stretching target of 15 new medicines 
by 2030, including the approvals of Truqap, 
Wainua and Airsupra. With strong revenue 
growth in 2023 and over 30 Phase III clinical 
trials underway (10 of these expected to 
have blockbuster potential), it is clear that 
AstraZeneca’s remarkable performance 
trajectory is set to continue to deliver value 
to shareholders in the years to come.

Key Committee activities in 2023
The Committee was pleased to have received 
a high degree of support for the 2022 
Directors’ Remuneration Report, with a 94% 
vote in favour at the Company’s 2023 AGM. 

An important area of focus for the Committee 
this year has been reviewing the current 
Directors’ Remuneration Policy (the Policy), 
which is required to be put to shareholders at 
the 2024 AGM. 

In the period since our Policy was last 
approved in 2021, we are proud that 
AstraZeneca has continued to grow and 
prosper under our CEO’s leadership – 
delivering excellent returns for shareholders, 
and consistently positioned first or second in 
the FTSE 100, materially larger in size than 
other UK listed companies. As a major global 
organisation, operating within the highly 
competitive global pharmaceuticals sector, the 
Committee is very aware of the challenges of 
providing competitive executive remuneration 
which balances the genuine pay pressures 
from a talent market heavily influenced by US 
practice, and the expectations of UK investors 
and the corporate governance environment.

During 2023, I spent time meeting with 
investors who hold over 50% of the 
Company’s issued share capital to discuss 
the Committee’s proposals for the 2024 
Policy. The valuable feedback received was 
discussed with the Committee, and was 
factored into the Committee’s consideration of 
both executive remuneration in 2024 and the 
Policy which will be put to shareholders for 
approval at the 2024 AGM. The new proposals 
are summarised later in this letter, and our 
new Policy can be found from page 127.

AstraZeneca has a well-established high 
performance culture, and we are committed 
to delivering and rewarding excellent 
performance. Over the year, the Committee has 
worked closely with its independent advisor 
and the Audit, Science and Sustainability 
Committees to ensure that the financial, 
science and ESG measures in our incentive 
plans are appropriate, suitably stretching and 
accurately assessed in order to enable the 
Company to achieve the 2030 Bold Ambition 
and Growth Through Innovation strategy.

In addition to overseeing the reward 
arrangements in relation to our Senior 
Executive Team (SET), including those for the 
appointment of Sharon Barr as EVP, 
BioPharmaceuticals R&D, we continue to look 
further into total reward of the wider workforce 
and are supportive of the Company’s efforts 
to ensure reward decisions are equitable by 
career level, geography and gender. The 
Committee is pleased that 35% of the 
employee population are eligible to participate 
in AstraZeneca share plans so that employees 
can share in the Company’s performance and 
align with the experience of shareholders. We 
are proud that AstraZeneca remains 
committed to paying a living wage for all 
employees globally.

AstraZeneca’s 2023 performance
Science and Innovation: 2023 saw another 
year of exceptional performance as we 
continued to expand and rapidly advance our 
high-quality portfolio. The scientific progress 
is essential for our patients who stand to 
benefit from our medicines and we are 
delighted that not only did we deliver 30 
pipeline progression events, either NME 
Phase II starts or Phase III investment 
decisions, but we were also able to exceed 
our goal for regulatory events by delivering 46 
over the year. AstraZeneca also continued to 
invest for the future and build our scientific 
leadership, with highlights including the 
agreement with Quell Therapeutics and 
proposed acquisition of Gracell 
Biotechnologies to advance cell therapies 
across oncology and autoimmune diseases 
and the new licensing agreement with 
Eccogene for a novel once daily oral GLP-
1RA, adding an exciting early asset with 
potential as a next-generation treatment for 
cardiometabolic diseases, diabetes and 
obesity to the CVRM portfolio. 

Growth and Therapy Area Leadership: 
In 2023, the commercial and regulatory teams 
have made great progress driving a 3% 
(constant exchange rate (CER): 6%) growth in 
Total Revenue, despite a decline of $3,736 
million from COVID-19 medicines. Excluding 
COVID-19 medicines, Total Revenue 
increased by 13% (CER: 15%). Oncology Total 
Revenue increased by 19% (CER: 21%) to 
$18,447 million following approvals of Imfinzi 
for biliary tract cancer and Imfinzi plus Imjudo 
for liver and lung cancers. Tagrisso, Imfinzi, 
Lynparza and Calquence were once again all 
stand out performers. Within BioPharmaceuticals, 
there was strong growth in all non-COVID-19 
therapy areas. CVRM Total Revenue was up 
15% (CER: 18%) to $10,628 million driven by 
Forxiga, Lokelma, roxadustat and Andexxa. 
Respiratory & Immunology Total Revenue was 
$6,404 million, an increase of 7% (CER: 10%). 
Rare Disease Total Revenue grew by 10% 
(CER: 12%) to $7,764 million, largely driven by 
Ultomiris (up 51% (CER: 52%)), along with 
marked contribution from Strensiq, Koselugo 
and Kanuma as they expand into new markets.

People and Sustainability: We continue to 
strive to be a great place to work. We have 
continued to invest in developing our leaders 
and nurturing a culture of lifelong learning. In 
2023, over 11,000 employees have 
participated in an immersive development 
experience and over 1.2 million self-guided 
learning modules have been completed in our 
learning platform Degreed. Inclusion and 
diversity remains an important priority; in 2023 
the Company has focused on embedding 
equity into our talent processes, building 
inclusive leadership capabilities and engaging 
our global workforce through quarterly Power 
of Diversity programming, such as our 
spotlight on building cultural intelligence. We 
have continued to make progress to increase 
the percentage of women at senior levels,

advancing to 50.1%, and have strong

with 40 countries of origin represented in

Sustainability is increasingly embedded into 
everything we do. The expansion of AZ 
Forest, raising our commitment to plant and 
ensure the long-term survival of over 200 
million trees by 2030, will contribute to 
Ambition Zero Carbon and remove around 
30 million tonnes of carbon dioxide from the 
atmosphere. Our ground-breaking partnership 
to deliver renewable natural gas to our US 
research and manufacturing sites will provide 
a source of clean heat which will contribute to 
our science-based target of reducing Scope 1 
and 2 emissions (operations and fleet) by 98% 
by 2026, whilst also contributing to the circular 
economy. We celebrated AstraZeneca being 
ranked number 1 among pharmaceutical 
companies for climate action in a new STAT 
Report, and we were proud of our strong 
presence at Climate Week and the UN 
General Assembly as we continued to drive 
change at scale.

2023 remuneration outcome
The Committee always seeks to ensure that 
the remuneration of our Executive Directors and 
our wider workforce reflects the underlying 
performance of the business. When approving 
outcomes, we therefore considered the Group 
scorecard along with wider business and 

individual performance over 2023, including 
other achievements across the enterprise, 
such as advancing our People and 
Sustainability priorities. In that context, the 
Committee believes that the payments 
outlined below fairly reflect their performance.

Annual bonus – 79.5% of maximum
When determining bonus outturns, the 
Committee considered the formulaic outcome 
from the Group scorecard along with wider 
business and individual impact and 
performance in 2023, including ESG 
achievements. The Committee determined to 
award an annual bonus equivalent to 79.5% of 
maximum to Mr Soriot and Dr Sarin (equivalent 
to 198.75% and 159% of base pay 
respectively), in line with the Group scorecard 
outcome. Details of the factors considered to 
determine the bonuses are provided from 
page 111.

    More information on the TSR 

peer groups for PSP awards can 
be found on page 115.

 Further detail of 2023 commercial 
and scientific performance can be

shares for three years to ensure further

Long-term incentives (LTIs)
2021 PSP – 88% of maximum
Our approach aims to reward sustainable 
outperformance and as a result of three very 
strong years, our 2021 award will vest towards 
the upper end of the possible range. The 
three-year performance period for 
Performance Share Plan (PSP) awards 
granted to our senior leaders in 2021, ended 
on 31 December 2023. Awards for all 
participants will vest at 88% of maximum, 
as shown on page 115 and reflects strong 
performance across all measures, as well as 
delivering a three-year TSR of 40%.

Policy review and remuneration in 2024
The Policy is due for renewal and we will be 
seeking shareholder approval for a new 
version of the Policy at the Company’s AGM 
on 11 April 2024. The new Policy is intended to 
remain in effect for three years from the date 
of the AGM.

During 2023, the Committee reviewed the 
Policy to ensure that it continues to be aligned 
with corporate governance best practice and 
promotes the delivery of long-term 
shareholder value. In shaping the new Policy, 
we have taken into account the perspectives 
of shareholders gathered from consultation 
undertaken during 2023. I met 26 of 
AstraZeneca’s largest shareholders and three 
proxy advisors to discuss our proposals, and 
was pleased with the level of engagement, 
feedback and support received. 

The purpose of the new Policy is to:

 > Incentivise the delivery of the Company’s 
2030 Bold Ambition and Growth Through 
Innovation strategy.

 > Continue to emphasise the importance 
the Committee places on performance-
related pay.

 > Retain and motivate incumbent Executive 
Directors to deliver against our strategy. 
 > Ensure that sufficient headroom exists to 
deliver market competitive performance 
based reward to our executives and down 
through the organisation.

In developing the new Policy proposals, the 
Committee noted that AstraZeneca has 
changed and grown significantly since the 
introduction of the 2021 Policy. The Company 
is more complex, with the integration of 
Alexion and the addition of successful new 
therapy areas in Rare Diseases and Vaccines 
& Immune Therapies. TSR of 40% has been 
delivered in this period, and Total Revenue 
has increased from $26.6 billion in 2020 to 
$45.8 billion at the end of 2023.

market-leading talent. Notably, we experience 
pay compression challenges under the 2021 
Policy, which does not provide sufficient 
headroom to deploy appropriately leveraged 
pay for performance compensation across our 
most senior leadership levels. Independent 
benchmarking of reward demonstrates that our 
current remuneration policy risks limiting our 
ability to compete for key roles below the Board, 
with heads of R&D being the most highly 
compensated roles in the industry below CEO 
level. 40% of our senior leaders are based in the 
US and over 40% of our revenue derives from 
the US. The Committee is acutely aware that we 
must be able to compete for the best talent in 
the US market. 

The Committee recognises that US pay 
practices differ from the UK, and in particular 
that US companies may offer a combination 
of time-based restricted stock, performance-
based stock, and sometimes market value 
options to executive directors. At AstraZeneca 
we firmly believe that executive pay should be 
clearly aligned to performance and therefore 
we are not proposing to alter the design of our 
incentive plans (annual bonus and PSP) in 
principle. However, in order to address the 
challenges of pay compression, and to 
provide a more competitive package for senior 
executives, we are proposing an increase to 
the maximum total incentive opportunity 
under our Policy, as set out below. The 
recommended changes will be accompanied 
by the Committee’s continued commitment to 
setting stretching targets, aligning to the 
delivery of the 2030 Bold Ambition. 

three-year cycle of the Policy. It will further 
engage our executive leadership in the 
conversion of the strength of our pipeline to 
commercial success, delivering industry-leading 
growth and our ambition of launching 15 new 
medicines by 2030 off the back of our planned 
material financial investment in future pipeline 
and partnerships. The importance of retaining 
and motivating our incumbent Executive 
Directors and senior leadership team in order 
to drive our 2030 Bold Ambition has been a 
key theme in consultation discussions with 
our shareholders. We seek to be competitive 
with comparable European pharma market 
peers and our proposals aim to reflect the 
performance, market capitalisation and future 
ambition of the Company in that context. 

Proposed changes to the Policy and how it 
will be implemented are summarised below 
and in more detail on page 127. The Policy is 
set out from page 128. The Committee would 
like to highlight that the key proposed changes 
are strictly linked to performance-related pay. 

 > No Policy changes are proposed in relation 

to base pay increases (which will not 
exceed the average of the relevant wider 
workforce) or pension arrangements 
(which are already in line with the relevant 
wider workforce).

 > We propose to increase the target annual 
bonus opportunity for the CEO, Mr Soriot, 
to 150% of base pay, resulting in a new 
maximum bonus of 300% of base pay 
(currently 250%), in line with the median target 
bonus opportunity of his global peer group. 
 > Target annual bonus for the CFO, Dr Sarin, 
remains unchanged at 100% of base pay, 
with a maximum bonus opportunity of 
200% of base pay. 

We face increasing external talent market 
pressure as our employees are rightly viewed as 

I believe that the proposed Policy reflects our 
current market position but, more importantly, 
should set us up for success over the next

 > Half of any earned bonus will be deferred 

into shares for three years. 

 > For awards under the PSP our proposal is 
to increase the maximum award under the 
Policy to 850% of base pay from the current 
650%, subject to appropriately stretching 
performance targets. This new maximum 
would apply to Mr Soriot in 2024 provided 
that it is approved by shareholders. 
 > Dr Sarin’s 2024 PSP opportunity would 

increase to 550% of base pay (from 450%).

 > At the same time, in light of feedback 
received from investors, the minimum 
shareholding requirement for each of our 
Executive Directors will increase to match 
their maximum variable pay opportunity, 
being 1,150% base pay for Mr Soriot, and 
750% base pay for Dr Sarin. 

The Committee recognises that these 
proposals are material if viewed in a UK 
context. However, the changes are necessary 
to increase the competitiveness of the 
performance-related pay opportunity in the 
context of the global and European pharma 
market. Given the size, complexity and global 
reach of AstraZeneca, the Committee does 
not consider the constituents of the FTSE 100 
to be an appropriate group against which to 
benchmark remuneration. Our approach is to 

look at remuneration opportunity amongst the 
European and global pharma peers with 
whom we compete for talent and compare 
performance and to determine a Policy which 
is highly weighted towards pay for 
performance. The charts below show our 
Executive Directors’ on-target and maximum 
opportunity relative to our defined comparator 
groups. Our proposed changes will bring 
Mr Soriot to the lower quartile of our global 
peer group, but will better reflect 
AstraZeneca’s relative position within the 
European peer group, moving up one position 
in the global and European rankings for target 
compensation and two positions at maximum 
(due to the higher proportion of pay at risk 
compared with peers). The increased PSP 
opportunity for Dr Sarin will bring her 
compensation into line with the global median 
of her peers. The importance of being able to 
offer our impactful and talented CEO a 
competitive remuneration package, has been 
a key area of interest raised by shareholders 
in consultation discussions.

The Committee is not proposing to make any 
changes to the choice of performance metrics 
and their weightings for the Annual bonus or 
the PSP in 2024, as feedback from our 
shareholders is that the metrics successfully

Market positioning of Executive Directors’ maximum remuneration

align pay with performance outcomes. Given 
the proposed increase in quantum, the 
Committee has rigorously reviewed the 
stretch in performance targets for 2024 to 
ensure they are appropriate and 
commensurate with delivery of excellent 
shareholder value. 

The Board considers that the proposed 
changes will enable our remuneration 
framework to be more competitive as we 
focus on the delivery of our 2030 Bold 
Ambition for our patients and shareholders. 
The emphasis on performance-related pay 
ensures that outcomes are fully aligned with 
shareholder interests as we address the need 
to attract and retain outstanding talent.

The Committee took shareholders’ feedback 
into account on the proposed changes to the 
Policy, and we would like to take this 
opportunity to thank all those who took part 
for their constructive engagement and 
support for our proposals.

Non-Executive Directors’ fees
With effect from January 2024, certain of the 
Non-Executive Directors’ fees have been 
increased. This reflects the continuing 
increase in workload and responsibilities of 
non-executive directors of large, global, 
complex, publicly listed companies, including 
the importance of the Science Committee and 
the Sustainability Committee to the Board’s 
work and the workloads of these Committees. 
AstraZeneca Non-Executive Directors’ fees 
have not been increased since January 2022. 
No Board member participated in any 
decisions relating to their own fees. Further 
detail is provided on page 118.

Next steps 
I hope that you find this Remuneration Report 
clear in explaining the 2024 Policy proposals 
and the implementation of our Policy during 
2023. We trust that we have provided the 
information you need to be able to support the 
resolution to be put to shareholders on the 
new Policy and this Remuneration Report at 
the Company’s AGM in April 2024.

2024 support the delivery of our strategy

Strategic Report

Corporate Governance

Financial Statements

Additional Information

AstraZeneca aims to continue to deliver great 
medicines to patients while maintaining cost 
discipline and a flexible cost base, driving 
operating leverage and increased cash 
generation. To incentivise and reward delivery 
of great performance over the short and 
longer term, the Committee carefully 
considers the balance of science, financial 
and ESG measures between the Annual 
bonus and PSP. 

Our focus on incentivising innovative science 
aligns with our patient-centric culture, as we 
strive to push the boundaries of science to 
deliver life-changing medicines to patients. 
The 2024 performance measures are closely 
aligned with our strategic priorities, as 
shown below.

    For more information about our 
strategic priorities, see page 12.

Science indices 
Our science measures incentivise the 
development of NMEs and the maximisation 
of the potential of existing medicines.

Bonus performance is assessed on pipeline 
progressions through Phase II and Phase III 
clinical trials. These reflect the outcome 
of nearer-term strategic investment decisions, 
whereas, in contrast, PSP performance is 
assessed on the volume of NMEs in 
Phase III and the registration stage, which 
reflects the outcome of longer-term strategic 
investment decisions. 

Additionally, we measure regulatory 
submissions and approvals for bonus, and 
regulatory approvals for PSP to drive the 
conversion of scientific progress into 
commercial revenue over the short term 
(bonus) and the longer term (PSP). 

Together, these science measures incentivise 
innovation and sustainable success along the 
length and breadth of the pipeline, leading to 
commercial growth.

Strategic pillar

 People and Sustainability 

We are committed to people and making a 
difference to society. Assessment of 
performance against this pillar is captured 
through a holistic review of each Executive 
Director’s individual performance (detailed on 
pages 112 and 113) as part of the final 
determination of annual bonus, including 
consideration of our progress against our 
ESG aspirations:

Total Revenue 
Our Total Revenue measure is included in the 
bonus and the PSP, reflecting the importance of 
incentivising sustainable growth in both the 
short and longer term.

Cash flow 
Ensures that we can sustain investment in 
our pipeline and Therapy Areas while at the 
same time meeting our capital allocation 
priorities. Cash flow is included in both the 
bonus and the PSP, ensuring a focus on both 
short- and longer-term cash flow generation 
and balance sheet strength.

Core EPS 
Incentivises operational efficiency and cost 
discipline, and remains a key measure of our 
profitability and a focus for our investors.

Total shareholder return (TSR) 
Assessed relative to our peer group of 
companies, the measure rewards positive 
performance that our shareholders also 
directly benefit from. This measure 
incentivises outperformance versus our peer 
group, and promotes the delivery of long-term 
sustainable returns for our shareholders.

 > Continuing to make our Company a great 
place to work by delivering our inclusion 
and diversity strategy and learning and 
development programmes.

 > Ensuring we operate in the smartest 

way and increase the speed of delivery 
of our life-changing medicines to 
patients through our Future of Work 
strategic initiative.

 > Leading the way in our efforts to improve 
access to healthcare and build health 
system resilience.

Ambition Zero Carbon 
This measure incentivises the 
elimination of our Scope 1 and Scope 2 
GHG emissions through 2025 with 
targets verified in line with the science of 
climate change, where we will innovate to 
avoid, reduce and substitute to become 
zero carbon.

How the Remuneration Committee 
ensures targets are stretching

We set stretching targets that incentivise our leaders to deliver exceptional performance, and to drive sustainable results for our patients, 
our employees and our shareholders. 2024 targets:
 > The Committee has reviewed the proposed targets against internal and external forecasts, including market consensus and peer group 

performance, and is comfortable that the level of stretch promotes truly exceptional performance in line with the delivery of our 2030 Bold Ambition. 

 > In real terms, financial performance goals under the 2024 Group scorecard and PSP would require achievement above prior year outturns 

and growth in excess of the average expected of the industry, particularly when taking the significant capital investment expected to be made 
during the performance period. 

Consistent with our approach in prior years we undertake the following robust process to setting annual bonus and PSP targets and 
assessing outcomes:

Stage 1 – 
Target setting

Stage 2 – 
Committee review 
and approval 
of targets

Science targets are based on a cohort of scientific opportunities 
specified at the start of the performance period. Opportunities 
represent potential achievements through the pipeline, from an 
early stage where our scientists work to discover new molecules, 
through to ultimately obtaining approvals and getting new 
medicines to patients. Rewarding success at each stage 
recognises the importance of creating and maintaining a 
long-term sustainable pipeline. Stretch of proposed targets is 
reviewed by the Science Committee taking into account factors 
such as the expected net present value of the pipeline and the 
anticipated financial contribution it will make, past performance, 
the external regulatory environment, and internal resourcing and 
efficiencies. Targets for realisation of these opportunities are 
ambitious. The outlook for the delivery of the pipeline is 
increasingly challenging given the rising proportion of new 
modalities and innovation, representing previously 
untested science.

Proposed targets for the Ambition Zero Carbon measure are 
reviewed and endorsed by the Sustainability Committee and 
exceed the 1.5°C Paris Agreement glide path. Our decarbonisation 
ambitions are increasingly challenging to deliver in the context of 
broader enterprise growth, particularly the higher supply 
volumes required to fulfil demand for our medicines.

Financial Targets metrics align with the Company’s Mid-Term 
Plan (MTP), which sets out the financial framework for delivering 
our ambitious strategy over a three-year period. The MTP 
process includes detailed business reviews, during which plans 
and efficiencies of each unit are challenged, leading to a 
proposed MTP for the Board to review and challenge. The 
Committee sets targets based on the Board-approved MTP, 
considering consensus expectations, independent analytics 
and anticipated challenges and opportunities. Whilst Total 
Revenue and Core EPS targets are set at budget exchange 
rates at the beginning of the performance period and evaluated 
at those rates at the end of the performance period (so that any 
beneficial or adverse movements in currency do not impact 
reward outcomes), the Committee also compares targets 
against prior plans at constant exchange rates, to ensure that 
new targets incentivise ambitious levels of growth. Where 
consensus figures do not align with internal forecasts, the 
Committee seeks to understand why a difference exists (such 
as differences in assumed capital expenditure). This range of 
data is used by the Committee to ensure the stretching nature 
of performance targets is robustly tested. Additionally, the PSP 
TSR measure is designed to reward strong performance relative 
to our peers.

The Committee thoroughly reviews and challenges targets 
proposed by management, working in partnership with the 
Science and Sustainability Committees to ensure targets are 
stretching and robust.

The Committee is provided with considerable supporting 
material for each metric and receives briefings from senior 
leaders across AstraZeneca. The science measures are reviewed 
and endorsed by the Science Committee, with a focus on 
ensuring that the targets will result in long-term sustainable value 
creation, and the Committee reviews and approves the full 
cohort of opportunities. The ESG metric within the PSP is aligned 
to our Ambition Zero Carbon goal and reflects the importance of 
eliminating GHG emissions in our Scope 1 and Scope 2 
operations through 2025.

The Ambition Zero Carbon metric has been reviewed and 
endorsed by our Sustainability Committee. 

Committee members participate in the full Board discussions 
on the strategy, MTP and budget, which form the basis for the 
targets. The Committee considers how proposed financial 
targets align with the MTP and budget; prior years’ outcomes 
(in absolute terms and against target); how the ambition has 
changed from the prior MTP and budget; external guidance the 
Company has provided or plans to give; consensus from 
external financial analysts and factors it may be impacted by; 
and the underlying assumptions. Statistical analysis conducted 
by the Committee’s independent adviser is also used to assess 
the proposals. This includes an assessment of historical levels 
of performance volatility.

Stage 3 – 
Performance 
assessment

At the end of the period, final performance against each metric is 
assessed. Outcomes are calculated based on performance 
against each weighted metric. Each performance measure is 
assessed on a standalone basis, so that underperformance 
against one measure cannot be compensated for by 
overperformance against another. Data for the metrics is taken 
from the Group’s financial reports which are reviewed by the 
Audit Committee and approved by the Board.

Stage 4 – 
Determination of 
Executive Directors’ 
bonuses

For annual bonus, the fairness of the formulaic Group scorecard 
outcome is considered in the context of overall business 
performance and the experience of shareholders. Such 
considerations include TSR performance and each Executive 
Director’s personal impact on the delivery of the strategy, wider 
ESG performance and other organisational achievements, such 
as inclusion and diversity targets and the realisation of 
technology-based milestones. Each year, there are important 
individual deliverables beyond the scorecard metrics which are 
taken into account when determining individual bonuses.

The Science Committee independently considers and informs 
the Committee whether science achievements represent a fair 
and balanced outcome, reflecting genuine achievements and 
pipeline progression. Ambition Zero Carbon outcomes are 
validated by the Sustainability Committee. Apart from Cash 
flow, which is set at actual rates of exchange, financial metrics 
are set at budget rates of exchange and evaluated at those 
rates at year end, which means they are not directly comparable 
year-on-year. The Committee is, however, provided with data to 
allow it to conduct year-on-year analyses.

Having considered the Group scorecard outcome, overall 
business performance, the experience of shareholders and 
individual performance, as detailed from page 112, the 
Committee carefully determines a final bonus outcome for each 
Executive Director that is considered fair and appropriate for the 
year’s performance, and is in the best interests of shareholders.

shares are subject to a further two-year holding period. The significant increase in AstraZeneca’s share price over the period of grant to vest has
provided the Executive Directors with a significant increase in value of the equity components of their reward. £3,945,583 of Mr Soriot’s and
£374,506 of Dr Sarin’s 2023 realised pay is attributable to share price increases. The benefit of the increased share price has also been

2023 Group scorecard assessment
Performance against the 2023 Group scorecard is set out below. 

Audited

The Group scorecard is used in the determination of bonus payouts for all AstraZeneca employees. Each metric within the scorecard is 
assessed on a standalone basis and has a defined payout range.

Performance below the specified threshold level for a metric will result in 0% payout for that metric. 100% of target bonus will pay out for 
on-target performance, and 200% of target bonus will pay out for performance at or above maximum. Performance between threshold and 
maximum is assessed on a pro rata basis. Maximum bonus payouts for the CEO and CFO for 2023 were capped at 250% and 200% of base 
pay respectively. The payout range for each metric is capped in line with each Executive Director’s maximum bonus opportunity to ensure 
underperformance against one metric cannot be compensated for by overachievement against another. The table below shows the scorecard 
formulaic outcomes for the CEO and CFO as a percentage of target bonus.

In 2023, the Growth and Therapy Area Leadership measure was based on Total Revenue. The Total Revenue and Core EPS measures are both 
set and evaluated at budget exchange rates at the beginning of the year and evaluated at those rates at the end of the performance period, so 
that any beneficial or adverse movements in currency, which are outside the Company’s control, do not impact reward outcomes. The Cash flow 
measure is set and evaluated at the actual exchange rate and is evaluated by reference to net cash flow from operating activities less capital 
expenditure, adding back proceeds from disposal of intangible assets, to be fully transparent with all elements easily derived from the Group IFRS 
Cash Flow Statement. 

Overall assessment
During 2023, the Executive Directors’ individual performance was assessed in the following key areas which align with the Company’s objectives. 

Audited

Pascal Soriot

Mr Soriot has skillfully steered AstraZeneca through another successful year. Commercial execution across all therapy areas and regions was very strong, 
underpinned by robust manufacturing and supply. Scientific performance in 2023 saw several significant positive read outs and regulatory approvals, including the 
launch of three new medicines that will contribute to the delivery of the Company’s 2030 Bold Ambition: Airsupra, Truqap and Wainua. Mr Soriot continues to lead 
the Company to drive Growth Through Innovation in science, with over a third of our pipeline now representing new modalities in 2023, reinforcing the 
transformative potential of our industry leading pipeline. Mr Soriot also oversaw the identification and signing of a number of impactful business development 
transactions during the year, including the licensing of a novel GLP-1 asset from Eccogene for obesity, the transaction with CinCor and proposed acquisition of 
Gracell Biotechnologies, which are expected to further accelerate delivery in cell therapy and oncology. 

Throughout 2023, Mr Soriot maintained a strong financial position for AstraZeneca, delivering yet another year of growth in revenue and profitability. The 
Committee also considered Mr Soriot’s leadership across other dimensions of performance: 

Demonstrating 
leadership to support 
developments in global 
life sciences

Mr Soriot has continued to drive change through a diverse set of external engagements with world leaders including senior government 
officials from the US, Canada, China and Sweden, enhancing strategic partnerships and catalysing innovation, demonstrating his 
thought leadership, his ability to drive global change and his influence on key issues.

He was the only private sector CEO to deliver a keynote speech at Climate Week in the presence of HM King Charles III and delivered a 
key note speech on Public – Private Partnerships for Healthcare Climate Action at COP28 in Dubai. He also attended both the American 
Society of Clinical Oncology (ASCO) and the European Society for Medical Oncology (ESMO) where he had the opportunity to engage 
with the scientific community, highlighting pivotal data that strengthens our confidence that we will replace conventional chemotherapy 
for many patients with advanced lung and breast cancers. 

Leading in 
Environmental, Social & 
Governance (ESG) 
performance 

Mr Soriot continued to advocate for an uncompromising sustainability agenda at AstraZeneca exemplifying, through his leadership, 
the essential role of ESG within AstraZeneca’s strategy and also the important role global leaders have in the direction of global 
decarbonisation, demonstrated by his leadership of the SMI Health Systems; and advancing climate action through his leadership and 
involvement in an industry collaboration to increase renewable energy to the industry’s supply base. His efforts have been recognised 
at COP28 and by TIME magazine which named Mr Soriot in its inaugural TIME100 Climate.

Making AstraZeneca a 
great place to work

Under Mr Soriot’s leadership, in 2023 AstraZeneca has improved or maintained its position on the ESG disclosures listings we report 
on, including receiving a Gold score from Ecovadis (previously Silver) and a step-up in the Corporate Sustainability Assessment (CSA) 
position to 4th in the sector. 

In 2023, AstraZeneca embarked on an extensive expansion of AZ Forest including forest protection and biodiversity for a cumulative 
200 million trees. It is estimated that AZ Forest will remove around 30 million tonnes of carbon dioxide from the atmosphere over 30 
years, demonstrating our commitment to environmental conservation, made possible by Mr Soriot’s leadership.

Healthy Heart Africa (HHA) continued to expand, launching in eight new countries. Over 43 million screenings have been conducted 
since the programme began, and 11,390 healthcare professionals trained. In total, over 66 million people have been reached by Access 
to Healthcare programmes.

Mr Soriot has continued to highlight the importance of having a truly diverse workforce, striving to drive a business with an inclusive 
and equitable environment where people feel that they belong, where they feel valued for the contribution they make, and empowered 
to push boundaries and innovate. Our Inclusion & Diversity (I&D) strategy, “The Power of Diversity” remained a key focus with topics 
including Clinical Trial Diversity, Cultural Intelligence, and spotlighting the work of our Employee Resource Groups (ERGs). AstraZeneca 
celebrated global I&D recognition days throughout the year including International Women’s Day, Neurodiversity Celebration Week, 
World Day for Cultural Diversity, Pride Month, International Day of the Girl and International Day for Persons with Disabilities.

Our progress was recognised externally on the 2023 Bloomberg Gender-Equality Index, Human Rights Corporation Corporate Equality 
Index, TIME World’s Best Companies, Forbes World’s Best Employers, Forbes World’s Top Companies for Women and Financial Times 
Leader in Diversity. 

Mr Soriot’s emphasis on leaders as coaches of our employees, and support for investments in lifelong learning has been key to 
providing our people with opportunities to perform, stretch, grow and take charge of their development. In 2023 AstraZeneca received 
several external, highly-respected awards for internal talent management programmes, including ‘Diversity by Design’ which won the 
Healthcare Businesswomen’s Association (HBA) Advancement. Commitment. Engagement. (ACE) Award and, alongside the 
Empowerment programme, also contributed to making AstraZeneca the Learning & Development winner of the Personnel Today 
Awards 2023.

Aradhana Sarin 

Audited

Dr Sarin continued to demonstrate her skills as a leader across the enterprise, helping to elevate a high-performance culture and driving efficiencies 
and simplification.

Performance delivery 

Under Dr Sarin’s leadership, the finance function continued to deliver strong performance and made significant steps in tax planning 
for the future, along with debt refinancing for the business building in additional flexibility to help support future business development. 
Dr Sarin was personally involved in the strategic and finance review for five major business development transactions, including CinCor, 
Pfizer Gene Therapy Portfolio, Eccogene, Icosavax and the proposed acquisition of Gracell Biotechnologies, along with providing 
guidance on negotiations, resulting in attractive terms for AstraZeneca.

Creating an enterprise-
wide impact through 
Global Business 
Services (GBS)

Under Dr Sarin’s guidance, GBS has maintained a pivotal role in AstraZeneca’s transformation. Aligned to the Future of Work, Dr Sarin 
has emphasised the need for simplifying, standardising, and scaling services so that AstraZeneca can deliver more medicines, faster 
and to more patients. 

Guided by Dr Sarin’s leadership, significant advances have been made creating efficiencies through clever use of new technology; the 
introduction of a transformational programme for data management which replaces multiple processes and uses integrated analytics 
that optimise process performance, and automated checks to ensure that data is right the first time; a new initiative on vendor demand 
which is transforming the way we search, find and buy goods and services; and an app developed and deployed which assists teams in 
Oncology Breast Cancer enabling them to make study co-location decisions – allowing studies to progress faster and removing 
complexities faced by Clinical Operations teams. All of these developments will help AstraZeneca to grow and change at speed.

Great place to work/ 
employee engagement

Dr Sarin continued to strive for increased diversity in the workplace. In June, she became the executive sponsor of AstraZeneca’s 
Network of Women.

Dr Sarin supported several I&D recognition days including World Day for Cultural Diversity and Dialogue, International Women’s Day 
and International Day of the Girl, for which she hosted a discussion panel focussing on the work of the Young Health Programme in 
driving greater equity for women and girls around the world.

Dr Sarin’s leadership style and positive influence on the team was reflected with Pulse scores showing that 90% of employees in the 
Finance function would recommend AstraZeneca as a great place to work and 91% believing that managers are committed to diversity 
and inclusion.

Final determination of Executive Directors’ bonuses
In determining the annual bonus outturn for Executive Directors, the Committee considers the formulaic Group scorecard outcome, as well as the 
overall business performance, shareholder experience and the personal contribution of the individual Executive Director. A description of the 
Executive Directors’ personal achievements is detailed above. 

Audited

Given the contributions made by both Mr Soriot and Dr Sarin in 2023 as outlined above, the Committee determined the bonus outturns for both 
Executive Directors should be 159% of target (or 79.5% of maximum), in line with the formulaic Group scorecard outcome.

Deferred Bonus Plan (DBP)
Half of each Executive Director’s pre-tax annual bonus is ordinarily deferred under the DBP. In respect of the bonus deferred, the Executive 
Director is granted a conditional award over shares. No further performance conditions apply to DBP shares. One half of the bonus earned in 
respect of performance during 2022 was deferred and details of the consequent DBP awards granted in 2023 are shown below. One half of the 
Executive Directors’ bonus earned in respect of performance during 2023 has been deferred and the consequent DBP awards are expected to be 
granted in March 2024.

Annual Report 
on Remuneration 
continued

Annual bonus continued

We intend to disclose the 2024 Group scorecard outcome and details of the performance hurdles and targets in the 2024 Directors’ 
Remuneration Report following the end of the performance period. The performance targets are currently considered to be commercially 
sensitive as prospective disclosure may prejudice the Company’s commercial interests. Executive Directors’ individual contribution will be 
assessed by reference to individual goals in line with the Company’s objectives for the year.

Long-term incentives

Long-term incentives included in the Executive Directors’ realised pay for 2023 figure: 2021 PSP
The Executive Directors’ realised pay for 2023 includes the value of PSP award with performance period ended 31 December 2023. These shares 
and dividend equivalents will not be released to the Executive Directors’ until the awards vest at the end of the holding period. 

Audited

The value of the shares due to vest has been calculated using the average closing share price over the three-month period ended 31 December 
2023 (10401 pence). The table below provides a breakdown showing the face value of these shares at the time they were granted, the value that is 
attributable to share price appreciation since grant, and the value of dividend equivalents accrued on these shares over the relevant performance 
period. Further information about the individual awards and performance assessments follows the table.

5  Calculated using the grant price of 8209 pence, being the average closing share price over the three dealing days preceding the CFO grant.

The 2021 PSP awards granted to Mr Soriot on 5 March 2021 and 14 May 2021, to take account of the revised limits for the PSP which were 
approved by shareholders at the Company’s 2021 AGM, are due to vest and be released on 5 March 2026 and 14 May 2026 on completion 
of a further two-year holding period. The 2021 PSP award was granted to Dr Sarin on 13 August 2021 following her appointment as CFO on 
1 August 2021. The award made to Dr Sarin was pro-rated to reflect that she took up the role part way through 2021. Her award is due to vest on 
13 August 2026 on completion of a further two-year holding period. Performance over the period from 1 January 2021 to 31 December 2023 
will result in 88% of the awards vesting, based on the following assessment of performance. The 2021 PSP targets were reviewed in light of 
the enlarged Group following the acquisition of Alexion. The Science and Innovation, Growth and Therapy Area Leadership, Ambition Zero 
Carbon and Cash flow targets were all amended in line with the Committee’s approach of ensuring performance targets are not materially 
more or less stretching as a result of the transaction and continue to incentivise strong delivery. No amendments were made to the TSR 
performance measure.
