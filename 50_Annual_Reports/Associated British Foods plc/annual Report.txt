Associated British Foods plc Annual Report 2023

Chairman’s statement

The Group performed very well in the financial 
year despite significant inflationary and other 
macro-economic pressures. 

Group revenue increased to £19.8bn, 16% higher than the 
previous year at actual exchange rates and 15% higher at 
constant currency. This increase in revenue was largely due to 
price increases negotiated across different businesses to 
mitigate high levels of inflation. As the financial year progressed, 
we saw the rate of inflation ease. 

Year-on-year performance in our Grocery and Ingredients 
divisions was strong while Sugar delivered higher sales and 
resilient profits in the face of difficult growing conditions in 
Europe. Retail revenue was very good, driven by our like-for-like 
performance and selling space expansion. At the start of the 
year we decided not to recover through pricing all the inflation 
in Primark’s input costs, and Primark adjusted operating profit 
fell by 3% year-on-year. 

Group adjusted operating profit rose to £1,513m, an increase 
over the previous year of 5% at actual exchange rates and 
4% at constant currency. Adjusted profit before tax rose 9% 
to £1,473m and adjusted earnings per share increased by 8% 
to 141.8p. 

Gross investment stepped up to £1.2bn in the financial year 
reflecting the many strategic investments made in our Grocery, 
Ingredients and Sugar divisions as well as a step-up in the store 
and technology roll-out in Primark. We made a number of small 
acquisitions for a total cash payment of £94m, in particular in our 
Agriculture division to expand the strength and breadth of our 
offer to the dairy sector. 

Capital structure and shareholder returns
Our capital allocation policy is for the Group’s financial leverage, 
expressed as the ratio of total net debt to adjusted EBITDA, to 
be well under 1.5 times, whilst financial leverage consistently 
below 1.0 times may indicate a surplus capital position. Surplus 
capital may be returned to shareholders by special dividends or 
share buybacks, subject to the Board’s discretion. 

During the financial year we executed £446m of a £500m 
share buyback programme with the remaining amount being 
completed recently. At the end of the financial year the financial 
leverage ratio was just under 1.0 times. The Group continues 
to prioritise investment in its businesses, and we expect to 
increase spend in each of the next few years to slightly above 
last year’s level. Nevertheless, given the outlook for the Group, 
the strength of the balance sheet and the underlying cash 
generation of the business, the Board has decided to continue 
to return additional capital to shareholders. Therefore, the Group 
will continue with a buyback programme, targeting an additional 
amount of £500m over the next 12 months. In addition, the 
Group is declaring a special dividend of 12.7p per share.

The Board is proposing a final dividend of 33.1p per share which 
together with the special dividend will be paid on 12 January 
2024 to shareholders on the register on 15 December 2023. 
Taken with the interim dividend of 14.2p a share, the aggregate 
total dividend equates to 60.0p per share, 37% higher than the 
total dividend of 43.7p per share in 2022.

Our commitment to good business
Our businesses aim to make a lasting contribution to society 
by following our Group values of respecting everyone’s dignity, 
acting with integrity, progressing through collaboration and 

delivering with rigour. The Group operates a devolved business 
model which gives the businesses considerable autonomy, but 
the Board has ultimate responsibility for overseeing responsible 
business practices across the Group. This year we continued to 
make good progress in our environmental initiatives in particular 
with significant investments in decarbonisation of Sugar, in 
water and effluent projects in Ingredients, and at Primark which 
progressed a number of initiatives under the Primark Cares 
programme including an increase in the proportion of recycled 
or more sustainably sourced materials used in our clothing. 

Board
There have been several important changes to the Board this 
year. We welcomed Eoin Tonge as a director in February 2023, 
succeeding John Bason as Finance Director in April 2023. 
Dame Heather Rabbatts became Senior Independent Director 
and Graham Allan became Chair of the Remuneration 
Committee in May 2023. Ruth Cairnie stepped down 
on 31 August 2023 after nine years on the Board. Ruth made 
a terrific contribution to our Board deliberations, and she leaves 
with our grateful thanks.

We have also welcomed Annie Murphy and Kumsal Bayazit as 
new non-executive directors. Annie joined from 6 September 
2023 and Kumsal will be joining from 1 December 2023. 
They bring a wealth of relevant experience in different areas to 
the Board and I very much look forward to working with them.

Looking ahead
Whilst the environment is still challenging for the consumer, 
inflationary pressures have eased and there is less volatility  
than there was 12 months ago. The Group is well positioned  
as a result.

At Primark, we believe our trading performance demonstrates 
the enduring strength of our appeal to customers across all 
markets. We continue to invest in both our existing store estate 
and in new stores and in our digital infrastructure. We expect 
further growth in sales next year driven by new selling space 
expansion of some 1 million sq ft and modest levels of like-for-
like sales growth. This like-for-like growth will be underpinned 
by our value proposition, our product relevance and stretch, 
our increasingly effective digital platform and some limited 
pricing. Lower material costs and lower freight costs should 
result in a substantial recovery in gross margin and overall 
we expect Primark adjusted operating profit margin to recover 
strongly. At this early stage we believe that the adjusted 
operating profit margin will be above 10% with further 
improvement dependent on levels of consumer demand. 

In our food businesses, we expect stability across our Grocery 
division as inflation recedes and as we step up our investment 
in marketing in our international brands. In Ingredients we 
anticipate a modest decline in sales and profit as we consolidate 
following a year of very strong growth and we invest to enhance 
capabilities. We expect Agriculture to move forward as markets 
improve and it integrates and leverages the acquisitions of the 
last two years. We continue to expect the broader Sugar 
portfolio to deliver a substantial improvement in profitability 
in this new financial year, driven by a marked improvement in 
the performance of British Sugar with an anticipated better UK 
sugar beet crop, and a significant reduction in losses at Vivergo. 

Strong cash generation will be driven by higher profitability, 
lower working capital, lower levels of cash tax payable and 
pension contributions, partially offset by higher capital 
investment. We look forward to a year of meaningful progress.

Chief Executive’s statement

At the start of this financial year we were staring at some very significant economic and political 
challenges. International currency markets were subject to extreme volatility and sterling’s 
weakness was damaging Primark’s gross margin. Supply chains were disrupted, not least by 
conflict in Ukraine. Inflation threatened consumer spending. And it was all but impossible to 
forecast how consumers in our many markets would behave. 

Faced with that outlook, we made two decisions. First, that we 
would work hard and consistently to recover our food margins 
wherever we could while taking great care to look after our 
customer relationships. And second, that we would raise prices 
only selectively at Primark, with the result that the impact of 
input cost inflation would mean lower Primark profits. To get 
a sense of the scale of the challenge, we believe that inflation 
increased costs across the Group by some £1.7bn in this 
financial year. That follows higher costs of £1bn in the previous 
year. As always in inflationary cycles, pricing actions lag the 
impact of rising input costs and, as a result, some of the 
benefits apparent this year originated from pricing agreed 
last year.

Today I look back at the twelve months with enormous pride 
in how the Group navigated those conditions. Revenues 
increased significantly but what is especially pleasing is how 
our businesses managed inflation with both consumers and 
customers in a thoughtful way, without damaging our 
businesses or those of others in the long run. It was not an easy 
process, but it was a necessary one, and it was handled with 
care. As the financial year progressed, inflation eased and some 
costs began to decline from recent highs, for example in freight, 
fabric and energy. This is not a uniform picture and inflation 
remains substantial in some countries in which the Group 
operates. But in aggregate we believe that the need for price 
increases in food and Primark are now largely behind us. 

So, Group revenue increased to £19.8bn, 16% higher than 
the previous year. Adjusted operating profit was also higher at 
£1,513m, an increase over the previous year of 5%. Adjusted 
earnings per share increased 8% to 141.8p. The fact that profits 
and earnings per share increased by less than revenues is a 
clear indication that we have more work to do to rebuild the 
Group margins. 

Against this backdrop our Ingredients business fared very well, 
with significantly higher adjusted operating profit. Grocery and 
Sugar also increased profits, albeit more modestly. Faced with 
challenging markets, profits fell in Agriculture. 

The effects of inflation were felt most in our Grocery 
businesses. We operate in many markets particularly through 
our international brands - Twinings, Ovaltine, Blue Dragon, 
Patak’s, Jordans and Mazzetti – and we used local consumer 
insight to manage inflation without overly impacting consumer 
demand. For the most part our branded product lines secured 
price increases sufficient to recover cash margins eroded by 
inflation, and in places we benefited from increased demand for 
own-label products. Our brands are now also more on the front 
foot in terms of investment. For example, Twinings plans to roll 
out campaigns internationally in the coming year while Ovaltine 
is benefitting from work on product innovation with the further 
introduction of Ready-to-drink products. Operational delivery 
also featured in our progress. Mazola and Fleischmann’s, our 
edible oils and yeast brands respectively in the US, had a very 
strong year with good availability of supply. In particular, I am 
very pleased with the improvement at Allied Bakeries while 
recognising we have more work to do. 

In Ingredients, the step-up in performance at AB Mauri has been 
significant. There were a number of good performances across 
its many geographies due to pricing, resilient volumes and good 
supply chain management. In fact, many other businesses 
in the Group benefitted from the experience AB Mauri has 
gained in the past from operating for years in high inflation 
environments. We continue to invest in the business to 
increase capacity and develop new products. ABF Ingredients, 
our specialty ingredients business, also increased sales well. 
Most of its businesses are long-term growth opportunities for 
the Group and much of this year has been focused on stepping 
up investment in capacity and capability for that growth. 

Agriculture had a more difficult year, as did many agriculture 
businesses across the world. Disease, particularly in pig 
and poultry, became a more common feature to manage. 
The imperative is to innovate using both science and 
technology, and we continue to invest in both AB Vista 
and our dairy-related businesses to this end. 

The year for Sugar could have been torrid. The UK beet harvest 
was blighted by a sequence of weather events that resulted in 
one of the lowest levels of sugar production at 0.74m tonnes 
and this in a year when energy costs were exceptionally high. 
In addition, Vivergo had a poor start to the year with a perfect 
storm of challenged industry margins and a difficult operating 
environment, both of which improved as the year progressed 
but which resulted in a substantial trading loss for this year. 
Next year looks much more promising. Illovo, our African sugar 
business, had a good year despite severe damage to our cane 
business in Mozambique due to flooding and it made further 
progress in developing its capability to offer retail packs to local 
markets. It strikes me that taken as a whole our Sugar business 
now has more balance due in part to geographical diversification 
– Illovo and our Spanish sugar business, Azucarera, performed 
well while our UK businesses struggled somewhat – and even 
within British Sugar our co-products activity compensated for 
some of the losses from sugar. 

I am delighted by Primark’s navigation of what could have been 
a very difficult year, when volatile inflation threatened to disrupt 
consumer spending. In the event, the strength of the Primark 
offer, and our decision to pass on only part of Primark’s cost 
increases in higher prices, stood us in good stead with our 
customers. Against the same period a year ago, sales reached 
more than £9bn, 15% higher at constant currency. Our difficult 
decision not to fully recover costs was fully vindicated, resulting 
in market share gains. The business has real confidence 
in its product offering both in the core proposition and in an 
increasingly impressive range extensions and collaborations, 
culminating in the collaboration with Rita Ora as the financial 
year ended. Margins at 8.2% were lower year-on-year, the 
natural consequence of our pricing decision.

CHIEF EXECUTIVE’S STATEMENT CONTINUED

OUR STRATEGY

We now have real momentum in our store opening programme 
and customer enthusiasm for new Primark stores continues. 
The digital programme is also building well. The roll-out 
of our enhanced website has been a key component of the 
programme, but as significant is the way we are organising and 
connecting our social media and digital marketing activities. 
Our Click + Collect trial has been extended by range and by 
geography, and we are adding self-checkout to our stores and 
automated systems to our warehousing. Last but not least,  
we are continuing to fit large numbers of low energy lightbulbs 
into our stores. 

Step-up in investment
We spent more than £1 billion in capital as a Group this year. 
While a minority of that investment is to replace existing plant 
or facilities or to meet regulatory requirements, most of the 
investment is aimed at growth. 

Among our ongoing capital projects for our food businesses 
is the exciting build of a new sugar factory in Tanzania, the 
completion of 17 decarbonisation projects across various sugar 
processes, completion of a new animal feed mill in Western 
Australia, reconstruction of a bakery for Tip Top also in Western 
Australia, further investment in core technology platforms for 
Grocery, and initiation of investment in a production facility in 
Nigeria for Ovaltine to serve markets across West Africa. 

In Primark, capital investment was also substantial. 
The company made considerable progress with its store 
expansion programme, now back at some 1 million sq ft of retail 
space a year with the associated logistics investments. We are 
also deploying technology in our digital roll-out and in areas such 
as self-checkouts and automated warehousing. 

More broadly we continue to invest across the Group 
in technology and innovation, not just in core operating 
systems but also increasingly in more innovative solutions 
for our businesses. 

We continue to expect at least this level of investment 
in the medium term.

People
I am immensely proud of the efforts of all our people in ABF 
who have worked hard in difficult economic circumstances 
made worse in some parts of the world by particularly bad 
weather. We continue to work very hard indeed to build a 
company where everyone feels welcome and included. 

In August we announced that Paul Foster, Managing Director 
of Mauri Australia, would succeed Stuart Grainger in November 
as Chief Executive of George Weston Foods following Stuart’s 
decision to retire from the role. Stuart joined ABF in 1995 and 
since 2008 he has been in Australia where he has transformed 
our businesses. I’d like to thank Stuart for being such an 
effective steward of the Group’s assets on the other side 
of the world. 

ESG
As a Group we have a clear sense of our social purpose. 
We work hard to provide safe, nutritious and affordable food 
and good quality, affordable clothing to millions of customers 

every day. At the heart of this purpose lies a devolved business 
model that empowers our managers to make the right 
decisions. This year saw significant progress across a wide 
range of ESG activities and actions designed to deliver 
on our previously published commitments. 

Of particular note were the steps taken this year to advance 
the decarbonisation of British Sugar. These investments, 
detailed later in this report under the Operating Review for ABF 
Sugar, are part of a broader strategy to cut Scope 1 and 2 GHG 
emissions at ABF Sugar by 30% by 2030. ABF Sugar accounts 
for some 82% of the energy used by the Group in our own 
operations, making its progress in decarbonisation critical to the 
delivery of commitments on GHG emissions. By the end of this 
calendar year, reduction targets for Scope 1, 2 and 3 emissions 
at ABF Sugar should be validated by the Science Based Targets 
initiative (SBTi). Primark’s targets for GHG emission reductions 
have already been validated by the SBTi this year. 

We recognise that water is a vital resource. We have carried 
out a high level water risk assessments for our Group 
operations using recognised methodologies and we are working 
steadily to reduce our water footprint. A significant amount 
of our water use occurs in crop irrigation and we are focused 
on improving the efficiency of this process. We have recently 
approved a large-scale irrigation project which could bring 
significant benefits. 

The year has shown us the potential impact of extreme 
weather. Our businesses are adapting and building resilience. 
They are also supporting social and environmental interventions 
on farms globally, with management models that include 
certified organic production, standards to promote wildlife 
biodiversity, and engagement with smallholder growers in 
developing markets. 

We understand that making progress in our supply chain, 
which is extensive, requires sustained and focused work over 
time. For that reason it is gratifying to note that the Primark 
Sustainable Cotton Programme celebrated its 10th anniversary 
this year. This year alone, Primark sold more than 337 million 
products made from this cotton, at the end of July this year, 
299,388 farmers had taken part in the training programme. This 
feels like very tangible progress, although there remains more 
to do of course.

Looking ahead
The Group is in very good shape. Its diversification, 
its strong positions in attractive markets, and the calibre 
of its management teams will stand it in good stead in the year 
ahead. But more than that, the operational improvements that 
we have made in the last 12 months, along with investment in 
new capacity and capabilities, should enable the Group to make 
very meaningful financial progress. Primark is as well placed as 
it has ever been, and our food businesses are as strong as ever. 
I look forward to this year with pleasurable anticipation. 

George Weston
Chief Executive

Creating long-term value…

Our Group strategy is to create long-term value for our shareholders 
and other stakeholders alike.

Our strategy is to achieve sustainable growth over the long 
term, increasing shareholder value through sound commercial 
and responsible business decisions that deliver steady growth 
in earnings and dividends. Our ownership structure provides us 
with the stability to invest in businesses that we believe in and 
to support the growth of those businesses over the long term. 
Our ESG agenda is shaped by the leaders within each business 
who are closest to the opportunities and risks. ESG factors are 
not only taken into account within business strategy, they are 
put into effect by people at every level of the Group who are 
trusted and empowered to exercise good judgement.

 Grocery

Our Grocery businesses are founded on a set of strong 
brands with leading positions in many markets worldwide.

For our international brands such as Twinings, Ovaltine, Patak’s, 
Blue Dragon and Jordans, we focus on investing in brand equity 
and employ regional strategies to drive growth.

We also have a series of more regional brands that are market 
specific, such as Tip Top bakery in Australia, Mazola vegetable 
oils in the US, and Kingsmill in the UK, where we seek out 
leading market positions in the relevant domestic markets.

For most of our brands we have our own end-to-end 
manufacturing capability which is critical in supporting new 
product development and operational excellence that drives 
our brand proposition.

Read more about Grocery’s performance and brands in action 
this year on pages 14 to 17.

 Ingredients

Our Ingredients businesses enable or enhance the 
production of food and other products.

AB Mauri manufactures and sells yeast and ingredients 
of a consistently high quality to the baking industry. We operate 
globally and have strong market positions in the Americas, 
Europe, and south and south east Asia. Through our Global 
Technology Centre in the Netherlands we invest in innovation 
to generate opportunities for growth. ABF Ingredients develops 
and manufactures specialty ingredients for the food, health and 
nutrition, pharmaceutical, animal health and industrial sectors. 
We focus on high-value niches and are differentiated by our 
technology, product quality and customer-centric culture. 
The breadth and low cyclicality of our products, customer base 
and applications provide commercial resilience. Our strategy 
is for growth both through acquisitions and organically through 
geographical expansion, innovation and new applications.

Read more about Ingredients’ performance and the innovation 
in our business this year on pages 18 to 21.

 Agriculture

AB Agri is an international agri-food business and a leader 
in the UK.

We supply farm performance services, animal feed, speciality 
ingredients and supplements to farms, feed manufacturers, 
food producers and retailers.

Our growth strategy sets out opportunities to strengthen our 
position in current markets, expand into new geographies, 
connect data and technology in new ways to deliver on-farm 
performance and build on our established position of strength 
in the dairy industry.

Read more about Agriculture’s performance and the expansion 
of our business this year on pages 22 to 25.

 Sugar

ABF Sugar has a portfolio of attractive positions, 
generally in deficit markets which are somewhat insulated 
from the volatile world sugar price by local supply and 
demand conditions.

We have significant opportunities to grow profits by continuing 
our efforts to become truly customer-led, by driving further 
efficiency and building out our co-products portfolio, all whilst 
working to reduce our water, carbon and electricity usage.

Our African sugar businesses are building attractive consumer 
brands and effective routes to market that will reinforce our 
market-leading positions. In the UK and Spain, where the 
majority of sugar demand is from food and drink manufacturers, 
we have built strong business-to-business offers around security 
of supply and quality. We have efficient operations, but there 
remains an opportunity to fully optimise reliability and utilisation 
to gain valuable additional volumes. In our fields, we are using 
data to improve yields and profitability for our growers.

Read more about Sugar’s performance and the development 
of our business this year on pages 26 to 29.

 Retail

Primark’s vision is to provide a wide choice of great-quality 
essential clothing and fashion at prices that are affordable 
to as many people as possible.

Our strategy is to drive business growth through the 
development of existing product categories, expansion into 
new product categories and space expansion in both existing 
and new markets.

Our customer appeal is supported by our commitment to price 
leadership, an exciting store environment and our sustainability 
programme. We are also using our increasingly sophisticated 
digital and online technologies which are driving marketing 
and customer engagement.

Who we are
Associated British Foods is a highly diversified group with 
a wide range of food and ingredients businesses, more than 
40 well-known grocery brands, and our flagship retail brand, 
Primark. We have a strong social purpose: to provide safe, 
nutritious and affordable food, and clothing that is great value for 
money. We are a global organisation with 133,000 employees, 
operations in 55 countries, suppliers in many more, and 
customers in more than 100 countries. More than half of our 
senior leaders are non-UK citizens, representing 26 different 
nationalities between them.

Devolved operating model
We operate a devolved operating model across our five 
business segments of Grocery, Ingredients, Agriculture, Sugar 
and Retail and believe the best way to create enduring value 
involves setting objectives from the bottom up rather than 
the top down. We make operational decisions locally, because 
in our experience decisions are most successful when made 
and owned by the people with the best understanding of their 
customers and markets. This accountability is highly motivating 
for our strong local management teams, encouraging an 
entrepreneurial approach that drives innovative 
business thinking.

The same is true of our ESG agenda, which is shaped by 
the leaders within each business who are closest to the 
opportunities and risks, and who benefit from detailed local 
knowledge, customer insights and clear ownership of actions. 
It means ESG factors are not only taken into account within 
business strategy, they are put into effect by people at every 
level of the Group who are trusted and empowered to exercise 
good judgement.

The Group, or corporate centre, provides a framework for the 
sharing of ideas and best practice. The Group is in constant 
dialogue with the people who run our businesses, giving our 
corporate leaders a comprehensive overview of their material 
opportunities and risks and enabling collaboration, where 
appropriate. Because the centre is small and uses short lines of 
communication, we can also ensure prompt and unambiguous 
decision-making.

The chart to the left shows how our business model works, 
from the discussion and scrutiny of each business by the Group 
leadership team to oversight by the Board through our 
structured governance framework.

Creating long-term value
We take a long-term view to create long-term value for our 
shareholders, business partners, employees and the 
communities in which we operate. Our strategy is to achieve 
sustainable growth over the long term and the Group balance 
sheet is managed to ensure long-term financial stability, 
regardless of the state of the capital markets. We are 
committed to increasing shareholder value through sound 
commercial and responsible business decisions that deliver 
steady growth in earnings and dividends.

…to create long-term value for all our stakeholders. 

Our unique ownership structure
The Group’s majority shareholder is Wittington 
Investments Limited, a privately owned company 
which in turn is majority owned by the Garfield 
Weston Foundation. The Foundation is one of the 
UK’s leading grant-making charitable institutions and 
is mainly funded by the dividends from Associated 
British Foods. The returns we generate therefore 
matter not only for shareholders, but also to many 
charities. In its last financial year to 5 April 2023, 
the Foundation donated £90m to around 2,000 
charities across the UK and in the 65 years since 
the Foundation was created it has disbursed more 
than £1.5bn in grants.

The Foundation has 
disbursed more than

£1.5bn

in grants since 1958

Our ownership structure provides us with the stability to invest 
in businesses that we believe in and to support the growth 
of those businesses over the long term. Our growth has been 
mostly organic, achieved through investment in marketing, 
development of existing and new products and technologies, 
and through targeted capital expenditure to improve efficiency 
and expand capacity. Acquisitions are carefully selected to 
complement existing business activities and exploit opportunities 
in adjacent markets or geographies; disposals are made when 
judged the best route to creating shareholder value.

Our long-established, disciplined approach to capital investment 
underpins our growth. We manage our balance sheet to provide 
the headroom necessary to fund long-term investment and 
we make funding available to all our businesses, providing 
that analysis of their investment proposals proves sound and 
the financial returns meet or exceed a set of clearly defined 
criteria. We believe that this approach, coupled with a rigorous 
commitment to ethical conduct and sustainable business 
practice, is the best way to create enduring value for all 
our stakeholders.

Our people, culture and values
We understand the value of good people, strong and accountable 
teams, the power of brands, the need for continuous investment 
and the need to maintain strong and enduring relationships 
with customers and suppliers.

Across all our businesses, we live and breathe our values 
through the work we do every day, from investing in the 
health and safety of our colleagues, to promoting diversity and 
inclusion and respecting human rights. Our values are: respecting 
everyone’s dignity; acting with integrity; progressing through 
collaboration; and delivering with rigour.

We pride ourselves on being a first-class employer, working 
actively to develop our people and create opportunities for 
progression. As a result, our employees tend to stay with us 
for a long time, building exciting careers that help them fulfil 
their goals at work, at home and in the community.

We believe that most people are inherently good and that 
with encouragement, engagement and support they will do 
the right thing in the right way. Our high standards of integrity 
enable us to drive a strong culture, recognising that acting 
responsibly is the only way to build and manage a business 
over the long term.

Operating review

Our Grocery businesses performed with great resilience in what 
were challenging inflationary conditions. Revenues were strongly 
ahead of last year driven primarily by price increases through the 
course of the year to mitigate cost inflation. Despite the challenges 
of dealing with inflation volatility, adjusted operating profit margin 
held at 10.7%, helped in part by a recovery in our Allied Bakeries 
business. Adjusted operating profit for the year was 8% higher 
at £448m. In the first half of the year revenues were 10% higher 
than the same period a year ago. In the second half, revenues 
were 12% higher. The difference in the growth rates predominantly 
reflects the lag between the input cost inflation of the prior year 
and the first half of this financial year and the time taken to 
implement pricing. As this year progressed, inflation abated 
somewhat. Adjusted operating profit in the first half was £173m, 
down 10% on the same period a year ago. However, in the second 
half adjusted operating profit increased by 23% to £275m as the 
effect of pricing came through. 

Our group of international brands – Twinings, Ovaltine, Blue Dragon, 
Patak’s, Jordans and Mazzetti – largely performed well. Sales at 
Twinings moved higher on pricing to recover input cost inflation, 
with volumes broadly flat. Within this, there were good 
performances in the US, UK, Australia and France. The brand 
conducted a number of marketing trials in the year as a prelude to 
deploying marketing spend to drive further growth. Sales of fruit and 
herbal infusion teas have increased significantly and are now close 
to those of black teas. Ovaltine sales also moved higher, with good 
performances in Brazil, Switzerland and Nigeria partially offset by 
lower foodservice sales in China and by difficult trading conditions 
in Myanmar. We saw an increase in sales of Ready-to-drink products 
in Thailand but lower sales of higher margin powder products. 
Patak’s and Blue Dragon both traded well. Half the sales of Patak’s 
are now located outside the UK where we delivered good growth, 
and the brand also delivered strong growth in the US and good 
growth in Australia. Blue Dragon delivered strong value growth, 
increasing further its proportion of international sales with growth in 
the US and Canada. Jordans had a resilient year, broadly maintaining 
its international sales. The Mazzetti brand of balsamic vinegars 
continued its international growth and nearly half of sales are now 
outside Europe. 

As noted above, in the US our international brands performed well. 
Our US focused brands and businesses also traded well. Mazola, 
the leading brand in the US edible oils category, delivered strong 
volumes and profitability supported by new production capabilities. 
Sales of our Fleischmann’s yeast and baking ingredients products 
have also been strong. Stratas, our joint venture in the US that 
supplies oils and other products to the foodservice, ingredients and 
retail markets, traded strongly due to improved sales mix and good 
procurement of oils. 

In our UK focused brands and businesses, the sales trajectory 
of Allied Bakeries improved considerably through the course 
of the year due to higher volumes, stronger pricing and operational 
improvement. We continue to work on improvements to the 
financial performance of this business. Ryvita continues to 
underperform but is investing in a brand relaunch and early results 
are positive. Shortly after the period end we acquired the Capsicana 
range of Latin American products such as tortillas, pastes, kits and 
seasoning mixes, broadening further our range of world foods.

In our Australian focused brands and businesses, sales at our Tip 
Top brand increased due to pricing taken to mitigate cost inflation. 
Performance at Don was held back by high meat costs, labour 
shortages and the insolvency of a major distribution business. 
As a result, we have conducted a value in use assessment which 
has led to a non-cash exceptional impairment charge of £41m. 

Investment continued, with major projects including the 
re-construction of the Canning Vale bakery in Western Australia 
which will secure Tip Top’s position as the leading supplier in that 
state and the first part of Ovaltine’s investment in a production 
facility in Nigeria to serve markets across West Africa. We have 
also invested in increased edible oil production capacity in the US. 
The division has also stepped up its investment in core 
technology platforms.

OPERATING REVIEW – GROCERY CONTINUED

Tip Top’s expanded foodservice offering
Tip Top is a key player in Australia’s bakery 
market, serving both the retail channel and 
the foodservice channel, which includes 
restaurants, cafés and clubs. The retail bakery 
market is quite mature, but we have leveraged 
drivers of growth such as ‘out of home’ dining 
and premiumisation to deliver impressive sales 
growth in the foodservice channel over the 
last three years.

Despite the challenges brought on by the pandemic, when 
many restaurants and cafés were forced to close, the trend for 
consumers to dine ‘out of home’ bounced back and continues 
to grow. This is demonstrated by foodservice’s impressive 
five-year growth rate of 8%, significantly above the 5% growth 
rate achieved in retail sales over the same period. Over the past 
two years, Tip Top has outperformed the market and driven 
sales by focusing on premiumisation of its product range and 
a revitalised channel strategy, which focuses on our three key 
routes to market: ‘quick service restaurants’ (QSR), distributors 
and direct accounts. 

A great example of this progress is in burger buns, where 
we have significantly improved our product offering. Our new 
range of premium buns – which are glazed, noticeably softer 
and better-tasting – have been very well received by our QSR 
customers and, importantly, by consumers too. This new 
range – which includes potato, brioche-style and milk buns 
– has driven impressive sales growth and transformed the 
performance of the burger bun category. This trajectory looks 
set to continue as we partner with our customers in the QSR 
segment and expand our customer base in the fast-growing 
and high-value hotels, restaurants and cafés segment. As we 
like to say – it’s the bun that makes the burger!

Strong brand propositions driving  
growth in the US
This year has been notable for the strong 
progression in the US enjoyed by a number 
of our brands despite a challenging 
retail environment.

Twinings is now the fastest-growing tea brand in the 
American market. Our products are enjoyed in half a million 
more households compared with three years ago, the 
greatest increase in household penetration of any tea brand. 
We achieved this outperformance by broadening our offering, 
both in terms of ranges and pack sizes; by evolving our 
marketing to become more modern, distinctive and relevant 
to today’s consumers; and by building strong relationships with 
our retail partners. 

In addition to strong growth in traditional retail, we are now 
the number one selling tea brand on Amazon. We have 
developed a powerful, collaborative partnership with Amazon 
and revamped our brand store to showcase compelling content. 
We keep the consumer at the heart of what we do, creating 
meaningful and engaging advertising, enhancing search engine 
optimisations and making it easier for consumers to find and 
buy the Twinings products they are looking for. 

Our Mazola cooking oil brand bucked the category trend, which 
was impacted by inflation resulting in a decline in the overall 
market. It grew market share to return to its position as the 
number one branded cooking oil in the US.

We accomplished this by using targeted digital and TV 
advertising to strengthen brand loyalty and remind consumers 
of the heart-healthy benefits of Mazola corn oil.

Thai consumers favour Ovaltine’s  
Ready-to-drink products
Ovaltine has been a household name and 
staple product in Thailand for more than 
80 years. This year, as the Thai economy 
continued to recover from the effects of the 
COVID-19 pandemic, we saw consumers 
favouring our Ready-to-drink (RTD) format. 

Our RTD products grew by 17.1%, driving growth across the 
malted beverage category but also significantly outperforming it. 
This surge in popularity was due not only to advertising but also 
to a desire for convenience, with RTD growth stronger in urban 
centres where this format is even more important to consumers. 
Our new advertising helped strengthen the brand image, with 
the campaign ‘Promoting love and warmth in the family’ 
resonating well. 

In the past year, Ovaltine Ready-to-drink reached its highest 
consumption at 243 million serves, an increase of more than 
20% on the previous year.

popular Ovaltine RTD products in Thailand

successful in the US

Our Fleischmann’s yeast brand also used digital and social 
media to promote the brand, extolling the benefits of home 
baking to consumers and helping us grow the category and 
our market share. The cost-of-living crisis is cited as the reason 
behind declining volumes across 86% of US grocery categories 
but, with home-baking remaining elevated, commercial 
activities to promote Fleischmann’s helped the yeast category 
grow more than 5%.

Our Blue Dragon and Patak’s world food brands have been 
available on the US market for many years but the pandemic 
was a pivotal moment for them. With restaurants closed, 
consumers wanted to enjoy international cuisines by cooking 
them at home, a trend that continued post-pandemic. 
Growth was also fuelled by changing consumer trends, with 
professional chefs finding innovative ways to use rice and nori 
wrappers, including frying them or adding them as a topping 
to salads and poke bowls. 

The Asian food category is worth $1bn annually and Blue 
Dragon is one of many players in this market. However, we 
have the added advantage of being pan-Asian, offering Thai, 
Chinese, Vietnamese and Japanese ranges. Blue Dragon is 
now the number one spring roll wrapper in the US and we are 
broadening our offering to include Asian sauces and a selection 
of egg, rice and soba noodles, as well as a range of products 
including Thai paste and coconut milk to help consumers make 
authentic Thai curries at home.

Operating review

Ingredients had a very strong year with substantial increases in both 
revenues and profits and, significantly for the future development 
of these businesses, higher investment in both production capacity 
and capability. 

Revenues were well ahead of last year primarily due to pricing 
action to recover large increases in raw material and other input 
costs which were apparent both this year and in the prior financial 
year. Revenues in the first half of the financial year were ahead of 
the same period last year by 27% at £1,088m. In the second half 
of this financial year, revenues were 6% ahead at £1,069m. 

Profitability this year was well ahead of the last financial year as the 
benefits of pricing were felt, with volumes proving generally resilient 
and a particularly strong performance by AB Mauri, our yeast and 
bakery ingredients business. In the first half of the financial year, 
Ingredients’ adjusted operating profit was 48% higher than the 
same period a year ago at £102m; in the second half of the period, 
adjusted operating profit was 14% higher at £112m. 

AB Mauri had a very strong year with significant increases in both 
revenues and profit. Price increases lagged prior year input cost 
inflation as customer contracts came up for renewal. As these 
contracts were repriced, the benefits came through strongly with 
little impact on volumes. Demand for yeast remained good, both 
from industrial bakers and from consumers who returned to home 
baking during the pandemic. Sales and profitability were particularly 
strong in the US. Elsewhere, hyperinflation continued in Argentina, 
Venezuela and Turkey with a consequent need for frequent 
repricing. Transition of our China business to our joint venture 
was completed. 

We continue to invest in effluent treatment plants at many sites 
to deliver on our commitment to maintain appropriate standards 
of water quality, this investment being significant in recent years. 
More broadly, the company’s water strategy focuses on reducing 
its water-intensity ratio defined as the quantity of water consumed 
per tonne of product produced, excluding by-products. AB Mauri 
has reduced its overall water-intensity ratio by 25% since 2017/18.

ABF Ingredients, our portfolio of specialty ingredients businesses, 
delivered a solid increase in revenues derived from pricing taken 
to offset input cost inflation, partially offset by a small decline in 
volumes, particularly in the second half of the period as customers 
destocked following the stabilisation of supply chains. Profits were 
slightly lower year-on-year as we continue to invest in these growth 
businesses to enhance capability in both research and development 
and in commercial activities.

Specifically, AB Enzymes, specialising in food and feed enzymes, 
had flat sales with pricing offsetting lower volumes caused by 
destocking. Ohly, specialising in yeast extracts, delivered good 
revenue growth driven by robust demand from food and 
bionutrients customers. SPI Pharma, specialising in pharmaceutical 
excipients, continued to progress with pricing and volume growth 
and an improvement in manufacturing efficiency. ABITEC, 
specialising in lipids, delivered a modest increase in sales driven 
by a solid performance in the Pharma and Nutritional Science 
sectors. Fytexia, our life sciences businesses acquired last year, 
continued to perform well. PGPI, which specialises in extruded 
proteins, saw volumes fall due to lower consumer demand for 
nutrition bars in the US. 

Investment continued, with major projects including a powder 
packing line for AB Enzymes at Rajamaki, Finland, and increased 
capacity at Ohly’s fermentation and spray dryer operations in 
Hamburg. In Mauri ANZ, investment in our animal feed mill in Hope 
Valley in Western Australia was completed and commissioned. Our 
specialty yeast plant in Hull has now been commissioned.

OPERATING REVIEW – INGREDIENTS CONTINUED

Celebrating the centennial of an iconic brand in bakery ingredients
In Argentina this year we celebrated the 100th anniversary of Calsa, AB Mauri’s consumer 
yeast brand. Calsa is well known there for its high quality, innovation and customer service, 
a reputation which we have developed over the past century.

It is this consistency that has made our levadura fresca product, 
or fresh yeast, a household name in the country since its origins 
in 1923. Calsa, which was created as a high-quality yeast for 
legendary Argentine bakery Virgen, has evolved to become 
AB Mauri’s flagship product in Argentina. 

Calsa’s dedication to the skilled craft of bakery has endured 
for decades, particularly in the 1960s, when the brand featured 
a much-expanded product, and in the 1970s when we 
introduced a school of bakery. With the launch of this 
educational initiative we deepened our business strategy, 
thereby delivering on Calsa’s ultimate mission and purpose: 
to help develop the artisan bakers of tomorrow. The bakery 
school still serves as a trusted mentor to home and commercial 
bakers across Argentina.

Fast-forwarding to the 1990s, Calsa underwent further 
significant development with the addition of a premium lineup 
of silver-branded bakery and pastry ingredients which has 
proved important to its current success.

Today the collection is led by Calsa’s traditional fresh yeast as 
well as other innovative products featuring added sourdough, 
better kneading and mixing capabilities, and more. 

Calsa continues to lead the industry by staying true to the 
purpose established a century ago, prioritising what is important 
for artisan and home bakers in Argentina. We continue to 
nurture this reputation through the creation of the freshest, 
highest-quality handmade bakery products and our focus on 
consistent and well-executed service to customers.

Capacity expansion at Ohly’s Hamburg plant
After multiple years of sales and volume 
growth at our Hamburg plant, where we 
produce innovative yeast extracts, we 
implemented a significant programme of 
investment to increase capacity and efficiency 
to enable us to continue to service increasing 
customer demand. 

This investment will also improve environmental performance 
and enhance our ability to tailor products to customer needs. 

Ohly’s strong growth has been driven by our product-led 
commercial teams, who have developed deeper insights into 
both their sectors and customers’ needs in key markets such as 
food, health and nutrition, animal health, and bionutrients. 

We have invested in a state-of-the-art drying tower which, once 
complete, will enable us to dry a significant proportion of our 
yeast extract products on-site, reducing the distance our 
products have to travel during processing. This new equipment 
will also reduce the amount of electricity and water used during 
the drying process by 10%, enhancing our efficiency and 
improving our environmental footprint.

We have also invested in a new on-site fermentation facility. 
This cutting-edge system has been designed specifically for 
the manufacture of our products and will increase production 
capacity by 50%. The investment should also enable us to run 
our fermentation process using approximately 40% less water, 
30% less natural gas and 25% less electricity. 

These two investments will enable us to meet customer 
demand, which has nearly doubled over the last seven years. It 
will also provide us with the capability to tailor our products to 
these markets, as well as the potential for further innovation.

About Agriculture

Operating review

AB Agri revenues were up 7% against the same period last 
year driven by pricing taken to mitigate input cost inflation, 
partially offset by lower volumes in the UK and China compound 
feed businesses. By period, revenue in the first half grew 
15% compared to the same period a year ago but fell by 1% 
year-on-year in the second half, largely reflecting movements in 
input commodity prices. As a result of these challenging market 
conditions, adjusted operating profit reduced to £41m despite 
a modest recovery in the second half of the financial year. 

There was a decline in the size of the European pig and poultry 
sectors as a result of disease and high cost of inputs, reducing 
sales volumes and margins in our compound feed and starter 
feed businesses. The dairy sector was more resilient, and we 
saw higher revenues and profits in our businesses serving that 
sector. In China, lockdowns caused by the pandemic depressed 
demand for pork products and reduced pig herd sizes, resulting 
in a decline in that market. AB Vista, our international feed 
additives business, traded robustly with sales and profits both 
slightly higher. The performance at Frontier, our joint venture 
specialising in farm crop inputs and grain marketing, was only 
slightly lower than the record results achieved last year as grain 
and fertiliser trading normalised. 

We believe there is an opportunity to develop a unique full 
service offer to the dairy sector. In August 2023 we completed 
the acquisition of National Milk Records for £48m which 
provides services to the dairy supply industry including 
testing services and management information which are 
complementary to AB Agri’s existing services. This follows our 
acquisition in November 2022 of Kite Consulting and Advance 
Sourcing which also serve customers in this sector.

AB Agri employs more than 3,000 people around the world. 
We sell products and services into more than 100 countries and 
our global operations continue to grow.

We have an expert understanding of agriculture and animal 
nutrition and we combine data and technology with industry 
expertise to enable the production of nutritious and 
affordable food.

Our core capabilities include:

Creating innovative nutrition and technology-based 
products – we are a major investor in innovation of speciality 
feed ingredients for livestock, equine and pet foods. We 
develop pioneering ingredients including feed additive products, 
high-quality bespoke vitamin and mineral pre-mixes, starter 
feeds and alternative proteins. 

Making animal feed – AB Agri is one of the UK’s largest 
compound feed businesses for pig and poultry customers and 
one of the UK’s largest marketers of co-products from the 
food and drink industries for dairy and beef farmers. We have 
international manufacturing capabilities extending into Europe 
and China and plan to increase global manufacturing further.

Delivering farm performance services for the agri-food 
industry – our data and technology platforms deliver targeted 
insights that help create continuous improvement for agricultural 
supply chains. We work with major food processors, retailers 
and directly with farmers, enabling them to: 

•  increase productivity and yields sustainably;
•  improve animal wellbeing and husbandry; and
•  develop quality assurance and operate in a more 

sustainable way.

Our products, insights and technological solutions enable our 
customers to produce high-yielding, safe and nutritious food 
using fewer chemicals whilst safeguarding natural resources 
and reducing environmental impact.

We also have a 50% ownership in Frontier, the UK’s largest 
arable farm inputs and grain marketing business. Its customers 
are some 25% of arable farmers in the UK and many UK food 
producers and processors. It supplies seed, crop protection 
products and fertiliser to farmers, as well as providing specialist 
agronomy and crop marketing advice. Frontier also works with 
farmers to increase the biodiversity of their farms and implement 
practices which help productivity and carbon reduction and 
sustainability. Its food customers look to Frontier for reliable 
supplies of quality agricultural products as well as procurement 
advice and logistics service.

OPERATING REVIEW – AGRICULTURE CONTINUED

AB Vista’s evolution from enzymes to a feed 
additive business
AB Vista is a leader in feed enzymes and one 
of the largest suppliers of yeast and natural 
betaine to the global animal nutrition industry. 
We recently broadened our portfolio through 
acquisitions and in-house product development 
into the highly profitable additives market.

We are focused on better protecting animal gut health in 
livestock agriculture through additive solutions to help animals 
better cope with environmental and biological challenges that 
could otherwise result in both ill health and reduced productivity.

We launched Signis, an AB Vista product that is proven to 
accelerate the fermentation of fibre in the gut. We also acquired 
the intellectual property for Progres, a patented natural feed 
material derived from coniferous trees. Developed in Finland, 
where resin has been used as a natural treatment for centuries 
due to its natural antiviral, antibacterial and anti-inflammatory 
properties, Progres is the only natural feed material on the 
market with a proven direct effect on intestinal integrity. 
Its active ingredients, resin acids, reduce the damage caused 
by inflammation, with proven application so far in poultry and 
livestock. Having acquired Progres, we can now leverage our 
global supply chain to bring this product to new markets while 
continuing to develop our portfolio to support our customers 
in the journey to produce feed and food more responsibly.

Expanding AB Dairy through acquisition
As the global population increases, the need 
to provide nutritious, affordable protein that can 
be produced sustainably has never been greater.

The dairy industry stands to benefit from this demand and milk, 
as one of the lowest-emitting and affordable animal proteins, 
is particularly well positioned. There is also ample scope to 
improve productivity through the integration of insights and 
technology to inform nutrition, genetics and feeding strategies. 

In the UK, data is routinely collected across a range of inputs, 
such as diet and genetics, and outputs such as milk production 
volumes and quality. However, this data is yet to be collated and 
interpreted in a way that gives farmers a deeper understanding 
of optimal dairy cow performance. Building on our 30 years’ 
experience supplying feed and providing nutritional expertise, 
we have acquired three businesses to help the industry 
respond to these challenges and enable more sustainable 
and profitable dairy farming.

Kite Consulting is a specialist dairy consultancy, providing 
practical and strategic advice on dairy farm performance across 
the food supply chain from farmers and food processors right 
through to retailers. Kite is known for its technical and business 
consultancy service, which supports dairy farmers in their 

efforts to improve the efficiency of their business and herd, and 
for its sustainability advisory service, which helps them reduce 
the carbon footprint of dairy production.

International Farm Comparison Network (IFCN) is a global dairy 
research network, providing globally comparable economic data 
and forecasts through partnerships with researchers, dairy 
companies and organisations in over 100 countries. Its dairy 
farm economics model is accepted as the global standard for 
comparing and understanding dairy systems, helping to secure 
profitability and sustainability in dairy farming by enabling users 
to understand the drivers that contribute to better performance. 

National Milk Records (NMR) provides a range of milk quality, 
herd health and genomic testing services to farmers and milk 
buyers, as well as providing an independent source of data for 
third parties such as vets, farm consultants and breed societies. 
Data is used to provide the phenotypic database for UK genetic 
evaluation, and the milk recording database is used to provide 
the basis of food provenance schemes run by major 
supermarket retailers. 

Together, these businesses provide unrivalled capability to 
combine milk, health, genomics and dairy industry insights, 
as well as the ability to help farmers consistently use these 
insights to make more precise and timely decisions.

British Sugar refinery technician 
monitoring sugar crystallisation 

British Sugar production levels were exceptionally low at 
0.74 million tonnes, 27% lower than the prior year’s campaign, 
the result of a sequence of unusually poor weather conditions which 
reduced the crop size and lowered beet yields and sugar content. 
The business secured alternative sources of supply in order to fulfil 
customer contracts but profitability was significantly reduced 
as a consequence in the second half of the year. In the course 
of the year energy costs remained at elevated levels, but were 
partially offset by strong pricing for electricity produced and other 
co-products. Profitability for the year at British Sugar was lower 
as a result of the combination of these factors. 

Azucarera, our Spanish sugar business, benefitted in the course of 
the year from the higher prices, partially offset by elevated costs for 
beet, raw sugars and energy. Beet sugar production was lower than 
the prior year due to hot and dry weather, and additional purchasing 
of raw sugars for refining was required in order to support sales. 
Overall production was down 20% at some 0.45 million tonnes. 

Our Illovo Sugar Africa business performed very well. The business 
continues to develop sales and higher margin routes to market 
for pre-packed branded sugar in Malawi, Tanzania and Zambia. 
Overall, Illovo sugar production was 1.53 million tonnes compared 
to 1.45 million tonnes in the previous financial year reflecting the 
recovery in production in Eswatini and good production in Malawi 
and South Africa partially offset by the impact of flooding in 
Mozambique. The combination of higher volumes and strong 
pricing resulted in both sales and profit being well ahead of last year. 
Construction of our new sugar mill in Tanzania continues and will 
increase our production capacity considerably in that country.

At the end of February, severe flooding in Mozambique affected 
our cane estate at Maragra and most of our partner-grower 
operations. The Maragra mill will not open for sugar production 
this season and as such we have taken a non-cash exceptional 
impairment charge of £35m in these accounts to write down 
the net asset value of this business. 

The trading performance of AB Sugar China was below last year 
as a result of lower demand caused by lockdowns earlier in the year. 
More recently the relaxation of restrictions has caused sugar prices 
to recover strongly. However, trading remains difficult and we have 
reviewed our outlook for this business, including the forecast for the 
evolution of beet crop area and yields. As a result, we have taken 
a one-off non-cash adjustment of £15m as an exceptional 
impairment charge this year. 

Vivergo incurred substantial losses in the first half due to high wheat 
and energy costs and low bioethanol prices. The second half of the 
year saw much reduced losses and a significant improvement in 
margin and operating performance, particularly in the fourth quarter. 

Sugar made good progress in its decarbonisation programme in 
the financial year. It completed 17 decarbonisation projects across 
various sugar processes, which contributed to a 4% reduction 
in greenhouse gas emissions compared with 2022. Among the 
projects completed are modifications in the UK to replace coal with 
natural gas in the dryers at our Bury St Edmunds processing plant, 
improvements to gas turbine performance at our Wissington plant, 
the elimination of heavy fuel oil at Cantley, and the installation 
of more efficient slicer machines at Bury St Edmunds. In addition, 
Sugar has also published its transition plan to a low carbon 
economy by 2030.

About Sugar

ABF Sugar is a group of agribusinesses which together employ 
30,000 people and operate 20 plants in nine countries, with the 
capacity to produce some 4.5 million tonnes of sugar annually. 
We farm more than 330,000 hectares worldwide by ourselves, and 
by over 25,000 growers.

to produce a range of products including sugar, animal feed, biofuels 
and a number of speciality products. We have the market leading 
consumer brand in over half our markets, including Silver Spoon in 
the UK, Azucarera in Spain, Bwana Sukari in Tanzania, White Spoon 
in Zambia and Illovo in multiple markets. We are also a large-scale 
power generator, with renewable sources providing 60% of our 
own energy use as well as significant renewable energy exports 
into national grids.

Although we have a global portfolio, we operate on a local basis, 
working together to do what is right in each location and market. 
As we continue to evolve to meet the changing needs of 
customers, growers and others, our role is to ensure we use 
resources responsibly, build strong rural economies and support 
local communities.

We also have a 42.5% ownership in Czarnikow Group Limited (CZ), 
a global supply chain management and advisory company 
specialising in the food and beverage sector.

Operating review

Sales were well ahead of last year with a strong performance 
by Illovo, our African sugar business, which delivered both higher 
sugar production and strong pricing actions. Illovo also made good 
progress in developing new and higher margin routes to market 
through pre-pack branded sugar facilities. In Europe, production was 
lower due to adverse weather conditions, but the resulting impact 
on profitability was partially offset by good co-product sales. 

Revenues were strongly ahead of the prior year driven by higher 
sugar pricing, a recovery in production and sales in Eswatini 
in Africa following strike action last year, and much higher sales 
from Vivergo, our bioethanol plant in Hull. European sugar prices 
moved higher this year, building on the price levels seen in the 
previous year and driven by lower European sugar production 
and higher world market prices. Prices in Africa also increased. 
Sales volumes increased modestly, with higher volumes at Illovo 
more than offsetting declines at British Sugar and Azucarera. 
Total production, at 2.8 million tonnes, is 8% down on last year 
reflecting lower volumes as a result of adverse weather affecting 
European crops, partly mitigated by strong co-product performance 
and partially offset by higher production in Africa driven by the 
recovery in Eswatini and good factory performances in Malawi and 
South Africa. By period, revenue in the first half increased 27% 
to £1.2bn against the same period a year ago; in the second half, 
revenue rose 31% to £1.4bn. 

Adjusted operating profit was modestly ahead of last year at £169m. 
Overall, the contribution from higher sales prices was partially offset 
by higher costs for beet, cane and energy. Specifically, profit was 
impacted by the need for British Sugar to buy and import sugar 
to make good a shortfall in beet sugar production. Overall profits 
were held back by the substantial trading losses incurred by Vivergo 
in the first half of the year. First half Sugar adjusted operating profit 
was 5% ahead of the same period last year at £86m while second 
half adjusted operating profit was 11% higher at £83m.

OPERATING REVIEW – SUGAR CONTINUED

Pulp processing improvement programme 
at British Sugar
At British Sugar, one of the most valuable 
co-products we produce is animal feed. We 
make and sell over 500,000 tonnes of feed a 
year from sugar beet pulp, the fibrous material 
left over from the sugar-making process.

To produce the feed, the wet pulp needs to be dried. The first 
step of this process involves mechanically squeezing the pulp 
to remove as much residual water as possible, before drying 
it at a high temperature in rotating drums which uses a lot 
of energy. We have therefore been working to find ways to 
increase the efficiency of this mechanical squeezing process. 
This has included an investment programme to transform our 
systems, increasing profitability and reducing energy costs 
across our UK sites.

In September 2022, we upgraded the sugar beet pulp press 
station at our Wissington factory to include a new, larger, 
self-draining press as well as making improvements across 
three other pulp presses. These improvements increased the 
quantity of water squeezed from the pulp, reducing the energy 
required to dry it.

In just over a year of operation the improvements at 
Wissington alone have delivered a number of substantial 
efficiencies, including:

Success in Azucarera’s grower base in 
northern Spain
We have transformed our relationship with 
sugar beet growers supplying Azucarera’s 
factories in northern Spain to deliver an 
impressive 70% increase in growing area 
for our 2022/23 campaign.

Over the last five years we have developed a commercially 
viable model that delivers a tailored, grower-centric proposition 
to build confidence in growing beet. The approach is about 
much more than price: it is focused on developing a collaborative 
model that encourages all parties to work together to minimise 
risk and overcome barriers to growing the crop successfully. 
Our team negotiates directly with growers to agree a tailor-
made model that works for them. This model encompasses 
all aspects of the growing process including buying the inputs 
needed to develop the beet crop, selecting the service providers, 
and defining the responsibilities and workload. This approach 
means all parties are aligned to deliver the best possible 
outcomes, resulting in a more equitable share of risk between 
us, the growers and service providers. 

Our collaborative model also gives growers access to 
Azucarera’s significant data capabilities, which provide valuable 
insights that can improve yields. Our ‘Visor’ platform gives 
growers access to real-time monitoring of crop health, of 
irrigation levels and of the evolving sugar content in the crop. 
Visor aggregates data across our grower sites, offering 
personalised advice and best practice to individual farms to 
improve beet yields. Equally, Visor gives Azucarera a significant 
competitive advantage as growers are incentivised to work with 
us in order to access this powerful monitoring tool that would 
otherwise be unavailable to them.

•  a 6% overall improvement in the dry content of the pulp;
•  a reduction in gas usage of 12% at site and 6% across 

the business; and

•  a CO2 emission reduction of more than 5,000 tonnes 

per annum.

This strategy is being replicated across all other sites to deliver 
considerable savings and significant carbon reductions.

and dried animal feed from the pulp processing station

The success is testament to our team’s commitment to 
collaboration. By promoting a grower-centric approach, 
underpinned by data and technology, we have significantly 
increased the growing area and fostered trust and confidence 
among our partners to grow beet more efficiently and 
more sustainably.

Visor platform to a Spanish sugar beet farmer on their farm

store at the Thabwa Trading Centre in Chikwawa district,

We also expanded our geographic footprint by appointing 
new distributors, opening new container shops in strategic 
locations and significantly scaling up our secondary distribution. 
This combination of improved delivery and an expanded 
footprint has transformed market penetration and ensures 
easier and more reliable access to Illovo products in rural areas.

These improvements contributed to a significant increase in our 
domestic sales, which have increased by 40% over the last 
three years.

Looking ahead, we are committed to refining our processes to 
promote closer and stronger relationships with our customers, 
improve the availability of sugar in the domestic market and 
grow volume and value for our stakeholders.

Optimising sugar distribution in Illovo Malawi
In Malawi, we have successfully redesigned 
Illovo Sugar’s routes to market to put 
customers’ needs at the heart, helping us 
to improve sugar margins and connections with 
distributors and stockists. This helped increase 
sugar sales to both consumers and industrial 
customers across the country.

We did this by developing and implementing a standardised 
process across the country, with one of the most important 
changes being the introduction of our improved delivery 
network. In delivering products to customers instead of them 
having to travel to collect stock, this eliminated price disparities 
arising from transportation costs being added to the selling 
price of our sugar.

About Retail
About Primark
Primark is a leading international retailer with 18.2 million sq ft 
of selling space across 432 stores in 16 countries with more 
than 76,000 colleagues. Founder Arthur Ryan opened our first 
store in 1969 in Mary Street and this remains our flagship Dublin 
city centre store and home of the global headquarters. Today 
Primark has stores in the UK, Ireland, Europe and the US with 
ambitious expansion plans: we expect to trade from 530 stores 
by the end of 2026, including from 60 in the US. We have 
expanded but remain true to our roots: offering unbeatable 
value alongside great quality products.

We target a wide customer base, offering quality essentials 
and affordable fashion across women’s, men’s and kidswear, 
as well as beauty, homeware, accessories and licensed ranges 
with some of the biggest names in entertainment, sport and 
food. Through our Primark Cares strategy, we have set open 
and measurable targets relating to product, planet and people 
and we are evolving how we operate. This is alongside 
our existing commitment to high ethical trading standards. 
Our intention is to use our scale for good, deploying it to have 
the most benefit across our end-to-end supply chain, so 
ultimately enabling customers to access more sustainable 
products affordably.

Primark is a retail store business and the store model centres 
on finding the right-sized stores in the right locations. We seek 
to continually improve our in-store experience, creating exciting 
retail destinations with additional services including beauty, food 
and beverage and our vintage concession WornWell. We focus 
on cost alongside price leadership; keeping our operating costs 
low and maximising efficiencies across our supply chain and 
operations to keep prices competitive and maintain margins. 

Digital is a core enabler of how we showcase our offering to 
customers and drive footfall into stores. We have now launched 
our enhanced customer website into all our markets, significantly 
improving our customers’ digital experience. The new site 
has increased traffic in all markets and we believe it is driving 
incremental growth in store sales. We have also launched 
a Click + Collect trial across selected stores in the UK to offer 
customers more choice and convenience to browse and order 
online before coming into store to collect their purchase.

Operating review

Primark revenues rose strongly in this financial year, 
up 15% and exceeding our expectations a year ago. 
This reflects a sales increase in all our markets driven by 
a number of factors, including carefully selected price increases 
taken to partially offset high and volatile input cost inflation, 
well-received product ranges and the resulting appeal of our 
offer to new and existing customers. Good footfall, strongly 
performing new stores and the rollout of our enhanced 
customer website also contributed to the strong sales 
performance. Sales increased in both halves of the year: 
in the first half, by 17% to £4.2bn against the same period 
in the prior year; and in the second half, by 14% to £4.8bn.

We believe that our product offer was a source of differentiation 
and competitive advantage throughout the year. Cold weather 
essentials and other seasonal product lines, including our 
well-received velvet plush leggings, drove strong sales leading 
into a record Christmas season which included a resurgence 
in women's partywear, tailoring separates and beauty products 

as a return to festive socialising gathered pace. In the new year 
sales of beachwear and luggage were exceptionally strong as 
customers looked early to holidays. Our summer trading was 
good, led by our boho-inspired design trend. Throughout the 
year we further broadened our ranges and collaborations to 
appeal to customers trying Primark for the first time alongside 
existing customers. We expanded our Edit collection, our more 
premium essentials range for women, across more stores 
which sold well. We also continued our successful UK and 
European collaborations with Stacey Solomon, Kem Cetinay, 
and Paula Echevarria, and launched our first truly international 
partnership with Rita Ora whose first collection sales have 
surpassed expectations. Sales of licensed products grew 
significantly year-on-year, in particular over Christmas across 
our growing portfolio of brand partners including Disney, Netflix, 
The Grinch, and US sports partners NFL and NBA. Our summer 
Barbie collection with Mattel also proved very successful.

Trading was influenced in the second half of the year by 
weather. We saw good sales through the early summer with 
the exception of Iberia which suffered unusually poor weather 
in May. In July, there was very poor weather in the UK and 
Ireland and heatwaves in Southern Europe, followed by warm 
conditions in August and September which coincided with 
the launch of our Autumn / Winter ranges. Despite these 
unseasonal conditions, we generally traded well with our 
core product ranges remaining in robust demand and partially 
offsetting inevitable volatility in sales more dependent on 
fashion and season.

Like-for-like sales growth was 8.5% for the year. In the first half, 
like-for-like sales rose by 10% driven by higher average selling 
prices and higher unit volumes partially offset by smaller basket 
sizes. Footfall increased in both the UK and Europe, against 
a comparative period which featured some disruption from the 
pandemic. In the second half of the year like-for-like growth was 
lower than in the first half at 7%. This growth was driven 
by a slightly greater benefit from selective pricing taken to 
part-mitigate inflation, the benefits of which were partially offset 
in turn by lower unit volumes, smaller basket sizes and slightly 
lower footfall. Space growth contributed sales growth of 6%, 
driven by the increase in selling space across a number of our 
markets, in particular Italy, France and the US, and higher sales 
densities in most new stores.

Adjusted operating profit margin for the full year was 8.2%, 
down on the previous financial year’s 9.8%. Adjusted operating 
profit margin in the first half was 8.3%, down on the same 
period a year ago due to our decision not to fully recover 
all the inflation in input costs. In the first half the higher costs 
of bought-in goods, higher freight rates, higher labour costs and 
higher energy costs outweighed the benefits of our selective 
price increases and an improvement in store sales densities due 
to higher footfall. In the second half, compared with the same 
period a year ago, the cost of bought-in goods was higher again 
including a more significant impact of the strength of the US 
dollar against sterling and the euro when we placed orders for 
our Spring / Summer ranges several months earlier. This higher 
cost of goods was offset somewhat by the benefit of like-for-
like sales growth and sales from new store openings and by 
the benefit of additional pricing being implemented in the spring 
and summer ranges. Freight costs fell in the fourth quarter, 
but labour costs were higher than the same period a year ago. 
Second half operating profit margin was 8.0%, slightly below 
the first half of the year, and also held back by higher than 
expected stock loss and a modest amount of German 
restructuring costs, albeit helped by lower markdowns.

OPERATING REVIEW – RETAIL CONTINUED

In the UK, sales increased by 11% against the previous financial 
year, driven by like-for-like growth of 10% helped in particular by 
our new customer website that has now been running for more 
than a year. This sales performance was achieved despite 
unhelpful weather impacts in the third and fourth quarters which 
resulted in slightly lower footfall in contrast to the first half of 
the year when footfall was significantly higher. Primark’s market 
share1 grew in the financial year, increasing from 6.4% last year 
to 6.7% this year. 

In Europe excluding the UK, sales increased by 18% 
on the previous financial year, with like-for-like growth of 8% 
despite weaker trading at times due to unseasonable weather. 
Our store estates in all the countries in which we operate 
delivered like-for-like sales growth, with good performances 
in Iberia, France, Germany, Belgium, the Netherlands and 
Eastern Europe. Italy delivered strong total sales growth 
and continues to operate on high sales densities. We opened 
17 stores in the European region in the period to strong 
customer demand and good resulting footfall. Sales densities 
in most of these new stores continue to be higher than average. 
Primark’s share of the total clothing, footwear and accessories 
market by value increased in both Spain and France. In Germany 
we closed two stores in the period and, after period end, 
we closed one more store and agreed two further closures. 
In addition we have started our rightsizing programme with 
two stores in the period and the signs are encouraging. 
Two further stores were resized in September after the period 
end. We continue to consider further resizing. We are also 
developing plans to open new stores smaller than average 
in new locations with merchandise selected to appeal 
to local customer demand. 

In the US, total net sales were 24% higher than last year driven 
by space expansion. We opened eight new stores in the period, 
largely in the Northeast, taking the estate to 21 stores trading 
from 0.9 million sq ft and are on track to meet our US store 
expansion target of around 60 stores by the end of 2026. 
We are pleased with trading in our new stores which are 
benefitting from our growing knowledge of the US consumer 
and the wider retail market. We have refined the design, size 
and layout of our stores and continue to tailor our ranges to suit 
the US consumer. We continued to expand our footprint beyond 
the Northeast with further progress in the new store pipeline 
and two leases signed recently in Texas. Investment in 
infrastructure to support this expansion continues with work 
ongoing at our new Jacksonville logistics centre where we 
expect to be operational in the spring.

Further progress has been made implementing our wide-ranging 
sustainability strategy unveiled two years ago, itself an evolution 
of an earlier and long-standing ethical trade and sustainability 
programme. During the year we further embedded the 
processes and capabilities needed to drive and accelerate 
change both internally and across our value chain. Some 55% 
of all the clothing units we sold in the financial year contained 
recycled or more sustainably sourced materials, up from 
45% last year and up from 25% at launch two years ago. 
This represents good progress in the delivery of our 

commitment that all our clothes will be made from recycled 
or sustainably sourced materials by 2030. Within this, 46% 
of our cotton clothing now contains cotton that is organic, 
recycled or sourced from our Primark Sustainable Cotton 
Programme (PSCP), up from 40% last year. Our commitment 
to reduce our carbon emissions across our value chain by 50% 
by 2030 was validated by the Science Based Targets initiative 
(SBTi). While carbon emissions increased this year by 11% 
compared to our baseline 2018/19 financial year, this is as 
expected: Scope 1 and 2 emissions reduced but there was 
an increase in our Scope 3 emissions due to an increase in the 
volume of materials used to produce the higher number of 
products sold in the period year-on-year. In the short term, 
this trend is likely to continue, but emissions will decline 
in time as we increase the use of more sustainably sourced 
materials across our product ranges. In our own store estate, 
some 70% of our stores are now powered by renewable 
or low-carbon electricity and 141 stores have switched 
to energy-efficient lighting. 

Primark continues to build and invest in transforming its digital 
capability. This year we successfully rolled out our new and 
improved website to all 16 markets. Since launching the new 
website, we have seen a positive customer reaction and strong 
traffic uplift in all trading markets, led by the UK and the 
Republic of Ireland which were the first two countries to move 
on to the new platform. Usage of the stock checker facility 
ranged broadly between 15%-20% of website sessions across 
our markets. We are also putting more focus on increasing 
traffic growth to www.primark.com through organic search, 
CRM and selected performance marketing trials and, overall, 
working in closer alignment with our already strong social media 
engagement. We believe our digital platform is already 
beginning to support good uplifts in footfall and that it is 
contributing to store like-for-like sales across our markets.

In April we announced the expansion of our Click + Collect trial 
to an additional 32 stores in London, taking the total number 
offering this service to 57 stores, one third of our UK estate. 
On 13 September 2023 we extended the service to include 
womenswear, alongside the existing offer on kidswear. 
Although this remains a trial, we are encouraged by the early 
results. In addition, we implemented self-checkouts in 22 stores 
in the period. This service has seen high utilisation and 
customer engagement and the roll-out continues. 

Retail selling space overall increased by just under 1 million sq ft 
since the last financial year end and on 16 September 2023 
we were trading from 432 stores and 18.2 million sq ft of selling 
space. We added 27 stores in the period: eight in the US; 
six in Central and Eastern Europe with three in Poland, two in 
Romania and our first store in Slovakia marking our 15th and 16th 
market; four in Italy and France respectively; three in Spain; and 
two in the UK. As referred to above, two stores in Germany 
were closed during the year. We fully reopened our Bank 
Buildings store in the heart of Belfast, which was damaged by 
fire in 2018, and closed our temporary store in Donegal Place. 
We also re-started our store refurbishment programme. 

We remain on track to grow to 530 stores by the end of 2026 
and have visibility for continued footprint expansion beyond.

Broadening our reach and attracting new 
customers through expanded ranges, still with 
value at their heart
Primark was founded with the aim of making 
great quality fashion affordable for everyone.

The Edit – our collection of quality investment pieces for 
women featuring more premium fabrics, blends and detailing 
– continues to go from strength to strength following its 
successful launch in Autumn/Winter 21. This range caters 
for customers seeking more premium products at the value 
Primark is famous for and has been extended to include 
products such as jewellery and elevated knitwear with 
cashmere and merino wool content. Due to its success, 
the collection has gone from being offered in selected stores 
and is now in more than 60% of our stores internationally.

The Edit’s ultimate heavyweight t-shirt is a bestseller. It comes 
in six colours and sells for £12/$16/€14, representing incredible 
value versus other comparable heavyweight t-shirts on the high 
street. And this t-shirt is, of course, only part of our offering. 
We have a comprehensive selection of t-shirts across our 
ranges, which start with our essential t-shirt at £3/$4.50/€3.50 
through to our more premium styles.

Alongside The Edit, we have also broadened our offer 
through collaborations. In September 2023 we launched our 
collaboration with global superstar and style icon Rita Ora. 
The first in a series of collections with Rita, it was made 
available in all our stores across all our markets. This more 
trend-led collection appeals to the style conscious and 
fashion-led consumer, and while it retails at slightly higher 
prices, it offers excellent value-for-money by giving customers 
the opportunity to shop Rita’s famous style for less.

OPERATING REVIEW – RETAIL CONTINUED

Our ‘Supporting Women for Life’ collection, 
making specialist collections more accessible 
and affordable
At Primark, we want all our customers to 
feel seen, included and understood but after 
listening to them, we realised many of the 
products women rely on during key moments 
of their lives were, for many, out of budget.

For example, post-surgery bras for breast cancer patients 
were often expensive and not widely available on the high 
street. Period underwear, which has become more popular 
in recent years, was in many cases prohibitively expensive. 
We challenged ourselves to think about the different products 
we could create for women offering the same functionality 
but at Primark prices. As a result, we created our Supporting 
Women for Life collection, offering a range of more specialist 
clothing, lingerie and nightwear at affordable prices. 

We started with our maternity range in January 2021, when 
maternity wear was not widely available on the high street and 
often sold online only. We followed with period underwear, 
designed as an alternative to single-use sanitary products. 
Since then, we have launched a dedicated breast cancer range 
comprising leisurewear, underwear, nightwear and accessories 
for women. We extended our underwear sizing across all our 
ranges to include fuller bust and bigger brief sizes, and to 
include a greater variety of skin tones. We also introduced 
innovative new fabrics – for example, our menopause collection 
contains anti-flush technology and cooling yarns across 
nightwear, underwear and base layers, which to date have 
only been available at a premium price elsewhere.

Using self-checkouts to enhance customers’ 
in-store experience 
At Primark, we think about every stage of 
a customer’s journey with us and we know 
how important it is that they have a good 
experience, including when they pay in-store.

With more customers using card and contactless payments and 
self-checkouts becoming commonplace, we took the decision 
to launch a trial to understand the benefits these technologies 
might bring to our customers, colleagues and business.

Today, our Supporting Women for Life collection is made up 
of six ranges, representing almost £100m in sales and growing. 
We are continuing to work with our customers, colleagues and 
specialist organisations to better understand consumers’ needs 
and experiences and will continue to bring to market more 
inclusive and specialist products at accessible prices for women 
at their different stages of life.

Some of the products in our ‘Supporting Women for Life’ range

We started with self-checkouts in two UK stores, Sheffield and 
Northampton, which had higher-than-average numbers of card 
transactions. The initial response from both customers and 
colleagues was very positive, with high adoption rates from 
customers who were given the option to use either the 
self-checkouts or the staffed checkouts as before. 

We then extended the trial to three additional UK stores of 
different sizes, formats and locations. With an average overall 
satisfaction rating of 88%, speed, convenience and reduced 
queue times were cited as the biggest draws for the service. 

The benefits to the business are already apparent and have the 
potential to be very significant. These innovations free up 
colleagues to focus on where they are most needed – for 
example re-stocking the shop floor, helping customers or 
manning fitting rooms – relieving recruitment pressures faced 
by the business in a tight labour market.

Due to the initial success of the trial, we have added self-
checkouts to 22 stores across the UK, the US, Ireland and Poland, 
both incorporating them into existing stores and fitting them 
in new ones. Today, around two thirds of our customers choose 
to use our self-checkouts when they have the option to do so, 
with many customers saying they prefer this check-out method.

We are excited by the benefits that self-checkouts can bring to 
the business and are rolling them out more widely to new and 
existing stores.

An overview of our growth and success in Spain
As part of our expansion strategy, we continue 
to explore not just new markets and regions 
but also the potential of our more established 
markets. Our presence in Spain, which was 
our first market outside the UK and Ireland, 
is a great example of this organic growth. 

Since opening our first store in Madrid in 2006, Spain has grown 
to become our second biggest market in terms of both store 
numbers and sales. We have 59 stores in Spain and employ 
more than 9,500 colleagues with 2.4 million sq ft of selling space.

The Primark offer has resonated with Spanish shoppers who 
love us for our style credentials and everyday affordable 
essentials for the whole family. In particular, our kids collections 
and licensed collections have been received really well, as 
customers love the quality and choice we offer at such 
affordable prices. Our collaboration with Spanish influencer 
Paula Echevarría has proven notably successful and helped to 
attract new customers in this market. We have also tailored our 
in-store experiences to local tastes and culture, partnering with 
other domestic brands such as Llaollao frozen yoghurt, Granier 
cafés and Hello Nails beauty.

We have enjoyed strong growth in Spain and that track record 
gives us confidence as we continue to invest and grow our 
presence there. We will invest €100m in our Spanish business 
between April 2023 and the end of 2024 in both new store 
openings and upgrading existing stores. 

In this financial year, we have opened three stores to a strong 
customer response: the first in April, in the city of Toledo; the 
second in June on the Canary Island of Lanzarote; and last but 
not least in September a store in the autonomous city of Melilla 
on the North African coastline.

Looking ahead to next year, we have plans for more new stores. 
Madrid remains as important to us today as it was 17 years ago 
when we first came to Spain. It is the city with the second 
highest number of Primark stores, after London. Today, there 
are eight stores across the city and we plan to open as many as 
four more in the next financial year, including our second 
flagship store in Madrid, in the iconic Cine Salamanca building. 

We continue to invest in and improve our existing stores too. 
With a strong pipeline of store extensions and upgrades, our 
Spanish customers can continue to expect to see the very 
best of Primark.

Financial review

Group performance
Group revenue was £19.8bn, 15% ahead of last year at 
constant currency, with sales growth in each of our businesses, 
benefitting from the build of price increases taken to offset 
inflation. However, as expected, adjusted operating profit margin 
declined, from 8.4% last year to 7.7% this year as a result of the 
overall inflation. The Group generated an adjusted operating 
profit of £1,513m, an increase of 5% at actual rates ahead of 
last year, a strong result given the scale of input cost increases. 

Statutory operating profit for the Group of £1,383m was 17% 
ahead, after charging exceptional items of £109m  
(2022 – £206m).

For the full year the average rates used to translate the income 
statement resulted in a translation gain of £17m, primarily driven 
by the strengthening of the US dollar, particularly in the first half 
compared to the first half of 2022. The weakness of sterling 
against some of our trading currencies also drove a benefit 
on translation of our non-sterling earnings.

The segmental analysis by division is set out in the operating reviews. The segmental analysis by geography is set out in note 1

Net finance income and other financial income
Finance income increased as a result of higher interest rates 
earned on our cash deposits. Other financial income increased 
this year as a consequence of the higher surplus in the Group’s 
UK defined benefit pension scheme at the beginning of the 
financial year. Lease interest increased during the year because 
of more leases being entered into from our continued store 
expansion programme, particularly in the US, Italy and France.

As a result, on an adjusted basis, profit before tax was 
up 8.6%, to £1,473m.

Taxation
This year’s tax charge on the adjusted operating profit before 
tax was £346m, with an increase in adjusted effective tax rate 
to 23.5% from 22.2% last year. This rate includes the impact 
on the blended tax rate for the full year of the increase in UK 
corporation tax rate from 19% to 25% in April 2023.

The Group is exposed to a range of uncertain tax positions. 
The provision at the financial year end for these tax positions 
was £55m (2022 – £102m). The reduction in the provision is due 
to the conclusion of UK tax audits covering several businesses 
and years. This reduction in the provision between last 
financial and this financial year was due to partial utilisation 
and also translated into a one-off benefit to the effective 
tax rate for the year.

We expect the Group’s effective tax rate in 2024 to be broadly 
in line with 2023. This includes the full year impact of the 
increase in the UK corporation tax rate in April 2023 and changes 
to the mix of profits by jurisdiction.

FINANCIAL REVIEW CONTINUED

Adjusted earnings per share increased by 8.2% to a record 
141.8p per share. This increase follows from the higher adjusted 
profit and the higher financial income, more than offsetting the 
slightly higher adjusted effective tax rate. The adjusted earnings 
per share also benefit from the reduction in weighted average 
number of shares, from 789 million for 2022 to 778 million for 
2023, as a result of the buyback programme.

In Retail, the German Primark portfolio recognised exceptional 
impairment charges relating to stores that were impaired in the 
previous year: £13m as a result of additional right-of-use assets 
being recognised due to rent indexation adjustments on 
right-of-use assets that were impaired, a further £5m non-cash 
exceptional charge for the right-sizing of four stores and the fair 
value write-down of a store.

The income statement this year included a non-cash exceptional 
impairment charge of £109m. In Grocery, the Don business has 
been impacted by inflationary pressures, a surplus supply of 
fresh pork in the market, labour constraints, equipment reliability 
causing production shortfalls and additional transportation costs 
following the unforeseen liquidation of its distribution partner. 
As a result we recognised impairment write-downs of £39m 
against property, plant and equipment, £1m against right-of-use 
assets and £1m against intangible assets. 

In Sugar, the China Sugar North business recognised a £15m 
impairment write-down against property, plant and equipment. 
This business was held for sale in the previous year but that 
process was halted in the second half of the year. Due to 
severe flooding in Mozambique, the related damage to the 
sugar crop fields and the inability to plant for the foreseeable 
future Illovo Mozambique recognised £25m impairment 
write-downs against property, plant and equipment, £7m 
against current biological assets, £2m of personnel costs 
and £1m write-down against inventory.

The prior year exceptional impairment charge of £206m 
comprised non-cash write-downs of assets in Primark Germany, 
£72m against property plant and equipment and £134m against 
right-of-use assets. 

Total tax charge for the year was £272m. This includes 
the positive benefit of deferred tax on exceptional items from 
the prior year, when a £63m exceptional charge was included 
in the Group's total tax charge reflecting the de-recognition 
of the deferred tax assets relating to Primark Germany. 
A significant proportion of that asset had been deemed 
to be irrecoverable and was written off as an exceptional 
tax charge last year. As a result of further work undertaken this 
year it has been determined that more of this deferred tax asset 
is recoverable and so, an exceptional non-cash tax credit of 
£58m was recognised in the first half.

There was free cash inflow in the year totalling £269m 
as a result of the operating profit generated by the Group, 
despite cash outflows driven by higher capital expenditure 
than the prior year and a working capital outflow.

The capital expenditure increase was driven by the number 
of large capital projects and a step up following low levels 
of the last few years. The increase of the investment in our 
food businesses primarily relates to projects to build capacity. 
In Primark the increase reflects the acceleration of our new 
store programme and expenditure to expand our capabilities 
in warehouse automation and technology. We expect this 
higher level of investment to continue over the medium term.

The main factors driving the increase in working capital were 
twofold: the impact of inflation across all our food businesses 
and higher inventories, particularly in our Sugar and Primark 
businesses. As a reminder Primark inventories a year ago were 
too low and reflected the logistics and supply chain difficulties 
experienced in the prior year. We do expect a working capital 
inflow in 2024 as Primark inventory levels normalise. 

Cash tax increased in the year driven by the increase in profit 
before tax. We expect a reduced level of cash tax in 2024 due 
to the reallocation of historic overpayments and favourable 
settlements of historical enquiries and returns. 

There was cash outflow of £448m for our share buyback 
programme, with the remainder of the £500m programme 
completed after the year end. We also paid £345m for total 
dividends in this financial year, which reflects the final 2022 
dividend and interim 2023 dividend. The £380m paid in the prior 
year included a special dividend that was declared in respect of 
the 2021 financial year.

Acquisitions and disposals
The spend on acquisitions this financial year was £94m. 
The most significant of these were the acquisitions 
of National Milk Records, Kite Consulting and Advance 
Sourcing in Agriculture.

For disposals, a non-cash provision of £6m was included 
in profit less losses on sale and closure of business in respect 
of Illovo's investment in Gledhow.

At 16 September 2023, the Group held cash balances of 
£1,388m. In addition, the Group has an undrawn Revolving 
Credit Facility (RCF) for £1.5bn. This facility is free from 
performance covenants and was extended in June 2023 for 
a further year, bringing the maturity to 2028. Our £400m bond, 
launched last year, at 2.5% is due in 2034, and our final $100m 
Private Placement notes are due in March 2024.

Total liquidity at year end was £2.7bn, comprising the £1.5bn 
of cash, less £0.2bn of short-term loans and overdrafts 
and £0.1bn of inaccessible cash, plus the £1.5bn RCF. 
This compares to £3.4bn at the end of 2022.

Pensions
The Group’s defined benefit pension schemes aggregate 
surplus increased by 5% to £1,377m at year end compared 
to last year’s £1,314m. The UK scheme, which accounts for 
around 90% of the Group’s gross pension assets was in surplus 
by £1,397m (2022 – £1,366m). A significant increase in the 
pension surplus in the prior year was driven by an increase in 
bond yields reducing liabilities. Details of the assumptions made 
in the current and previous year are disclosed in note 12 of the 
financial statements together with the bases on which those 
assumptions have been made. 

The charge for the year for the Group’s defined contribution 
schemes, which was equal to the contributions made, 
amounted to £95m (2022 – £87m). This compared with 
the cash contribution to the defined benefit schemes 
of £36m (2022 – £36m).

The most recent triennial actuarial valuation of the UK scheme 
was carried out as of 5 April 2023. This last valuation showed 
a funding surplus of £1,013m. This is a clear improvement on 
the previous valuation undertaken at 5 April 2020, which 
showed a deficit of £302m. As agreed with the trustees in 
September, as a result of this significant increase in the surplus, 
the Group will receive a cash flow benefit of approximately 
£70m per year from the abatement of UK employer pension 
contributions on both the defined benefit and defined 
contribution schemes. This will take effect from the start 
of the new financial year.

Dividend and shareholder returns
We announced a share buyback programme of £500m in 
November 2022. In the financial year we purchased 23.7 million 
shares for £446m and the shares bought back were cancelled. 
At the end of the financial year we had 765 million ordinary 
shares in issue. The weighted average number of shares for 
the year was 778 million which compared to 789 million for the 
last financial year. This share buyback has resulted in a positive 
impact on our reported adjusted earnings per share of 1.8p. 
Since the financial year end, a further 2.8 million shares were 
purchased, completing the total £500m buyback programme. 
The Group has announced the continuation of a buyback 
programme, targeting an additional amount of £500m 
over the next 12 months.

This year the Board declared an interim dividend of 14.2p 
per share (2022 – 13.8p), an increase of 3% compared to 
prior year. The Board is proposing a final dividend of 33.1p 
per share. It is also declaring a special dividend of 12.7p per 
share to be paid as a second interim dividend. Taken with the 
first interim dividend of 14.2p per share, the aggregate total 
dividend for the year is 60.0p per share, 37% higher than the 
total dividend of 43.7p in 2022, which comprised an interim 
dividend of 13.8p, and a final dividend of 29.9p.

SECTION 172 STATEMENT | OUR STAKEHOLDERS

Engaging with our stakeholders

This approach necessarily involves a high degree of delegation 
of communication with stakeholders to the management of the 
Group businesses. Where the directors of the Company have 
not themselves directly engaged with stakeholders, those 
stakeholder issues are considered at Board level both through 
reports to the Board by the Chief Executive and/or Finance 
Director and also by the senior management of the Group’s 
businesses. Senior management are requested, when 
presenting to the Board on strategy and principal decisions, 
to ensure that the presentations cover what impact the strategy/
principal decision has on the relevant stakeholders and how 
the views of those stakeholders have been taken into account.

In the following pages, we set out the key stakeholder groups 
with whom engagement is fundamental to the Group’s 
ongoing success.

Stakeholder engagement
We engage regularly with stakeholders at Group and/or 
business level, depending on the particular issue.

As illustrated in our Group business model and strategy section 
on pages 9 to 11, the role of the Group, and therefore of the 
Board, is to provide a framework in which the Group businesses 
have the freedom and decision-making authority to pursue 
opportunities with entrepreneurial flair and to manage risks at 
the level at which the businesses operate. We consider this to 
be an important factor in the success of the Group.

Authority for the operational management of the Group’s 
businesses is delegated to the Chief Executive for execution 
or for further delegation by the Chief Executive to the senior 
management teams of the businesses. This is to ensure the 
effective day-to-day running and management of the Group. 
The chief executive of each business within the Group has 
authority for that business and reports directly to the 
Chief Executive.

While day-to-day operational decisions are generally made 
locally, the Board not only provides input on the principal 
decisions and strategy, but also supports individual businesses 
by facilitating the sharing of best practice and know-how 
between the businesses.

the Group is heard at Board level, Richard Reid, as designated 
Non-Executive Director for engagement with the workforce, 
meets with employees from a selection of businesses. 
Each business division also specifically reports to the Board 
on workforce engagement within that division. The Board also 
receives two specific updates each year from Richard Reid 
and the Chief People and Performance Officer in respect 
of progress on workforce engagement and resulting actions.

•  The Group Safety and Environment Manager provides the 
Board with updates on safety trends and progress against 
key performance indicators, supplemented by updates from 
the divisions.

SECTION 172 STATEMENT | OUR STAKEHOLDERS CONTINUED

Principal decisions

In making decisions throughout the course 
of the financial year, there is a need to 
ensure that the consequences promote the 
long-term success of the Company, as well as 
maintain our reputation for high standards 
of business conduct.

Investment in Primark’s existing store estate 
alongside its ongoing international expansion.
Which stakeholders most affected?
•  Customers/Consumers
•  Employees
•  Suppliers
•  Communities and the environment

Provided in this section are some examples of principal 
decisions that were taken (or implemented) during the year and 
how stakeholder views were taken into account and impacted 
on those decisions.

Launch of a £500m share buyback programme.
Which stakeholders most affected?
•  Shareholders/Institutional investors

Consideration of stakeholder views/interests 
and impact on decision-making
The Board took into account views of various investors 
(including views expressed in meetings with the Chairman, the 
Chief Executive and/or Finance Director) in reaching the decision 
in November 2022 to launch a share buyback programme of up 
to £500m. This included, for example, investor views that the 
Company’s shares were undervalued, that a share buyback 
would be an appropriate way to return capital to shareholders 
and that return on investment from a potential buyback should 
be considered in the same way as an M&A opportunity. 
Following detailed consideration by the Board and engagement 
with brokers and external advisers, the first tranche of the 
programme was launched in November 2022 with Barclays 
Capital Securities Limited (‘Barclays’) being irrevocably 
instructed to buy back up to £250m of the Company’s ordinary 
shares. Feedback received from institutional investors following 
the launch of the first tranche of the buyback indicated that 
they welcomed the buyback programme and that, in particular, 
they were pleased with the quantum.

Following completion of the first tranche of the programme 
by Barclays, in May 2023 we commenced the second £250m 
tranche of the share buyback, having irrevocably appointed 
Credit Suisse International to carry out that tranche. In deciding 
to launch the second tranche, the Board considered whether 
the share buyback continued to be value accretive, taking into 
account external advice.

The share buyback programme announced in November 2022 
has now completed and, in total, the Company purchased 
26,478,215 of its ordinary shares for a total consideration 
of £499,999,929. The purpose of the share buyback was 
to reduce the capital of the Company and all shares repurchased 
as part of the programme were cancelled.

Whilst some shareholders, particularly retail shareholders, 
expressed a preference for return of capital by way of an 
additional (or larger) dividend rather than by way of a share 
buyback, the Company considered on this occasion that a 
buyback was the more appropriate way to return capital, 
taking into account the long-term consequences of the 
different options.

Consideration of stakeholder views/interests 
and impact on decision-making
In line with Primark’s commitment to create a great in-store 
experience for consumers, the Board has approved the 
investment of substantial sums in extensions and upgrades to 
existing stores. This is in addition to investment in growing the 
Primark store estate to 530 by the end of the 2026 financial year 
as well as in automation of distribution depots.

The upgrades to stores have included the continued roll-out of 
LED lighting across the UK store portfolio, which will also help 
Primark progress its ambition to reduce its carbon footprint, and 
self-service checkouts, which, as well as reducing labour costs, 
should also reduce queues for customers (in response to 
customer feedback). We are also upgrading CCTV monitoring 
in a bid to reduce theft and anti-social behaviour in stores, both 
of which impact our employees. 

During the course of the financial year, Primark has opened 
stores in two new markets, namely Slovakia and Romania, 
bringing the total number of countries in which Primark operates 
to 16 at year end. The decision to expand Primark’s footprint 
in the southern states of the US was also taken. New store 
openings continue to be met with an enthusiastic reception 
from customers, as well as providing employment opportunities 
in the local areas and increasing career options for employees.

Relationships with key landlords continue to be important, as is 
the use of technology and demographic data to inform decisions 
about new store locations.

Approval of various projects in our food 
and ingredients businesses.
Which stakeholders most affected?
•  Customers/Consumers
•  Employees
•  Shareholders/Institutional investors

Consideration of stakeholder views/interests 
and impact on decision-making
Throughout the financial year, the Board approved significant 
capital expenditure (or increases to existing approved capital 
expenditure) by our food and ingredients businesses. 
This included a new yeast plant for AB Mauri in northern India, 
a new spray dryer and upgraded yeast production facility for 
Ohly in Germany, a new sugar factory in Tanzania, a major 
new water irrigation system in Malawi, an upgrade to a Tip 
Top bakery and a new animal feed plant in Western Australia 
(see picture on page 45), a steam reduction project for British 
Sugar (as part of its pledge to reduce its carbon footprint) and 
a new factory purchase with plans for localised production 
for Ovaltine in Nigeria.

The decisions to approve such projects and initiatives took into 
account customer demand for our products and the additional 
quantity of products and/or improved quality that such investment 
should bring about. The decisions also factored in our investors’ 
interest in us making the best use of the Company’s capital.

We continue to monitor the Group’s small number of 
food-related sales and co-packing operations in Myanmar 
(which primarily relate to the supply of food and grocery 
products to the local population). 

Acquisition of National Milk Records.
Which stakeholders most affected?
•  Shareholders/Institutional investors
•  Customers/Consumers
•  Employees

Consideration of stakeholder views/interests 
and impact on decision-making
In June 2023, following detailed consideration of both the 
short-term and longer-term benefits of the transaction for AB 
Agri customers and our investors, we announced the acquisition 
by AB Agri Limited (an indirect wholly-owned subsidiary of the 
Company) of the entire issued and to-be-issued ordinary share 
capital of National Milk Records plc (NMR) for approximately 
£48m. The NMR business was considered by the Board to be 
well-aligned with AB Agri’s objective of supporting customers 
across the dairy industry, helping to drive efficiency and 
increase productivity.

NMR provides complementary services and technology 
offerings to AB Agri’s existing operations across the dairy supply 
chain. It was considered that the combination will enable a 
better service to the dairy industry and will ultimately offer 
products that deliver increased value, efficiency and ultimately 
profitability for farmers. It was also considered that the 
acquisition will allow NMR to accelerate and de-risk the delivery 
of its strategy, as well as creating greater opportunities for 
NMR’s customers, employees and wider stakeholders.

The work done leading to the decision to acquire NMR took 
into account our customers’ desire for increased value and 
efficiency, as well as the opportunities that this is likely 
to create for our employees as we strengthen our position 
in the dairy sector.

Implementation of a responsible exit from 
Myanmar as a source of garments for Primark.
Which stakeholders most affected?
•  Suppliers
•  Communities and the environment

Consideration of stakeholder views/interests 
and impact on decision-making
Primark places a high priority on the safety and wellbeing of the 
people who make its clothes and products and of the Ethical 
Trade team that carries out visits to the factories.

Following the military coup in Myanmar in February 2021 and 
subsequent calls from global trade unions to disinvest from the 
country, the situation became both concerning and complex, 
given that many people in Myanmar are employed in suppliers’ 
factories making garments for major retailers such as Primark.

In September 2022, following its human rights impact 
assessment, the Ethical Trading Initiative published a report 
setting out the significant challenges faced by businesses 
sourcing garments from Myanmar in relation to their ability 
to conduct the level of due diligence required to meet 
recognised standards governing human rights and labour rights. 
The conclusions of this report were combined with information 
from the Primark Ethical Trade team and the resulting document 
was then reviewed by the Primark Myanmar Steering 
Committee. As referred to in our 2022 Annual Report, 
Primark decided to work towards a responsible exit from 
Myanmar. Accordingly, Primark stopped placing orders in 
October 2022 and expects its final orders from Myanmar 
to ship before the end of the 2023 calendar year. 

Following the announcement that it would stop sourcing 
from Myanmar, Primark doubled the size of the Ethical Trade 
team on the ground to enable more frequent visits to supplier 
factories to give the business improved visibility of working and 
employment conditions. While the exit plan from Myanmar is 
being implemented, the Primark Ethical Trade team will continue 
to work with supplier factory management and relevant 
stakeholders to address any issues as and when they arise.

The decision to exit was not taken lightly. Primark has managed 
its exit in consultation with partners and stakeholders both 
in Myanmar and globally, following the UN Guiding Principles 
on Business and Human Rights and ACT’s responsible exit 
guidelines. It is also working with IndustriALL Global Union 
and alongside other retail brands to create a framework for 
responsible business disengagement.

Materiality and stakeholders
This year, to better support our stakeholders’ understanding of 
our business model and our approach to ESG, this Responsibility 
section of the Annual Report focuses on the areas that have 
been identified as material for the Group.

The materiality assessment helps us understand how ESG 
factors might impact our businesses. This assessment helps 
us prioritise our activities. We consider the guidance of globally 
recognised sustainability standards and frameworks when 
compiling potential material topics and issues. Our stakeholders 
are a key part of the materiality assessment and we give them 
the chance to provide input on our ESG agenda and put their 
views to inform our decision-making.

The list of ABF material topics has been grouped into 
six areas:

•  Agriculture and farming practices;
•  People in our supply chains and surrounding 

communities;

•  Our people;
•  Carbon and climate;
•  Efficient resource use; and
•  Food and nutrition.

Looking ahead, we are working to further develop our 
materiality approach in line with the reporting requirements 
under the EU’s Corporate Sustainability Reporting 
Directive (CSRD).

For more information please see our Responsibility Report 2023.

We live and breathe our values through the work we do every 
day. They guide our behaviour and help us deliver long-term 
benefits for our people, suppliers, communities, customers 
and the environment.

These do not replace each business’s own values, but rather 
consolidate and summarise the most common themes found 
across the Group.

Non-financial and sustainability reporting 
requirements

We proudly promote and protect 
a culture of trust, fairness and 
accountability that puts ethics first. 
From farms and factories right 
through to our boardroom, we are 
committed to embedding integrity 
into every action.

We work with others to leverage 
our global expertise for local good. 
Through collaboration with our 
stakeholders, we are working 
to create safer, fairer working 
environments and promoting 
thriving, resilient communities. 

Our Group ESG governance
The Board has overall responsibility for the general oversight 
of ESG factors across ABF. It reviews each business segment 
every year, including a review of ESG issues.

In carrying out its duties, the Board is also supported by:

•  our Director of Legal Services and Company Secretary who 

reports to the Chief Executive and has responsibility for ESG 
issues. He acts as the focal point for communications to the 
Board and shareholders on ESG matters;

•  our Chief People and Performance Officer (CPPO) who 

reports to the Chief Executive and has responsibility for all 
employee matters, including safety, mental health, financial 
wellbeing, employee development, workforce engagement 
and diversity, equity and inclusion (DEI), as well as initiatives 
within procurement in our supply chains, the coordination 
of environmental reporting across our operations and how 
we ensure security for our people and assets; and 

•  our Group Corporate Responsibility Director who leads the 

Group’s Corporate Responsibility Hub team.

The Corporate Responsibility Hub is a central resource available 
to all our businesses, which provides support to them as required 
on environmental and human rights issues. It provides a network 
that brings together professionals across the Group working 
in these areas, the Corporate Responsibility (CR) Leads, so that 
they can share knowledge and best practices with each other.

Within the remit of the CPPO, other teams have been assigned 
dedicated focus areas, including DEI and health, safety and 
environment (HSE) and procurement.

All our businesses operate within a clear governance framework 
defined by the Group. However, our devolved business model 
gives businesses autonomy to operate in ways that aim to create 
enduring economic, environmental and social value. In addition 
to individual business leaders, divisional CEOs also have 
responsibility and are accountable for their ESG programmes. 
This covers their ESG risks, opportunities and impacts. They can 
draw on specialist support from the Corporate Responsibility 
Hub and the Director of Legal Services and Company Secretary, 
the CPPO as well as specialist legal advice from the team led 
by the Associate General Counsel for ESG.

RESPONSIBILITY CONTINUED

Agriculture and farming practices 

ABF is a diversified group, with a wide range of food and 
ingredients businesses as well as our retail brand, Primark. 
Our businesses depend upon agricultural systems for most of 
the raw materials we use in our products, and we recognise the 
need to support more sustainable farm management practices.

We have a strong association with the UK agricultural sector, 
where our businesses collectively form the largest end-to-end 
food producer. Globally, we are also a significant purchaser 
of cotton, sugar beet, sugar cane, tea and cereals.

Global agricultural systems are under increasing pressure 
to provide for a growing population while responding to the 
challenges and effects of climate change. Extreme weather 
events, increasing water stress, biodiversity loss and soil 
degradation are all adding to pressures within the system. 

We expect our businesses to go further than legal compliance 
by continuously considering and implementing other appropriate 
activities, voluntary commitments and internationally recognised 
management systems to reduce their environmental and 
social impacts and risks. This encompasses the responsible 
stewardship of our environment in line with the 
following requirements:

•  Group Environment Policy;
•  Group Animal Health and Welfare Policy; and
•  Group Supplier Code of Conduct.

Our businesses support a wide range of social and 
environmental interventions at farm level. These span 
management models including certified organic production, 
standards to promote wildlife biodiversity, engagement with 
smallholder growers in developing markets, and the adoption 
of integrated farm management systems built on the principles 
of sustainable intensification.

For example, Primark launched its Sustainable Cotton Programme 
in 2013, with farmers in the programme trained on techniques 
to help improve efficiency, increase soil quality and reduce their 
use of agrichemicals. It also aims to address a wide range 
of social development issues related in income improvement.

While it is not possible for our businesses to intervene in every 
farm supply chain, collectively we support many farm-focused 
intervention programmes. The objective of these is to shape 
management practices to promote systemic commercial, social 
and environmental resilience for the long term. Science, 
technology and data are essential to achieving this aim.

Many of the farm management standards our businesses 
support align with the core principles of Integrated Farm 
Management (IFM). They require the incorporation of a range 
of management practices across a number of designated  
criteria in the context of improving overall supply chain efficiency 
and driving more sustainable farm productivity. Requirements 
typically include, for example, the safe handling of agrochemicals 
and improving soil structure, as well as the provision of land 
management practices to sustain habitats for wildlife biodiversity. 
IFM can make a significant impact on a range of measures.

A Jordan’s Farm Partnership grower tending the infield crop 
alongside woodland habitat

The UN Sustainable Rice Platform (SRP) Standard, for example, 
requires Alternate Wet and Dry farm management techniques 
to reduce water use in the rice sector by around 30% and, 
by association, GHG emissions by up to 50%. Westmill has 
committed to source 20% of all the rice it purchases from 
farms in Pakistan and Thailand to follow this Standard.

Our businesses also supply a range of products and services to 
the agricultural sector that facilitate efficient farm management 
and regenerative approaches such as cover-cropping to improve 
soil structure and water retention.

We support the adoption of regenerative farm management 
techniques alongside the responsible use of precision science 
and technology to maximise efficiency, reduce greenhouse 
emissions and limit biodiversity losses while maintaining 
commercially productive agricultural outputs. For example, 
Illovo – Africa’s largest sugar producer – manages cane lands 
and farming activities in South Africa according to the 
SUSFARMS® environmental management system. Allied Mills 
and British Sugar require the farms they purchase from to 
meet the Combinable Crops Standard specified under the Red 
Tractor mark. In Jordans Dorset Ryvita, the Jordan’s Farm 
Partnership programme is run across 15,000ha in conjunction 
with both LEAF (Linking Environment And Farming) and 
The Wildlife Trusts.

We believe in the importance of high animal health and welfare 
standards. This is captured in our Group Animal Health and 
Welfare Policy, which applies to all our businesses.

For more information please see our Responsibility Report 2023.

People in our supply chains and 
surrounding communities

Respect for the working conditions and labour standards of the 
workers in our businesses’ supply chains is important to us. We 
also recognise the potential contribution we can make to 
surrounding communities. 

Human and labour rights in our supply chains
Our businesses use the United Nations Guiding Principles on 
Business and Human Rights (UNGPs) as a reference point to 
guide their activities in implementing human rights due diligence 
processes. The OECD’s Guidelines for Multinational Enterprises, 
Due Diligence Guidance for Responsible Business Conduct and 
various sectoral guidance documents all provide valuable 
models and reference material.

Our Group Supplier Code of Conduct is an essential  
requirement of the responsible business conduct of our 
businesses. This document is based on the core conventions  
of the International Labour Organization (ILO) and on the Base 
Code of the Ethical Trading Initiative, of which Primark is a 
member. All businesses within the Group are responsible for 
managing their relationships with suppliers and satisfying 
themselves that suppliers operate in line with the principles 
contained in the Supplier Code of Conduct.

In their application of the Supplier Code of Conduct, our 
businesses continue to develop and improve human rights 
due diligence processes in their supply chains as laid out in the 
UNGPs. Knowledge of where potential negative human rights 
impacts might exist, combined with supply chain mapping, helps 
them to monitor and identify actual issues, to seek remedy or 
even to anticipate and prevent them before they arise, prioritising 
those that are most salient. Our devolved business model 
enables our businesses to take the most appropriate approach 
based on their specific supply chains and the nature of their 
supplier relationships. In many cases we find that suppliers have 
their own programmes that meet our expectations in this area, 
but where this is not the case our businesses seek to use their 
leverage or collaborate to drive change.

Our businesses use a number of data platforms to assess and 
monitor potential human rights risks. Many businesses monitor 
their risk through audits carried out by internal teams or third 
parties. For example, Primark’s Ethical Trade auditing and 
monitoring programme is one of Primark’s most important 
resources for identifying risks. Some businesses also engage 
workers and their representatives directly outside of the audit 
process to understand what issues they face.

Our businesses seek to use the leverage they may have with 
their suppliers to secure access to an effective remedy for 
workers facing negative human rights impacts in their supply 
chains. For example, in India, Primark’s Ethical Trade and 
Environmental Sustainability team has developed a 
comprehensive programme called the India Worker 
Empowerment Programme to address the root causes and 
manifestations of key human rights risks.

Our businesses have or are developing grievance mechanisms 
to give workers a voice on the issues they face in the 
workplace. Examples include ABF Sugar’s ‘We Listen, We Act, 
We Remedy’ toolkit. Primark has multiple approaches to 
achieve effective grievance mechanisms, these include the 
Amader Kotha programme in Bangladesh, where a hotline is 
available to workers in garment factories.

Different stakeholders including NGOs, trade unions, 
governments, other businesses (subject to relevant competition 
and anti-trust laws) and industry bodies inform our approach to 
human rights due diligence. We work with these organisations 
due to their expert knowledge and we acknowledge 
their contribution.

Transparency about who and where our businesses source 
from enhances our understanding of human rights risks and, 
where necessary, encourages collaboration to resolve issues 
both locally and across our sectors. Some of our businesses, 
including Primark, Twinings and ABF Sugar, publish global 
sourcing maps and provide information about their processes, 
progress and challenges through corporate reports, websites, 
stakeholder engagement activities and submissions 
to ESG benchmarks.

In line with our Group Supplier Code of Conduct, our businesses 
prohibit all forms of modern slavery, including forced labour and 
human trafficking. For more information, see our Group Modern 
Slavery Statement 2023. Alongside our Group statement, some 
of our businesses publish separate modern slavery statements.

Supporting communities 
ABF Sugar continues to invest in its relationships with 
communities and key stakeholders. For instance, Illovo 
recognises that its sugar estates are a key part of the 
communities they are located in, and this is reflected by its 
activities to support those communities, such as by providing 
clinics, schools and local services to support its employees 
and in some cases also to support their families and 
neighbouring communities.

RESPONSIBILITY CONTINUED

Our people

We employ over 133,000 people and have operations in 
55 countries across Europe, Africa, the Americas, Asia and 
Australia. The people across our businesses are united by our 
purpose, culture and passion for delivering for our customers. 
We empower them to innovate and support them to grow 
and develop.

Health, safety and wellbeing
Our businesses strive to safeguard the wellbeing, health and 
safety of our people, contractors and visitors to our sites and 
when they are travelling for business. Safety is non-negotiable.

Loss of life in our operations is unacceptable and we expect 
all colleagues to return home after work as well as when they 
arrived. As such, we are deeply saddened to report three 
fatalities this year and recognise the irreplaceable loss this has 
caused their families, friends and colleagues. One contractor 
in Spain was fatally injured during an off-site traffic accident. 
An employee was involved in a fatal incident with a forklift truck 
in one of our bakeries in Australia. An employee in Malawi was 
fatally injured while working on an overhead electricity line.

Following these tragic events, our priority was to support the 
families and colleagues of those who died. We investigate all 
fatalities and serious accidents thoroughly, share the learnings 
with safety and operational colleagues across the group 
and have reinvigorated our focus on working with moving 
vehicles and electricity to minimise the risk of such events 
from happening again.

All our businesses must comply with our Group Health, 
Safety and Wellbeing Policy. Many of them supplement this 
with additional policies of their own. Responsibility for ensuring 
compliance with the Health, Safety and Wellbeing Policy is 
devolved to the chief executives of the various businesses. 
Each business also has a nominated director with specific 
accountability for health, safety and wellbeing.

A growing number of our businesses are investigating the 
potential of human behavioural and psychological techniques, 
some of them based on neuroscience, to help employees and 
contractors stay focused on health, safety and wellbeing.

Across the Group, we have identified the following key on-site 
and off-site safety risks:

•  harm from moving vehicles;
•  falls from height;
•  machinery safeguarding;
•  the storage and handling of hazardous materials;
•  manual handling of heavy and awkward loads;
•  working in confined spaces; and
•  the management of contractors.

Supporting our people’s mental health and their sense of 
general wellbeing also remains a priority. We continue to invest 
in our support across the Group, including programmes designed 
to raise awareness and provide practical assistance. In response 
to rising living costs this year, we have continued to focus 
on ensuring financial wellbeing tools and resources are 
available internationally.

We engage independent HSE specialists to provide us with 
an objective opinion of our safety performance, through 
a compliance and risk management audit programme.

Of our factories and retail stores, 69% have operated for one 
or more years without an on-site employee injury. 

This year, the Group’s on-site employee Lost Time Injury 
(LTI) rate has reduced slightly from 0.36% in 2022 to 0.35%. 
The number of onsite employee LTIs has also reduced by 2% 
from 355 to 348. Primark has reduced its on-site employee 
LTI rate again this year by 15% from 0.40% of employees 
experiencing an LTI to 0.34%.

The on-site contractor LTI rate this year has increased from 
0.14% to 0.33% and the number of on-site contractor LTIs has 
increased significantly by 85% from 41 to 76. Of this year’s 
on-site contractor LTIs 80% are attributed to our Retail and 
Sugar segments. The two segments are working hard 
to address the reasons for these incidents.

Engagement and development
Our employees can provide feedback to their business 
through discussions with their line manager and leaders, 
engagement surveys, and other mechanisms that support 
two-way communication. The work and focus of Richard Reid, 
our Non-Executive Director for engagement with our workforce, 
enables the Board to ensure that our businesses have cultures 
of openness so our people can share their views, that their 
voice is heard and acted upon. Read more about workforce 
engagement on pages 84 and 85.

Our businesses strive to attract and develop the most talented 
people. We enable this by creating opportunities for professional 
and personal development, and by fostering environments that 
enable our people to showcase their diverse and unique skills.

We offer a variety of learning opportunities and development 
programmes to help our people gain the skills our businesses 
need, including apprenticeships and mentoring. Our people are 
supported to build a rewarding career with us, we help them 
explore their own aspirations by building awareness of what 
their business and the wider group has to offer.

Diversity, equity and inclusion (DEI)
We celebrate diversity in all its forms. Our businesses are 
focused on widening and deepening their talent pools, 
attracting new recruits and connecting with the diverse 
communities they serve. We believe engaging with a diverse 
talent pool gives us a competitive edge and enhances our ability 
to deliver long-term success.

Many of our businesses have their own diversity policies, 
alongside the Board Diversity policy which applies across the 
Group, DEI teams and dedicated programmes to support their 
people, be they women, people from ethnic minorities, those 
working with disabilities or people who identify as LGBTQIA+.

Our Group DEI Network brings together people from across 
our businesses to share knowledge, best practices and ideas. 
We have over 300 DEI advocates across the Group, who 
benefit from access to masterclasses and self-study kits 
across a range of topics, including allyship, handling difficult 
conversations, neurodiversity inclusion, disability inclusion, 
racial and ethnic diversity and anti-racism, female careers 
and leadership, gender identity and LGBTQIA+ inclusion.

To create a more inclusive workplace, we ensure leaders and 
line managers have the skills they need to set the tone, model 
appropriate behaviour and put in place targeted campaigns 
relevant to local circumstances. We provide unconscious bias 
and cultural awareness training and tools to all our businesses.

Our ‘Women in ABF’ network was established over 10 years 
ago and continues to grow and evolve. It provides support for 
our women to develop skills, business awareness and networks 
that will enhance their current performance and future careers 
across the Group. Virtual events with external and internal 
speakers and networking opportunities are available to women 
across the Group.

To further address gender and ethnicity imbalances, we need 
to prioritise attracting a broader range of talent using more 
inclusive and effective processes. We are addressing the 
barriers that have historically discouraged talent from being 
attracted to or joining ABF or from reaching the top of our 

organisation. We continue to support female talent with 
bespoke development interventions to further strengthen our 
succession pipeline for senior roles across the Group.

Overall, the gender balance of the Group is fairly equal, 
with women making up 55%∆ of our total global workforce. 
We voluntarily report on our overall gender pay gap for 
employees in Great Britain (GB) on page 110 of this Annual 
Report. Each of our GB-based businesses with over 250 
employees also report on their own gender pay gap, with these 
reports published on their websites. These reports share some 
inspirational business-level insights about the actions being 
taken to enable all employees to successfully grow their 
careers with us.

Considering the most senior levels, those reporting to the 
divisional chief executives and Group functional directors, 
our gender balance as reported to the FTSE Women Leaders 
has improved to 28.1% from last year. We also see an increase 
in the number of women in senior management roles to 38%. 
It is pleasing to see the outcome from the focus we have given 
to addressing gender imbalances, we commit to a continued 
focus on ensuring women are represented in our most 
senior roles.

For more information please see our Responsibility Report 2023.

RESPONSIBILITY CONTINUED

Anti-Bribery and Corruption Policy
Our approach to governance is to respect not simply the letter, 
but also the spirit, of our policy and always act with integrity. 
To ensure the effective implementation of our Policy and 
procedures, each business has its own designated Anti-Bribery 
and Corruption Officer and we have monitoring systems 
in place at various levels within the Group including global 
risk assessments.

In addition, all relevant employees are required to complete 
an e-learning course on the subject when they join the Group 
and at regular intervals thereafter and those who work in higher 
risk roles are required to attend regular face-to-face training.

A copy of the ABF Anti-Bribery and Corruption Policy is available 
on the ABF website.

Speak Up
Our Speak Up Policy provides a route for our employees to raise 
concerns confidentially about inappropriate behaviour at work.

Speak Up empowers our people to tell us whenever they see 
anything inappropriate, improper, dishonest, illegal or dangerous 
and ensures that their concerns will be handled confidentially 
and professionally. Speak Up includes both a telephone line 
and a web reporting device managed by a leading independent 
provider, People Intouch.

We encourage all individuals working for ABF in any of our 
businesses in any country and in any capacity to Speak Up, 
including employees at all levels, directors, officers, part-time 
and fixed-term workers, casual and agency workers, seconded 
workers and volunteers. Speak Up also enables issues to be 
raised by third parties. 

Any contact made is disseminated to the appropriate 
management team responsible for investigating the issues 
raised. A thorough investigation is then undertaken and any 
remediation agreed.

In the year to 31 May 2023, 216 notifications were received, 
of which:

•  24% were resolved, with outcomes ranging from reviews 
of processes and support for individual employees to, 
where necessary, disciplinary procedures being followed;

•  60% were investigated as appropriate and required no action; 

and 

•  16% remain under investigation.

A copy of the ABF Speak Up Policy is available on the 
ABF website.

Carbon and climate

As a Group, we recognise that climate change represents a 
material risk throughout our supply chains and poses challenges 
to some of our businesses worldwide. However, we also 
recognise that climate change and the transition to a lower-
carbon world presents opportunities.

We wholly support policies that are aligned with the goals of the 
Paris Climate Agreement to limit the rise in global temperatures 
to well below 2˚C above pre-industrial levels, and to pursue 
efforts to limit the temperature increase even further to 1.5˚C.

As a Group, we have an ambition to achieve net zero by 2050 
or sooner. Beyond that broad ambition we do not set groupwide 
climate-related plans or targets. In line with our devolved 
business model, our businesses set plans and targets 

that are appropriate to their operations and supply chains. 
Our businesses are all committed to cutting GHG emissions and 
several of our businesses have set specific reduction targets.

ABF Sugar, Primark, Twinings Ovaltine and UK Grocery have 
each set a specific emissions reduction target. Primark has set 
a target in line with the Science Based Targets initiative (‘SBTi’), 
while ABF Sugar is in the process of validating their reduction 
target against the SBTi. We expect this to be completed by the 
end of the calendar year.

Achieving net zero across ABF by 2050 will depend on a 
number of factors that are beyond our control. However, based 
on our track record and progress against our plans so far, we are 
confident in our ability to deliver on this objective.

Reducing GHG emissions
Our businesses are targeting reductions in GHG emissions 
through carbon reduction plans, energy efficiency and growing 
their use of renewable energy. ABF Sugar and Primark have 
transition plans in place.

Energy efficiency has long been a driver of better performance 
for our Group, and we remain focused on finding ways to 
produce more from less energy. Much of our electricity is 
purchased from third-party power generation companies via 
national grids, and our businesses understand the benefits of 
transitioning to renewable energy tariffs for their purchased 
electricity. Many are doing so as soon as it becomes operationally 
and commercially feasible. In 2022/23, 29% of the electricity we 
bought came from renewable sources, which is a 62% increase 
in the amount of purchased renewable electricity compared 
with last year.

Several of our businesses are also contributing to 
decarbonisation by exporting renewable energy, contributing 
909 gigawatt hours (GWh) this year to national grids.

This year our businesses consumed 21,183 GWh∆ of energy 
which is a 1% increase compared with last year. Of this 
total consumed, 58%∆ was derived from renewable sources. 
These are predominantly biomass fuels from by-products 
generated as part of the production process within our 
agricultural based businesses. In the main, the renewable 
energy we generate comes from bagasse, the renewable 
plant-based fibrous residue that remains after the extraction 
of juice from the crushed stalks of sugar cane. Some renewable 
energy is derived from the anaerobic digestion of a range 
of waste materials.

Our Scope 1 and 2 (location-based) emissions decreased by 
6% this year from 3.11 million tonnes of CO2e to 2.91 million 
tonnes of CO2e ∆. This decrease has been driven primarily 
by a reduction in imported electricity and a change in the fuels 
used on-site.

In compliance with UK reporting requirements, we have 
provided in the table on the following page our UK energy and 
GHG emissions data. The principal energy efficiency measures 
undertaken this year to reduce our carbon emissions include 
a large-scale project to replace fluorescent lighting with LED 
lighting across stores in eight of Primark’s markets; embedding 
the use of energy monitoring systems; and upgrades to 
production machinery such as evaporators, pulp presses and 
boilers to improve efficiencies across our UK businesses.

For more examples of energy efficiency actions, see our 
Responsibility Report 2023.

Biogenic emissions are those from the combustion or fermentation of biomass/biofuels on our sites.
We calculate and disclose our GHG emissions based on the WRI/WBCSD GHG Protocol Corporate Accounting and Reporting Standard Revised Edition, except 
for alignment with the GHG Protocol’s approach for determining our organisational boundary and limitations with our Scope 3 disclosures. See our Responsibility 
Report Appendix for detail on our current treatment of emissions from joint ventures and Scope 3 limitations. We use carbon conversion factors published by the 
UK’s Department for Business, Energy and Industrial Strategy (BEIS) in June 2022, other internationally recognised sources, and bespoke factors based on laboratory 
calculations at selected locations. Scope 2 market-based emissions have been calculated in accordance with the GHG Protocol Scope 2 Guidance on procured 
renewable energy. Since 2021, we have excluded Primark’s third-party transport emissions from the Group figure as these are accounted for in the reported Primark 
Scope 3 emissions. Aligned with the GHG Protocol, biogenic CO2 emissions are specifically excluded from Scope 1 emissions and are separately reported.

Many of our businesses are in the process of calculating their 
wider Scope 3 emissions, focusing initially on their supply 
chains. Primark completed this process in 2021 and is currently 
implementing plans to support its suppliers and partners to 
reduce their GHG emissions in line with its reduction target. 
ABF Sugar completed this year a project to calculate its Scope 3 
emissions and it is also in the process of validating its Scope 3 
reduction target with the SBTi.

Primark reports 7.02 million tonnes of CO2e ∆ this year for 
their full Scope 3 emissions. For the rest of the Group, we 
currently report emissions from third-party transport for 
which we are responsible. These equate to 655,545 tonnes 
of CO2e ∆ which is a 3% increase compared with last year. 
This increase has been driven primarily by third-party transport 
emissions from our Retail and Sugar segments.

Our total Scope 3 emissions, which include Primark’s Scope 3 
emissions and Group third-party transport emissions increased 
by 8% from 7.09 million tonnes of CO2e to 7.67 million tonnes 
of CO2e ∆. This is largely due to Primark’s continued increase in 
trading activity during the year and expansion into new markets, 
resulting in increased materials and products brought into 
the business. Our businesses have started to collect their 
third-party transport data to align with the internationally 
recognised GHG Protocol.

For more information please see our Responsibility Report 2023.

Providing products that help others reduce their 
GHG emissions
We provide products and services that have the potential to 
assist others in reducing their carbon emissions, often referred 
to as carbon enablement. This has always been integral to our 
businesses, and a key focus for investment and innovation. 
ABF businesses including ABF Sugar, AB Enzymes and AB 
Agri play a role in facilitating the potential reduction of other 

businesses’ emissions. For example they do this by creating 
products which have environmental benefits for the end user.

For more information please see our Responsibility Report 2023.

RESPONSIBILITY CONTINUED

Efficient resource use

We are reliant on a range of natural resources to deliver our 
products and new processes and technologies have enabled us 
to become highly efficient at maximising the value that we can 
derive from them.

Waste and circularity
As a first step, our businesses aim to avoid waste generation 
as far as possible, and reuse and recycle waste where they can. 
Some of our businesses also explore energy recovery solutions 
for any remaining waste. Landfill and other final disposal 
techniques are always the last resort.

We are focused on making finite resources go further, believing 
that waste materials are often a resource that we can find a use 
for. With that in mind, our businesses are implementing 
practices to reuse, recycle or reduce food, plastic and/or textile 
waste. For example, we do not just make sugar. Our sugar 
facilities are highly efficient biorefineries that play a key role in 
other sectors’ value chains. We turn sugar beet and sugar cane 
co-products and by-products into animal feed and chemical 
products, as well as using it to generate renewable energy. 
We also use on-site anaerobic digesters to generate biogas 
from our waste streams.

In Retail, Primark has made a commitment to giving its clothes 
a longer life. Its ambition is to drive forward innovation and 
collaboration within its industry to make its clothes last longer 
and reduce clothing waste.

Our food businesses avoid products going to waste by donating 
surpluses to food banks, community groups and charities.

Across the Group, we generated 520,608 tonnes of waste ∆ 
in 2023 which is an 11% decrease compared with the 584,845 
tonnes generated in 2022. Of the total generated, 83% was 
sent for recycling or other beneficial use. Our businesses 
continue to focus on reusing waste materials where possible. 

This year, 11% of all our production sites achieved zero waste 
to landfill and 37% recycled or reused 95% or more of their total 
generated waste.

For more information please see our 2023 Responsibility Report.

Plastic and packaging
As a leading provider of food, ingredients and clothing, 
packaging contributes significantly to our environmental 
footprint. Paper is the main packaging material used across the 
Group, followed by plastic and glass. We also use wood, steel, 
aluminium and a number of other materials.

Though we fully recognise the harmful effects of plastic waste 
on ecosystems, plastic currently plays a vital role in both food 
safety and reducing food waste, by extending the shelf life of 
food. Our challenge is to use plastic materials responsibly and 
find solutions which balance the needs of our customers and 
our desire to minimise our impact.

Our businesses aim to achieve this by removing unnecessary 
and problematic plastic packaging, switching to more easily 
recyclable types of plastic and increasing the use of recycled 
content in the plastics we use.

Our businesses demonstrate their commitment to tackling 
plastic and packaging challenges by involvement with and 
support for a number of pacts and programmes, including the 
WRAP UK Plastics Pact, REDcycle in Australia and the Soft 
Plastic Recycling Scheme in New Zealand.

In 2023, our businesses used 246,683 tonnes ∆ of packaging 
compared with 267,638 tonnes used in 2022. This is an 8% 
annual decrease even though tonnes of production from Group 
operations increased by 3%. There has been a decrease in the 
use of all the packaging materials, including plastic, steel, glass 
and paper, which remains the main packaging material used. 
Tonnes of plastic used as a packaging material has decreased 
by 9% this year and demonstrates the commitment of our 
businesses to reduce the use of plastic where appropriate.

Water use
Our businesses aim to reduce the amount of water they abstract, 
to reuse process water as much as possible and to return treated 
wastewater to nature, having ensured it meets or exceeds local 
and national water standards, and protect aquatic ecosystems.

We have carried out annual water risk assessments for our 
operations using internationally recognised methodologies to 
identify the sites operating in water-stressed areas.

We use a range of technologies in our operations to manage our 
water use in fields and factories, and constantly work to further 
reduce our water footprint per tonne of product we produce.

This year, the Group collectively abstracted 860 million m3 ∆ 
of water for use in operations and irrigation, an 8% increase 
compared with last year. This rise is driven by three of Illovo’s 
estates which account for a significant proportion of the Group’s 
total water abstraction. Their increase in water abstraction, which 
is primarily used for cane irrigation, is aligned with their increase 
in tonnes of production from their operations for this year.

ABF Sugar accounts for a significant proportion of the water 
used in our own operations across the Group, at 97% of the 
total water abstracted. Water is used carefully and extensively 
throughout the sugar manufacturing operations compared with 
our other businesses; from the processing stage to extract and 
refine the sugar, to generating steam in the boilers, through to 
cleaning the equipment. A significant amount of ABF Sugar’s 
abstracted water is also used for crop irrigation within Illovo and 
where possible the sites reuse abstracted water for this 
irrigation, for dust control, landspreading and cleaning machinery.

This year, across the Group, 25% of the water abstracted was 
reused before being returned to watercourses. This is a cost- 
and resource-efficient way of managing water.

Notable improvements in water management this year were 
made by ABF Sugar and include the approval of a large-scale 
irrigation project and continued conversions from furrow to 
more efficient drop irrigation systems.

AB Mauri continues to invest in effluent treatment plants 
at many of its sites to deliver on its commitment to maintain 
appropriate standards of water quality, this investment being 
significant in recent years. More broadly, its water strategy 
focuses on reducing its water-intensity ratio defined as the 
quantity of water consumed per tonne of product produced, 
excluding by-products. AB Mauri has reduced its overall water 
intensity-ratio by 25% since 2017/18.

Food and nutrition

Providing safe food and enabling customers to make healthier 
choices have both been central to our approach for a long time. 

Relevant businesses take nutritional factors into account across 
their product portfolio. Many of our food products already 
support healthier choices – from high-fibre breakfast cereals, 
wholemeal bread and crispbreads to specialist sports nutrition 
products. Product reformulation can also help to gradually shift 
consumer tastes towards foods that support better long-term 
nutrition, and our food businesses actively review their 
portfolios with this in mind.

As part of ABF Sugar’s commitment to thriving and healthy 
communities, the business has its Making Sense of Sugar 
website which provides factual information based on robust 
science to help inform and educate people about sugar and the 
role it can play as part of a healthy balanced diet.

As part of UK Grocery’s commitment to responsibly produce 
and market safe, nutritious and affordable food, our UK Grocery 
businesses provide details of the revenue generated by their UK 
branded portfolio in terms of the 2004/5 Nutrient Profiling Model 
and the Food (Promotion and Placement) (England) Regulations 
2021. The Nutrient Profiling Model uses a formula to assess the 
nutritional content of foods, designating them as either HFSS 
(high in fat, salt, or sugar), or non-HFSS.

Overall, more than 94% of the revenue generated from our 
UK Grocery’s branded portfolio in 2022/23 was derived from 
products that are designated as being non-HFSS, or that are 
classified as HFSS but are not subject to restrictions under the 
Food (Promotion and Placement) (England) Regulations 2021. 
For context, foods designated HFSS within our UK Grocery’s 
branded portfolio that are not within the scope of public 
health-related sales restrictions include bagged sugars and 
cooking oils, as well as some cooking sauces and condiments.

Examples of products becoming healthier include Jordans 
Dorset Ryvita launching several new non-HFSS recipes and AB 
World Foods reducing sugar, fat and salt from Patak’s sauces.

AB Mauri has successfully developed solutions for its sweet 
bakery portfolio that enables up to 100% sugar reduction while 
preserving the delightful taste experience. AB Mauri is also 
improving the nutritional profile of its sweet bakery goods by 
increasing the amount of fibre. 

A number of ABF brands, including Ryvita and Kingsmill, are 
among 24 signatories to the UK Food and Drink Federation’s 
Action on Fibre pledge, to increase fibre consumption in the UK. 
Our UK Grocery division is also a long-term sustaining member 
of the British Nutrition Foundation.

CLIMATE-RELATED FINANCIAL DISCLOSURES (TCFD)

Climate-related Financial Disclosures (TCFD)

Climate change continues to represent a 
material risk throughout our supply chains 
and presents ongoing risks and opportunities 
to some of our businesses, some of which 
we have been working on for many years. 
We remain committed to taking action and 
supporting policies aligned with the goals 
of the 2015 Paris Climate Agreement to limit 
the rise in global temperatures to well below 
2° C above pre-industrial levels, and to pursue 
efforts to limit the temperature increase 
even further to 1.5° C.

We recognise our role in working towards a low-carbon 
economy. We have developed last year’s disclosure to highlight 
actions we have taken in the current year and describe transition 
plans for two of our largest businesses.

In our diversified Group, climate-related targets are set by our 
businesses based on their material risks and what is relevant 
and achievable for them. ABF Sugar, Primark and Twinings 
remain our most material businesses, comprising 76% of  
Group adjusted operating profit (2022 – 81%) and 72% of 
Scope 1 and 2 greenhouse gas (‘GHG’) emissions (2022 – 70%), 
mainly from ABF Sugar and Twinings. Primark’s GHG emissions 
arise predominantly in Scope 3, which accounts for 98% of 
Primark’s total GHG emissions. See pages 52 and 53 for the 
detailed disclosure.

Our most material businesses each have their own emission 
reduction targets. These are:

•  ABF Sugar – a 30% absolute reduction in Scope 1 and 2 

emissions by 2030 (baseline: 2018)

•  Primark – a 50% absolute reduction in emissions across 

the value chain by 2030 (baseline: 2018)

Other Group businesses have identified their own emission 
reduction targets or are in the process of doing so. Further 
information can be found on our website.

We are committed to the aim of reaching net zero by 2050, but 
this cannot be achieved by us in isolation. There is a need for 
systemic change throughout the value chain, including a 
redesign of national energy strategies and policies.

Twinings’ previously set target is under review to develop a 
new, more specific carbon reduction target. For further details 
please read page 33 of the Responsibility Report 2023.

Background

We published our approach to TCFD in the 2021 Annual Report 
before our first TCFD report in the 2022 Annual Report.

Last year we met the requirements of Listing Rule 9.8.6R  
with TCFD disclosures in line with the 2017 TCFD framework. 
This year we have applied the same framework, now including 
the 2021 implementation guidance which requires details of 
transition plans. For the first time, we have included transition 
plans for ABF Sugar and Primark as they contribute most 
significantly to adjusted operating profit and total GHG emissions. 
Twinings’ transition plan will be included next year. These 
disclosures also meet the Companies Act 2006 requirement 
to make UK Mandatory Climate Disclosures.

Last year we considered a variety of climate scenarios including 
<2° C and 4° C scenarios to assess the resilience of the Group 
to climate change. On the basis of that analysis, we determined 
that in the period to 2030, the risks to the Group were not 
material, but are material in the longer term. This year we have 
identified no significant changes in our businesses or where 
they operate that would require an update to last year’s 
scenario analyses.

Governance
Our governance processes in relation to overseeing, assessing 
and managing climate-related issues evolve every year. This year 
we enhanced our processes to address the evolving requirements 
of climate change and other ESG matters. The Board continues 
to have oversight over, and responsibility for, climate-related 
risks and opportunities.

Oversight by the Board and Audit Committee
The Board receives specific updates each year on climate and 
other ESG matters from the Group Corporate Responsibility 
Director, the Director of Legal Services and Company Secretary 
and the Chief People and Performance Officer. This year, 
this included:

•  an update on TCFD requirements and the additional areas 

we are required to report against

•  our approach to transition plans and why the focus is on ABF 

Sugar and Primark

•  an update on UK Mandatory Climate Disclosures and which 

entities are in scope

•  update on strategic decisions taken by businesses 
in addressing climate change and wider ESG issues

The Board receives relevant updates, such as updates 
on transition plans throughout the year outside of this annual 
presentation. All operating businesses present periodically 
to the Board, including on significant climate matters.

The Board is proactive and has taken prior assessments of 
climate risks and opportunities and information from the above 
meetings and used these to influence strategic decisions. 
In 2023 this has primarily crystallised through approval and drive 
of transition plans.

Primark’s targets for GHG emission reductions have been 
validated against the Science Based Targets Initiative (SBTi). By 
the end of the calendar year, reduction targets for 
Scope 1, 2 and 3 emissions at ABF Sugar should be validated 
against the SBTi. 

The Board possesses sufficient competencies to lead the  
Group in responding to climate-related risks and opportunities. 
Please refer to pages 80 and 81 for details of the Board.

The Audit Committee was briefed on updated TCFD 
requirements, including transition plans for Primark and ABF 
Sugar, as well as on UK Mandatory Climate Disclosures, which 
apply to our largest UK subsidiaries for the first time this year.

Management’s role
Assessing and managing the impact of climate change on the 
Group is the responsibility of the Chief Executive, reporting to 
the Board. Divisional chief executives are responsible for 
assessing, managing and mitigating the impact of climate 
change on their businesses. Every business presents quarterly 
updates to the Chief Executive and Finance Director, which 
include discussion of significant climate-related matters.

The Chief Executive and the Board are supported in these 
activities by the Director of Legal Services and Company 
Secretary, the Chief People and Performance Officer and the 
Group Corporate Responsibility Director.

Further details of their activities are set out in the ’Our Group 
ESG Governance’ section on page 47.

15% of short-term incentive targets for the Chief Executive 
and Finance Director, equivalent to 30% of base salary, is linked 
to strategic, primarily ESG, measures. See pages 104, 105, 107 
and 108 for further details.

Risk management
The Board is accountable for risk management including on 
climate change issues. The process for identifying, assessing 
and managing climate-related risks is the same as for other 
business risks and sits with the business where the risk resides. 
Risks are collated and reviewed at a business and divisional 
level and are then reported to the Director of Financial Control, 
who reviews the key risks with the Board.

More information on our risk management process is available 
in the ‘Our approach to risk management’ section on page 68.

We have integrated climate-related considerations into 
processes affecting our financial statements, including 
considerations of capital expenditure within the ABF Sugar 
business as well as for impairment assessments.

Identifying, assessing and managing climate-related 
risks and opportunities
Last year, we described our groupwide materiality-based risk 
assessment, focussed on financially material climate risks and 
opportunities at a divisional level and our decentralised 
structure. This assessment identified risks and opportunities in 
the most material divisions contributing to Group adjusted 
operating profit and GHG emissions – ABF Sugar, Primark 
and Twinings.

Our cross-functional divisional teams worked with third-party 
experts to understand climate-related physical and transition 
risks and opportunities. These were included in our 
scenario analysis.

Following this we worked with the third-party experts and 
performed high-level assessments across the remainder of our 
businesses to understand whether the risks and opportunities 
in individual businesses, but also in aggregate, could be material 
to the Group. The most significant risks were incorporated 
into relevant risk registers, in line with our existing risk 
management process. We have considered, in aggregate, 
other risks and opportunities that might have a material impact. 
None were identified.

This year, ABF Sugar and Primark formalised their transition 
plans, which confirmed that the risks and opportunities 
identified last year were still appropriate. No new risks 
or opportunities were identified.

Strategy and action, metrics and targets
We operate a decentralised business model because we believe in giving our leaders the scope and accountability to create and run 
the best businesses they can.

Enabling decision-making by the people closest to these issues, with the relationships with affected stakeholders, provides resilience, 
agility and flexibility in planning, allowing for quick action on impacts and opportunities.

Scenario analysis
As described in last year's Annual Report, we engaged third-party 
experts to help us perform scenario analysis to assess  
the potential impact of these risks. This year, we considered 
whether that analysis should be updated for any new material 
factors. We concluded that the analysis remains appropriate, 
except in respect of flooding risk in Bangladesh, where revised 
information is given on page 62.

Knowledge in this area is growing and we expect models and 
pathways to evolve with time. Models have limitations, and some 
areas are challenging to model, for example the frequency and 
severity of extreme weather events. However, our businesses can 
still consider how they would mitigate or adapt to such events. 
Additionally, in certain situations different models can project 
contrasting results. In these situations, we have used our 
experience of current risks that may be exacerbated by climate 
change and then considered how different outcomes would impact 
our businesses.

We have used the following scenarios:

Warming  
trajectory by 2100

< 2˚ C

2-3˚ C

~4˚ C

Transition scenarios1

Net Zero Emissions by 2050 
Scenario (‘NZE’) (1.5˚ C)

Sustainable Development 
Scenario (‘SDS’)

Stated Policies Scenario 
(‘STEPS’)

Physical 
scenarios2

RCP2.6

RCP4.5

RCP8.5

1.  The International Energy Agency’s scenarios have been used to assess 

transition impacts with each scenario built on a set of assumptions on how 
the energy system might evolve. Each scenario has a different temperature 
outcome. We used scenarios covering 1.5˚ C, <2˚ C and <3˚ C.

2.  We used the Intergovernmental Panel on Climate Change’s Representative 
Concentration Pathways (RCP) to assess physical climate risk. RCPs are 
commonly used by climate scientists to assess physical climate risk, with each 
pathway representing a different greenhouse gas concentration trajectory 
which can then be translated into global warming impacts. We used climate 
data from the World Climate Research Programmes Coupled Model 
Intercomparison Project – Phase 5 (CMIP 5 adjusted for spatial resolution and bias 
corrected) to do this translation. RCPs feed into climate, crop and flood models. 
There are four RCP pathways with RCP8.5 representing the worst case scenario.

The impact of compounding means that even small changes 
in assumptions can lead to a significant range of outcomes 
from climate models and scenarios. We have therefore placed more 
emphasis on projections to 2030, using them for action planning, 
and used projections to 2050, where there is more uncertainty, to 
check our sense of direction and consider the resilience of our 
businesses should certain hypothetical scenarios take place.

Risks and opportunities have been considered over the following 
time horizons:

Years Rationale

Short-term

2025 Mid-decade 

Medium-term 2030 Our most financially material businesses, 

ABF Sugar, Primark and Twinings have 
set 2030 emission targets, which are 
supported by emission reduction plans

Long-term

2050 2050 is consistent with many national and 

industry targets. Primark is aligned with 
the UNFCCC Fashion Industry Charter 
goal of net zero emissions across all three 
Scopes by 2050

TCFD physical risk: concepts and frameworks
In all physical risk analysis, we have used the RCP8.5 scenario, 
which is widely considered to represent one of the worst-case 
climate scenarios with temperatures reaching some 4˚ C above 
pre-industrial levels by 2100. This scenario projects an extreme 
view of physical climate change impacts.

In addition to RCP8.5, the evaluation of physical risks has been 
supplemented with analysis using either RCP2.6 or RCP4.5 
scenarios, depending on which climate scenario is most 
applicable to the risk. We have focused on the results of 
RCP8.5 as it is the most challenging scenario from a physical 
risk perspective.

In line with best practice, we used a multi-modal approach to 
capture and assess the uncertainty of future climate change 
projections. The numbers quoted represent the median 
projected result. Where appropriate we have also disclosed 
ranges in potential outcomes to reflect the uncertainties and 
variables inherent when using models to assess future climate 
outcomes. These outcome ranges represent the 25th and 75th 
percentiles. Detailed data for the analysis was supplied by our 
businesses, including individual locations of our own operations, 
suppliers’ factories and the location of the farming communities 
in Primark’s Sustainable Cotton Programme in India, Pakistan 
and Bangladesh.

Our third-party experts advised us which crop models to use to 
assess climate change impacts on crop yields. In some cases 
(e.g. for cotton and tea), only one available crop model was 
deemed sufficiently robust for evaluating future climate impacts 
on yields, the analysis was based on the input of five climate 
models providing sensitivity to the analysis. For other crops (e.g. 
sugar cane, wheat and corn), multiple crop models were used.

Use of scenario results to support strategy  
and financial planning
Scenario analysis has helped our businesses confirm the actions 
they need to take and strategies they need to adopt on an 
ongoing basis to mitigate and adapt to risks and take advantage 
of opportunities. Mitigating actions are managed by the relevant 
businesses as the actions are specific to them. We consider 
that the scenario analysis performed in conjunction with the 
mitigating actions undertaken by our businesses demonstrate 
that our business models and strategy are resilient to climate 
change in each of the transition and physical scenarios 
outlined above.

Impact assessment

Determining the potential impact of climate risks and the size of 
climate opportunities is challenging. Climate models include 
several fixed assumptions and there is significant uncertainty 
around the impacts of climate change and how governments 
will respond to its threats.

We have taken several factors into consideration when 
assessing our confidence in mitigating actions:

1. Greater reliance is placed on actions already underway and 
where we have seen evidence of the success of those 
actions, for example the benefits seen by farmers in Primark’s 
sustainable cotton programme and pest control in British 
Sugar.

2. Physical risks from a changing climate are already present, 
growing and being managed by our businesses. In many 
cases, risks may worsen but there is time to find innovative 
solutions to adapt to their impacts.

This year we experienced significant flooding, damaging the 
sugar crop in our sugar business in Mozambique, which 
required an asset write-off, but the financial impact on the group 
was not material.

Having evaluated, using scenario analysis, all physical and transition risks in the table on page 58, we disclose below the risks we 
believe have the potential to be the most financially significant and/or of the most interest to stakeholders:

Climate impact on cotton yields

2022 assessment

Low

2030

Medium

2050

Scenarios assessed: RCP2.6 and RCP8.5 
Assessment: based on RCP8.5
The outcomes to 2030 show that effects of climate risks such 
as extreme temperatures, heavy rainfall and timing/duration of 
monsoon season range from virtually no impact to a reduction 
of approximately 4% under RCP8.5.

The outcomes to 2050 project a negative impact on yield 
of 14% under RCP8.5 and 4% under RCP2.6 before 
mitigating actions.

Mitigation
•  By 2022, 40% of Primark’s cotton clothing sales (units) 

contain cotton that is organic, recycled or is sourced from 
Primark’s Sustainable Cotton Programme (‘PSCP’).
•  Cotton sourced through PSCP is grown using farming 
methods with a lower environmental impact, including 
reducing water, chemical pesticide and fertiliser use and 
training farmers in these methods. Our 2013-2019 study 
concluded that switching to these farming methods led to 
increased yields which help mitigate negative yield impacts 
caused by climate change.

•  By 2022, some 250,000 farmers have received training 

in our PSCP.

2023 update

Metrics and targets
•  Proportion of cotton clothing sales (units) that contain cotton that is organic, recycled or sourced from Primark’s Sustainable 
Cotton Programme: 100% by 2027. 46% of cotton clothing units sold against this metric in 2023. This is up from 27% at the 
launch of the programme and 40% from 2022. 

•  Number of farmers trained in Primark’s Sustainable Cotton Programme: 275,000 by end of 2023. As of July 2023, 299,388 

(∆assured) farmers had received training through the programme.

Please refer to https://corporate.primark/en-gb/primark-cares/resources/reports for Primark’s basis of reporting for each metric. 

Projects addressing physical risks

Primark Sustainable Cotton Programme
Cotton sourced through PSCP is grown using farming methods with lower environmental impact, including reducing 
water, chemical pesticide and fertiliser use. This has led to increased yields, lower input costs and an overall increase 
in income for the farmers trained in these methods.

Project impact
As at July 2023, 299,388 (∆assured) farmers had received training through the programme compared to a target 
of 275,00 farmers. In 2023, the programme was expanded to Turkey.

Impact of climate on sugar yields in Africa (Malawi, Mozambique,  
South Africa, Tanzania and Zambia)

2022 assessment

Low

2030

Medium

2050

Scenarios assessed: RCP2.6 and RCP8.5 
Assessment: based on RCP8.5
Climate impact on sugar yields varies country by country. 
The outcomes to 2030 under the USDA’s EPIC crop model 
indicate a range from no change to a decline of 10%. The 
outcomes to 2050 indicate a 5% gain to a 29% decline.

Mitigation
•  Our African sugar businesses already experience and 

manage significant climate variability, so their responses to 
weather events are well developed.

•  Improving irrigation efficiency to mitigate the risk of drought, 
including investing in drip irrigation and river defences to 
reduce storm damage.

2023 update

Metrics and targets
•  Sugar production (tonnes): ABF Sugar has produced 2.8m tonnes of sugar
•  Volume of water abstracted (million m3): ABF Sugar has abstracted 830 million m3 of water.
•  ABF Sugar has a target to reduce its end-to-end supply chain water usage by 30% by 2030. ABF Sugar has reduced water usage 

by 4% between 2017/18 and 2022/23.

Projects addressing physical risks

Irrigation and drainage investment
ABF Sugar is implementing a variety of irrigation and drainage projects across its African businesses to reduce the 
impact climate has on sugar yields. These include drip irrigation conversion, a bulk water supply efficiency programme 
and sub-surface drainage in Malawi.

Project impact
These are a few of the ongoing projects to improve irrigation and drainage and therefore reduce water usage. 
This is measured primarily through solutions implemented and volume of water saved.

Mitigation
•  Twinings’ sourcing capability coupled with its blending 
capability enables the business to manage localised 
yield issues.

Climate impact on tea yields

2022 assessment

Low

2030

Low

2050

Scenarios assessed: RCP8.5
Assessment: based on RCP8.5
The outcomes through 2030 and 2050 show a positive impact 
on tea yields. However, the crop model has limited 
representation of acute weather events such as extreme 
temperatures, heavy rainfall and droughts. We have a 
well-grounded experience in understanding volatility in regional 
tea yields as a result of weather events and by extension the 
world’s tea-growing regions. With this, we can respond to 
extreme weather events by sourcing tea products to continue 
to produce tea to our set standards. Where this is not an 
option for single origin blends, the impact would not be 
material to the business.

2023 update

Metrics and targets
•  Since the impact of climate change on tea yields is assessed as low, no metrics are disclosed. We will continue to monitor 

this risk and will develop a metric at such a time where the risk could be material.

Medium

2050

Scenarios assessed: Bangladesh RCP4.5 and RCP8.5; 
China RCP8.5
Assessment: Bangladesh (based on RCP4.5 and RCP8.5)
Bangladesh is exposed to both coastal and river flooding. The 
flood risk outcomes through to 2030 are minimal, but by 2050 
there is a distinct increase. 

China (based on RCP8.5)
The flood risk in China only changes minimally through to 2030 
and 2050. Coastal flooding is projected at 1% in 2030 and less 
than 2% in 2050. River flooding is projected at less than 5% 
for 2030 and 2050. Primark has a large geographical spread of 
supplier factories which would require a large number of rivers 
and coastlines to flood simultaneously for there to be a 
material problem.

Mitigation
•  The analysis shows that the majority of Primark’s suppliers 
in Bangladesh are located in areas of Dhaka which are less 
susceptible to flooding. 

•  The local Dhaka community regularly deals with flooding 

and has adapted processes to mitigate its impacts. 
•  Ensuring a geographical spread of supplier factories 

across China. 

•  Primark’s Sourcing Strategy has been in place for two years 
with a focus on geographical diversification, creating a more 
balanced global footprint and developing risk mitigation 
strategies to increase flexibility and agility when unexpected 
events occur.

2023 update

Metrics and targets
•  Number of Primark supplier factories (China and Bangladesh) subject to high flood risk.

China
•  10.9% of factories face high ravine flood risk at baseline (2023)
•  2.9% of factories face high coastal flood risk at baseline (2023)

Bangladesh
•  10.2% of factories face high ravine flood risk at baseline (2023)
•  5.1% of factories face high coastal flood risk at baseline (2023)

Projects addressing physical risks

Structural Integrity Programme – Mott MacDonald flood pilot – Bangladesh
Primark has mobilised an engineering team under its Structural Integrity Programme to pilot an approach in Bangladesh 
to support supplier factories to mitigate flood risk. Primark has appointed Mott MacDonald to investigate flood risk 
associated with factories within Primark’s supply chain that are deemed high risk. The programme seeks to understand 
the detailed risk to each site and how those supplier factories have taken appropriate measures to minimise the potential 
impact of flooding such as damage to property, plant and equipment and finished goods as well as protecting the 
wellbeing of factory workers.

Project impact
Primark will use the pilot to determine how to deploy wider activity within the existing Structural Integrity Programme. 
Progress in this area will be provided in next year’s report. However, the overarching goal is to ensure factories have 
the right flood mitigation measures in place.

2022 assessment

2030

Scenarios assessed: International Energy Agency’s Net 
Zero Emissions by 2050 Scenario, Sustainable

Assessment
Incremental impact ranges from £0m to £48m in 2030. ABF 
Sugar has developed a plan to reduce Scope 1 and 2 
emissions by 30% by 2030 (from a 2018 baseline), achieved 
through a series of fuel substitution and energy-efficiency 
programmes that generally have a return on investment above 
15%. Beyond 2030, while some technologies exist, they are 
not yet commercially viable.

Mitigation
•  ABF Sugar has a detailed plan to achieve its 30% absolute 
GHG reduction by 2030. Some 12% reduction has already 
been delivered versus its 2018 baseline. 

2023 update

Metrics and targets
•  A 30% absolute reduction in Scope 1 and 2 emissions by 

2030 (from a 2018 baseline).

Technology adoption
ABF Sugar is using SAI platform FSA to support assessing, improving and validating on-farm sustainability. This focuses 
on soil health, pest management and climate change.

Project impact
ABF Sugar is in the process of defining metrics to monitor the progress of this programme. It will align these metrics to 
the SAI regenerative agriculture framework.

emissions. Scope 1 and 2 make up less than 2% of Primark’s 
total emissions. Primark’s decarbonisation programme is 
managed as an integral part of the Primark Cares strategy with 
a road map to reduce absolute emissions by 50% by 2030 
and mitigate potential exposure to increased carbon taxation. 
The plan focuses on Primark’s top five sourcing markets and 
support to suppliers with implementing energy-efficient 
measures and making a switch to renewable sources. 
The plan does not assume the purchase of offsets.

Mitigation
•  Primark has a worked-up plan to achieve a significant 

reduction in supplier emissions by the end of the decade 
and is aligned with the UNFCCC Fashion Industry Charter 
goal of net zero emissions across all three Scopes by 2050.

2023 update

Metrics and targets
•  A 50% absolute reduction in Scope 1, 2 and 3 emissions by 

2030 from a 2018 baseline.

Strategy, metrics and targets
ABF Sugar has categorised existing and new plans and projects 
into three timeframes:

1. Short term (present to 2025): Focus on improving efficiency 

and reducing operational GHG emissions; investing in energy 
efficiency with the aim of reducing energy consumption and 
eliminating coal.

2. Medium term (2026 to 2030): Targeting key sites and pairing 

them with key technological resources.

3. Long term (beyond 2030): Focusing on employing low-

emission technologies, managing climate-related risks across 
the value-chain, and partnering to innovate at factories across 
the business.

There are assumptions on low-emission technologies for 
hydrocarbons and government regulations surrounding biogas 
that underpin these goals. The above short- and medium-term 
goals have been identified to achieve ABF Sugar’s 2030 
commitments.

These goals have been set in line with the Science Based 
Targets Initiative (‘SBTi’). ABF Sugar’s emissions reduction 
target will be validated by the SBTi throughout 2023, with the 
aim of completion before the end of the calendar year.

In alignment with the best practice, ABF Sugar will need to 
develop a strategy to neutralise residual emissions that will not 
be abated through emissions reductions initiatives in the future.

The progress of each project is monitored by a defined 
governance structure which aligns with the capital and 
performance improvement programme quarterly review. This is 
owned by the Head of Advocacy who monitors each project 
with appropriate metrics. Progress against the transition plan 
is also monitored as part of this process. 

The selection and implementation process for these projects 
are included in ABF Sugar’s financial planning process. 
Each selected project undergoes a formal capital 
expenditure process.

Some of the long-term projects are reliant on external factors. 
For example, development of hydrogen solutions will require 
significant government policy change and support. If this 
does not eventuate, ABF Sugar will have to reassess its 
long-term plans.

CLIMATE-RELATED FINANCIAL DISCLOSURES (TCFD) CONTINUED

Transition plans

In line with the 2021 TCFD implementation 
guidance, this year we are disclosing transition 
plans for ABF Sugar and Primark. We have 
applied a materiality-based methodology as set 
out in the climate risk and opportunity section. 
ABF Sugar and Primark are currently our largest 
contributors to GHG emissions. Twinings will 
be included next year.

Whilst each business prepares and executes 
their own transition plans, the Board has 
overall accountability for the transition plan. 
Transition plans were reviewed by the Board 
in June. The Board reviews these plans to 
ensure they align and further the Group’s 
transition to a low-carbon economy. The Board 
will receive an update annually on the status 
and execution of the transition plans with the 
transition plans being revised every three 
years, or sooner if a material event occurs.

ABF Sugar

ABF Sugar is committed to reducing absolute Scope 1 and 2 
emissions by 30% from a 2018 baseline by 2030. ABF Sugar is 
undergoing a project to measure Scope 3 emissions. Once this 
is completed, they will be considered. This transition plan explains 
the activities ABF Sugar has planned to ensure that it can meet 
this commitment.

Governance
The ABF Sugar chief executive and local managing directors are 
responsible for overseeing climate-related risks, opportunities, 
overall strategy and transition plans. ABF Sugar holds regular 
meetings with the corporate centre which act as a forum for 
climate-related content, particularly updates on: climate 
commitments, transition plans, GHG reduction roadmaps and 
any additional risks or opportunities identified. The frequency 
of these meetings has increased in this first year of reporting 
on transition plans.

Climate related targets are included in the personal performance 
incentive assessment of senior management.

Risk management
The ABF Sugar chief executive and local managing directors are 
accountable for effective risk management. The process for 
identifying, assessing and managing climate-related risks is 
the same as for other risks and sits with the business where 
the risk resides. These individuals are also accountable for 
identifying, assessing and managing risks to delivering the 
transition plan. 

Each business develops action plans to respond to relevant 
climate-related risks and opportunities. All plans and projects are 
subject to a well-established governance process within ABF 
Sugar that examines each performance improvement proposal 
against internal rate of return criteria and ESG factors. These 
plans are then approved by the local managing director and the 
chief executive of ABF Sugar.

Projects supporting carbon reduction to date
Since communicating its 2030 commitments, ABF Sugar has delivered a number of projects to support the transition to a low-carbon 
economy. These are a sample of the projects ABF Sugar has delivered, there is a larger number and carbon impact.

Project

Impact

Bury St Edmunds hot gas  
generator dryer (February 2019 – 
September 2021)*

Newark decalcification (February 
2018 – September 2022)*

Modifications made to dryers have allowed them to run on natural gas instead of coal, 
leading to a 1% decrease in carbon emissions (9,833 tCO2e).

Calcium was removed from thin juice to prevent evaporator scaling. This enables 
evaporators to operate more energy efficiently, leading to a 0.3% decrease in carbon 
emissions (3,302 tCO2e).

Newark heater (October 2018 – 
September 2022)*

Several new heaters have facilitated improved heat transfer and improved energy 
performance, leading to a 0.2% decrease in carbon emissions (1,758 tCO2e).

Wissington gas turbine  
performance recovery (July 2017 
– September 2019)*

Cantley process safety – heavy fuel 
oil elimination (September 2016 – 
September 2019)*

Bury cossette quality improvement 
(March 2017 – September 2018)*

Gas turbine performance has been improved, leading to a 1% decrease in carbon 
emissions (10,407 tCO2e).

A switch from heavy fuel oil to natural gas at this site, leading to a 0.1% decrease in carbon 
emissions (1,422 tCO2e).

Slicer machines were replaced with newer models allowing for higher quality cossette and 
lower water usage leading in turn to less process water for sugar extraction and lower 
evaporation demand. This has led to a 2% decrease in carbon emissions (20,242 tCO2e).

*  All emission decreases are against the 2017/18 baseline.

All of the above projects were selected in alignment with ABF Sugar’s short-term focus on energy reduction, energy efficiency and 
smaller fuel switching projects. These have included projects that enable the reduction of steam usage in the factory and fuel 
reduction in our animal feed dryers. By minimising our factories’ energy demand in the near-term, this will enable ABF Sugar to deploy 
technological and larger fuel-switching projects in the medium- to long-term. 

There is a strong pipeline of accretive GHG reduction projects. Each ABF Sugar business has its own environmental plan which has 
been categorised between short- and long-term.

Short term (present to 2025)
•  UK: Projects focus on smaller factory energy efficiency/steam 
reduction, coal elimination and reduction of energy use for 
pulp drying.

Medium and long term (2026 to 2050)
•  UK: Projects focus on technological advancements for factory 
energy efficiency/steam reduction and alternate pulp drying 
technologies.

•  Africa: Projects focus on energy efficiency and coal 
elimination/reduction in South Africa and green cane 
harvesting.

•  Spain: Projects focus on factory energy efficiency and 
automation as well as a specific project in Guadalete.

•  Africa: Projects are aligned to those in the short term, but the 

technology is yet to be developed.

•  Spain: Projects focus on alternative fuel projects, but current 

regulations present a challenge at this point in time.

ABF Sugar has reported an overall 24% reduction in absolute 
Scope 1 and 2 emissions for 2023 against 2018. Please refer to 
page 92 of the 2023 Responsibility Report for further detail. ABF 
Sugar is on track to achieve its carbon reduction goal of 30% 
absolute reduction by 2030.

CLIMATE-RELATED FINANCIAL DISCLOSURES (TCFD) CONTINUED

Primark
Governance
The overall responsibility for the Primark transition plan lies with 
Primark’s Chief Financial Officer. The Director of Primark Cares 
and Head of Environmental Sustainability work with the Chief 
Financial Officer to implement the plan.

Primark has established dedicated forums for the governance of 
its decarbonisation strategy (transition plan), which fall under the 
broader Primark Cares governance structure. In particular, these 
forums engage key stakeholders across the business, including 
board members, and cover related climate commitments, 
GHG emissions reduction roadmaps and any relevant risks 
or opportunities identified. For additional information, please 
refer to the Primark Sustainability and Ethics report, 
‘Governance’ section.

Additional ad-hoc meetings with the corporate centre have been 
held in this first year of reporting on transition plans to ensure 
alignment across the Group.

Climate related targets are included in the personal performance 
incentive assessment of senior management.

Risk management
The Primark Chief Executive and Chief Financial Officer are 
accountable for effective management of physical and transition 
climate-related risks.

Last year the impact of climate risks and opportunities on 
Primark was assessed by the Group using scenario analysis. 
Primark has incorporated this analysis on transition risks into its 
own risk management process to ensure that no risks are 
omitted. Risks are identified and assessed through various 
means. Workshops with internal stakeholders are held focusing 
on the identification, assessment and management of climate 
and nature-related risks.

Primark’s baseline emissions (2018)

Strategy, metrics and targets
In 2021, Primark set an overarching objective to halve absolute 
carbon emissions across its value chain by 2030, from a base 
year of 2018. In defining a roadmap to realise this ambition, 
Primark has focussed on key priority areas across all emission 
scopes for the short term (up to 2025) and medium term 
(up to 2030).

Short-term goals focus on maintaining current certifications, 
developing strategies for heat decarbonisation and energy 
efficiency. Medium-term goals focus on product-specific 
initiatives. Long-term goals are yet to be defined. Development 
of technology and innovations gaps in the market are constraints 
in defining long-term goals. We will evolve these goals as these 
needs are met and as the business evolves. 

These goals have been set in line with the Science Based 
Targets Initiative (‘SBTi’). Primark’s emissions reduction target 
has been validated by the SBTi in 2023. 

At present, Primark has not included residual emissions 
neutralisation (“carbon offsetting”) in its transition planning. 
However, in alignment with industry standards, for its long-term 
ambition Primark will need to develop an approach to 
neutralising the residual emissions that will not be abated 
through its emissions reduction strategy.

Key priority areas for action were identified on the basis of the 
influence and materiality of emissions categories, assessed 
from the base year of 2018 (see the diagram below). These are 
Scope 1 and 2 emissions, where the business has stronger 
influence, and the most significant Scope 3 categories in terms 
of absolute emissions.

Medium term (2026 – 2030)
•  Reduce absolute Scope 1 and 2 GHG emissions by 50% by 

2030, from a 2018/2019 baseline year.

Scope 3 emissions
Short term (present – 2025)
•  Launch an energy efficiency programme, engaging and 
supporting suppliers’ manufacturing facilities on energy 
demand reduction.

•  Launch a renewable energy programme, engaging and 

supporting suppliers’ manufacturing facilities on sourcing low 
carbon and renewable energy.

•  Optimise inbound transport modes to balance emissions, 

cost, and time.

•  Strengthen the durability of Primark’s clothes by 2025.

Medium term (2026 – 2030)
•  Develop all clothes to be recyclable by design by 2027.
•  Develop all clothes from recycled or sustainably sourced 

materials by 2030.

•  Further regenerative agricultural practices will be used in the 

Primark Sustainable Cotton Programme.

•  Eliminate single-use plastics and all non-clothing 

waste by 2027.

The selection and implementation process for these projects are 
included in Primark’s financial planning process. Each selected 
project undergoes a formal capital expenditure process where 
capital spend is involved.

Projects supporting carbon reduction to date
Since communicating its 2030 commitments in 2021, Primark has started several key projects focussed on the priority areas 
identified in the road map and using a pilot-learning-scale approach. Once at scale, these projects are expected to drive the bulk 
of Primark’s decarbonisation as they tackle the most material value chain emissions categories.

Project

Impact

Renewable energy 
procurement 
(Late 2022 
to present)

Own operations: Primark has signed renewable power contracts in seven countries, covering the UK and continental 
Europe. At the time of publishing this report, approximately 70% of stores were covered by a renewable or low-carbon 
electricity contract. However, as these contracts have come into operation at different times over the course of the 
year, their full benefit isn’t seen in the Scope 2 emissions reporting. Continuing its progress in the renewable power 
market is a key priority for Primark in the next year, alongside addressing Scope 1 emissions from onsite heating.

Supply chain: Primark has partnered with Ren Energy to help suppliers source and switch to energy from 
renewable sources.

Influencing customers on how to use Primark’s products is important to support the decarbonisation of its downstream 
value chain. Key behavioural drivers to emissions reductions include reducing the number of washes, avoiding tumble 
drying and keeping clothes in active use for longer. Primark’s plan is to collaborate with customers and industry 
partners to advance our understanding and extend our sphere of influence. Over the last year, Primark has scaled 
its repair workshops further in the UK and Ireland, and introduced them in the Netherlands, Germany and France. 
To date, Primark has held 120 workshop sessions, offering more than 1,700 free places to customers and colleagues. 
To further maximise the reach of the repair workshops, Primark has created an online customer hub featuring 
easy-to-follow repair videos. 

Own operations: Primark is scaling the roll-out of an energy bureau to enable remote management of energy and 
greater visibility of energy use to manage demand more effectively. At year end, this covered more than 179 locations 
across the UK at year end. It allows the business to maintain sustainable store condition in an energy efficient manner.

Primark also launched a significant initiative to fit all stores with energy-efficient light fittings. Approximately 70% 
of Primark stores across eight markets are now powered by renewable or low-carbon electricity and 141 stores have 
switched to energy-efficient LED lighting.

Supply chain: Building on the learning of small-scale energy and water efficiency pilot projects conducted over years 
in China using the Apparel Impact Institutes (Aii) Clean by Design (CBD), Primark has now scaled its energy efficiency 
programmes to engage 57 factories in Bangladesh, China and Cambodia. Suppliers involved learn about more energy 
efficient practices and receive support on data collected and analyse to create their own emissions reduction action 
plan, while improving manufacturing processes. These programmes create improvements in factory operations by 
delivering training, guidance and workshops.

Primark has set a target to remove all single-use plastic by 2027 and estimates it has already removed and/or avoided 
more than 1 billion units of single-use plastic from its business in 2019.

(Late 2021 
to present)

Energy efficiency

(early 2021 
to present)

Packaging Centre 
of Excellence 
(2019 to present)

This year, there has been an overall increase of 11% in carbon 
emissions across the value chain against Primark’s baseline year 
2018/19. This is the result of an increased volume of material 
used to produce the products sold over that period. In the short 
term, this trend is likely to continue, but there will be a decline 

as Primark increases the use of more sustainably sourced 
materials across its product range and once the energy 
programmes being rolled out across the supply chain begin 
to deliver at scale.

PRINCIPAL RISKS AND UNCERTAINTIES

Managing our risks

Our approach to risk management
The delivery of our strategic objectives and the sustainable 
growth and long-term shareholder value of our business is 
dependent on effective risk management. We regularly face 
business uncertainties and it is through a structured approach to 
risk management that we are able to mitigate and manage 
these risks and embrace opportunities when they arise. 
These disciplines remain effective as the global environment 
continues to be uncertain in the face of increasingly complex 
global economic, geopolitical and environmental challenges. 
As a result of these, together with ongoing inflationary pressures, 
cost-of-living remains a real issue for consumers across a 
number of the markets in which we operate.

The diversified nature of our operations, geographical reach, 
assets and currencies are important factors in mitigating the 
risk of a material threat to the Group’s sustainable growth 
and long-term shareholder value. However, as with any 
business, risks and uncertainties are inherent in our business 
activities. These risks may have a financial, operational and 
reputational impact.

The Board is accountable for effective risk management, 
for agreeing the principal, including emerging risks facing the 
Group and ensuring these are successfully managed. The Board 
undertakes a robust annual assessment of the principal risks 
that would threaten the business model, future performance, 
solvency or liquidity. The Board also monitors the Group’s 
exposure to risks as part of the business performance 
reviews at each Board meeting, providing the Board with 
an opportunity to discuss risk mitigation actions with divisional 
senior management.

Our decentralised business model empowers the management 
of our businesses to identify, evaluate and manage the risks 
they face, on a timely basis, to ensure each business’s 
compliance with relevant legislation, our business principles 
and Group policies.

Our businesses perform risk assessments which consider 
materiality, risk controls and specific local risks that are relevant 
to the markets in which they operate. The collated risks from 
each business are shared with the respective divisional 
chief executives who present their divisional risks to the 
Group Executive.

Emerging risks are identified and considered at both a Group 
and business unit level, with key management being close to 
their markets and geographies. These risks are identified as 
part of the overall risk management process through a variety 
of horizon-scanning methods including: geopolitical insights; 
ongoing assessments of competitor activity and market factors; 
workshops and management meetings focused on risk 
identification; analysis of existing risks using industry knowledge 
and experience to understand how these risks may affect us 
in the future; and representation and participation in key 
industry associations.

The Group’s Director of Financial Control receives the risk 
assessments on an annual basis and, with the Finance Director, 
reviews and challenges them with the divisional chief 
executives on an individual basis.

These discussions are wide-ranging and consider operational, 
environmental and other external risks. These risks and their 
impact on business performance are reported during the 
year and are considered as part of the monthly management 
review process.

Group functional heads including Legal, Treasury, Tax, IT, 
Pensions, HR, Procurement and Insurance also provide input to 
this process, sharing with the Director of Financial Control their 
view of key risks and what activities are in place or planned to 
mitigate them. A combination of these perspectives together 
with the business risk assessments creates a consolidated view 
of the Group’s risk profile. A summary of these risk assessments 
is then shared and discussed with the Finance Director and 
Chief Executive at least annually.

The Director of Financial Control holds meetings with each 
of the non-executive directors seeking their feedback on the 
reviews performed and discussing the key risks, which include 
emerging risks, and mitigating activities identified through the 
risk assessment exercise. Once all non-executive directors have 
been consulted, a Board report is prepared summarising the 
full process and providing an assessment of the status of risk 
management across the Group. The key risks, mitigating 
controls and relevant policies are summarised and the Board 
confirms the Group’s principal risks.

These are the risks which could prevent ABF from delivering 
our strategic objectives. This report also details when formal 
updates relating to the key risks will be provided to the Board 
throughout the year.

Key areas of focus this year
Effective risk management processes and 
internal controls
We continued to seek improvements in our risk management 
processes to ensure the quality and integrity of information 
and the ability to respond swiftly to direct risks. During the year, 
the Audit Committee on behalf of the Board conducted reviews 
on the effectiveness of the Group’s risk management processes 
and internal controls in accordance with the 2018 UK Corporate 
Governance Code. Our approach to risk management and 
systems of internal control is in line with the recommendations 
in the Financial Reporting Council’s (FRC) revised guidance 
‘Risk management, internal control and related financial and 
business reporting’.

The Board is satisfied that internal controls were properly 
maintained and that principal and emerging risks are being 
appropriately identified and managed.

Geopolitical uncertainty, Russia’s ongoing war 
in Ukraine and the potential for escalation of the conflict 
in Gaza
The ongoing Russian war in Ukraine continues to drive economic 
uncertainty in almost all of the markets in which we operate.

Whilst during the year, we have seen a reduction in energy 
prices and sea freight costs, which are significant costs for ABF, 
the ongoing situation remains volatile and could result in supply 
chain disruption.

We remain cognisant of the significant impacts that would 
result from an escalation in the war in Ukraine, particularly 
if western governments’ support for Ukraine were to waver. 

Russia’s suspension of the Ukraine grain export agreement 
in July 2023 could result in tensions and further inflation in the 
medium-term. Our management teams continue to work closely 
with suppliers to secure raw materials, maintain production and 
provide a reliable supply to our customers.

Escalation of recent events in Gaza could have further 
inflationary pressures, particularly on energy. In addition, there 
could potentially be wider implications for global logistics and 
supply chains. 

Cost of living
Recent global financial data shows that several European 
economies in which we operate tipped into recession in 
recent months and a prolonged period of stagnation is a real 
possibility. This would increase consumer debt problems, 
resulting in increasing costs of living and putting additional 
strain on household budgets. 

Whilst consumer spending has proven to be more resilient than 
anticipated at the start of the financial year, household budgets 
continue to face real pressures as a result of high inflation and 
interest rates and general economic uncertainty. This means that 
some consumers are having to make challenging and difficult 
choices in respect of what they spend and where they spend it.

We continue to offer safe, nutritious and affordable food and 
affordable, quality clothes to our customers. Primark’s cost 
leadership position continues to be attractive to the customer. 
In the food businesses, there is an increasing demand for 
private label products.

All of our businesses have developed strategies considering 
the potential changes in both end consumer and our customer 
behaviours and demands, the implications for the business 
and where investment or changes to business models may 
be appropriate.

The medium-term impact on our businesses will depend on 
the extent of government intervention and the duration of any 
economic downturns.

Regulatory changes
Our businesses continue to face a large number of regulatory 
changes with ever increasing complexity and variations in 
requirements across the markets in which we operate. 
For example, the EU’s Corporate Sustainability Reporting 
Directive (CSRD) requiring EU-incorporated companies and 
certain other companies with operations in the EU to publicly 
disclose and report on environmental, social affairs 
and governance issues, the new German Supply Chain Due 
Diligence Act (LkSG), and changes to data privacy laws.

The extent of change will have an impact on the capacity of 
management at a time when they are dealing with the ongoing 
challenges resulting from economic uncertainty, alongside the 
day-to-day growth of our businesses.

Environmental, Social and Governance
ABF has an ambition to continue to make food and clothes 
available and affordable and to achieve net zero by 2050 or sooner.

Environmental factors, including the potential implications of 
climate change within our businesses and their supply chains, 
are considered as part of the risk management framework and 
they also frame opportunities for our businesses. Our culture 
and values, and particularly our devolved decision-making 
model, empowers our teams to make the right judgements 
in assessing and mitigating risks related to climate change.

Where relevant, third-party experts have been engaged to 
perform scenario analyses and in-depth risk assessments which 
form the basis of strategies to mitigate the material risks.

Our local management teams have demonstrated their ability 
to respond quickly and make decisions that make sense to 
their businesses when extreme climate-related events occur. 
For example, in response to adverse weather conditions which 
resulted in significantly lower beet yields from the 2022/23 crop, 
British Sugar moved swiftly to secure alternative sources of 
supply. Similarly, our Africa sugar business, Illovo, has been 
significantly impacted by floods in Mozambique and Malawi, 
and is investing in a variety of irrigation and drainage projects 
to reduce the impact climate has on sugar yields.

Leaders across ABF are also empowered to implement 
responsible business practices to further reduce our negative 
impact on the environment, such as the sustainable use of 
natural resources, sourcing responsible packaging and our use 
of plastic, as well as reducing carbon emissions. Each of our 
businesses has prioritised resources to those environmental 
factors which are of greatest relevance and will make the 
greatest long-term difference.

The Board has overall responsibility for overseeing ESG factors 
across ABF. On a regular basis, the Board conducts a review of 
each of our business segments, including a review of significant 
ESG issues.

Divisional chief executives have responsibility and are 
accountable for their ESG programmes, as well as for risks, 
opportunities and impacts in their divisions. They can draw on 
support from the Corporate Responsibility Hub and the Director 
of Legal Services and Company Secretary, the CPPO as well as 
specialist legal advice from the team led by the Associate 
General Counsel for ESG. The leaders of our businesses are 
also challenged by the centre through detailed reviews of the 
Group’s environmental performance, health and safety 
performance, and its diversity, equity and inclusion and 
workforce engagement programmes.

Our principal risks and uncertainties
The directors have carried out an assessment of the principal 
risks facing ABF, including emerging risks, that would threaten 
our business model, future performance, solvency or liquidity.

Outlined below are the Group’s principal risks and uncertainties 
and the key mitigating activities in place to address them. These 
are the principal risks of the Group as a whole and are not in any 
order of priority.

ABF is exposed to a variety of other risks related to a range of 
issues such as human resources and the attraction, development 
and retention of people, community relations, the regulatory 
environment and competition. These are managed as part of the 
risk process and a number of these are referred to in our 2023 
Responsibility Report. Here, we report the principal risks which 
we believe are likely to have the greatest current or near-term 
impact on our strategic and operational plans and reputation.

They are grouped into external risks, which may occur in the 
markets or environment in which we operate, and operational 
risks, which are related to internal activity linked to our own 
operations and internal controls.

The ‘Changes since 2022’ describe our experience and activity 
over the last year.

PRINCIPAL RISKS AND UNCERTAINTIES CONTINUED

External risks

Operating in global markets 

Context and potential impact
Associated British Foods operates in 55 countries with sales 
and supply chains in many more. For example, Primark has a 
complex supply chain, which is dependent on supplies from 
countries including China, Bangladesh, India and Turkey. We are 
therefore exposed to global market forces; fluctuations in 
national economies; societal unrest and geopolitical uncertainty; 
a range of consumer trends; evolving legislation; and changes 
made by our competitors.

The ongoing Russian war in Ukraine continues to drive 
economic uncertainty in almost all of the markets in which 
we operate.

Failure to recognise and respond to any of these factors could 
directly impact the profitability of our operations.

Entering new markets is a risk to any business.

Mitigation
Our approach to risk management incorporates potential 
short-term market volatility and evaluates longer-term socio-
economic and political scenarios. The Group’s financial control 
framework and Board-adopted tax and treasury policies require 
all businesses to comply fully with relevant local laws.

Provision is made for known issues based on management’s 
interpretation of country-specific tax law, EU cases and 
investigations on tax rulings and their likely outcomes.

By their nature socio-political events are largely unpredictable. 
Nonetheless our businesses have detailed contingency plans 
which include site-level emergency responses and improved 
security for employees.

In the event of a major geo-political event that disrupts 
Primark’s supply chain, in the short-term the risk would be 
partially mitigated as we have several weeks of stock in 
warehouses and relatively long lead times, whilst alternative 
sourcing strategies are implemented. 

We engage with governments, local regulators and community 
organisations to contribute to, and anticipate, important changes 

Fluctuations in commodity and energy prices 

in public policy. We conduct rigorous checks when entering 
or commencing business activities in new markets.

Our management teams continue to both monitor where 
products and raw materials are sourced from and work closely 
with suppliers to secure raw materials, maintain production and 
provide a reliable supply to our customers.

Changes since 2022
Whilst during the second half of the year, we have seen 
a reduction in energy prices and sea freight costs, which are 
significant costs for ABF, the ongoing war in Ukraine means 
that there is still a level of volatility in energy prices and a risk 
of further supply chain disruption. Russia’s suspension of the 
Ukraine grain export agreement in July 2023 could result in 
further inflation in the medium term. An escalation of the recent 
hostilities in Gaza and the potential wider implications for the 
global economy are being closely monitored.

Recent global financial data shows that several European 
economies in which we operate tipped into recession in recent 
months and a prolonged period of stagnation is a real possibility. 
This would increase consumers’ debt problems and put 
additional strain on household budgets.

Geopolitical tensions continue to arise in a number of countries 
in which we operate and this is having an impact on sourcing 
and supplier management. For example, Primark are working 
through a responsible exit plan in consultation with partners 
and stakeholders in Myanmar and globally, in line with the 
UN Guiding Principles on Business and Human Rights and the 
ACT (Action, Collaboration and Transformation Responsible 
Exit Guidelines). Since the announcement to stop sourcing from 
Myanmar, Primark has doubled the size of its ethical team in 
its remaining sourcing locations enabling an increased number 
of supplier factory audits.

High inflation continues to be a challenge for our yeast and 
bakery ingredients businesses based in Argentina and Turkey.

The impact of the COVID-19 pandemic on our businesses has 
been negligible in the past year, now that restrictions have 
largely been removed, particularly in China.

Context and potential impact
Changes in commodity and energy prices can have a material 
impact on the Group’s operating results, asset values 
and cash flows.

Changes since 2022
A number of our food and agriculture businesses have 
experienced increased input costs driven by the appreciation 
of energy and agricultural commodity prices in the financial year.

Mitigation
The Group purchases a wide range of commodities in the 
ordinary course of business. We constantly monitor the markets 
in which we operate and manage certain exposures with 
exchange traded contracts and hedging instruments.

The commercial implications of commodity price movements 
are continuously assessed and, where appropriate, are reflected 
in the pricing of our products.

Energy prices, particularly in the first half of the year in UK and 
Europe, increased materially as a result of significant market 
uncertainty and supply concerns. Whilst wholesale energy 
prices have reduced from the peak, the market continues 
to experience levels of volatility. Businesses continue 
to manage commodity price risk under their existing risk 
management frameworks and, where appropriate, reflect 
this in pricing of products.

Movement in exchange rates

Context and potential impact
Associated British Foods is a multinational Group with 
operations and transactions in many currencies.

Changes in exchange rates give rise to transactional exposures 
within the businesses and to translation exposures when the 
assets, liabilities and results of overseas entities are translated 
into sterling upon consolidation.

Mitigation
Our businesses constantly review their currency exposures and 
their hedging instruments and, where necessary, ensure 
appropriate actions are taken to manage the impact of currency 
movements.

Board-approved policies require businesses to hedge all 
transactional currency exposures and committed long-term 
supply or purchase contracts which are denominated in a 
foreign currency, using foreign exchange forward contracts. 
Cash balances and borrowings are largely maintained in the 
functional currency of the local operations.

Health and nutrition

Context and potential impact
Failure to adapt to changing consumer health choices or to 
address nutrition concerns in the formulation of our products, 
related to consumer preferences or government public health 
policies, could result in a loss of consumer base and impact 
business performance. We have provided a detailed breakdown 
of our UK Grocery product portfolio in the context of nutrition 
within the ABF Responsibility Report.

Mitigation
All of our food businesses are individually responsible for 
managing their product portfolio. Consumer preferences, 
regulation and market trends are monitored continually. 
Recipes are regularly reviewed and, where technically feasible, 
are considered for reformulation to improve their overall 
nutritional value.

All of our grocery products are labelled with nutritional 
information, including in many cases front of pack nutrition 
labelling on our branded grocery products.

We actively consider consumer health in the context of brand 
development and merger and acquisition activity.

Changes since 2022
On average, sterling has weakened against most of our trading 
currencies this year, resulting in an operating profit gain on 
translation of £17m.

Primark covers its currency exposure on purchases of 
merchandise denominated in foreign currencies at the time of 
placing orders, with an average tenor of Primark’s hedging 
activity of between three and four months. There was a 
negative transactional effect from the appreciation of the US 
dollar exchange rate against both sterling and euro on Primark’s 
largely dollar-denominated purchases for the year.

There has been a high level of volatility in sterling exchange rates 
against our major trading currencies during the financial year. 
This has been driven by the impacts and varying global responses 
to high inflation and increasing interest rates impacting 
economic growth output.

We invest in research with experts to improve our 
understanding of the science and societal trends. Both ABF UK 
Grocery and British Sugar support the charitable work of the 
British Nutrition Foundation to promote understanding of 
nutrition science in the context of healthy and sustainable diets.

Changes since 2022
Our Sugar and Grocery businesses have continued to focus on 
nutrition and health during the year to help consumers improve 
their diet.

Notable examples include AB World Foods, who have continued 
to roll out recipes with a reduction in fat, sugar and salt, and 
Jordans Dorset Ryvita who reduced the salt level in the Ryvita 
Thins range.

In addition to reformulating existing products, our businesses 
have launched a range of products with nutritional benefits 
including Dorset Cereals range of high in fibre, non-HFSS (high 
in fat, salt or sugar) porridges, Jordan’s non-HFSS No Added 
Sugar Granola and Westmill’s Elephant Rice Basmati Boost, the 
UK’s first fortified basmati with thiamin and iron.

PRINCIPAL RISKS AND UNCERTAINTIES CONTINUED

Operational risks

Workplace health and safety 

Context and potential impact
Our operations have the potential for loss of life or workplace 
injuries to employees and contractors, both on-site and off-site, 
if the hazards and associated risks are not fully controlled.

Mitigation
Safety continues to be one of our main priorities. The chief 
executives of each business, who lead by example, are 
accountable for the safety performance of their business.

Our Health, Safety and Wellbeing Policy makes it very clear that 
we require the businesses to make improvements to safety 
year on year, and to make sure that we understand the hazards 
and risks of our activities and have in place appropriate controls.

We have an external independent safety audit programme 
to verify implementation of safety management and support 
a culture of continuous improvement.

Best practice safety guidance is shared across the businesses, 
coordinated from the corporate centre, to supplement the 
delivery of their own programmes.

Product safety and quality 

Context and potential impact
As a leading food manufacturer and retailer, it is vital that we 
manage the safety and quality of our products throughout the 
supply chain.

Mitigation
Product safety is put before economic considerations.

We operate strict food safety and traceability policies within an 
organisational culture of hygiene and product safety to ensure 
consistently high standards in our operations and in the sourcing 
and handling of raw materials and garments.

Food quality and safety audits are conducted across all our 
manufacturing sites, by independent third parties and 
customers, and a due diligence programme is in place to ensure 
the safety of our retail products.

Our sites comply with international food safety and quality 
management standards and our businesses conduct regular 
mock product incident exercises.

This guidance addresses our critical risks of moving vehicle 
interactions, falls of people and materials from height, 
machinery safety, confined spaces, electrical safety and 
management of contractors, as well as addressing the more 
common, but less severe, injuries from manual handling and 
from slips and trips.

Changes since 2022
The safety performance of the Group is reported in the 2023 
Responsibility Report at www.abf.co.uk/responsibility.

We are deeply saddened to report that in the year there were 
three work-related fatalities: two to employees, both on-site, 
and one to a contractor off-site. They occurred in Australia, 
Spain and Africa. Our businesses have conducted thorough 
root cause analyses, have implemented safety changes and 
communicated the findings to the other businesses.

This year just under £42m was invested in reducing the safety 
and health risks across a wide range of operational hazards. 

All businesses set clear expectations of suppliers, with relevant 
third-party certification or other assessment a condition of 
doing business. Product testing and trials are undertaken as 
required and where bespoke raw materials are purchased, the 
businesses will work closely with the supplier to ensure quality 
parameters are suitably specified and understood.

All Primark’s products are tested to, and must meet, stringent 
product safety specifications in line with and, in some instances 
above, legal requirements.

Primark continues to drive and improve product performance 
for quality and compliance purposes through its product 
approval processes, in-country inspection centres and 
management of its supply base.

Changes since 2022
We had no major product recalls during the year. 
There have been a very small number of product recalls that 
have been managed and monitored as part of our normal 
course of business.

Businesses have continued to define and refine KPIs 
in this area.

Breaches of IT and information security 

Context and potential impact
To meet employee, customer, consumer and supplier needs, 
our IT infrastructure needs to be flexible, reliable and secure to 
allow us to interact through technology.

Our delivery of efficient and effective operations is enhanced 
using relevant technologies and the sharing of information. 
We are therefore subject to potential cyber-threats such as 
social engineering attacks, computer viruses and the loss 
or theft of data.

There is the potential for disruption to operations from data 
centre failures, IT malfunctions or external cyber-attacks.

Mitigation
There is an ongoing programme of investment in both 
technology and people to enhance the longevity of our IT 
environments for both on-site and remote working. This ongoing 
investment includes the control and protection of the IT and 
manufacturing environments being provided.

To support our employees in our campaign against phishing and 
social engineering attacks we have invested in cyber security 
solutions that prevent the majority of attacks from reaching our 
employees. We continue to educate through user awareness 
training programmes to help further reduce the likelihood of our 
employees falling victim to such attacks. We measure and 
report on these campaigns and training programmes regularly.

We have established Group IT security policies, technologies 
and processes, all of which are subject to regular internal audit.

Our supply chain and ethical business practices

Access to sensitive data is restricted and closely monitored.

Robust disaster recovery plans are in place for business-critical 
applications and are adequately tested.

Cyber incident response testing is done at all levels of the 
business to ensure we have adequate and effective processes 
to respond to a cyber incident.

Technical security controls are in place over key IT platforms 
with the Chief Information Security Officer tasked with 
identifying and responding to potential security risks.

Changes since 2022
As cybersecurity risks evolve, we continue to invest in our 
security capabilities at a Group level and across the businesses 
allowing us to more effectively detect, respond to and recover 
from disruptive cyber-threats.

We have improved and developed the existing disciplines to 
ensure that user devices and applications are regularly patched 
and upgraded to reflect emerging IT security threats.

During the year we have reviewed, tested and refined our cyber 
security ransomware response plan at the Group level.

We have developed an operational technology security strategy 
and policy to further protect our manufacturing and supply 
chain functions.

Due to the fast-paced growth of AI and its potential uses in our 
organisation, we created an AI policy and guidelines to support 
the adoption of this technology in a safe and secure manner. 

Context and potential impact
We have a global diverse business with complex supply chains 
most of which depend on agriculture and manufacturing.

Our UK Grocery businesses monitor their supply chains and 
engage suppliers through the use of the Sedex (Supplier Ethical 
Data Exchange) online database.

The most critical risks in our supply chain are:

•  transparency of the source of raw materials and 
manufacturing locations in our supply chains;

•  the vulnerability of workers; and
•  ensuring we have the leverage and consistency in our 
approach to due diligence to prevent, avoid or mitigate 
negative social and environmental impacts that may arise.

Mitigation
ABF’s Supplier Code of Conduct, which all businesses are 
required to implement, is based on the International Labour 
Organization’s (ILO) standards as well as the Ethical Trading 
Initiative’s Base Code. We have developed online training 
modules to facilitate both internal awareness across the Group 
and to support knowledge of our approach and expectations 
amongst our suppliers.

Primark is a member of the Ethical Trading Initiative and is also 
recognised for its Ethical Trade and Environmental Sustainability 
programme. Its approach to due diligence is explained in its 
Supply Chain Human Rights Policy.

Many of our businesses monitor their risks through social audits 
carried out by internal teams or third parties. For example, 
Primark’s Ethical Trade auditing and monitoring programme 
is one of the most important resources for identifying risks. 

Our businesses work to understand the issues specific to the 
workers within their respective supply chains and where 
appropriate the communities in which they reside. For example, 
Twinings uses a comprehensive Community Needs 
Assessment Framework, developed in consultation with expert 
external stakeholders. In addition to labour rights, this 
framework covers housing, water and sanitation, health and 
nutrition, land, gender and children’s rights, farming practices 
and more.

Some of our businesses – including Primark, Twinings and ABF 
Sugar – publish global sourcing maps and provide information 
about their processes, progress and challenges through 
corporate reports, websites, stakeholder engagement activities 
and submissions to benchmarks. This helps our understanding 
of human rights risks and, where necessary, supports 
collaboration both locally and across our sectors.

PRINCIPAL RISKS AND UNCERTAINTIES CONTINUED

Our supply chain and ethical business practices continued

The impact of climate change and natural disasters on our operations 

Context and potential impact
Our businesses and their supply chains rely on a secure supply 
of finite natural resources, some of which are vulnerable to 
external factors such as natural disasters and climate change. 
Climate change continues to represent a material risk 
throughout our supply chains and poses challenges to some of 
our businesses. Many of our businesses rely on agricultural 
crops with complex supply chains. Long-term climate change 
will impact agricultural crops and workers while extreme 
weather events have the potential to cause disruption to supply 
chains and operations.

For example, extreme adverse weather conditions in the UK 
resulted in significantly lower beet yields from the 2022/23 crop; 
British Sugar therefore moved swiftly to secure alternative 
sources of supply. 

Also, our Mozambique operation was seriously impacted by 
severe flooding which resulted in the destruction of over 98% 
of the sugar cane crop.

In our assessment of climate-related business risks we 
recognise that the cumulative impacts of changes in weather 
and water availability could affect our operations at a Group 
level. However, the diversified and devolved nature of the 
Group means that mitigation or adaptation strategies are 
considered and implemented by the individual businesses.

Some of our businesses have continued to work with third-party 
experts to understand climate-related risks and opportunities. 
The most significant and material risks are incorporated into 
the business risk registers.

Mitigation
Determining the potential medium- to long-term impact 
of climate risks and opportunities is challenging as the impacts 
of climate change and governments’ responses to its threats 
are uncertain.

Our climate-related scenario analysis has identified business-
specific actions which are being overseen by the relevant 
businesses. Further information on our material climate-related 
risk mitigation activities is provided in the TCFD report on pages 
56 to 67.

Changes since 2022
Last year we met the requirements of Listing Rule 9.8.6R 
with TCFD disclosures in line with the 2017 TCFD framework. 
This year this has been expanded to include the 2021 
implementation guidance by including the transition plans for 
ABF Sugar and Primark as they contribute most significantly 
to adjusted operating profit and total reported GHG emissions.

Over the past year, our businesses have continued to 
implement specific projects which aim to reduce the impact of 
climate change and natural disasters on our businesses including:

•  Illovo Sugar is implementing a variety of irrigation and 
drainage projects across its African businesses; and

•  Primark is mobilising a specialist engineering team to support 
the development of a pilot approach in Bangladesh to support 
supplier factories to assess and mitigate flood risk.

For details on the scenario analysis, transition plans, and our risk 
management and materiality assessment approach, refer to the 
2023 TCFD report and 2023 Responsibility Report.

In line with our Group Code of Conduct, our businesses prohibit 
all forms of modern slavery, including forced labour and human 
trafficking. For more information, see our Group Modern Slavery 
Statement 2023.

Changes since 2022
Our Modern Slavery Statement 2023, together with the 
businesses’ due diligence activities across our supply chains, 
are reported on our website and in the 2023 Responsibility 
Report at www.abf.co.uk/responsibility.

In November 2022, the EU formally adopted the Corporate 
Sustainability Reporting Directive (CSRD) requiring companies 
operating in the EU to publicly disclose and report on 
environmental, social affairs and governance issues. Through 
the established ESG Steering Committee, the Group has a 
number of activities to prepare for the inception of the CSRD 
reporting requirements, including the European Sustainability 
Reporting Standards (ESRSs) and the EU Taxonomy.

As result of the Directive certain EU companies within the 
Group will be required to publish mandatory sustainability 
information from 2025/26 onwards. From 2028/29 reporting 
under the CSRD will also need to cover the rest of the Group. 
The exact format and scope of reporting will depend upon 
transposition of EU law into the national laws of EU member 
states (which is due by July 2024) and on any equivalence 
arrangements put in place with the UK

Our UK Grocery division has established a central capability 
for monitoring and reporting upon supplier Self-Assessment 
Questionnaire (SAQ) completion, as well as the status of 
non-conformances identified within supplier audit reports. 
In addition, we have appointed an India-based corporate 
responsibility specialist to support Westmill Foods and AB 
World Foods to engage and support third-party businesses 
in their supply chains.

Our use of natural resources and managing our environmental impact 

Context and potential impact
We are reliant on a range of natural resources to deliver our 
products, and new processes and technologies have enabled us 
to become highly efficient at maximising the value that we can 
derive from them. Overall, our material environmental impacts 
come from: fuel and energy use; agricultural operations giving 
rise to GHG emissions; use of land related to agricultural 
operations; the abstraction and management of water and 
wastewater especially in water-stressed areas; and waste 
which is not yet eliminated at source, reused or recycled, 
including single-use plastics.

In addition to GHG emissions, our operations generate a range 
of other environmental impacts related to wastewater and 
waste which, if not controlled, could pose a risk to the 
environment and local communities, potentially creating risk to 
our licence to operate and resulting in additional costs.

Across countries where ABF businesses operate, there is 
increased regulatory scrutiny and ESG reporting requirements 
that we must meet. Remaining compliant with these 
requirements and being able to report accurate and robust data 
on our environmental impact, is a priority for the Group and to 
our businesses.

Mitigation
We recognise our role in transitioning to a low-carbon economy. 
We are targeting reductions in our GHG emissions through 
carbon reduction plans, energy efficiency and growing our use 
of renewable energy.

We continuously seek ways to improve the efficiency of our 
operations, using technologies and techniques to reduce our 
use of natural resources and minimise waste and the 
subsequent impact on the environment. We are also increasing 
our focus on capturing this data and being able to report in line 
with regulatory requirements.

We support the adoption of integrated farm management 
techniques and the responsible use of precision science and 
technology to maximise efficiency, reduce GHG emissions and 
limit biodiversity losses while maintaining commercially 
productive agricultural outputs.

Water is an essential input for clothing and food production. 
We remain aware that it is a valuable resource and our 
businesses aim to reduce the amount of water they abstract, to 
reuse process water as much as possible and to return treated 
wastewater to nature, having ensured it meets or exceeds local 
and national water standards, and protect aquatic ecosystems. 

Changes since 2022
The environmental performance of the Group is reported 
in the 2023 Responsibility Report and in our CDP 
submissions which can be found on the ABF website at

VIABILITY STATEMENT AND GOING CONCERN

Viability statement and going concern

The Group has a track record of delivering strong cash flows, 
with in excess of £1bn of operating cash being generated in 
each of the last ten years. This has been more than sufficient to 
meet not only our ongoing financing obligations but also to fund 
the Group’s expansionary capital investment.

Even in a worst-case scenario, with risks modelled to 
materialise simultaneously and for a sustained period, the 
possibility of the Group having insufficient resources to meet 
its financial obligations is considered remote. Based on this 
assessment, the directors confirm that they have a reasonable 
expectation that the Company will be able to continue in 
operation and meet its liabilities as they fall due over the 
three-year period to 12 September 2026.

Going concern
After making enquiries, the directors have a reasonable 
expectation that the Group has adequate resources to continue 
in operational existence for the foreseeable future. For this 
reason, they continue to adopt the going concern basis in 
preparing the consolidated financial statements. 

The forecast for the going concern assessment period to 
1 March 2025 has been updated for the business’s latest 
trading in October and is the best estimate of cashflow in the 
period. Having reviewed this forecast and having applied a 
downside sensitivity analysis and performed a reverse stress 
test, the directors consider it a remote possibility that the 
financial headroom could be exhausted.

The Board’s treasury policies are in place to maintain a strong 
capital base and manage the Group’s balance sheet and liquidity 
to ensure long-term financial stability. These policies are the 
basis for investor, creditor and market confidence and enable 
the successful development of the business. The financial 
leverage policy requires that, in the ordinary course of business, 
the Board prefers to see the Group’s ratio of net debt including 
lease liabilities to adjusted EBITDA to be well under 1.5x. At the 
end of this financial year, the financial leverage ratio was 1.0x 
and the Group had total cash of £1.5bn and an undrawn 
committed Revolving Credit Facility of £1.5bn.

In March 2023, S&P Global Ratings reaffirmed their assignment 
to the Group of an ‘A’ grade long-term issuer credit rating. The 
Group’s funding basis is supported by the existing £400m public 
bond due in 2034. Furthermore the Group’s committed 
Revolving Credit Facility is free of performance covenants and 
matures in 2028, with one 1-year extension option remaining 
(after the first was utilised during the year). The $100m of 
outstanding private placement notes are due in March 2024 
after which point Group funding will not be subject to financial 
performance covenants.

Viability statement
The directors have determined that the most appropriate period 
over which to assess the Company’s viability, in accordance 
with the 2018 UK Corporate Governance Code, is three years. 
This is consistent with the Group’s business model which 
devolves operational decision making to the businesses. 
Each business sets a strategic planning time horizon appropriate 
to its activities which are typically of a three to five year duration. 
The directors also considered the diverse nature of the Group’s 
activities and the degree to which the businesses change and 
evolve in the relatively short term.

The directors considered the Group’s profitability, cash flows 
and key financial ratios over this period and the potential impact 
that the Principal Risks and Uncertainties set out on pages 68 to 
75 could have on future performance, solvency or liquidity of the 
Group and its resilience to threats to its viability posed by severe 
but plausible scenarios. Building on the analysis performed as 
part of the going concern review, sensitivity analysis was 
applied to these metrics and the projected cash flows were 
stress tested against a range of scenarios.

The directors considered the level of performance that would 
cause the Group to exhaust its available liquidity, the financial 
implications of making any strategic acquisitions and a variety of 
additional potentially adverse factors including long-term 
reputational damage, macroeconomic influences such as 
fluctuations in commodity markets and climate-related business 
risks. Specific consideration has been given to the potential 
ongoing risks associated with the outlook for a potential global 
recession, reducing demand for goods in both the food 
businesses and Primark, and continuing inflationary cost 
pressures. The impact of potential mitigating actions under the 
Group’s control were also considered in this analysis. 

The Board’s treasury policies are in place to maintain a strong 
capital base and manage the Group’s balance sheet and liquidity 
to ensure long-term financial stability. These policies are the 
basis for investor, creditor and market confidence and enable 
the successful development of the business. The financial 
leverage policy requires that, in the ordinary course of business, 
the Board prefers to see the Group’s ratio of net debt including 
lease liabilities to adjusted EBITDA to be well under 1.5x. 
At the end of this financial year, the financial leverage ratio was 
1.0x and the Group had total cash of £1.5bn and an undrawn 
committed Revolving Credit Facility of £1.5bn.

In March 2023, S&P Global Ratings reaffirmed their assignment 
to the Group of an ‘A’ grade long-term issuer credit rating. 
The Group’s funding basis is supported by the existing £400m 
public bond due in 2034. Furthermore the Group’s committed 
Revolving Credit Facility is free of performance covenants and 
matures in 2028, with one 1-year extension option remaining 
(after the first was utilised during the year). 

The Group is highly diversified operating in 55 countries 
in different markets, sectors, customer groups, geographies 
and products. While the principal risks considered all have 
the potential to affect future performance, none of them are 
considered individually or collectively to threaten the viability 
of the Company for the period of the assessment. 

In reviewing the cash flow forecast for the period, the directors 
reviewed the trading for both Primark and the food businesses 
in light of the experience gained from events of the last three 
years of trading and emerging trading patterns. The directors 
have a thorough understanding of the risks, sensitivities and 
judgements included in these elements of the cash flow forecast 
and have a high degree of confidence in these cash flows.

As a downside scenario the directors considered the adverse 
scenario in which inflationary costs are not fully recovered, 
there are adverse foreign exchange impacts and there is a 
global recession, reducing demand for goods further than the 
base levels forecast. This downside scenario was modelled 
without taking any mitigating actions within their control. 
Under this downside scenario the Group forecasts liquidity 
throughout the period.

In addition, the directors also considered the circumstances 
which would be needed to exhaust the Group’s total liquidity 
over the assessment period – a reverse stress test. This 
indicates that, on top of the downside scenario outlined above, 
cost inflation would need to exceed £1.9bn without any price 
increases or other mitigating actions being taken before total 
liquidity is exhausted. The likelihood of these circumstances 
is considered remote for two reasons. Firstly, over such a 
period, management could take substantial mitigating actions, 
such as reviewing pricing, taking cost cutting measures and 
reducing capital investment. Secondly, the Group has significant 
business and asset diversification and would be able to, if it 
were necessary, dispose of assets and/or businesses to raise 
considerable levels of funds.

Chairman’s introduction

the executive directors and through annual updates by senior 
management of the businesses. This gives the Board the 
opportunity to provide effective guidance and 
constructive challenge.

On succession planning at Board level, earlier this year we 
announced that Ruth Cairnie would be relinquishing her roles as 
Senior Independent Director and as Chair of the Remuneration 
Committee and would not be standing for re-election at the next 
annual general meeting, having served on the Board since May 
2014. Dame Heather Rabbatts became Senior Independent 
Director and Graham Allan became Chair of the Remuneration 
Committee, both with effect from 1 May 2023. Ruth stepped 
down from the Board with effect from 31 August 2023. Ruth 
made a terrific contribution to our Board deliberations and she 
leaves with our grateful thanks. 

In February 2023, the Board was also pleased to welcome 
Eoin Tonge as a director, taking up the role of Finance Director 
with effect from 29 April 2023 after John Bason retired from the 
Board on 28 April 2023. In addition, Annie Murphy was appointed 
as a Non-Executive Director and as a member of the Audit and 
Remuneration Committees with effect from 6 September 2023. 
As announced in August 2023, Kumsal Bayazit will be appointed 
as a Non-Executive Director and as a member of the same 
Committees with effect from 1 December 2023. All directors 
will be standing for election or re-election at the annual general 
meeting. We look forward to working with our newest Board 
members and benefiting from the additional skills, insights and 
experience that they will undoubtedly bring.

We published our Board Diversity Policy in November 2022. I am 
pleased to report that, by the time of our annual general meeting, 
we will have met the commitments and aspirations around 
Board composition as set out in that policy, which reflect the 
new targets on gender and ethnic diversity in the Listing Rules. 
Further details are set out in the Nomination Committee Report.

Richard Reid continues in his role as our Non-Executive Director 
designated for engagement with the workforce and an update 
is provided in Richard’s letter on pages 84 and 85. Richard’s 
activities are a key way that we continue to assess and monitor 
culture, alongside directors’ visits to sites, business divisions’ 
updates to the Board on workforce engagement, input from our 
Speak Up programme and the annual talent review and update 
to the Board from the Chief People and Performance Officer.

Our four values, namely respecting everyone’s dignity, acting 
with integrity, progressing through collaboration and delivering 
with rigour, are illustrated through the various case studies 
in this Annual Report, through our Section 172 Statement 
on pages 40 to 45 and through the Responsibility section on 
pages 46 to 55. Further examples can be found in our 2023 
Responsibility Report, which is available on the Company’s 
website at: www.abf.co.uk/responsibility.

We will again hold a physical AGM in December 2023. As was 
the case last year, we will also stream the event online for those 
shareholders who are not able to attend in person. Please note, 
however, that you will not be able to vote or ask questions 
on the day if you do not attend in person, so please vote in 
advance by proxy and submit any questions in advance if you 
cannot attend. Details on how to do so are provided in the 
Notice of Annual General Meeting 2023. We look forward to 
seeing as many of you as possible on the day.

Our devolved decision-making model 
is a distinctive characteristic of ABF. 
This empowers management of our 
businesses to take decisions at the level we 
consider to be the most effective – in other 
words, closest to the markets, customers 
and stakeholders relevant to each business.

Dear fellow shareholders
I am pleased to present the Associated British Foods plc 
Corporate Governance Report for the year ended 
16 September 2023.

Your Company’s clear sense of purpose – to provide safe, 
nutritious and affordable food, and clothing that is great value 
for money – continues to stand us in good stead. Our conviction 
that businesses do well when they act well is ingrained 
throughout the Group and management continue to be 
encouraged to take a long-term view and to invest in the future. 
We give various examples throughout the Strategic Report 
of how we have invested in our food businesses and in the 
Primark retail estate.

We continue to operate a devolved decision-making model. 
This is a distinctive characteristic of ABF, and one which we 
believe empowers management of our businesses to take 
decisions at the level we consider to be the most effective. 
The senior management of the businesses are supported with 
resources and expertise from throughout the Group.

The Board continues to be kept informed about, and engages 
with, the individual businesses through regular updates by 

Compliance with the

CORPORATE GOVERNANCE CONTINUED

Board leadership and company purpose

The work of the Board during the year

The Board
The Board is collectively responsible to the Company’s 
shareholders for the direction and oversight of the Company 
to ensure its long-term success. This includes setting the 
Company’s purpose, which is described in the Strategic Report. 
The Board met regularly throughout the year, sometimes with 
individual members attending virtually, to approve the Group’s 
strategic objectives, to lead the Group within a framework 
of effective controls which enable risk to be assessed and 
managed, and to ensure that sufficient resources are available 
to meet the objectives set.

There are a number of matters which are specifically reserved 
for the Board’s approval. These are set out in a clearly defined 
schedule which is available to view on the corporate governance 
section of the Company’s website: www.abf.co.uk.

Certain specific responsibilities are delegated to the Board 
Committees, being the Nomination, Audit and Remuneration 
Committees, which operate within clearly defined terms of 
reference and report regularly to the Board. Membership of 
these Committees is reviewed annually. Minutes of Committee 
meetings are made available to all directors on a timely basis. 
For further details, please see the Reports of each of these 
Committees below.

Purpose, business model and strategy
The purpose of the Company is to provide safe, nutritious 
and affordable food, and clothing that is great value for money. 
A description of the Company’s business model for sustainable 
growth in support of this purpose is set out in the Group business 
model and strategy section on pages 9 to 13. This section 
provides an explanation of the basis on which the Group 
generates value and preserves it over the long term and its 
strategy for delivering its objectives. Our ‘Managing our risks’ 
section starting on page 68 provides details on how opportunities 
and risks to the future of the business have been considered.

Culture and values
At its simplest, our culture and our values (respecting 
everyone’s dignity, acting with integrity, progressing through 
collaboration, and delivering with rigour) centre around doing 
the right thing. Our devolved decision-making model empowers 
the people closest to the risks to make the right judgements 
to mitigate those risks and to find opportunities, but importantly 
with encouragement, engagement and support from the centre. 
That support can take the form of resources and expertise or 
it can be provided through challenge. We believe the route to 
enduring value creation lies in our focus on building objectives 
from the bottom up rather than from the top down.

Culture is monitored by the Board through a number of different 
approaches. Richard Reid’s work on workforce engagement, 
with the support of the Chief People and Performance Officer, 
is a key approach (and Richard’s letter on pages 84 and 85 sets 
out further detail on how Richard has engaged with the 
businesses during this financial year and the overarching 
themes of such engagement). This is supported by business 
presentations from senior management of each business 
division to the Board (which include information on safety 
performance and health and wellbeing initiatives, as well as 
the individual businesses’ workforce engagement initiatives, 
including results and outcomes). 

It is essential that the businesses not only engage with and 
assess culture within their workforce, but that they also respond 
and take action. Some of the initiatives that our businesses 
have taken arising from people surveys and other listening and 
engagement interactions, including examples of how we reward 
and invest in our workforce, are set out in Richard Reid’s letter 
on pages 84 and 85. 

In addition, directors have carried out other site visits and other 
engagement events, further details of which can be found 
on page 88. 

Whistleblowing
The Group’s Speak Up Policy contains arrangements for an 
independent external service provider to receive, in confidence 
(where legally permitted), reports of any inappropriate, improper, 
dishonest, illegal or dangerous behaviour for reporting to the 
Audit Committee as appropriate. The Audit Committee reviews 
reports and the actions arising from internal audit and reports 
on these to the Board.

The Audit Committee reports to the full Board on (or all Board 
members attend the relevant parts of the Audit Committee 
meeting to obtain details of) the analysis of reported allegations 
which is compiled by the Director of Financial Control. 
Arrangements are in place for proportionate and independent 
investigations of allegations and for follow-up action. 
Further details of the Speak Up Policy and processes in place, 
as well as information on the status of notifications received 
in the year to 31 May 2023 are provided on page 52.

Conflicts of interest procedure
The Company has procedures in place to deal with the situation 
where a director has a conflict of interest. As part of this 
process, the Board:

•  considers each conflict situation separately on its 

particular facts;

•  considers the conflict situation in conjunction with the rest of 
the conflicted director’s duties under the Companies Act 2006;
•  keeps records and Board minutes as to authorisations granted 

by directors and the scope of any approvals given; and

•  regularly reviews conflict authorisation.

Engagement with stakeholders
Our scale, employing approximately 133,000 people and 
with operations in 55 countries across the world, means that 
our activities matter to, or have an impact on, many people. 
As a result, the Company engages regularly with its stakeholders 
at Group and/or business level, depending on the particular issue.

At a Group level we engage with a variety of stakeholder groups 
including shareholders, governments, media and investors 
through a range of methods. As part of daily business activities 
and through structured processes, our businesses routinely 
engage with customers, suppliers, regulators and industry bodies.

More detail about our approach to stakeholder engagement 
and specific activities this year can be found on pages 40 to 45 
(which contain our Section 172 Statement on engaging with 
our stakeholders), pages 46 to 55 (on responsibility) and in the 
letter on pages 84 and 85 from Richard Reid, our Non-Executive 
Director for engagement with the workforce.

CORPORATE GOVERNANCE CONTINUED

Board leadership and company purpose continued

Non-Executive Director for engagement with the workforce

•  operations, commercial and management teams from 

Twinings Ovaltine in Andover and New Jersey;

•  employees from the Argo factory and the Chicago Head 

Office in ACH;

•  retail assistants, store supervisors, managers, and regional 

HR business partners at Primark’s Chicago store and at two 
different Primark stores in New Jersey;

•  employees across a range of teams and departments at SPI 

Pharma in Grand Haven, Michigan;

•  participants of the Thrive development programme at George 

Weston Foods businesses in Australia;

•  employees from operations and product merchandising from 

Tip Top in New South Wales, Australia;

•  a wide variety of employees from our Don business 

in regional Victoria, Australia; and

•  the team in our Yumi’s business based in Port Melbourne, 

Australia.

My visits also enable me to connect with our people through 
unions or other local collective arrangements, for example with 
the union representative for our Don business.

I am also grateful for the input from fellow Board members 
who have visited our businesses including Acetum, Illovo and 
Primark during the year.

I am struck by the openness and honesty I experience in all 
these discussions and the willingness of our people to actively 
participate in sharing views on what is going well and where 
there could be improvement. This is a testament to the cultures 
that our leaders have developed across the Group. Overarching 
themes from these discussions include that:

•  people enjoy their work, feel respected and deeply appreciate 

the accountability and empowerment that they have, 
consistent with the ABF devolved operating model;
•  people care about the work they do and feel cared for 

by our businesses;

•  people appreciate the culture and values, which are seen 
as being different from other organisations they have 
worked with;

•  people are appreciative of clear and consistent 

communications and that there is no such thing as too 
much communication;

•  the leaders of our businesses have increased the breadth 

and depth of communications in recent years, as our people 
value being kept informed on business progress and the 
opportunity for discussion; and

•  people value career development and progression, and there 

is real interest in understanding and pursuing career and 
development opportunities across the broader Group.

Further areas are beginning to emerge in discussions, for 
example, our people seeing the opportunity for greater use 
of technology to increase efficiency and effectiveness in the 
work environment.

In my visits and discussions, I specifically take the opportunity 
to understand if our people are aware of Speak Up, our policy to 
ensure there is a route beyond local management and leadership 
to raise concerns and issues. Speak Up is an important 
mechanism to ensure employees will always feel comfortable 
to raise concerns even in the most sensitive of situations. 
For more information on Speak Up, see page 52.

Richard Reid
Non-Executive Director

The success of our Group has people at its 
heart. The culture and processes across all our 
businesses ensure that employee voices, at all 
levels of the organisation, are encouraged and 
welcomed in their local teams through to Board 
discussions, and that their views and opinions 
are heard and acted upon.

The breadth and complexity of our Group, with our devolved 
operating model, requires all our leaders to connect with their 
people and teams, actively and attentively listening and 
responding to views or suggestions considering the local 
culture, workplace and style of operation. The Chief Executive 
sets the tone and expectations for this ongoing engagement 
with all our divisional chief executives and business leaders. 
My role as Non-Executive Director for engagement with the 
workforce is primarily to ensure processes are in place giving 
employees the opportunity to raise views, opinions, and 
concerns, and that the workforce understand how to access 
these channels and they are listened to when they do. It is also 
to interact with our leaders and businesses to test culture and 
engagement and bring back perspectives to the boardroom. 
While local cultures clearly vary across the world and we need 
to be sensitive to those, divisional chief executive officers also 
have responsibility to embed group-wide cultures across our 
businesses and this is an area of focus for the Board.

Since my last report I have spent face-to-face time with our 
people in their offices, factories, stores, and out in the field. 
In these discussions I have been able to understand how 
they view our Group and their specific business and location. 
I have spoken with:

The visits are only one part of the ABF approach to workforce 
engagement. In addition:

•  workforce engagement across the Group is discussed in 

depth at two of the Board meetings, with the Chief People 
and Performance Officer presenting a groupwide view of 
progress, including metrics, process enhancements, and 
highlighting the ‘we asked, you said, we listened, we did’ 
feedback loop case studies from across the Group. During 
these discussions we identify areas of ongoing enhancement 
which are taken back to the businesses. This year for example, 
we identified a further focus on colleagues who work in 
factories and stores, including relationships with unions;
•  every Board meeting also includes divisional chief executive 

presentations covering workforce engagement within 
their businesses; this ensures all areas of the Group are 
reviewed in depth during the year. I continue to be in regular 
discussion with our divisional chief executives and people and 
performance/HR directors across all segments for the Group. 
I speak with them after their formal presentations to discuss 
areas of interest or concern and to share insights for my 
discussions with their people;

•  we have an annual Board session focused on talent, 

succession and progress on inclusion;

•  twice a year the Chief Executive and Chief People and 
Performance Officer have in-depth discussions on 
organisation and talent that include workforce engagement 
with each divisional chief executive and people and 
performance/HR director; and

•  the divisional people and performance/HR directors, facilitated 

by the Chief People and Performance Officer, also come 
together regularly to learn and share with each other across 
a variety of topics, including workforce engagement.

A vast number of our businesses use engagement surveys to 
gather feedback from their people, through a variety of global 
partners such as Willis Towers Watson, Workday Peakon and 
Gallup. Close to 90% of our businesses use engagement 
surveys regularly, often annually or more frequently. In the 
businesses that have run their surveys this year, 85% of our 
people were invited to participate with response rates at almost 
70%. The insights and actions that flow from these surveys are 
part of the data presented to the Board on a regular basis. I was 
pleased to see that, of the businesses running their engagement 
surveys this year, almost 90% showed favourable engagement 
scores at or above 70%.

In line with our focus areas shared in last year’s report, we have 
widened our understanding of workforce engagement, through 
introducing engagement surveys to new parts of the Group 
or through expanding the reach of existing surveys to more 
employees. Local technological, legal and cultural norms do still 
present challenges for a full rollout of engagement surveys in all 
countries, but we expect our leaders to find appropriate ways to 
understand workforce engagement and take action to enhance 
it further for all our employees in the year ahead.

I am pleased to see the feedback loop in action, with 
businesses acting on the voice of their employees through 
their employee engagement surveys, listening groups or 
through the insights I can share from my visits and discussions. 
Examples include:

•  the ABF Centre leadership held a ‘Strength through 

Difference’ workshop to explore ways to ensure even greater 
inclusion among the corporate centre teams;

•  the Managing Director of our ABF Sugar business in Eswatini 

invited colleagues from operations teams to day visits in 
the head office to learn more about the wider business. 
This followed on from discussions I had with them when 
I visited them at the end of the last financial year;

•  in response to employee feedback, that was shared in 

discussion sessions with me, Twinings Ovaltine held global 
town hall sessions, to provide its employees with greater 
understanding and clarity of areas of the business beyond 
their own;

•  our grocery business Acetum has enhanced its benefits for 
shift workers and provided a communal lunchroom and 
subsidised meals for all their employees based on feedback 
and requests from their employees and union discussions;
•  to promote an open workplace, AB Mauri’s Global Baking 

Ingredients business has introduced a number of 
mechanisms to support communication and connections 
across their teams, including suggestion boxes, town halls, 
team-building games, appreciation workshops, family days, 
newsletters and lunch with leaders;

•  AB Agri has further developed its wellbeing offering including 
using Nudge to support financial education and wellbeing, 
creating spaces for social wellbeing, plus raising awareness 
through recognising World WellBeing Week; and

•  Primark has developed a new approach to ensure it is 

responding promptly to employee feedback. Themes from 
its regular engagement surveys are fed into the centres 
of excellence or its global teams, where local managers and 
people and culture business partners develop and implement 
local action plans at a store or team level. 

In summary, from my work over the last 12 months, I have seen 
significant evidence that the necessary policies and practices 
within the businesses are in place and that our people are of 
aware how to raise views, ideas and concerns. This perspective 
comes from my direct interactions with the Chief Executive, 
Chief People and Performance Officer, division chief executives, 
business leaders and managers, the observations and insights 
shared with me by our people on my visits, information shared 
in Board presentations and papers, and the results of the 
engagement surveys across the Group. 

Culture and tone are set from the top of an organisation, 
echoed through leaders and managers to every level of a 
business; across ABF I see an open culture that enables issues 
and ideas to be raised and acted on constructively. It is clear 
that our chief executives and business leaders take seriously 
the voices of all our people.

I and the Board remain steadfast to holding divisional chief 
executives and business leaders to account, and in turn 
ensuring that all our employees have the opportunity for their 
voice to be heard in every part of ABF, so they can be part 
of creating a successful business where people thrive.

CORPORATE GOVERNANCE CONTINUED

Board leadership and company purpose continued

of the meeting on all resolutions put forward as shareholders 
will not be able to vote on the day if they are not attending in 
person. Shareholders will also have the opportunity to put their 
questions to the Board either at the meeting (if attending in 
person) or in advance of the meeting. Further details are included 
in the Notice of AGM and documentation accompanying the 
proxy form. All votes are taken by a poll. In 2022, voting levels 
at the AGM were over 85% of the Company’s issued share 
capital.

Annual Report
We publish a full Annual Report and Accounts each year which 
contains a Strategic Report, responsibility section, corporate 
governance section and financial statements. The Annual Report 
is available in paper format for those who request it and on our 
website: www.abf.co.uk.

Responsibility/ESG 
We publish a Responsibility Report on the issues most 
material to the businesses within our Group. The Director 
of Legal Services and Company Secretary acts as a focal point 
for communications on matters of corporate responsibility. 
During the year, the Company responded to requests for 
meetings, telephone meetings or written information from 
both existing and potential shareholders and research bodies 
on a broad range of environmental, social and governance risk 
matters, including matters related to climate change, water and 
greenhouse gas risk management, supply chain management, 
sustainable agriculture, human rights, employee welfare, gender 
balance and human capital development. The Director of Legal 
Services and Company Secretary and the Group Corporate 
Responsibility Director regularly meet with investors, potential 
investors and other stakeholders to discuss corporate 
responsibility matters.

Website (www.abf.co.uk)
Our website is regularly updated and contains a comprehensive 
range of information on our Company. There is a section 
dedicated to investors which includes our investor calendar, 
financial results, presentations, press releases and contact 
details. The area dedicated to individual shareholders is an 
essential communication method. It includes information 
on shareholder news, administrative services and 
contact information.

Engagement with shareholders

We have a dedicated in-house team to manage communications 
with our shareholders, making sure we respond directly, 
as appropriate, to any matters regarding their shareholdings. 
We also have a dedicated team at Equiniti Limited (our share 
registrar) which looks after their needs. To improve security 
and efficiency of communications and to reduce the amount 
of paper we use, we seek to use e-communications to 
communicate with shareholders wherever possible and 
encourage shareholders to switch to e-communications in order 
to reduce our paper usage further. We also encourage the direct 
payment of dividends into bank or building society accounts.

We also engage with shareholders, both institutional investors 
and individual shareholders, in a number of other ways: 

Meetings
The Chairman meets with the Company’s largest institutional 
shareholders to hear their views and discuss any issues or 
concerns. During the year, the Chairman held meetings with a 
number of institutional shareholders (either in person or virtually) 
and discussed a range of topics including the Company’s 
strategy and approach to corporate governance, ESG and 
remuneration-related matters. The Remuneration Committee 
Chair also meets with investors and analysts to answer queries 
and respond to feedback around remuneration issues.

On the day of the announcement of the interim and final results, 
the Company’s largest shareholders, together with financial 
analysts, are invited to a presentation with a question and answer 
session by the Chief Executive and Finance Director, with 
webcast presentations of the results available for all shareholders 
through the Company’s website. Following the results, the 
Executive team holds one-to-one and group meetings (virtually 
where necessary) with institutional shareholders and potential 
investors. These views are then reported back to the Board 
as a whole at the following Board meeting to ensure that it is 
aware of any issues that the Company’s largest shareholders 
are concerned with.

During the year, the Board has maintained an active programme 
of engagement with institutional investors, including engagement 
by the Chief Executive and/or Finance Director, the purpose 
of which is both to develop shareholders’ understanding of 
the Company’s strategy, operations and performance and to 
provide the Board with an awareness of the views of significant 
shareholders. At each Board meeting, the directors are briefed 
on shareholder meetings that have taken place and on feedback 
received, including any significant concerns raised.

AGM
All shareholders are invited to attend the AGM in person, have 
access to our website and the choice to receive electronic 
communications. 

The AGM provides an opportunity for the directors to engage 
with shareholders, answer their questions and to meet them 
informally. The AGM will be held on Friday 8 December 2023 
at 11.00 am at the Congress Centre, 28 Great Russell Street, 
London WC1B 3LS. It is planned that shareholders will be able 
to attend in person. There will also be the possibility for 
registered shareholders to follow proceedings through a 
livestream on the AGM website. We encourage all shareholders 
not attending in person on the day to vote by proxy in advance 

Division of responsibilities

Board composition
At the date of this Annual Report, the Board comprises 
the following directors:

Chairman
Michael McLintock

Executive Directors
George Weston (Chief Executive) 
Eoin Tonge (Finance Director) – appointed 6 February 2023

Non-Executive Directors
Dame Heather Rabbatts (Senior Independent Director) 
Emma Adamo 
Graham Allan 
Wolfhart Hauser 
Annie Murphy – appointed 6 September 2023 
Richard Reid

The Board has approved the appointment of Kumsal Bayazit 
as a Non-Executive Director with effect from 1 December 2023. 
John Bason retired from the Board with effect from 28 April 
2023 and Ruth Cairnie retired from the Board with effect from 
31 August 2023.

Biographical and related information about the directors as at the 
date of this Annual Report is set out on pages 80 and 81.

We consider the size of the Board to be large enough to ensure 
diversity and an appropriate variety of skills whilst still being 
small enough to ensure a good quality of debate. This view was 
supported by the external Board evaluation in 2021, as well as 
the internal Board evaluations carried out in 2022 and 2023, 
further details of which are set out on page 89.

Chairman and Chief Executive
The roles of the Chairman and the Chief Executive are 
separately held and the division of their responsibilities is clearly 
established, set out in writing, and agreed by the Board to 
ensure that no one has unfettered powers of decision. Copies 
are available on request.

The Chairman is responsible for the operation and leadership 
of the Board, ensuring its effectiveness and setting its agenda. 
The Chairman works with the Company Secretary to set the 
agenda for Board meetings. The Chairman promotes a culture 
of openness and debate, which has been a key factor behind 
seeking to keep the size of the Board relatively small, and 
facilitates constructive Board relations and contributions from all 
non-executive directors, as well as ensuring that directors 
receive accurate, timely and clear information. The Chairman 
was independent on appointment.

The Chief Executive is responsible for leading and managing the 
Group’s business within a set of authorities delegated by the 
Board and for the implementation of Board strategy and policy. 
Authority for the operational management of the Group’s 
business has been delegated to the Chief Executive for 
execution or further delegation by him for the effective 
day-to-day running and management of the Group. The chief 
executive of each business within the Group has authority for 
that business and reports directly to the Chief Executive.

Senior Independent Director
The purpose of this role is to act as a sounding board for the 
Chairman and to serve as an intermediary for other directors 
where necessary. The Senior Independent Director is also 
available to shareholders should a need arise to convey 
concerns to the Board which they have been unable to convey 
through the Chairman or through the executive directors. 
The role of the Senior Independent Director is set out in writing 
and a copy is available on request.

In addition to meeting with non-executive directors without 
the Chairman present to appraise the Chairman’s performance 
(for which, see further details on page 89), the Senior 
Independent Director meets with the non-executive directors 
on other occasions as necessary.

The non-executive directors
The non-executive directors, in addition to their responsibilities 
for strategy and business results, play a key role in providing a 
solid foundation for good corporate governance and ensure that 
no individual or group dominates the Board’s decision-making. 
They each occupy, or have occupied, senior positions in industry 
which, taken together, cover a broad range of jurisdictions, 
bringing valuable external perspectives to the Board’s 
deliberations through their experience and insight from different 
sectors and geographies. This enables them to contribute 
significantly to Board decision-making by providing constructive 
challenge and holding to account both management and 
individual executive directors against agreed performance 
objectives. The Board is of a sufficiently small size to be 
conducive to open and candid discussions. The formal letters 
of appointment of non-executive directors are available for 
inspection at the Company’s registered office.

Board Committees
The written terms of reference for the Nomination, Audit and 
Remuneration Committees are available on the Company’s 
website, www.abf.co.uk, and hard copies are available on 
request. Further details on the work of each of the Committees 
are included later in this Corporate Governance Report.

Board independence
Emma Adamo is not considered by the Board to be independent 
in view of her relationship with Wittington Investments Limited, 
the Company’s majority shareholder. Emma was appointed in 
December 2011 to represent this shareholding on the Board. 
The Board considers that the other non-executive directors are 
independent in character and judgement and that they are each 
free from any business or other relationships which would 
materially interfere with the exercise of their independent 
judgement. Further details of their independence are included 
in the Notice of AGM. At least half the Board, excluding the 
Chairman, are independent non-executive directors.

Commitment
The letters of appointment for the Chairman and the 
non-executive directors set out the expected time commitment 
required of them and are available for inspection by any person 
during normal business hours at the Company’s registered 
office and at the AGM. Other significant commitments of 
the Chairman and non-executive directors are disclosed prior 
to appointment and subsequent appointments require 
prior approval.

CORPORATE GOVERNANCE CONTINUED

Division of responsibilities continued

Dame Heather Rabbatts stepped down from the board of Kier 
Group plc with effect from 30 March 2023. Wolfhart Hauser 
stepped down from the board of RELX plc in April 2023 and 
subsequently took up a position as a board member in the 
(non-listed) Trescal group. Graham Allan was already a director 
on an Americana Restaurants entity which subsequently listed 
its shares for trading on the Abu Dhabi Securities Exchange and 
the Saudi Stock Exchange in December 2022 as Americana 
Restaurants International PLC. The Board considered that these 
appointments did not impact the relevant directors’ ability to 
discharge their responsibilities to the Company.

Board meetings
The Board held eight meetings during the financial year. 
Periodically, Board meetings are held away from the corporate 
centre in London.

The attendance of the directors at Board and Committee 
meetings during the year is shown in the table below. If a 
director is unable to participate in a meeting either in person 
or remotely, the Chairman will solicit their views on key items 
of business in advance of the relevant meeting and share 
these with the meeting so that they are able to contribute to 
the debate.

All of the directors attended those meetings that they were 
eligible to attend.

Senior executives below Board level are invited, when 
appropriate, to attend Board meetings and to make 
presentations on the results and strategies of their business 
units. Papers for Board and Committee meetings are generally 
provided to directors a week in advance of the meetings.

Information flow
The Company Secretary manages the provision of information 
to the Board at appropriate times in consultation with the 
Chairman and Chief Executive and ensures that the Board has 
the policies, processes, time and resources it needs in order to 
function effectively and efficiently. This includes the provision 
of corporate governance updates to all Board members in the 
Board pack for each meeting. In addition to formal meetings, 
the Chairman and Chief Executive maintain regular contact with 
all directors. The Chairman holds informal meetings or calls with 
non-executive directors, without any of the executives being 
present, to discuss issues affecting the Group, as appropriate. 
All directors have access to the Company Secretary, who is 
responsible for advising the Board on all governance matters.

Board induction
The Company provides all non-executive directors with a tailored 
and thorough programme of induction, which is facilitated by 
the Chairman and the Company Secretary and which takes 
account of prior experience and business perspectives and the 
Committees on which he or she serves. This typically includes 
training, as well as site visits and meetings with management 
to get to know the businesses better.

Eoin Tonge, the newest executive director appointed to the 
Board, has visited many businesses since his appointment in 
February 2023. These visits have included: Illovo in South Africa, 
Zambia and Malawi; AB World Foods and Twinings Ovaltine in 
Poland; Primark in Ireland, the USA and Germany; Azucarera and 
AB Agri in Spain; George Weston Foods in Australia and New 
Zealand; and various grocery businesses in the UK. 

Annie Murphy joined the Board with effect from 6 September 
2023. Since the end of the financial year to which this Annual 
Report relates, in addition to meeting with executives at the 
corporate centre in late September 2023, Annie has also visited 
India with Dame Heather Rabbatts and the Group Corporate 
Responsibility Director as part of Annie’s induction. This has 
enabled them to understand more about Primark’s activities in 
India following meetings with Primark’s Ethical Trade and 
Environmental Sustainability team and visits to a community 
centre, farmer village and a supplier factory. 

Kumsal Bayazit will join the Board with effect from 1 December 
2023 and an induction will be arranged, including visits to 
businesses. 

Training, development and engagement
The Chairman has overall responsibility for ensuring that the 
directors receive suitable training to enable them to carry out 
their duties and is supported in this by the Company Secretary. 
Directors are also encouraged personally to identify any additional 
training requirements that would assist them in carrying out 
their role. Training is provided in briefing papers, such as the 
regular update from the Company Secretary as part of the Board 
pack ahead of each meeting covering developments in legal, 
regulatory and governance matters, and by way of presentations 
and meetings with senior executives or other external sources. 

The Chief Executive encourages other Board members to visit 
operations either with him, with other directors, or on their 
own. The Board meeting in May 2023 was held at Primark’s 
headquarters at Arthur Ryan House in Dublin and also included 
a visit to the Mary Street store.

Dame Heather Rabbatts had also separately visited Primark’s 
head office and its first store in Mary Street in Dublin in January 
2023 and met with Paul Marchant, Primark CEO, together with 
members of the Primark leadership team. 

In addition to the visits by Eoin as part of his induction, as 
mentioned above, the senior executives of several businesses 
also met with Eoin to provide ‘deep dives’ into their businesses.

For details of visits by Richard Reid to a variety of businesses 
across the Group, please see pages 84 and 85.

Composition, succession and evaluation

Board composition and succession
Details of the composition of the Board are on page 87. There is a formal and transparent procedure for the appointment of new 
directors to the Board. Details are available in the Nomination Committee Report on pages 90 to 92 which also provides details of the 
Committee’s activities, including the approval of the appointment of Annie Murphy and Kumsal Bayazit as Independent Non-Executive 
Directors as well as details of Board and senior management succession plans and diversity.

Election and re-election of directors
In accordance with the provisions of the 2018 Code, at the 2023 AGM to be held in December, all directors currently in office 
will be proposed for election/re-election. Kumsal Bayazit is to be appointed with effect from 1 December 2023 and will also be 
proposed for election at the AGM.

Board evaluation
2022 internal Board evaluation
As reported in our last Annual Report, an internal Board evaluation was carried out in May to August 2022. A summary of the actions 
arising from the 2022 Board evaluation and their outcomes are set out below.

Actions from 2022 internal evaluation 

Outcome 

Chief Executive to discuss with the Director of Business Performance 
and the Chief People and Performance Officer and agree approach with 
regard to increasing the provision of feedback to executives on their 
presentations to the Board and to encourage business divisions to focus 
on a few specific issues in their presentations such that the Board can 
provide input of most value to the business divisions. 

Businesses have improved in giving further specific 
insight into their business during Board presentations. 
Feedback provided to executives following their 
presentations to the Board has increased.

Chairman, Chief Executive and Finance Director to consider the most 
appropriate model to meet requirements, including looking beyond usual 
corporate governance structures in order to consider the interface 
between the Primark Strategic Advisory Board and the main Board.

The Chair of the Primark Strategic Advisory Board 
(‘PSAB’) meets regularly with the Chairman and 
Chief Executive to update them on the PSAB’s work. 
This input then informs main Board discussions.

Chairman to consider in conjunction with the Chief People and 
Performance Officer how the Nomination Committee/Board can most 
effectively carry out their roles in respect of the diversity pipeline and 
succession planning.

During the financial year, two new non-executive 
directors were approved to join the Board, strengthening 
the Board’s expertise, particularly in respect of retail/
brand and technology/analytics experience. 

2023 internal Board evaluation
An internal Board evaluation was carried out in July and August 
2023. The objective of the review was to assess all aspects of 
the effectiveness of the Board, its Committees, the Chairman 
and the individual directors, also measuring progress against 
recommendations from the previous Board evaluation.

The Board evaluation was carried out at the request of the 
Chairman by the Director of Corporate Governance.

How the Board evaluation was conducted
The main strands of work were as follows:

•  each Board member, the Company Secretary and the Group 
Statutory Auditor was requested to complete a questionnaire 
and provide comments in response to a range of questions 
and observations relating to the Board. Each respondent was 
also given the opportunity to have a follow-up meeting with 
the Chairman to discuss any particular issues; and

•  a report was prepared including overall observations and 
highlighting key recommendations for consideration.

The report was then included in the Board pack for the Board 
meeting in September 2023 and discussed by the Board at 
that meeting. The headline outcomes of the review were that 
the Board felt that it had the right mix of skills and expertise 
in the context of developing and delivering the strategy and 
assessing the challenges and opportunities facing the Group 
(particularly in light of the skillset that the newest directors will 
bring) and that the Board and its Committees continue to be 
well-functioning and effective in providing oversight of the 
Company and its governance.

Key recommendations and actions from the 2023 internal Board 
evaluation are to:

•  increase the businesses’ discussion with the Board on the 

competitive environment and growth areas so as to improve 
the Board’s understanding of their strategies and ability to 
continue to provide valued input;

•  consider how to facilitate more business visits by non-

executive directors, in recognition of the importance of such 
visits in monitoring culture; 

•  continue to consider how ESG risks and opportunities are 

addressed most effectively; and 

•  consider aligning the Board’s ‘deep dives’ on businesses with 

the Audit Committee’s ‘deep dives’ on the audit.

The outcome of the evaluation will not have any impact on 
Board composition, taking into account that the composition of 
the Board has only recently changed with the appointment of 
Annie Murphy as a director in September 2023 and with Kumsal 
Bayazit joining the Board in December 2023.

The Board (apart from the Chairman) also reviewed the 
performance of the Chairman during the year. This concluded 
that the Chairman is highly effective, ensuring that the Board 
considers the individual strategies of the businesses within the 
Group, whilst also maintaining a focus on priorities. It was 
further noted that the Chairman successfully enables open and 
purposeful discussions and is very inclusive, working well with 
all the non-executive directors and ensuring that the Board 
retains appropriate independence whilst forging strong 
relationships with the key executives.

CORPORATE GOVERNANCE CONTINUED

Nomination Committee Report

•  ensuring effective succession plans are in place for the Board 
and senior management and overseeing the development 
of a diverse pipeline for orderly succession based on merit 
and objective criteria, with due regard to diversity of age, 
gender, ethnicity, sexual orientation, disability, educational, 
professional and socio-economic background, cognitive and 
personal strengths; and

•  making recommendations to the Board on the Board’s policy 

on boardroom diversity and inclusion, its objectives and 
linkage to strategy, how it has been implemented and 
progress on achieving its objectives.

Governance
Members of the Nomination Committee are appointed by 
the Board from amongst the directors of the Company, in 
consultation with the Committee Chair. The Nomination 
Committee comprises a minimum of three members at any 
time, a majority of whom are independent non-executive 
directors. A quorum consists of two members, being either 
two independent non-executive directors or one independent 
non-executive director and the Chairman.

Only members of the Nomination Committee have the right to 
attend Nomination Committee meetings. Other individuals such 
as the Chief Executive, Finance Director, members of senior 
management, the Chief People and Performance Officer and 
external advisers may be invited to attend meetings as and 
when appropriate.

The Nomination Committee may take outside legal or other 
professional advice on any matters covered by its terms of 
reference at the Company’s expense but within any budgetary 
constraints imposed by the Board.

The Nomination Committee Chair reports the outcome of 
meetings to the Board to the extent that any Board members 
are not in attendance at the relevant meeting.

The terms of reference of the Nomination Committee are 
available on the Corporate Governance section of the 
Company’s website: www.abf.co.uk.

Committee activities during the year
Succession planning
The Board continues to emphasise generalist skills in Board 
recruitment as well as continuing to factor in all forms 
of diversity, including gender and ethnic diversity.

A detailed review of succession planning in respect of senior 
management was presented to the Board by the Chief People 
and Performance Officer at the Board meeting in July 2023. This 
included a focus on: overall principles for succession (including 
an aim to have an increasingly diverse potential internal 
successor pool for all our leadership roles); potential succession 
candidates for the corporate centre roles; potential succession 
candidates for divisional CEO and CFO roles; diverse succession 
talent planning, including specifically identifying, developing and 
sponsoring emerging talent; group-wide learning and 
development initiatives to support diverse talent (e.g. the 
Executive Leadership Programme; the Senior Executive 
Induction Programme; the Finance Excellence Programme; and 
the Business Acumen Programme); and inclusion and diversity 
networks throughout the Group (e.g. Women in ABF; Early 
Careers Network; and the DEI Network).

Board appointments process
The process for making new appointments is led by the 
Chairman. Where appropriate, external, independent consultants 
are engaged to conduct a search for potential candidates, 
who are considered on the basis of their skills, experience and 
fit with the existing members of the Board. The Nomination 
Committee has procedures for appointing directors and these 
are set out in its terms of reference.

During the year, the Chairman led the process for conducting 
a search for new non-executive directors. Lygon Group, an 
external executive search consulting firm, was engaged to help 
identify potential candidates. In line with our Board Diversity 
Policy, the firm is a signatory to the Voluntary Code of Conduct 
for Executive Search Firms for best practice on gender and 
ethnic diversity. The firm is also a signatory to the Change the 
Race Ratio. Lygon has no other connection to the Company or 
the directors.

Potential candidates were considered on the basis of their 
skills and experience as well as their fit with the Group’s 
strategy. Following a rigorous process including interviews with 
members of the Nomination Committee and the Chief 
Executive and following recommendations of the Nomination 
Committee, in May 2023 the Board approved the appointment 
of Annie Murphy as a Non-Executive Director with effect from 
6 September 2023. Following a similar process, in August 2023 
the Board approved the appointment of Kumsal Bayazit as a 
Non-Executive Director with effect from 1 December 2023.

Re-election of directors
The Nomination Committee members considered the 
composition of the Board and the time needed to fulfil the roles 
of Chairman, Senior Independent Director and Non-Executive 
Director. They also considered the election/re-election of 
directors prior to their recommended approval by shareholders 
at the AGM.

Performance evaluation
The performance of the Nomination Committee was considered 
as part of the internal Board evaluation. The overall view was 
that it appeared to be working well and it was noted that the 
work of the Nomination Committee had led to securing good 
new non-executive director appointments.

Diversity and inclusion
We operate under the principle that we should be a Group 
where anyone with ambition and talent can have a great career, 
regardless of their age, gender, ethnicity, sexual orientation, 
disability, educational and socio-economic background, cognitive 
and personal strengths or any of the other qualities that make 
people unique. This applies as much to the Board and to its 
Remuneration, Audit and Nomination Committees as it does 
to the Group as a whole. 

In furtherance of this principle, we aim to ensure that there 
are no obstacles or barriers to people joining the Group and 
progressing their careers with us. Across all of our operations, 
our objective is that everyone should feel respected, valued 
and included.

In November 2022, the Board approved a Board Diversity Policy 
which is available online at: www.abf.co.uk. This was taken 
into account in the appointments approved during the course 
of the financial year. 

The objectives under our Board Diversity Policy include:

•  continuing to engage executive search firms who have signed 
up to the Voluntary Code of Conduct for Executive Search 
Firms for best practice on gender and ethnic diversity;
•  committing to maintain at least 33% female directors on 

the Board and at least one person from an ethnic minority 
background on the Board;

•  aspiring to have at least 40% female directors on the Board 
by the end of 2025 and to maintain at least one woman 
in the Chair, Chief Executive, Finance Director or Senior 
Independent Director role;

•  with a view to attracting non-executive directors from 

more diverse socio-economic backgrounds, reducing the 
shareholding expectation for non-executive directors to 
‘a meaningful level of shareholding’; and

•  overseeing the development of a diverse pipeline for orderly 
succession of appointments to both the Board and to senior 
management, so as to maintain an appropriate balance of 
skills and experience, taking into account the challenges and 
opportunities facing the Group. This includes continuing 
to receive detailed annual updates on succession planning 
and talent management from the Chief People and 
Performance Officer in recognition of its importance in 
supporting the Group’s strategy.

By way of update, with the appointment of Annie Murphy on 
6 September 2023 and with the forthcoming appointment of 
Kumsal Bayazit on 1 December 2023 (including the appointment 
of both to the Audit and Remuneration Committees), the Board 
will have met its aspiration as set out in the Board Diversity 
Policy to increase female representation to at least 40%, 
as recommended by the FTSE Women Leaders Review. 
We continue to meet our commitment to have at least one 
person from an ethnic minority background as a director, in line 
with the recommendations of the Parker Review. The Board 
has also maintained at least one woman in the Chair, Chief 
Executive, Finance Director or Senior Independent Director role, 
with Dame Heather Rabbatts taking up the position of Senior 
Independent Director from Ruth Cairnie in May 2023.

The Board also reviews progress on diversity and inclusion 
with the divisions as part of their business updates and with 
the Chief People and Performance Officer as an element of the 
talent and succession planning reviews. Details of other initiatives 
across the Group to promote diversity are provided on page 51, 
as is information on the gender balance of senior managers 
and direct reports.

On the next page we also publish a director skill sets matrix 
which seeks to provide a snapshot of the diversity of skills 
of the Board, as well as gender and ethnicity representation 
at Board and executive management levels.

Board and executive management gender and ethnicity metrics
New Listing Rules targets for gender and ethnic diversity apply to the Company for the first time this financial year. As at 
16 September 2023, the Company had met the new Listing Rules targets for gender and ethnic Board diversity with the exception 
of the target for 40% female representation on the Board. This remains the case as at the date of this Annual Report. However, 
following the appointment of Kumsal Bayazit as a director with effect from 1 December 2023 (subject to Kumsal’s election by 
shareholders at the upcoming AGM), the Company will then meet all of the Listing Rules Board diversity targets as it will increase 
female representation on the Board to 40%.

The following metrics set out the range of gender and ethnicity as they relate to our Board and executive management as at 
16 September 2023. In the absence of an Executive Committee, by ‘executive management’ we refer to the most senior level 
of managers reporting to the Chief Executive, including the Company Secretary but excluding administrative and support staff, 
in accordance with the definition in the Listing Rules. The process by which diversity data was collected was, where permitted 
by relevant laws, to contact relevant individuals and ask them how they identified using the categorisations set out in the Listing 
Rules. Where we already held gender or ethnicity data for executives, with consents in place to use it for reporting on an anonymous 
basis, we used that data.

CORPORATE GOVERNANCE CONTINUED

Governance
The Audit Committee comprises a minimum of three members, 
all of whom are independent non-executive directors of the 
Company. Two members constitute a quorum.

The Committee Chair fulfilled the requirement that there must 
be at least one member with recent and relevant financial 
experience and competence in accounting or auditing (or both) 
during the year. In addition, the Committee as a whole has 
competence in the sectors in which the Company operates. 
All Committee members are expected to be financially literate 
and to have an understanding of the following areas:

•  the principles of, and developments in, financial reporting 

including the applicable accounting standards and statements 
of recommended practice;

•  key aspects of the Company’s operations including corporate 

policies and the Group’s internal control environment;

•  matters which may influence the presentation of accounts 

and key figures;

•  the principles of, and developments in, company law and 

other relevant corporate legislation;

•  the role of internal and external auditing and risk 

management; and

•  the regulatory framework for the Group’s businesses.

The Committee invites the other non-executive directors, Chief 
Executive, Finance Director, Group Financial Controller, Director 
of Financial Control and senior representatives of the external 
auditor to attend its meetings in full, although it reserves 
the right to request any of these individuals to withdraw. 
Other senior managers are invited to present such reports 
as are required for the Committee to discharge its duties.

During the year, the Committee held four meetings with the 
external auditor without any executive members of the Board 
being present.

The Committee has unrestricted access to Company 
documents and information, as well as to employees of the 
Company and the external auditor.

The Committee may take independent professional advice 
on any matters covered by its terms of reference at the 
Company’s expense.

The Committee Chair reports the outcome of meetings to the 
Board (to the extent that any Board members were not in 
attendance at the relevant meeting).

The performance of the Audit Committee was considered 
in the external Board evaluation in 2021, which found that the 
Committee was universally well-regarded as being strong and 
effective. It was noted that members came to the meetings 
well prepared and offered robust challenge and that the agenda 
of meetings was broad-ranging, well-structured and covered 
all the matters in the Audit Committee’s remit. This view was 
reiterated in both the 2022 and 2023 internal Board evaluation.

The terms of reference of the Audit Committee can be viewed 
on the Investors section of the Company’s website: 
www.abf.co.uk.

The Committee advises the Board to enable it to meet its 
responsibilities under audit, risk and internal control.

Board responsibilities on audit, risk and 
internal control
The Board recognises that its responsibility to present a fair, 
balanced and understandable assessment extends to interim 
and other price-sensitive public reports, reports to regulators, 
and information required to be presented by statutory requests.

The directors confirm that they consider that the Annual Report 
and financial statements, taken as a whole, are fair, balanced 
and understandable and provide the information necessary for 
shareholders to assess the Company’s position, performance, 
business model and strategy. The Company produced a paper in 
this respect, prepared by the Group Financial Controller, 
containing an assessment of the Annual Report and financial 
statements, including a summary by division of performance 
issues in the year and one-off items which benefited 
performance. This paper was presented to the Audit 
Committee.

Risk management and internal control
The Board acknowledges its overall responsibility for monitoring 
the Group’s risk management and internal control systems to 
facilitate the identification, assessment and management of 
risk and the protection of shareholders’ investments and the 
Group’s assets. The directors recognise that they are responsible 
for providing a return to shareholders, which is consistent with 
the responsible assessment and mitigation of risks.

The directors confirm that there is a process for identifying, 
evaluating and managing the risks faced by the Group and the 
operational effectiveness of the related controls, which has 
been in place for the year under review and is up to the date of 
approval of the Annual Report. They also confirm that they have 
regularly monitored the effectiveness of the risk management 
and internal control systems (which cover all material controls 
including financial, operational and compliance controls) utilising 
the review process set out below.

Standards
There are guidelines on the minimum groupwide requirements 
for health and safety and environmental standards. There are 
also guidelines on the minimum level of internal control that 
each of the divisions should exercise over specified processes. 
Each business has developed and documented policies and 
procedures to comply with the minimum control standards 
established, including procedures for monitoring compliance and 
taking corrective action. The board of each business is required 
to confirm twice yearly that it has complied with these policies 
and procedures.

High-level controls
All businesses prepare annual operating plans and budgets 
which are updated regularly. Performance against budget is 
monitored at business unit level and centrally, with variances 
being reported promptly. The cash position at Group and 
business level is monitored constantly and variances from 
expected levels are investigated thoroughly. Clearly defined 
guidelines have been established for capital expenditure and 
investment decisions. These include the preparation of budgets, 
appraisal and review procedures and delegated authority levels.

Financial reporting
Detailed management accounts are prepared every four 
weeks, consolidated in a single system and reviewed by senior 
management and the Board.

They include a comprehensive set of financial reports and 
key performance indicators covering commercial, operational, 
environmental and people issues. Performance against budgets 
and forecasts is discussed regularly at Board meetings and 
at meetings between operational and Group management. 
The adequacy and suitability of key performance indicators are 
reviewed regularly. All chief executives and finance directors of 
the Group’s operations are asked to sign an annual confirmation 
that their business has complied with the Group Accounting 
Manual in the preparation of consolidated financial statements 
and specifically to confirm the adequacy and accuracy of 
accounting provisions.

Internal audit
The Group’s internal audit activities are co-ordinated centrally 
by the Director of Financial Control, who is accountable to the 
Audit Committee.

Our internal audit team adopts a risk-based approach to develop 
and deliver a balanced internal audit plan that provides assurance 
that our businesses are effectively managing their key control 
risks and agreed action plans with business leaders where 
controls require improvement.

All Group businesses are required to comply with the Group’s 
Financial Control Framework which sets out minimum control 
standards. Our internal audit plans are designed to include 
coverage of financial controls to provide assurance over how 
our businesses meet the requirements of the Financial 
Control Framework.

Assessment of principal risks
The directors confirm that, during the year, the Board has 
carried out a robust assessment of the principal and emerging 
risks facing the Group, including those that could threaten its 
business model, future performance, and solvency or liquidity. 
A description of these principal and emerging risks and how 
they are being managed and mitigated is set out on pages 
68 to 75.

Annual review of the effectiveness of the systems of risk 
management and internal control
During the year, the Board reviewed the effectiveness of the 
Group’s systems of risk management and internal control 
processes embracing all material systems, including financial, 
operational and compliance controls, to ensure that they remain 
robust. The review covered the financial year to 16 September 
2023 and the period to the date of approval of this Annual 
Report. The review included:

•  the annual risk management review, a comprehensive 

process identifying the key external and operational risks 
facing the Group and the controls and activities in place to 
mitigate them, the findings of which are discussed with 
each member of the Board individually (refer to the risk 
management section on pages 94 to 95 for details of the 
process undertaken); and

•  the annual assessment of internal control, which, following 

consideration by the Audit Committee, provided assurance to 
the Board around the control environment and processes in 
place around the Group, specifically those relating to internal 
financial control.

The Board evaluated the effectiveness of management’s 
processes for monitoring and reviewing risk management and 
internal control. No significant failings or weaknesses were 
identified by the review and the Board is satisfied that, where 
areas of improvement were identified, processes are in place to 
ensure that remedial action is taken and progress monitored.

The Board confirmed that it was satisfied with the outcome of 
the review of the effectiveness of the systems and processes 
and that they complied with the requirements of the 2018 Code.

Going concern and viability
The 2018 Code requires the directors to assess and report on 
the prospects of the Group over a longer period. This longer-
term viability statement and statement of going concern is set 
out on pages 76 and 77.

Audit Committee activities during the year
In order to fulfil its terms of reference, the Audit Committee 
receives and reviews presentations and reports from the 
Group’s senior management, consulting as necessary with 
the external auditor.

Monitoring the integrity of reported financial information
Ensuring the integrity of the financial statements and 
associated announcements is a fundamental responsibility 
of the Audit Committee.

During the year it formally reviewed the Group’s interim and 
annual reports.

These reviews considered:

•  the description of performance in the Annual Report to ensure 

it was fair, balanced and understandable;

•  the accounting principles, policies and practices adopted 

in the Group’s financial statements, any proposed changes 
to them, and the adequacy of their disclosure;

•  important accounting issues or areas of complexity, the 

actions, estimates and judgements of management in relation 
to financial reporting and in particular the assumptions 
underlying the going concern and viability statements;

•  any significant adjustments to financial reporting arising from 

the audit;

•  tax contingencies, compliance with statutory tax obligations 

and the Group’s tax policy;

•  ongoing consideration of the potential implications of the 
Government White Paper: Restoring Trust in Audit and 
Corporate Governance, including the preparatory work for 
additional control reviews, the Group’s Assessment 
of Controls Effectiveness (ACE) programme;

•  reporting in line with the recommendations and recommended 

disclosures of the Task Force on Climate-related Financial 
Disclosures (TCFD) and the new Companies Act 2006 
climate-related disclosure requirements; and

•  treasury policies.

CORPORATE GOVERNANCE CONTINUED

Significant accounting issues considered by the Audit 
Committee in relation to the Group’s financial statements
A key responsibility of the Committee is to consider the 
significant areas of complexity, management judgement and 
estimation that have been applied in the preparation of the 
financial statements. The Committee has, with support from 
Ernst & Young LLP (‘EY’) as external auditor, reviewed the 
suitability of the accounting policies which have been adopted 
and whether management has made appropriate estimates 
and judgements.

Set out below are the significant areas of accounting judgement 
or management estimation and a description of how the 
Committee concluded that such judgements and estimates 
were appropriate. These are divided between those that could 
have a material impact on the financial statements and those 
that are less likely to have a material impact but nevertheless, 
by their nature, required a degree of estimation.

Areas of significant accounting judgement and 
estimation material to the Group financial 
statements

Impairment of goodwill, intangibles, property, 
plant and equipment and right-of-use assets
Assessment for impairment involves comparing the 
book value of an asset with its recoverable amount, 
being the higher of value-in-use and fair value less 
costs to sell. Value-in-use is determined with 
reference to projected future cash flows discounted 
at an appropriate rate. Both the cash flows and the 
discount rate involve a significant degree of 
estimation uncertainty.

Impact of inflationary pressures on the viability 
statement and going concern
The Group has continued to experience inflationary 
pressures in raw material, supply chains and energy. 
These inflationary pressures have been exacerbated 
by the war in Ukraine. 

The Board considered future performance and cash 
flows in its going concern assessment, through to 
February 2025, and its viability statement over the 
next three years.

Management has undertaken a detailed financial 
modelling exercise that has considered the impact on 
profit, cash and working capital of a number of 
potential scenarios.

Audit Committee assurance

The Committee considered the reasonableness of cash flow projections 
which were based on the most recent budget approved by the Board and 
reflected management’s expectations of sales growth, operating costs and 
margins based on past experience and external sources of information. 
The Committee focused on China Sugar, Don, Illovo Mozambique, Jordans 
Dorset Ryvita and Vivergo.

Long-term growth rates for periods not covered by the annual budget were 
challenged to ensure that they were appropriate for the products, industries 
and countries in which the relevant cash-generating units operate. 
The Committee reviewed and challenged the key assumptions made in 
deriving these projections: discount rates, growth rates, and expected 
changes in production and sales volumes, selling prices and direct costs. 
The Committee also considered the adequacy of the disclosures in respect 
of the key assumptions and sensitivities. Refer to notes 8, 9 and 10 to the 
financial statements for more details of these assumptions.

The Committee was satisfied that the discount rate assumptions 
appropriately reflected current market assessments of the time value of 
money and the risks associated with the particular assets. The other key 
assumptions were all considered to be reasonable.

On the basis of the key assumptions and associated sensitivities, it is 
considered that the charge of £109m, comprising £41m in the Don 
business, £15m in north China Sugar, £35m in Illovo Mozambique and £18m 
in Primark was appropriately recognised and included within exceptional 
items as detailed in notes 8, 9 and 10.

The external auditor undertook an independent audit of the estimates of 
value-in-use and fair value less costs to sell, including a challenge of 
management’s underlying cash flow projections, long-term growth 
assumptions and discount rates. On the basis of its work, and its challenge 
of the key assumptions and sensitivities, it considered that the impairment 
charges as detailed in notes 8, 9 and 10 were appropriately recognised.

The Committee has reviewed and challenged the scenarios considered 
by management and concluded that these, and the stress-testing scenarios 
and assumptions, were appropriate and adequate.

The Committee has reviewed the detailed cash flow forecasts, which 
incorporate the mitigating actions proposed by management. 
The Committee also reviewed and challenged the reverse stress 
assumptions to confirm the viability of the Group.

The Committee has been kept informed of the impacts of inflationary 
pressures on the Group, including accounting matters, going concern and 
viability considerations. The Committee has satisfied itself that management 
has adequately identified and considered all potentially significant accounting 
and disclosure matters.

Areas of significant accounting judgement and 
estimation material to the Group financial 
statements

Post-retirement benefits
Valuation of the Group’s pension schemes and 
post-retirement medical benefit schemes require 
various subjective judgements to be made including 
mortality assumptions, discount rates, general and 
salary inflation, and the rate of increase for pensions 
in payment and those in deferment.

Audit Committee assurance

Actuarial valuations of the Group’s pension scheme obligations are 
undertaken every three years in the UK by an independent qualified actuary 
who also provides advice to management on the assumptions to be used 
in preparing the accounting valuations each year. Actuarial valuations in 
other jurisdictions are performed as required. Details of the assumptions 
made in the current and previous year are disclosed in note 12 of the 
financial statements together with the bases on which those assumptions 
have been made.

The Committee reviewed the assumptions by comparison with externally 
derived data and also considered the adequacy of disclosures in respect 
of the sensitivity of the surplus to changes in these key assumptions.

Other accounting areas requiring management 
judgement or estimation

Audit Committee assurance

Taxation
Current and deferred tax recognised in the financial 
statements is dependent on subjective judgements 
as to the outcome of decisions by tax authorities in 
various jurisdictions around the world and the ability 
of the Group to use tax losses within the time limits 
imposed by various tax authorities.

The Committee reviews the Group’s tax policy and principles for managing 
tax risks annually.

The Committee reviewed and challenged the provisions recorded and the 
contingent liabilities disclosed at the balance sheet date and management 
confirmed that they represent their best estimate of the financial exposure 
faced by the Group.

The external auditor explained to the Committee the work that they had 
conducted during the year, including how their audit procedures were 
focused on those provisions requiring the highest degree of judgement. 

The Committee discussed with both management and the external auditor 
the key judgements which had been made. The Committee was satisfied 
that the judgements were reasonable and that, accordingly, the provision 
amounts recorded were appropriate.

Misstatements
Management reported to the Committee that they were not 
aware of any material or immaterial misstatements made 
intentionally to achieve a particular presentation. The external 
auditor reported to the Committee the misstatements that they 
had found in the course of their work. After due consideration 
the Committee concurred with management that these 
misstatements were not material and that no adjustments 
were required.

Internal financial control and risk management
The Committee is required to assist the Board to fulfil its 
responsibilities relating to the adequacy and effectiveness of 
the control environment, controls over financial reporting and 
the Group’s compliance with the 2018 Code. To fulfil these 
duties, the Committee (or the Board as a whole) reviewed:

•  the external auditors’ summary of management letters 

and their Audit Committee reports;

•  internal audit reports on key audit areas and any significant 

deficiencies in the financial control environment;

•  reports on the systems of internal financial control and risk 
management, including the preparatory work for additional 
control reviews under the Group’s ACE programme;

•  an assessment of business continuity plans in place in the 

Group’s businesses;

•  reports on fraud perpetrated against the Group;

•  the Group’s approach to anti-bribery and corruption, and 

whistleblowing;

•  the Group’s approach to IT and cybersecurity;
•  reports on significant systems implementations; and
•  inflationary pressure challenges and response assurance plan.

Internal audit
The Group’s businesses employ internal auditors (both 
employees and resources provided by major accounting firms 
other than the firm involved in the audit of the Group (except 
where expressly permitted by the Audit Committee)) with skills 
and experience relevant to the operation of each business. 
All of the internal audit activities are co-ordinated centrally by 
the Director of Financial Control, who is accountable to the 
Audit Committee.

The Audit Committee is required to assist the Board in fulfilling 
its responsibilities for ensuring the capability of the internal audit 
function and the adequacy of its resourcing and plans.

The Audit Committee receives regular reports on the results 
of internal audit’s work and monitors the status of 
recommendations arising. The Committee reviews annually 
the adequacy, qualifications and experience of the Group’s 
internal audit resources and the nature and scope of internal 
audit activity in the overall context of the Group’s risk 
management system.

CORPORATE GOVERNANCE CONTINUED

To fulfil its duties, the Committee reviewed:

•  internal audit’s reporting lines and access to the Committee 

and all members of the Board;

•  internal audit’s plans and its achievement of the planned 

activity;

•  the results of key audits and other significant findings, 

the adequacy of management’s response and the timeliness 
of their resolution; and

•  changes in internal audit personnel to ensure appropriate 

resourcing, skills and experience are put in place.

The Group’s Director of Financial Control meets with the Chair 
of the Audit Committee as appropriate but at least quarterly, 
without the presence of executive management, and has direct 
access to the Chairman of the Board.

Whistleblowing and fraud
The Whistleblowing Policy ‘Speak Up’ is designed to protect 
ABF’s culture of fairness, trust, accountability and respect, 
encouraging effective and honest communication at all levels. 
In addition, an independent external service provider receives, 
in confidence, complaints on accounting, risk issues, internal 
controls, auditing issues and related matters for reporting to the 
Audit Committee as appropriate. Further details on the Policy 
can be found on page 52. The Committee reviewed reports 
from internal audit and the actions arising therefrom and reported 
this to the Board (to the extent any Board member was not 
in attendance at the relevant meeting).

The Group’s Anti-fraud Policy has been communicated to all 
employees and states that all employees have a responsibility 
for fraud prevention and detection. Any suspicion of fraud should 
be reported immediately and will be investigated vigorously. 
The Audit Committee reviewed all instances of fraud perpetrated 
against the Group and the action taken by management both 
to pursue the perpetrators and to prevent reoccurrences.

External audit
Auditor independence
The Audit Committee is responsible for the development, 
implementation and monitoring of policies and procedures 
on the use of the external auditor for non-audit services, 
in accordance with professional and regulatory requirements. 
These policies are kept under review to meet the objective 
of ensuring that the Group benefits in a cost-effective manner 
from the cumulative knowledge and experience of its auditor, 
whilst also ensuring that the auditor maintains the necessary 
degree of independence and objectivity. The Committee’s policy 
on the use of the external auditor to provide non-audit services 
is in accordance with applicable laws and takes into account the 
relevant ethical guidance for auditors. Any non-audit work to be 
undertaken by the auditor requires authorisation by the Finance 
Director, and above a certain threshold, the Audit Committee, 
prior to its commencement.

The Committee also ensures that fees incurred, or to be 
incurred, for non-audit services, both individually and in 
aggregate, do not exceed any limits in applicable law and take 
into account the relevant ethical guidance for auditors.

The Committee is required to approve the use of the external 
auditor to provide: accounting advice and training; corporate 
responsibility and other assurance services; financial due 
diligence in respect of acquisitions and disposals; and will 
consider other services when it is in the best interests of the 
Company to do so, provided they can be undertaken without 
jeopardising auditor independence. Tax services including tax 
compliance, tax planning and related implementation advice 
may not be undertaken by the external auditor except in very 
exceptional circumstances where specialist knowledge is 
required. The aggregate expenditure with the Group auditor 
is reviewed by the Audit Committee. No individually significant 
non-audit assignments that would require disclosure were 
undertaken in the financial year.

The Company has a policy that any partners, directors or senior 
managers hired directly from the external auditor must be 
pre-approved by the Chief People and Performance Officer, 
and the Finance Director or Group Financial Controller, with the 
Chair of the Audit Committee being consulted as appropriate.

The Audit Committee has formally reviewed the independence 
of the external auditor. EY has reported to the Committee 
confirming that it believes it remained independent throughout 
the year, within the meaning of the regulations on this matter 
and in accordance with its professional standards.

To fulfil its responsibility to ensure the independence of the 
external auditor, the Audit Committee reviewed:

•  a report from the external auditor describing arrangements 
to identify, report and manage any conflicts of interest, and 
policies and procedures for maintaining independence and 
monitoring compliance with relevant requirements; and

•  the extent of non-audit services provided by the 

external auditor.

The total fees paid to EY for the 52 weeks ended 16 September 
2023 were £11.2m, of which £1.0m related to non-audit work. 
Further details are provided in note 2 to the financial statements.

Auditor effectiveness
To assess the effectiveness of the external auditor, 
the Committee reviewed:

•  the external auditor’s fulfilment of the agreed audit plan 

and variations from it (including changes in perceived audit 
risks and the work undertaken by the external auditors to 
address those risks);

•  reports highlighting the major issues that arose during 

the course of the audit;

•  feedback from the businesses via questionnaires evaluating 
the conduct and performance of each assigned audit team 
(including in respect of their planning, challenge and 
interaction with the business); and

•  a report on EY, as a firm, from the Audit Quality Review Team 
(‘AQRT’) of the Financial Reporting Council (‘FRC’) and the 
discussions with EY on the contents of such report.

Minimum Standard
The FRC’s ‘Audit Committees and the External Audit: Minimum 
Standard’ (the ‘Minimum Standard’) was published in May 2023, 
eight months into the financial year. Between its publication 
and the end of the financial year on 16 September 2023, 
one Audit Committee meeting has taken place, at which the 
Minimum Standard was considered. The Audit Committee’s 
initial assessment is that there is nothing of note in the 
Minimum Standard that differs from how the ABF Audit 
Committee currently operates. However, this is being reviewed 
further, including to the extent that there may be useful points 
to consider in relation to the assessment of the effectiveness 
of the audit process and to the audit tender process.

Richard Reid 
Audit Committee Chair

There is regular open communication between EY and the Audit 
Committee as well as between EY and the businesses’ senior 
management. The Audit Committee holds private meetings with 
the external auditor after each Committee meeting to review 
key issues within their sphere of interest and responsibility and 
to satisfy itself that the audit is of a sufficiently high standard.

To fulfil its responsibility for oversight of the external audit 
process, the Audit Committee reviewed:

•  the terms, areas of responsibility, associated duties and 
scope of the audit as set out in the external auditor’s 
engagement letter;

•  the overall work plan and fee proposal;
•  the major issues that arose during the course of the audit 

and their resolution;

•  key accounting and audit judgements;
•  the level of errors identified during the audit; and
•  the content of, and any recommendations made by the 
external auditor in, their management letters and the 
adequacy of management’s response.

Auditor appointment
The Audit Committee reviews annually the appointment of 
the auditor, taking into account the auditor’s effectiveness and 
independence, and makes a recommendation to the Board 
accordingly. Any decision to open the external audit to tender 
is taken on the recommendation of the Audit Committee.

The Company’s current external auditor, EY, was first appointed 
at the annual general meeting in December 2015, with effect 
from 2016, following the conclusion of a competitive tender 
process. The Audit Committee is satisfied with the auditor’s 
effectiveness and independence and has recommended to the 
Board that EY be reappointed as the Company’s external auditor 
for 2023/24. The Board accepted such recommendation. In 
accordance with applicable law and regulation, the Company is 
required to conduct a competitive audit tender during 2025.

The Audit Committee has discussed the most appropriate time 
to carry out the external audit tender process, taking into account 
the independence, objectivity and quality of EY’s external audit 
and has concluded that, based on current performance, it is 
anticipated that a competitive tender process will commence in 
2024. The Audit Committee considers that a competitive tender 
is in the best interests of the Company’s shareholders as it will 
allow the Company to appoint the audit firm that will provide 
the highest quality, most effective and efficient audit.

Compliance with the Competition and Markets 
Authority Order
The Company confirms that, during the period under review, 
it has complied with the provisions of The Statutory Audit 
Services for Large Companies Market Investigation (Mandatory 
Use of Competitive Tender Processes and Audit Committee 
Responsibilities) Order 2014.

DIRECTORS’ REMUNERATION REPORT

Annual statement by the Remuneration 
Committee Chair

Incentive Plan Outcomes for 2022/23
At the beginning of the year, the Company was facing extreme 
market volatility, as well as significant cost inflation at Primark 
and in most of the food businesses. Given the challenging 
trading environment, adjusted operating profit and adjusted 
earnings per share were, at that time, expected to be lower 
than in 2021/22. During the course of the year, however, 
the Company successfully navigated these headwinds and 
outperformed against both expectations and the prior year. 
At Primark, well-received ranges, good results from new stores, 
and selective price increases generated a solid sales and profit 
outcome. Several other businesses had impressive sales 
growth, particularly in Grocery and Ingredients, and international 
brands performed well. In Sugar, performance was slightly 
better than expected and adjusted operating profit was 
moderately above last year. For the Group overall, this strong 
all-round performance resulted in adjusted operating profit 
finishing ahead of last year. The remuneration outcomes for 
2022/23 reflect these results.

Short-Term Incentive Plan (STIP) 2022/23
Underpinned by year-on-year sales growth, operating profit 
exceeded the maximum target established under the STIP. 
However, working capital levels were impacted by supply chain 
challenges and inflationary pressures and the threshold for the 
working capital modifier was not met. Accordingly, the overall 
outcome under the financial performance measures for this year 
is 66.67% of maximum.

Last year, as part of our review, the personal element of 
the STIP was replaced with strategic KPIs, with a weighting 
of 15%. This year our strategic KPIs were all related to ESG. 
The diversified nature of ABF means that ESG targets 
are developed by division, with the centre having a key role 
in governance, overseeing progress and ensuring accountability 
for performance. Our scorecard of measures for the year 
incorporated both the key ESG priorities within the divisions and 
the evolution of our governance model. For the 2022/23 STIP, 
against a broad scorecard of measures, the Committee 
assessed the overall score at 21/30.

Combining these measures, the overall formulaic outcome 
for the 2022/23 STIP was 67.17% of maximum. 

Long-Term Incentive Plan 2020-23
Reflecting the Group’s strong post-COVID recovery, EPS 
performance for the 2020-23 LTIP was broadly in line with the 
target set back in 2020. The Group three-year average ROACE 
without Sugar exceeded the maximum level. The four-year 
average Sugar ROACE outcome was just below the maximum 
level. Note that the Group ROACE without Sugar modifier 
and the Sugar ROACE modifier act only as downward modifiers 
to the calculated incentive outcomes. 

Based on these results, the overall formulaic outcome for the 
2020-23 LTIP was 58.46% of maximum. 

The Committee believes that the STIP and LTIP outcomes 
are appropriate, taking into account the performance of the 
Company in the year and the strong recovery of the business 
over the three-year LTIP performance period.

Appointment of Eoin Tonge
In the year, the Committee finalised the terms of buy-out 
awards in place of awards forfeited by Eoin Tonge at his 
previous employer, Marks and Spencer (‘M&S’), upon his 
appointment as Finance Director of ABF. These awards, 
along with their terms, were disclosed in last year’s Directors’ 
Remuneration Report. Three of these awards vested in July 
2023. Details of these can be found on page 111.

Remuneration decisions for 2023/24
Salary and fees
In ABF’s decentralised model, each business is given flexibility 
to determine its own salary increases and there is no single 
budgeted increase rate for UK employees. We assess that our 
average UK salary increases will be 9.2% including hourly-paid 
Primark staff, and 4.7% if hourly-paid Primark staff are excluded. 
In this context, the Committee has determined that for 2023/24, 
the executive directors will receive salary increases of 4.5%, 
below the average increase for the wider employee population. 

STIP 2023/24
For 2023/24, the financial measures under the STIP remain 
the same as those used in 2022/23, with a modest rebalancing 
towards EBIT performance versus working capital. Strategic 
measures, focused on ESG, will continue to represent 15% 
of the total measures.

Restricted Share Plan (RSP) 2023-26
The shareholder-approved 2022 Remuneration Policy included a 
move from LTIP awards to RSP awards for those in Group roles. 
In line with shareholder expectations, the RSP awards represent 
a 50% reduction in award opportunity compared to the previous 
LTIP awards. 

ABF has operated a conservative overall incentive quantum for 
many years, with the maximum LTIP award level having been 
set at 200% of salary since 2010. Recognising the modest level 
of our incentive packages, the 2016 and 2019 remuneration 
policies included headroom for LTIP awards to be increased up 
to 300% of salary for new hires.

As disclosed last year, the recruitment of Eoin Tonge as Finance 
Director afforded an opportunity to test the competitiveness 
of senior level remuneration at ABF. As anticipated, use of the 
policy headroom was required and an LTIP opportunity of 250% 
of salary was needed to secure Eoin in the role. Under the 
2022 Remuneration Policy, this translated to an RSP award 
of 125% of salary.

Reliance on this policy headroom to successfully recruit a new 
Finance Director caused the Committee last year to consider 
an increase in the maximum opportunity for the Chief Executive 
to an LTIP of 250% or an RSP award of 125% of salary. At that 
time, the Chief Executive requested that this increase be 
deferred. As a result, his RSP opportunity for 2022-25 was 
100% of salary.

This year, the Committee again reviewed market data and 
internal relativities, and concluded that it would be inappropriate 
to continue awarding RSP awards to the Chief Executive at a 
lower level than those awarded to the Finance Director. Recent 
market data reveals that an RSP award of 100% of salary is not 
competitive, with ABF having the joint lowest opportunity within 
a comparator group of similar sized UK listed companies.

The Annual Remuneration Report is subject to an advisory 
vote at the 2023 AGM.

Dear shareholders
In this first letter as the new Remuneration Committee Chair, 
I am pleased to present the Directors’ Remuneration Report for 
the year to 16 September 2023. I would like to acknowledge 
Ruth Cairnie’s extensive work as the previous Committee Chair 
and to thank her for her support with the transition.

Work of the Committee in 2022/23
The role of the Committee includes incentivising strong 
business performance and appropriately rewarding contributions 
to the Company’s long-term success. We are pleased that the 
2022 Remuneration Policy, which was based on these 
principles, received support from more than 92% of 
shareholders at the 2022 AGM. 

The Committee has, as part of its regular work, reviewed the 
policy based outcomes under the annual short-term incentive 
plan (STIP) and the long-term incentive plan (LTIP), as well as 
consulting with shareholders on the proposed restricted 
share plan (RSP) award level for the Chief Executive for 
2023-26 onwards. 

The chart below shows the LTIP opportunities in the FTSE 
15 – 45 (excluding Financial Services) with awards subject to 
performance conditions discounted by 50% to allow for ready 
comparison to the RSP, alongside the current and proposed 
opportunities at ABF:

From 2023/24 onwards, we plan to make RSP awards at 125% 
of salary to both executive directors. This remains modest 
compared to other companies of our scale. 

As part of the normal consultation process we engaged with 
22 of our largest shareholders on this proposal. No significant 
concerns have been raised with the Committee in the course 
of these consultations.

Consideration of wider workforce views and 
remuneration approaches
The Group is geographically dispersed and subject to quite 
different employment market conditions, both of which 
complicate meaningful comparisons against wider workforce 
compensation. However, the Committee is mindful of reward 
practices across the Group when setting and implementing its 
approach to executive remuneration. The Committee receives 
data on the remuneration structure for two tiers of management 
below the executive directors and uses this information to 
ensure as much consistency of approach as is practicable.

Divisional HR directors provided input to the most recent 
remuneration policy review and they also share, on an ongoing 
basis, feedback they receive from employees on remuneration. 
Richard Reid, a member of the Committee, engages with 
employees through his work as the Non-Executive Director 
for workforce engagement and specifically affords them an 
opportunity to share their views on pay and conditions. 
This feedback is shared fully with the Committee. We have also 
created an email inbox (remcochair@abfoods.com) to enable 
employees and other stakeholders to share directly their views 
on the Company’s executive remuneration approach should 
they so wish.

2023 AGM
This year the Committee has maintained its approach of aligning 
compensation with business performance and the shareholder 
experience. I hope that you will feel able to support our 
Directors’ Remuneration Report at the 2023 AGM.

DIRECTORS’ REMUNERATION REPORT CONTINUED

Remuneration summary/at a glance
Remuneration principles
Our remuneration approach needs to support efforts to attract and retain top executive talent and to promote the strategic and 
financial performance of the business. Our principles, which are consistent with the requirements of Provision 40 of the UK Corporate 
Governance Code, are considered in the Committee’s decision making. We believe that pay should be:

Fair
Total remuneration should fairly 
reflect the performance delivered 
by executives. Where appropriate, 
this may include the application 
of discretion to ensure remuneration 
outcomes are aligned to performance 
that creates value for shareholders 
and other stakeholders

Aligned
The portfolio we operate is diverse and 
complex. We aim to align remuneration 
and business objectives and to use 
performance measures which provide 
clear line of sight for executives

Clear & simple
We believe that executive 
remuneration should be clear and 
simple for participants to understand. 
The best way to achieve this is through 
close alignment with business 
performance

Remuneration approach
The Remuneration Policy for the executive directors, approved by shareholders last year, includes the following elements:

Base salary

Pension and 
benefits

Short-Term 
Incentive Plan (STIP)

Restricted Share 
Plan (RSP)

Shareholding 
requirement

Base salary set at an 
appropriate level for ABF’s 
size and scale

The Chief Executive will 
opt out of his current 
EFRBS and will not 
receive a cash allowance 
thereafter

The Finance Director 
receives a cash allowance 
of 10% of salary aligned 
with other employees

Maximum of 200% 
of salary 

Normal annual RSP award 
of 125% of salary

(Up to 150% of salary 
cash, and 50% of salary 
STIP shares)

Set at 250% of salary, 
retained for 2 years after 
leaving employment

The policy worked as intended this year and outcomes are in line with performance. The full Remuneration Policy wording is set out 
in the 2022 Annual Report and Accounts which is available on the Company’s website https://www.abf.co.uk

STIP and RSP payments are subject to malus and clawback provisions.

Performance alignment
Reward in Group and business roles – Group roles, including the executive directors, are granted RSP awards. This structure is 
consistent with their responsibility for managing the portfolio to achieve sustainable growth in shareholder value. Performance-based 
LTIPs are used at division and business level where tangible and directly relevant targets are set.

STIP performance measures – STIP performance is based on financial measures (adjusted operating profit and working capital) 
and a portion based on strategic measures including ESG. 

RSP underpins – The RSP underpins are intended to avoid rewards for failure. The underpins ensure a disciplined approach 
to investment (ROACE), alignment with shareholders (dividends), strategic focus for future sustainable growth, good governance 
and meaningful progress on the ESG agenda.

Discretion and judgement – In line with the principle of fairness, the Committee has a long history of applying discretion both to 
increase and reduce incentive outcomes to ensure that they ‘feel fair’ given the circumstances and achievements across our portfolio, 
consistent with our established remuneration principles.

Shareholder voting and engagement
We were pleased last year that 92.37% of those voting supported our new remuneration policy and that 99.11% supported the 
Directors’ Remuneration Report, as shown below.

Notes to single total figure of remuneration for the executive directors

Salary
For George Weston, the salary paid is reduced for pension-related salary sacrifices. The benefit of these salary sacrifices is captured 
in the increase in pension entitlements for which a remuneration value is shown in the pensions row.

Benefits
The value of benefits for George Weston comprised £15,656 taken in cash and £2,114 taxed as benefits-in-kind; for Eoin Tonge 
comprised £15,197 taken in cash and £1,363 taxed as benefits-in-kind; and for John Bason benefits comprised £9,725 taken in cash 
and £1,001 taxed as benefits-in-kind.

Pension
In 2022/23 George Weston had an overall benefit promise of 1/45th of final pensionable pay for each year of pensionable service up 
to 5 April 2016 and 1/50th of final pensionable pay for each year of pensionable service thereafter, subject to a maximum of 2/3rds of 
final pensionable pay (basic salary during the last 12 months before retirement, plus if applicable, the average of the last three years’ 
fluctuating earnings). He opted out of the Associated British Foods Pension Scheme on 5 April 2006 and has a deferred benefit in that 
scheme; the balance of the promise is provided under an EFRBS. His pension benefits are payable from age 65. No alternative defined 
benefit arrangements are available to any member who chooses to take their benefits early. His accrued pension at 16 September 
2023 was £754,991 per annum. George Weston will opt out of the EFRBS on 31 December 2023.

While the nature of George Weston’s pension benefits has not changed during the year, the pensions number for remuneration 
purposes is £0 as inflation exceeded salary increases in the year.

Eoin Tonge received a cash allowance of 10% of salary in lieu of pension, which is reported under the pensions section in the single 
figure table for clarity. Between 24 April 2019 and 31 December 2022, John Bason received a cash supplement of 25% of salary 
in lieu of pension contributions. This reduced to 10% of salary from 1 January 2023.

At the start of the year, the Company was facing extreme market volatility and significant cost inflation. Given the challenging 
trading environment, adjusted operating profit was expected to be lower than in 2021/22. As explained on page 100, the Company 
successfully navigated these headwinds. For the Group overall, this strong all-round performance resulted in adjusted operating profit 
finishing ahead of last year and ahead of the maximum of the STIP performance range. However, working capital levels were impacted 
by supply chain challenges and inflationary pressures and the threshold for the working capital modifier was not met. Accordingly, 
the overall outcome under the financial performance measures for this year is 66.67% of maximum. 

Achievement against ESG strategic KPIs
This year our STIP strategic KPIs were all related to ESG. In our diversified Group, ESG-related targets are set by the businesses based 
on their material risks and what is relevant and achievable for them. As detailed in our TCFD report, our most material businesses 
each have their own emissions reduction targets.

We are committed to a range of sustainability goals, including reaching net zero by 2050, and believe that the best way to incentivise 
management to deliver this is by setting targets in their short-term incentive plans linked to the delivery of key projects. In our TCFD 
report we have included transition plans for ABF Sugar and Primark as they contribute most significantly to adjusted operating profit 
and total GHG emissions.

In line with our governance model, we have assessed the STIP outcome taking into account progress in four key areas, as set out 
in the table below. The targets set were demanding and tightly-aligned with our approach to ESG. Against a scorecard of measures, 
the overall score achieved was 21/30, 70% of the maximum for this element.

The Committee also considered our progress on ESG in the round, ensuring that our ESG governance approach is robust, that each 
operating division has its own ESG framework and increasing understanding of future legislation and implications for reporting. 
The Committee concluded that progress had been good and was therefore satisfied that 21/30 (70%) was a fair outcome.

The 2022-25 STIP shares element was subject to the same performance conditions as the cash element. 67.17% of the shares that 
were allocated at the beginning of the performance period will vest in 2025, subject to a service condition. The remaining allocated 
shares have now lapsed. The number of shares vesting is shown on page 111.

STIP amounts included in the single total figure table
For 2022/23, the figures shown in the single total figure table comprise the annual cash bonus, which is paid in December in respect 
of the preceding financial year, and the value of deferred share awards, earned for performance in the 2022/23 financial year, calculated 
based on the average mid-market closing price over the last quarter of the financial year of 2,008.02p. These shares are subject to 
a two-year deferral period. 20.6% of the value of the deferred awards is attributable to share price appreciation as the share price 
has increased from 1,665.3p at allocation in December 2022. No value is included in respect of the STIP deferred shares based on 
performance in 2020/21 and vesting in November 2023 as these values were required to be reported in the 2020/21 annual report. 
The directors are also paid dividend equivalents in respect of vested shares. These are not included in the single total figure as the 
amounts do not relate to the periods being reported on. 

For 2021/22, this figure comprises the annual cash bonus, which was paid in December 2022 in respect of the preceding financial 
year, and the value of deferred share awards, earned for performance in the 2021/22 financial year, calculated based on the average 
mid-market closing price over the last quarter of the 2021/22 financial year of 1,580.52p. These shares are subject to a two-year 
deferral period. These values are not updated to reflect vesting share price as the awards have not yet vested. None of this value is 
attributable to share price appreciation as the share price decreased in the 2021/22 financial year. The directors are also paid dividend 
equivalents in respect of vested shares. These are not included in the single total figure as the amounts do not relate to the periods 
being reported on.

LTIP 2020–23
Boosted by a strong post-COVID recovery, the EPS performance for the 2020-23 LTIP was just ahead of target. The Group three-year 
average ROACE without Sugar exceeded the maximum level. The four-year average Sugar ROACE outcome was just below the 
maximum level. Note that the Group ROACE without Sugar modifier and the Sugar ROACE modifier act only as downward modifiers 
to the calculated incentive outcomes. The overall formulaic outcome for the 2020-23 LTIP was 58.46% of maximum, as shown in the 
table below.

LTIP amounts included in the single total figure table
The numbers in the single total figure table reflect the number of shares vesting. George Weston will receive 63,063 shares and John 
Bason will receive 35,870 shares. As required by UK regulations, the vesting value for 2020–23 has been estimated using the 
mid-market closing price over the last quarter of 2022/23 of 2,008.02p. Vesting will be on 20 November 2023 and a figure recalculated 
for the share price on that date will be presented in the 2023/24 annual report. The values shown in the table also include an amount 
in respect of cash dividend equivalent payments that will be made in respect of the shares vesting. The amount included for George 
Weston is £62,054 and for John Bason is £35,296. None of the amount shown is in respect of an increase in share price as the price 
used in the calculation is below the allocation price.

None of the shares under the LTIP for 2019–22 vested in November 2022.

Other
The values shown for other remuneration in the single total figure table for Eoin Tonge are:

•  the buyout awards made to replace awards that he held in M&S of 96,210 shares, which vested on 3 July 2023 at a price of 

2,006.7p; and

•  £440,605 in cash made as a buyout award in respect of the M&S STIP he forfeited on joining ABF.

Pension

The Group has a wide variety of pension arrangements in place and a history of honouring the 
commitments we make to individuals at appointment. Our UK defined benefit pension scheme remains 
open to future accrual for members who joined the Group before it closed to new members.

George Weston participates in an EFRBS designed to replicate benefits under the UK defined benefit 
scheme. Whilst this is consistent with others who joined the Group at a similar time, it is different from the 
wider workforce of more recent recruits who participate in a defined contribution scheme.

In 2021/22 George Weston agreed that his EFRBS participation would end on 31 December 2023. He will 
then opt out of the EFRBS and become a deferred member of the Scheme. Thereafter he will receive no 
further EFRBS accruals from the Group, nor will he receive a cash allowance in lieu of pension contributions.

Eoin Tonge will receive a cash supplement of 10% of salary in lieu of pension contributions, in line with the 
approach for the wider ABF UK workforce.

The financial measures remain the same as in 2022/23, with a modest rebalancing in weighting towards 
EBIT performance.

STIP share awards will be granted in November 2023 and will lapse at the end of the financial year to the 
extent that performance conditions have not been met. The balance of the shares will remain conditional 
and be deferred for a further two years. 

Malus and clawback provisions apply to STIP awards for up to two years after being paid. 

Restricted share awards will be granted in November 2023. At the Committee’s discretion, vesting may 
be reduced if the following underpins are not met:

•  ROACE above the weighted average cost of capital;
•  dividend payments maintained;
•  consideration of whether the right actions have been taken to strengthen ABF’s competitive position for 
long-term sustainable growth. Performance will be assessed in the round. The underpin will be deemed 
to not be met in the event that there is an identified and agreed specific management failure; and

•  satisfactory governance performance including no ESG issues that result in material reputational damage 

(as determined by the Board).

A two-year post-vesting holding period applies to net of tax shares. Malus and clawback provisions apply for 
two years post-vesting.

George Weston’s shareholding very significantly exceeds the 250% of salary requirement.

Eoin Tonge’s shareholding does not yet meet the requirement and at least 50% of net shares vested under 
the STIP and RSP awards as well as 50% of net shares vested under certain new joiner awards must be 
held by him until it is met.

Wider Workforce Remuneration
Fair pay
Associated British Foods is a diversified business that currently operates in 55 countries and employs 133,000 people working across 
five business segments. Our people are central to our business and we pride ourselves on being a first-class employer. 

As an international business, we have a duty to operate responsibly and are keen to ensure that the people who work in our 
businesses are paid fairly. We support the work of governments to ensure that minimum wages are sufficient to allow employees 
to have an acceptable standard of living. Our businesses, each of which is responsible for setting and managing its own remuneration 
approach, operate in line with the principles set out below and in compliance with all local laws.

Pay should be…

Appropriate

For the employee’s role, 
experience and skills

Fixed pay will meet/exceed 
legal minimum and 
appropriate industry 
standards (e.g. collective 
bargaining agreements)

Free from 
discrimination

Pay should not be impacted 
by an individual’s age, 
gender, sexual orientation, 
ethnicity or other 
characteristics

Intuitive

Explainable

Market competitive

Employees should always 
receive compensation 
regularly, in full and on time

The business should be 
able to explain how pay 
has been calculated so that 
it is easy to understand

Local market conditions 
(industry/location/cost of 
living) should be considered 
when setting pay levels

Workforce engagement on remuneration
Please see the Remuneration Committee Chair’s letter on pages 100 and 101 for more information on how the Committee 
communicates with the wider workforce.

Inflation and wider workforce remuneration
This year has seen exceptionally high inflation in the UK, with the lowest paid workers disproportionately impacted. In our 
decentralised model, the salary management approach varies from business to business but all have targeted higher rates of salary 
increase to our more junior employees. Many have also paid temporary allowances or made specific additional payments to lower paid 
colleagues to assist them with the additional costs they are facing.

This year we have updated our Health, Safety and Wellbeing Policy to include a greater focus on mental health and wellbeing. 
In addition, many of our businesses have reviewed their financial wellness activities to help protect employees from financial shocks. 
96% of our people have access to an EAP to support their wellbeing. More information on the actions our businesses take to support 
employees’ wellbeing can be found in our Responsibility Report.

DIRECTORS’ REMUNERATION REPORT CONTINUED

Directors’ Pay in the Context of the Group’s Wider Pay Practices
The Committee has regard to workforce remuneration and related policies across the Group and ensured alignment of incentives and 
reward with the Company’s culture when determining the 2022 Policy for directors. The table below summarises the remuneration 
structure for the wider workforce.

Salary

STIP

Below the Board

Salary increase budgets are determined by each of the businesses for each 
country, taking into account country-specific conditions such as inflation. 
Salary increases are then determined by line managers based on factors 
such as development in role and local market practice. Salaries are 
benchmarked to ensure that we are able to recruit and retain talented people.

We review the ratio of the Chief Executive’s pay to that of our UK employees 
on page 109

In our decentralised model the approach to incentives varies by division. 
This is consistent with our line of sight approach and ensures design is 
appropriate for the strategy of each business and market. There is a common 
governance framework, with central oversight, for signing off all changes to 
incentive design to ensure that risks are mitigated and cultural considerations 
are appropriately taken into account.

Key performance measures of adjusted operating profit, working capital, ESG 
targets and personal performance are commonly used across the Group.

As employees progress and are promoted, their target and maximum bonus 
opportunities increase.

LTIP

We make share-based LTIP or RSP awards to around 200 of our most senior 
managers across the Group to support the remuneration philosophy of 
incentivising superior long-term business results and shareholder value creation.

The performance measures for around a third of participants are aligned fully 
or partially to those of the executive directors. For other participants, the 
appropriate measures are agreed with the individual business to reflect the 
strategy and role in the portfolio of the business. Measures include profit 
growth, returns, working capital management and strategic objectives e.g. 
related to business transformation or ESG priorities.

We also operate a cash LTIP to ensure long-term incentivisation for a wider 
population of senior managers and to reward performance in businesses, 
where relevant long-term targets can be set.

All of our LTIPs have a performance period of at least three years with some 
being up to five years. Awards are made as a percentage of base salary.

Pension

A pension/provident fund is offered to our employees in line with local market 
requirements and practices. Exceptions to this are countries where pension 
provision is not prevalent in the local market and/or is provided by the state.

In the UK, newly appointed employees and executives of all ABF companies 
are entitled to receive a Company pension contribution that matches their own 
contribution to a maximum of 10% of salary. They are eligible to take some 
or all of this as a cash alternative if subject to the lifetime or annual allowance.

In certain countries, including the UK and Ireland, longer-serving employees 
continue to participate in and accrue benefits under defined benefit pension 
schemes which are closed to new members.

In our decentralised model, we expect our businesses to ensure that core 
benefits provided to employees in each country remain appropriate and local 
market competitive. For example, in the African sugar businesses, outside 
South Africa, we have on site clinics/hospitals (dependent on country) 
available to employees and their families to ensure that they have access to 
healthcare. In other locations such provision may be through the state or may 
be covered by insurances that we offer as a benefit to employees.

Benefits

Executive directors

Salary increases as a percentage 
of salary are normally aligned with, 
or lower than, those of the 
wider workforce.

Consistent with the wider workforce, 
salaries are set competitively against 
peers in support of the recruitment 
and retention of executive directors.

The STIP for executive directors 
is primarily based on the financial 
performance of the Company. 
15% of the STIP is based on 
ESG performance.

STIP share awards are made for 
25% of the total STIP payment and 
are deferred for a further two years 
after the performance condition 
has been met.

Executive directors’ LTIP grants up 
to 2021 were subject to achievement 
of EPS and ROACE performance 
conditions.

From 2022 the LTIP was replaced 
with an RSP, granted by reference to 
a percentage of salary that is half the 
amount of an equivalent LTIP award 
and which vest provided underpins 
are met.

Vested shares are subject to 
a two-year holding period.

Newly appointed executive directors 
are eligible to receive a Company 
pension contribution of up to 10% 
of salary in line with the wider 
workforce in the UK. They are 
eligible to take some or all of this 
as a cash alternative if subject to 
the lifetime or annual allowance. 

Executive directors receive benefits 
which consist primarily of the 
provision of a company car/allowance 
and health cover.

In addition, executive directors are 
eligible for benefits available to 
the wider head office workforce. 

CEO Pay Ratio

2018/19

We have chosen to use Option B of the available methodologies 
to calculate our CEO Pay Ratio. Given the complexity of our 
Group, this approach enables us to use existing gender pay 
data for Great Britain (GB) as a foundation for our calculations. 
We determined the hourly rates at each quartile of our 5 April 
2023 gender pay data then calculated the average annual salary 
and total remuneration for each quartile as each point represents 
multiple individuals. We pro-rated the data for part-time individuals 
to reflect full-time equivalent remuneration and excluded 
leavers from the calculation.

Those at the lower quartile data point are Primark and Allied 
Bakeries employees, at median they are from Primark, 
Speedibake and Vivergo and at upper quartile they are from 
Speedibake, Primark, Allied Bakeries, Westmill and SilverSpoon.

The increase in the pay ratio reflects the increase in incentive 
outcomes this year for the Chief Executive. We are pleased 
that the remuneration levels for our GB-based employees have 
increased year-on-year by 11.7% at the median.

Whilst based on data for GB only, this year’s pay ratio reflects 
the relationship between the Chief Executive’s pay and the 
experience of UK employees as a whole. Many of our early 
career employees are in Primark and this affects the data, with 
those in the food businesses typically later in their careers and 
with remuneration at higher levels in line with their skills 
and experience.

1.  George Weston and John Bason’s salary rates increased by 3.5%, a lower increase rate than for other head office employees, whose standard increase was 6%. 

The lower increase shown in the table reflects an increase in the number of more junior roles in the head office.

2.  The NED fee increased from £76,000 to £78,250 in December 2022.
3.  Michael McLintock’s fee increased to £440,000 in December 2022.
4.  The Committee Chair fee increased from £23,500 to £27,000 in December 2022 and the Senior Independent Director fee increased from £21,000 to £24,500 in 
December 2022. There was no change to other additional responsibility fees in the period, but the change in base NED fee detailed in note 2 applies to these 
roles.

5.  Benefits data is calculated on the same basis as the benefits data in the single total figure table on page 103 and includes benefits in kind and benefits taken 
in cash but excludes any pension allowances. The reduction in benefits for the average employee reflects a reduction of the number of employees eligible 
for a company car.

6.  Includes cash STIP payments only.
7.  The numbers for 2022 have been restated to correct an error in the 2022 disclosure, which led to the salary and benefits increases being understated and 

the STIP increase overstated for the average employee.

DIRECTORS’ REMUNERATION REPORT CONTINUED

2023 Gender pay gap reporting
Women comprise 55% of our total global workforce. We have chosen to report on the gender pay gap that relates to our employee 
population in Great Britain (GB) as of 5 April 2023. However, more than half of our workforce is employed outside Great Britain and is 
not included in this analysis. Consistent with last year we have presented data for the whole Group and for the Group without Primark.

Gender pay and bonus gaps are calculated by comparing the mean (average) and median (central value in the data list) measures for women to that of men and 
identifying the percentage difference between the two. As required by the UK Equality Act 2010 (Gender Pay Gap Information) Regulations 2017, we submit data 
for our relevant legal entities to the UK Government through their website.

Group
The Group pay gap has improved, though it remains in favour 
of men. A significant number of female employees work as 
retail assistants, with 77.2% of roles in the lower pay quartile 
taken by women. Whilst men take up more of the highest 
paid roles, we are pleased that the proportion of women in the 
upper quartile is increasing, reducing the pay gap. 

One of the Company’s strengths is that business leaders have 
detailed knowledge of every aspect of their organisation. That 
knowledge often comes from many years in role. Institutional 
memory is critical in our decentralised operating model. 

Whilst the gender balance at the top of the Group is changing, 
it is slow due to long tenure. Balancing long tenure, fresh 
external insights and the need for diverse thinking is a focus 
across our businesses. We support new colleagues to build 
strong internal networks so that they can more quickly 
understand the organisation.

Proportion of men and women in each pay quartile

The greater presence of senior men in the bonus pool has a 
distorting effect on the mean bonus gap. The median bonus 
gap, which includes recognition awards, is in favour of women. 
Recognition awards are smaller in quantum and often given to 
men with long service in the manufacturing environment. They 
are compared to bonuses for women in middle management.

Non-retail businesses
In the non-retail businesses the pay gap remains in favour of 
women as we have a significant majority of male employees in 
the food businesses who work in a manufacturing environment. 
These employees are being compared to women who, on 
average, work in middle management. 

Primark
The Primark gender pay data can be found on their website. 
At median we have only a 1.4% pay gap in Primark.

Responsibility Report.

2.  George Weston is a director of Wittington Investments Limited which, together with its subsidiary Howard Investments Limited, held 431,515,108 ordinary 

shares in Associated British Foods plc as at 16 September 2023.

3.  Beneficially owned shares are shown as at retirement date.
4.  Prior year restated to reflect revised approach of including only the element of STIP shares that is subject to a holding condition. Adjustment for George Weston 

is 4,177,101 shares minus 76,303 (the full amount of STIP shares shown on page 143 of the 2022 Annual Report) plus 26,850 (the number of STIP shares 
subject to a service condition). Adjustment for John Bason is 479,612 shares minus 50,767 plus 17,913. This methodology is then consistent with the numbers 
shown for unvested deferred awards and total shares for 2023.

Executive Director departures and appointments
Appointment of Eoin Tonge as Finance Director
Our approach to remuneration for Eoin Tonge was set out in detail on page 146 of the 2022 annual report. The details of RSP and 
buyout awards made to him can be found in the share allocation tables on page 111.

Retirement of John Bason as Finance Director
John Bason retired on 28 April 2023 and was determined to be a good leaver. He remains subject to the following shareholding 
requirements:

•  any shares vesting under the LTIP need to be retained, net of tax, for a further two years from the vesting date; and
•  a personal holding of ABF shares to the value of 250% of salary must be maintained until 28 April 2025. Shares that are subject 

to a holding period post-vesting count towards this 250% shareholding requirement.

Details of the approach applied for incentive awards can be found on page 147 of our 2022 Annual Report. 

Payments to past directors and payments for loss of office (audited information)
The only payments made to John Bason in relation to his role as Finance Director since his retirement are those noted above 
in respect of his participation in incentive schemes up to his leaving date.

No payments for loss of office were made in the year.

Executive directors serving as non-executive directors
To encourage self-development and external insight, the Committee has determined that, with the consent of both the Chairman and 
the Chief Executive, executive directors may serve as non-executive directors of other companies in an individual capacity, retaining 
any fees earned. Neither individual currently holds such other roles.

The Chairman was considered independent on appointment and, as such, is a member of the Committee. George Weston 
(Chief Executive), Sue Whalley (Chief People and Performance Officer), and Julie Withnall (Group Director of Reward) attend the 
meetings of the Committee. No individual is present when their own remuneration is considered.

Role of the Committee
The Committee is responsible to the Board for determining:

•  the remuneration policy for the executive directors and Chairman, considering internal and external trends on remuneration;
•  the overall policy for remuneration of the Chief Executive’s direct reports;
•  the design and monitoring of the operation of any Company share plans;
•  stretching performance targets for executive directors to encourage enhanced performance;
•  an approach that fairly and responsibly rewards contribution to the Company’s long-term success; and
•  the specific terms and conditions of employment of each executive director, ensuring that contractual terms and payments made 

on termination are fair to the individual and Company, that failure is not rewarded and loss is mitigated.

The Committee’s remit is set out in detail in its terms of reference, which are reviewed regularly to ensure that they are compliant 
with the latest corporate governance requirements and were most recently updated in November 2022. They are available from the 
corporate governance section of our website at www.abf.co.uk. 

Remuneration Committee advisers and fees
Following a competitive tender the Committee appointed Deloitte LLP (Deloitte) in March 2020 to provide independent advice to the 
Committee. Deloitte are members of the Remuneration Consultants Group and adhere to its Code of Conduct in relation to executive 
remuneration consulting. The Committee is satisfied that the advice it received in the year was objective and independent. This advice 
included independent meetings with the Committee Chair during the year. During the year, other services that Deloitte provided to 
the Company were corporate and employment tax advice, advice related to transactions, and risk and controls-related advisory work. 
The fees paid to Deloitte for Committee assistance over the past financial year totalled £76,500.

Herbert Smith Freehills LLP and Addleshaw Goddard LLP provide the Company with legal advice. Their advice is made available 
to the Committee, where it relates to matters within its remit.

Compliance
Where information in this report has been audited by Ernst & Young LLP, it has been clearly indicated. The report has been prepared 
in line with the requirements of The Large and Medium-sized Companies Regulations (as amended), the recommendations of the UK 
Corporate Governance Code (July 2018) and the requirements of the UKLA Listing Rules.

Company’s principal decisions (pages 40 to 45; 50 and 51; 
84 to 85);

•  information on how the directors have had regard to the need 

to foster the Company’s business relationships with 
suppliers, customers and others and the effect of that regard, 
including on the principal decisions taken by the Company 
during the year (pages 40 to 55); and

•  the Corporate Governance Statement (pages 78 to 115).

Results and dividends
The consolidated income statement is on page 128. Proﬁt for 
the ﬁnancial year attributable to equity shareholders amounted 
to £1,044m.

The directors recommend a final dividend of 33.1p per ordinary 
share to be paid, subject to shareholder approval, on 12 January 
2024. Together with the interim dividend of 14.2p per share paid 
on 7 July 2023, this amounts to 47.3p for the year. See page 
147 for the note on dividends. In addition, a special dividend 
of 12.7p is proposed by the directors as an interim dividend 
which will also be paid on 12 January 2024 to holders of 
ordinary shares on the register at the close of business on 
15 December 2023. Shareholder approval for this special 
dividend is not required.

Directors
The names of the persons who were directors of the Company 
during the ﬁnancial year and as at 7 November 2023 appear 
on page 87.

Appointment of directors
The Articles give directors the power to appoint and replace 
directors. Under the terms of reference of the Nomination 
Committee, any appointment must be recommended 
by the Nomination Committee for approval by the Board. 
A person who is not recommended by the directors may only 
be appointed as a director where details of that director have 
been provided at least seven and not more than 35 days prior to 
the relevant meeting by at least two members of the Company.

The Articles require all directors to retire and seek re-election at 
each AGM in line with the 2018 Code.

Details of unexpired terms of directors’ service contracts are set 
out in the Directors’ Remuneration Report on page 149.

Power of directors
The directors are responsible for managing the business of the 
Company and may exercise all the powers of the Company 
subject to the provisions of relevant statutes, to any directions 
given by special resolution and to the Articles. The Articles, for 
example, contain speciﬁc provisions and restrictions concerning 
the Company’s power to borrow money. Powers relating to the 
issuing of shares are also included in the Articles and such 
authorities are renewed by shareholders at the AGM each year.

Directors’ indemnities and insurance
The directors of a subsidiary company that acts as trustee of 
a pension scheme benefited from a qualifying pension scheme 
indemnity provision during the ﬁnancial year and at the date 
of this report.

The Company has in place appropriate directors’ and ofﬁcers’ 
liability insurance cover in respect of legal action against its 
executive and non-executive directors, amongst others.

Directors’ share interests
Details regarding the share interests of the directors (and their 
persons closely associated) in the share capital of the Company,

Paragraphs (1), (2), (5), (6), (7), (8), (9), (10) and (11) of Listing Rule 9.8.4R 
are not applicable. 

Relationship agreement with controlling 
shareholders
Any person who exercises or controls, on their own or together 
with any person with whom they are acting in concert, 30% 
or more of the votes able to be cast at general meetings of 
a company is known as a ‘controlling shareholder’ under 
the Listing Rules. The Listing Rules require companies with 
controlling shareholders to enter into an agreement which 
is intended to ensure that the controlling shareholders comply 
with certain independence provisions in the Listing Rules and 
which must contain undertakings that:

•  transactions and arrangements with the controlling 

shareholder (and/or any of its associates) will be conducted 
at arm’s length and on normal commercial terms;

•  neither the controlling shareholder nor any of its associates 
will take any action that would have the effect of preventing 
the listed company from complying with its obligations under 
the Listing Rules; and

•  neither the controlling shareholder nor any of its associates 

will propose or procure the proposal of a shareholder 
resolution which is intended or appears to be intended to 
circumvent the proper application of the Listing Rules.

Wittington Investments Limited (‘Wittington’) and, through 
their control of Wittington, the trustees of the Garﬁeld Weston 
Foundation (the ’Foundation’) are controlling shareholders of the 
Company. Certain other individuals, including certain members 
of the Weston family who hold shares in the Company (and 
including two of the Company’s directors, George Weston and 
Emma Adamo) are, under the Listing Rules, treated as acting in 
concert with Wittington and the trustees of the Foundation and 
are therefore also treated as controlling shareholders of the 
Company. Wittington, the trustees of the Foundation and these 
individuals together comprise the controlling shareholders of 
the Company and, as at 16 September 2023, had a combined 
interest in approximately 59.8% of the Company’s voting rights.

The Board conﬁrms that, in accordance with the Listing Rules, 
on 14 November 2014 the Company entered into a relationship 
agreement with Wittington and the trustees of the Foundation 
containing the required undertakings (the ‘Relationship 
Agreement’ as most recently amended and restated on 
3 November 2022).

Under the terms of the Relationship Agreement, Wittington 
has agreed to procure compliance with the undertakings by the 
other individuals who are treated as controlling shareholders 
(the ‘Non-signing Controlling Shareholders’). The Board conﬁrms 
that, during the period under review:

•  the Company has complied with the independence provisions 

included in the Relationship Agreement;

•  so far as the Company is aware, the independence provisions 
included in the Relationship Agreement have been complied 
with by the controlling shareholders and their associates; and
•  so far as the Company is aware, the procurement obligation 

included in the Relationship Agreement as regards 
compliance with the independence provisions by the 
Non-signing Controlling Shareholders and their associates, 
has been complied with by Wittington.

The Company is a premium listed company on the London 
Stock Exchange and, under the Listing Rules, is required to 
carry on an independent business as its main activity. 

Major interests in shares
During the period under review, and up until 3 November 2023, 
the Company received the following formal notifications under 
the Disclosure Guidance and Transparency Rules of material 
interests in its shares:

Further details of the Company’s controlling shareholders for 
the purpose of the Listing Rules who, as at 16 September 2023, 
had a combined interest in approximately 59.8% of the voting 
rights are set out above.

Share capital
Details of the Company’s share capital and the rights attached 
to the Company’s shares are set out in note 22 on page 162. 
The Company has one class of share capital: ordinary shares 
of 515/22p. The rights and obligations attaching to these shares 
are governed by English law and the Articles.

No shareholder holds securities carrying special rights with 
regard to the control of the Company. There are no restrictions 
on voting rights.

There are no restrictions on the holding or transfer of the ordinary 
shares other than the standard restrictions for an English 
incorporated company.

Authority to issue shares
At the last AGM, held on 9 December 2022, authority was given 
to the directors to allot shares in the Company up to an aggregate 
nominal amount equivalent to two thirds of the shares in issue 
(of which one third must be offered by way of rights issue). 
This authority expires on the date of this year’s AGM to be 
held on 8 December 2023. No such shares have been issued. 
The directors propose to renew this authority at the 2023 AGM 
for the forthcoming year.

A further special resolution passed at the 2022 AGM granted 
authority to the directors to allot equity securities in the Company 
for cash, without regard to the pre-emption provisions of the 
Companies Act 2006 in certain circumstances. This authority 
also expires on the date of the 2023 AGM and the directors will 
seek to renew this authority for the forthcoming year. 

Authority to purchase own shares
The Companies Act 2006 empowers the Company to purchase 
its own shares subject to the necessary shareholder approval. 
At the last AGM, authority was given to the directors to allow 
the Company to purchase its own shares. This authority expires 
on the date of this year’s AGM. The directors propose to renew 
this authority at the 2023 AGM for the forthcoming year.

On 9 November 2022, the Company commenced a share 
buyback programme in order to reduce the capital of the 
Company. That buyback programme completed on 27 October 
2023, the Company having purchased 26,478,215 of its ordinary 
shares of 515/22p (being 3.3% of called-up share capital) for a 
total consideration of £499,999,929. All such shares were 
subsequently cancelled. Further details of the Company’s share 
capital are set out on page 162.

Amendment to Articles
Any amendments to the Articles may be made in accordance 
with the provisions of the Companies Act 2006 by way of 
special resolution of the shareholders.

DIRECTORS’ REPORT CONTINUED

Signiﬁcant agreements – change of control
The Group has contractual arrangements with many parties 
including directors, employees, customers, suppliers and 
banking groups. The following arrangements are considered to 
be signiﬁcant in terms of their potential impact on the business 
of the Group as a whole and could alter or terminate on a 
change of control of the Company:

•  the Group has a number of borrowing facilities provided by 
various banking groups. These facility agreements generally 
include change of control provisions which, in the event 
of a change of control of the Company, could result in their 
renegotiation or withdrawal. The most signiﬁcant of these is 
a £1.5bn syndicated loan facility dated 9 June 2022, maturing 
in June 2028, which was undrawn at the year end. In the 
event of a change in control of the Company, the lenders 
may request cancellation of the commitment and repayment 
of any outstanding amounts;

•  on 16 February 2022, the Company issued £400m 2.5 per 

cent Notes due 16 June 2034 (‘the Notes’). In the event of a 
change of control of the Company, in certain circumstances 
set out in the Terms and Conditions of the Notes as set out in 
the Prospectus dated 14 February 2022 (which is available on 
the Company’s website at www.abf.co.uk), noteholders shall 
have the option to require the Company to redeem or repay 
the notes at their principal amount together with interest 
accrued to (but excluding) the date of redemption or purchase;

•  £81m (approximate sterling equivalent) of private placement 
notes are in issue to institutional investors. In the event of 
a change of control of the Company, the Company is obliged 
to make an offer of immediate repayment to the remaining 
note holders; and

•  cross-currency swaps totalling $100m are in place to swap 
all of the private placement debt denominated in US dollars 
to euros. In the event of a change of control of the Company, 
the agreement contains a typical ‘Credit Event Upon Merger’ 
termination event which permits the counterparty 
to terminate the agreement and all transactions under it.

There are no agreements between the Company and its 
directors or employees providing for compensation for loss of 
ofﬁce or employment that occurs as a result of a takeover bid. 

Political donations
During the year, the Group did not make any political donations 
or incur any political expenditure (within the ordinary meaning 
of those words) in the UK. However, under the wider definition 
of those terms in Part 14 of the Companies Act 2006, the 
Company and a subsidiary of the Company paid costs totalling 
approximately £3,150 during the year for attendance of 
employees at the Conservative and Labour Party Conferences 
which could potentially fall within that wider definition. The 
Group did not make any contributions to non-UK political parties 
during the year.

Financial risk management
Details of the Group’s use of ﬁnancial instruments, together 
with information on our risk management objectives and 
policies, including the policy for hedging each major type of 
forecasted transaction for which hedge accounting is used, and 
our exposure to price, credit, liquidity, cash ﬂow and interest 
rate risks, can be found in note 26 starting on page 166.

Research and development
Innovative use of existing and emerging technologies will 
continue to be crucial to the successful development of new 
products and processes for the Group.

The Company has a technical centre in the UK at the Allied 
Technical Centre. R&D facilities also exist across the Group, 
including at: ACH Food Companies in the USA; AB Mauri in 
Australia and the Netherlands (including the Global Technology 
Centre); AB Enzymes in Germany; and our Roal joint venture 
pilot plant in Rajamäki, Finland. These centres support the 
technical resources of the trading divisions in the search for new 
technology and in monitoring and maintaining high standards 
of quality and food safety. The Company also acquired National 
Milk Records plc (see further details on page 25) which 
invests in an innovative range of milk quality, herd health and 
genomic testing services, generating data and building robust 
insights that empower farmers to make informed decisions 
on cow productivity.

Branches
The Company, through various subsidiaries, has established 
branches in a number of different countries in which the 
Group operates.

Disclosure of information to auditor
Each of the directors who held ofﬁce at the date of approval 
of this Directors’ Report conﬁrms that:

•  so far as each director is aware, there is no relevant audit 

information of which the Company’s auditor is unaware; and
•  each director has taken all the steps that they ought to have 
taken as a director to make themself aware of any relevant 
audit information and to establish that the Company’s auditor 
is aware of that information.

For these purposes, relevant audit information means 
information needed by the Company’s auditor in connection 
with the preparation of its report on pages 120 to 127. 

Auditor
Resolutions for the reappointment of Ernst & Young LLP as 
auditor of the Company and to authorise the Audit Committee 
to determine its remuneration are to be proposed at the 
forthcoming AGM.

Annual general meeting
The AGM will be held on 8 December 2023 at 11.00 am. 
Details of the resolutions to be proposed are set out in a 
separate Notice of AGM which accompanies this report for 
shareholders receiving hard copy documents and which is 
available at www.abf.co.uk for those who elected to receive 
documents electronically. All resolutions for which notice has 
been given will be decided on a poll.

view of the assets, liabilities, ﬁnancial position and proﬁt 
or loss of the Company and the undertakings included 
in the consolidation taken as a whole; and

•  the Strategic Report includes a fair review of the development 

and performance of the business and the position of the

Statement of directors’ responsibilities in respect 
of the Annual Report and the Financial Statements
The directors are responsible for preparing the Annual Report 
and the Group and parent company financial statements 
in accordance with applicable law and regulations.

Company law requires the directors to prepare Group and 
parent company financial statements for each financial year. 
Under that law they are required to prepare the Group ﬁnancial 
statements in accordance with Adopted IFRS and have elected 
to prepare the parent company ﬁnancial statements in 
accordance with UK Accounting Standards, including FRS 101.

Under company law the directors must not approve the ﬁnancial 
statements unless they are satisﬁed that they give a true and 
fair view of the state of affairs of the Group and parent company 
and of their proﬁt or loss for that period.

In preparing each of the Group and parent company ﬁnancial 
statements, the directors are required to:

•  select suitable accounting policies and then apply them 

consistently;

•  make judgements and estimates that are reasonable 

and prudent;

•  for the Group ﬁnancial statements, state whether they have 

been prepared in accordance with Adopted IFRS;

•  for the parent company ﬁnancial statements, state whether 
applicable UK Accounting Standards have been followed, 
subject to any material departures disclosed and explained 
in the parent company ﬁnancial statements; and

•  prepare the ﬁnancial statements on the going concern basis 
unless it is inappropriate to presume that the Group and 
the parent company will continue in business.

The directors are responsible for keeping adequate accounting 
records that are sufﬁcient to show and explain the parent 
company’s transactions and disclose with reasonable accuracy 
at any time the ﬁnancial position of the parent company and 
enable them to ensure that its ﬁnancial statements comply with 
the Companies Act 2006. They have general responsibility for 
taking such steps as are reasonably open to them to safeguard 
the assets of the Group and to prevent and detect fraud and 
other irregularities.

Under applicable law and regulations, the directors are also 
responsible for preparing a Strategic Report, Directors’ Report, 
Directors’ Remuneration Report and Corporate Governance 
Statement that complies with that law and those regulations. 
The directors are responsible for the maintenance and integrity 
of the corporate and ﬁnancial information included on the 
Company’s website. Legislation in the UK governing the 
preparation and dissemination of ﬁnancial statements may 
differ from legislation in other jurisdictions.

INDEPENDENT AUDITOR’S REPORT

Independent Auditor’s Report to the 
members of Associated British Foods plc

Opinion
In our opinion:

•  Associated British Foods plc’s consolidated financial 

statements and parent company financial statements 
(the ‘financial statements’) give a true and fair view of the 
state of the Group’s and of the parent company’s affairs 
as at 16 September 2023 and of the Group’s profit for the 
52 weeks then ended;

•  the consolidated financial statements have been properly 
prepared in accordance with UK adopted international 
accounting standards;

•  the parent company financial statements have been properly 

prepared in accordance with United Kingdom Generally 
Accepted Accounting Practice; and

•  the financial statements have been prepared in accordance 

with the requirements of the Companies Act 2006.

We have audited the financial statements of Associated British 
Foods plc (the ‘parent company’) and its subsidiaries (the ‘Group’) 
for the 52 weeks ended 16 September 2023 which comprise:

Group

Parent company

Consolidated balance sheet as 
at 16 September 2023

Balance sheet as at 
16 September 2023

Statement of changes 
in equity for the 52 
weeks then ended

Related notes 1 to 11 
to the financial 
statements including a 
summary of significant 
accounting policies

Consolidated income statement 
for the 52 weeks then ended

Consolidated statement 
of comprehensive income 
for the 52 weeks then ended

Consolidated statement 
of changes in equity for the 
52 weeks then ended

Consolidated statement of cash 
flows for the 52 weeks then ended

Related notes 1 to 30 to the 
financial statements, including 
a summary of significant 
accounting policies

The financial reporting framework that has been applied 
in the preparation of the consolidated financial statements 
is applicable law and UK adopted international accounting 
standards. The financial reporting framework that has been 
applied in the preparation of the parent company financial 
statements is applicable law and United Kingdom Accounting 
Standards, including FRS 101 ‘Reduced Disclosure Framework’ 
(United Kingdom Generally Accepted Accounting Practice).

Basis for opinion
We conducted our audit in accordance with International 
Standards on Auditing (UK) (ISAs (UK)) and applicable law. 
Our responsibilities under those standards are further described 
in the Auditor’s responsibilities for the audit of the financial 
statements section of our report. We believe that the audit 
evidence we have obtained is sufficient and appropriate to 
provide a basis for our opinion.

Independence
We are independent of the Group and parent company 
in accordance with the ethical requirements that are relevant 
to our audit of the financial statements in the UK, including 
the FRC’s Ethical Standard as applied to listed public interest 
entities, and we have fulfilled our other ethical responsibilities 
in accordance with these requirements.

The non-audit services prohibited by the FRC’s Ethical Standard 
were not provided to the Group or the parent company and 
we remain independent of the Group and the parent company 
in conducting the audit. 

Conclusions relating to going concern 
In auditing the financial statements, we have concluded that 
the directors’ use of the going concern basis of accounting 
in the preparation of the financial statements is appropriate. 

Our evaluation of the directors’ assessment of the Group and 
parent company’s ability to continue to adopt the going concern 
basis of accounting included: 

•  Understanding the process undertaken by management to 
evaluate the economic impacts of rising costs on the Group 
and to reflect these in the Group’s forecasts for the going 
concern period until 1 March 2025; 

•  Analysing the historical accuracy of forecasting by comparing 

management’s forecasts to actual results, both for 2023 
and 2022 and through the subsequent events period, and 
performing inquiries to the date of this report to determine 
whether forecast cash flows are reliable based on 
past experience;

•  Considering whether the Group’s forecasts in the 

going concern assessment were consistent with other 
forecasts used by the Group in its accounting estimates, 
including impairment;

•  Confirming the opening cash and cash equivalents to 

the financial statements and the Group’s facilities to the 
agreements and third party confirmations, and agreeing 
the terms of the facilities to the underlying contracts;

•  Considering the downside scenario identified by management 
in their assessment on page 77, assessing whether there are 
any other scenarios, which should be considered through 
reference to the Groups principal risks, and assessing 
whether the quantum of the impact of the downside scenario 
in the going concern period was sufficiently severe whilst 
remaining plausible;

•  Evaluating the Group’s ability to undertake mitigating actions 
should it experience a severe downside scenario, considering 
likely achievability of both timing and quantum;

•  Testing the clerical accuracy of the model used to prepare 

the Group’s going concern assessment;

•  Reperforming the reverse stress test to establish the 

increases in input costs and the related impact on the cash 
flows that could lead to a loss of liquidity and considering 
whether this scenario was plausible; and

•  Assessing the appropriateness of the Group’s disclosure 

concerning the going concern basis of preparation.

The audit procedures performed to address this risk were 
performed by the Group audit team.

We observed that the Group achieved the forecasts that it 
was targeting in 2023. We observed the significant liquidity that 
the Group has at its disposal that can be utilised if the modelled 
downside was to materialise. The Group has the facilities 
disclosed in note 26 which includes details of the maturities 
of those facilities.

Based on the work we have performed, we have not identified 
any material uncertainties relating to events or conditions that, 
individually or collectively, may cast significant doubt on the 
Group and parent company’s ability to continue as a going 
concern until 1 March 2025.

In relation to the Group and parent company’s reporting on how 
they have applied the UK Corporate Governance Code, we have 
nothing material to add or draw attention to in relation to the 
directors’ statement in the financial statements about whether 
the directors considered it appropriate to adopt the going 
concern basis of accounting.

Our responsibilities and the responsibilities of the directors with 
respect to going concern are described in the relevant sections 
of this report. However, because not all future events or 
conditions can be predicted, this statement is not a guarantee 
as to the Group’s ability to continue as a going concern.

Overview of our audit approach

Audit 
scope

•  We performed an audit of the complete 
financial information of 101 components 
and audit procedures on specific balances 
for a further 19 components

•  The components where we performed full 
or specific audit procedures accounted for 
88% of adjusted profit before taxation, 
87% of revenue and 86% of total assets

Key audit 
matters

•  Assessment of the carrying value of goodwill, 
other intangible assets, property, plant and 
equipment and right-of-use assets

•  Taxation provisions
•  Revenue recognition, including the risk 

of management override 

Materiality

•  We used a Group materiality of £66m 

which represents 4.5% of adjusted profit 
before taxation

An overview of the scope of the parent company 
and group audits 
Tailoring the scope
Our assessment of audit risk, our evaluation of materiality and 
our allocation of performance materiality determine our audit 
scope for each company within the Group. Taken together, 
this enables us to form an opinion on the consolidated financial 
statements. We take into account the level of revenue and 
adjusted profit before taxation, risk profile (including country 
risk, controls and internal audit findings and the extent of 
changes in management, systems and processes and the 
business environment) and other known factors when 
assessing the level of work to be performed at each entity.

In assessing the risk of material misstatement to the 
consolidated financial statements, and to ensure we had 
adequate quantitative coverage of significant accounts in the 
financial statements, of the 517 reporting components of the 
Group, we selected 120 components, which represent the 
principal business units within the Group.

Of the 120 components selected, we performed an audit 
of the complete financial information of 101 components 
(‘full scope components’) which were selected based on their 
size or risk characteristics. For the remaining 19 components 
(‘specific scope components’), we performed audit procedures 
on specific accounts within that component that we considered 
had the potential for the greatest impact on the significant 
accounts in the financial statements, either because of the size 
of these accounts or their risk profile. 

The reporting components where we performed audit 
procedures accounted for 88% (2022 – 90%) of the Group’s 
adjusted profit before taxation, 87% (2022 – 88%) of the 
Group’s revenue and 86% (2022 – 87%) of the Group’s total 
assets. For the current period, the full scope components 
contributed 79% (2022 – 80%) of the Group’s adjusted profit 
before taxation, 84% (2022 – 84%) of the Group’s revenue 
and 83% (2022 – 83%) of the Group’s total assets. The specific 
scope components contributed 9% (2022 – 10%) of the Group’s 
adjusted profit before taxation, 3% (2022 – 4%) of the Group’s 
revenue and 3% (2022 – 4%) of the Group’s total assets. 
The audit scope of these components may not have included 
testing of all significant accounts of the component but will 
have contributed to the coverage of significant accounts tested 
for the Group.

Of the remaining 397 components that together represent 
12% of the Group’s adjusted profit before taxation, none are 
individually greater than 1% of the Group’s adjusted profit 
before taxation. For these components, we performed other 
procedures, including analytical review, testing of consolidation 
journals and intercompany eliminations and foreign currency 
translation recalculations to respond to any potential risks 
of material misstatement to the Group financial statements.

Involvement with component teams
In establishing our overall approach to the Group audit, we 
determined the type of work that needed to be undertaken at 
each of the components by us, as the Group audit engagement 
team, or by component auditors from other EY global network 
firms operating under our instruction. Of the 101 full scope 
components, audit procedures were performed on 32 of these 
directly by the Group audit team and 69 by component audit 
teams. For the 19 specific scope components, where the work 
was performed by component auditors, we determined the 
appropriate level of involvement to enable us to determine that 
sufficient audit evidence had been obtained as a basis for our 
opinion on the Group as a whole.

During the current audit cycle, we completed a combination 
of physical visits to component teams and alternative oversight 
procedures, including video meetings and live reviews of our 
local audit teams’ working papers based on the risk and size 
of our components. Our physical visits included the senior 
statutory auditor visiting Ireland and Australia and other senior 
members of the Group audit team visiting South Africa, India, 
Italy and Poland. For the alternative oversight procedures, we 
used video technology to meet with our component team to 
discuss and direct their audit approach, reviewed key working 
papers using our global audit software and understood the 
significant audit findings in response to the risk areas including 
asset impairment, tax provisions and revenue recognition. 
We also held meetings with local management and obtained 
updates on IT systems implementations and local matters 
including tax, pensions and legal. The Group audit team 
interacted regularly with the component teams where 
appropriate during various stages of the audit, reviewed key 
working papers and were responsible for the scope and 
direction of the audit process. This, together with the additional 
procedures performed at Group level, gave us appropriate 
evidence for our opinion on the consolidated financial 
statements.

Climate change
There has been increasing interest from stakeholders as to 
how climate change will impact Associated British Foods plc. 
The Group has determined that the most significant future 
impacts from climate change on their operations will be from 
the impact on key agricultural crops, the impact of flooding 
on the end-to-end supply chain including operations, resilience 
of workers to mitigate/adapt to climate change and transition 
risks as the world reduces its reliance on carbon.

These are explained on pages 56 to 57 in the Task Force for 
Climate related Financial Disclosures and on pages 74 to 75 
in the principal risks and uncertainties, which form part 
of the ‘Other information’, rather than the audited financial 
statements. Our procedures on these disclosures therefore 
consisted solely of considering whether they are materially 
inconsistent with the financial statements or our knowledge 
obtained in the course of the audit or otherwise appear to be 
materially misstated.

As explained in these disclosures, governmental and societal 
responses to climate change risks are still developing, and are 
interdependent upon each other, and consequently financial 
statements cannot capture all possible future outcomes as 
these are not yet known. The degree of certainty of these 
changes may also mean that they cannot be taken into account 
when determining asset and liability valuations and the timing 
of future cash flows under the requirements of UK adopted 
international accounting standards. The scenarios assessed 
by Associated British Foods plc do not lead to a need 
for reasonably possible change disclosures related 
to climate change.

Our audit effort in considering climate change was focused on 
evaluating management’s assessment of the impact of climate 
risk, physical and transition, and ensuring that the effects 
of material climate risks disclosed on pages 74 to 75 have been 
appropriately reflected in asset values and associated 
disclosures where values are determined through or assessed 
by modelling future cash flows, being goodwill, other intangible 
assets, property, plant and equipment and right-of-use assets. 
Details of our procedures and findings on the carrying value of 
goodwill, other intangible assets, property, plant and equipment 
and right-of-use assets are included in our key audit matters 
below. We also challenged the Directors’ considerations of 
climate change in their assessment of going concern and 
viability and associated disclosures.

Whilst the Group has stated its commitment to the aspirations 
of the Paris Agreement to achieve net zero emissions by 
2050, the Group is currently unable to determine the full future 
economic impact on its business model, operational plans 
and customers to achieve this and therefore, the potential 
impacts are not fully incorporated in these financial statements.

Key audit matters 
Key audit matters are those matters that, in our professional judgement, were of most significance in our audit of the financial 
statements of the current period and include the most significant assessed risks of material misstatement (whether or not due to 
fraud) that we identified. These matters included those which had the greatest effect on: the overall audit strategy, the allocation of 
resources in the audit and directing the efforts of the engagement team. These matters were addressed in the context of our audit of 
the financial statements as a whole, and in our opinion thereon, and we do not provide a separate opinion on these matters.

Key observations 
communicated to the 
Audit Committee 

We concluded that it was 
appropriate to record an 
impairment for Don, that 
the impairment recorded 
was not materially 
misstated and that the 
impairment was 
appropriately disclosed as 
an exceptional item. 

For JDR and AB 
Mauri, we agreed with 
management's conclusion 
that no impairments 
were required. 

Assets relating to Don and 
JDR remain sensitive to 
reasonably possible 
changes in key 
assumptions. Management 
discloses these 
sensitivities appropriately 
in the intangible assets and 
property, plant and 
equipment notes to the 
consolidated financial 
statements, in accordance 
with the requirements 
of IAS 36. 

Risk

Our response to the risk

Assessment of the carrying value 
of goodwill, other intangible assets, 
property, plant and equipment, 
right-of-use assets and assets held 
for sale (2023 – £9,986m; 
2022 – £9,968m)
The Group has significant carrying 
amounts of goodwill, other intangible 
assets, property, plant and equipment 
and right-of-use assets. The impairment 
tests covered the Don business 
(carrying value £154m), Jordans Dorset 
Ryvita (‘JDR’) (£137m) and AB Mauri 
(£937m). 

During the year, impairments have been 
recognised against the Don business 
(£41m). 

Don and JDR continue to operate in 
environments where there is significant 
retailer pressure on price and competitor 
activity, which is further exacerbated 
by high inflationary costs and 
operational challenges. 

There is a risk that these cash generating 
units (‘CGUs’) or groups of CGUs may 
not achieve the anticipated business 
performance to support their carrying 
value, or that the estimated fair value 
less cost to sell of a disposal group may 
not support its carrying value. This could 
lead to an impairment charge or loss 
on disposal that has not been recognised 
by management.

The significant improvement in 
performance in AB Mauri in 2023 has 
resulted in the risk of impairment of the 
carrying value of that CGU reducing.

Significant estimation is required in 
forecasting the future cash flows of each 
CGU or, in the case of goodwill, group 
of CGUs, together with the rate at which 
they are discounted.

We understood the methodology applied by management 
in performing its impairment test for each of the relevant 
CGUs, groups of CGUs or disposal groups and walked 
through the controls over the process, but did not test the 
operating effectiveness of them.

For CGUs where there were indicators of impairment, 
including the three CGUs or groups of CGUs described, we 
performed detailed testing to critically assess and corroborate 
the key inputs to the impairment tests, including:

•  Analysing the historical accuracy of budgets to actual 
results to determine whether forecast cash flows are 
reliable;

•  For Don, we challenged management’s key assumptions 
within the impairment model for optimism, benchmarking 
against historical trends and external market data. We 
tested management’s methodology over the remaining 
impairment allocation basis and concur that the allocation 
is in line with IAS 36;

•  For JDR, we critically challenged and evaluated, the 

key assumptions adopted in management's forecasts. 
Where assumptions in our opinion could not be supported 
or appeared, in our view, optimistic, these were risk 
adjusted and/or removed. We calculated the breakeven 
level of operating profit required in the perpetuity cash 
flows and assessed this in the context of the historical 
performance of JDR;

•  For AB Mauri, we challenged the assumptions in the 

model, focusing on the cash flow forecasts for the largest 
regions. Analysing the non-key and the negative business 
units, along with reviewing the contingencies included 
in the model. We have assessed the overall adjusted 
operating profit growth in the key business units and 
compared to third party market rates. We have assessed 
the overall division growth against the global growth 
rates;

•  In conjunction with our valuation specialists, assessing 
the discount rates used by determining independently 
a range of acceptable rates for each CGU, considering 
market data and comparable organisations, and comparing 
these ranges to the rates used by management; 
•  Validating the long-term growth rates assumed by 

comparing them to economic and industry forecasts that 
we obtained independently; and

•  Considering any contra evidence obtained during the 

course of the audit.

INDEPENDENT AUDITOR’S REPORT CONTINUED

Risk

Our response to the risk

Key observations 
communicated to the 
Audit Committee 

This risk existed in the prior year as well. 
We focus our audit effort on those 
businesses where we believe there 
is greater risk of impairment.

Refer to the Audit Committee Report 
(pages 93 to 99); accounting policies 
(pages 133 to 138); accounting estimates 
and judgements (page 139); and notes 8, 
9 and 10 to the consolidated financial 
statements (pages 148 to 153). 

Tax provisions for uncertain tax 
positions £55m (2022 – £102m) 
included within the income tax 
liability of £109m (2022 – £160m)
The global nature of the Group’s 
operations results in complexities in 
the payment of and accounting for tax.

Management applies judgement in 
assessing tax exposures in each 
jurisdiction, which require interpretation 
of local tax laws.

Given this judgement, there is a risk that 
tax provisions are misstated.

This risk existed in the prior year as well. 
Refer to the Audit Committee Report 
(pages 93 to 99); accounting policies 
(pages 133 to 138); accounting estimates 
and judgements (page 139); and note 5 
to the consolidated financial statements 
(pages 146 and 147).

For all CGUs we calculated the degree to which the key 
inputs and assumptions would need to fluctuate before an 
impairment is triggered and we considered the likelihood of 
this occurring. We performed our own sensitivities on the 
Group’s forecasts. We then determined whether adequate 
headroom remained using these sensitivities and our 
independent assessment.

We assessed the disclosures in notes 8, 9 and 10 against 
the requirements of IAS 36, in particular in respect of the 
requirement to disclose further sensitivities for CGUs where 
a reasonably possible change in a key assumption would 
cause an impairment.

For AB Mauri, the audit procedures performed to address 
this risk were performed by the Group audit team. The JDR 
and Don CGUs were subject to full scope audit procedures 
by the respective component teams and reviewed by the 
Group team.

We understood:

•  The Group’s process for determining the completeness 

and measurement of provisions for tax;

•  The methodology for the calculation of the tax provision 
and considered whether this is compliant with IFRIC 23 
requirements; and

•  Management’s controls over tax reporting, but did not 

test the operating effectiveness of these controls.

The Group audit team, including tax specialists, evaluated 
the tax positions taken by management in each significant 
jurisdiction in the context of local tax law outcomes, 
correspondence with tax authorities and the status of any 
tax audits. Our work utilised additional support from country 
tax specialists in five jurisdictions where the Group had 
more significant tax exposures.

We assessed the Group’s transfer pricing judgements, 
considering the way in which the Group’s businesses 
operate and the correspondence and agreements reached 
with tax authorities.

In evaluating management’s accounting, we developed our 
own range of acceptable provisions for the Group’s tax 
exposures, based on the evidence we obtained. We then 
compared management’s provision to our independently 
determined range.

We have evaluated the 
Group’s tax provisions 
and challenged the 
judgements applied. 

We consider provisions for 
uncertain tax positions to 
be within an acceptable 
range in the context of the 
Group’s overall tax 
exposures.

Key observations 
communicated to the 
Audit Committee 

Based on the procedures 
performed, including those 
in respect of trade 
promotions and rebates 
in the Grocery segment, 
we did not identify any 
evidence of management 
override or material 
misstatement in the 
revenue recognised in 
the period.

Risk

Our response to the risk

Revenue recognition, including 
the risk of management override 
(2023 – £19,750m; 2022 – £16,997m)
There continues to be pressure to meet 
expectations and targets. Management 
reward and incentive schemes, based 
on achieving profit targets and working 
capital as a percentage of revenue 
targets, may also place pressure 
on management to manipulate 
revenue recognition.

The majority of the Group’s sales 
arrangements are generally 
straightforward, being on a point of sale 
basis and requiring little judgement to 
be exercised. However, in the Grocery 
segment, management estimates the 
level of trade promotions and rebates 
to be applied to its sales to customers, 
adding a level of judgement to revenue 
recognition. Approximately 3% (2022 
– 3%) of the Group’s gross revenue is 
subject to such arrangements.

There is a risk that management may 
override controls intentionally to misstate 
revenue transactions, either through the 
judgements made in estimating rebates 
in the Grocery segment or by recording 
fictitious revenue transactions across 
the business.

This risk existed in the prior year as well. 
Refer to the accounting policies (page 
134) and note 1 to the consolidated 
financial statements (pages 140 to 143).

We understood the revenue recognition policies and how 
they are applied, including the relevant controls, but we did 
not test the operating effectiveness of these controls. 

We discussed key contractual arrangements with 
management and obtained relevant documentation, 
including in respect of rebate arrangements. Where rebate 
arrangements existed, on a sample basis, we obtained 
third-party confirmations or performed appropriate alternative 
procedures, including reviewing contracts and recalculating 
rebates. We also performed hindsight analysis over changes 
to prior period rebate estimates to challenge the assumptions 
made, including assessing the estimates for evidence 
of management bias.

For several businesses, including Primark, as part of our 
overall revenue recognition testing, we used data analysis 
tools on revenue transactions in the period to test the 
correlation of revenue to cash and sample tested to cash 
receipts to verify the occurrence of revenue. This provided 
us with assurance over £17.1bn (87%) (2022 – £14.8bn 
(87%)) of revenue recognised by the Group. For those 
in-scope businesses where we did not use data analysis 
tools, we performed alternative procedures over revenue 
recognition such as detailed transaction testing to invoices 
and payments.

We performed other audit procedures specifically designed 
to address the risk of management override of controls 
in addition to the correlation testing including journal entry 
testing, applying particular focus to manual journals.

We performed full and specific scope audit procedures over 
this risk area in 82 locations, which covered 87% of the 
Group’s revenue.

The audit procedures performed to address this risk were 
performed by component teams and reviewed by the 
Group team.

Our application of materiality
We apply the concept of materiality in planning and performing 
the audit, in evaluating the effect of identified misstatements 
on the audit and in forming our audit opinion. 

Materiality
The magnitude of an omission or misstatement that, individually 
or in the aggregate, could reasonably be expected to influence 
the economic decisions of the users of the financial statements. 
Materiality provides a basis for determining the nature and 
extent of our audit procedures.

We determined materiality for the Group to be £66m 
(2022 – £65m), which is 4.5% (2022 – 5%) of adjusted profit 
before taxation. We believe that adjusted profit before taxation 
provides us with the most relevant performance measure to 
the stakeholders of the entity and therefore have determined 
materiality based on this number.

We determined materiality for the parent company to be £49m 
(2022 – £46m), which is 2% (2022 – 2%) of equity.

Performance materiality
The application of materiality is at the individual account or 
balance level. It is set at an amount to reduce to an appropriately 
low level the probability that the aggregate of uncorrected and 
undetected misstatements exceeds materiality.

On the basis of our risk assessments, together with our 
assessment of the Group’s overall control environment, 
our judgement was that performance materiality was 75% 
(2022 – 75%) of our planning materiality, namely £50m 
(2022 – £49m). 

Audit work at component locations for the purpose of obtaining 
audit coverage over significant financial statement accounts 
is undertaken based on a percentage of total performance 
materiality. The performance materiality set for each component 
is based on the relative scale and risk of the component to 
the Group as a whole and our assessment of the risk of 
misstatement at that component. In the current year, the 
range of performance materiality allocated to components 
was £1m to £20m (2022 – £1m to £20m).

INDEPENDENT AUDITOR’S REPORT CONTINUED

Reporting threshold
An amount below which identified misstatements are 
considered as being clearly trivial.

We agreed with the Audit Committee that we would report to 
them all uncorrected audit differences in excess of £1m 
(2022 – £1m) as well as differences below that threshold that, 
in our view, warranted reporting on qualitative grounds. 

We evaluate any uncorrected misstatements against both the 
quantitative measures of materiality discussed above and in light 
of other relevant qualitative considerations in forming our opinion.

Other information 
The other information comprises the information included 
in the Annual Report set out on pages 1 to 119, other than 
the financial statements and our auditor’s report thereon. 
The directors are responsible for the other information contained 
within the Annual Report. 

Our opinion on the financial statements does not cover the 
other information and, except to the extent otherwise explicitly 
stated in this report, we do not express any form of assurance 
conclusion thereon. 

Our responsibility is to read the other information and, in doing 
so, consider whether the other information is materially 
inconsistent with the financial statements or our knowledge 
obtained in the course of the audit or otherwise appears to be 
materially misstated. If we identify such material inconsistencies 
or apparent material misstatements, we are required to 
determine whether this gives rise to a material misstatement in 
the financial statements themselves. If, based on the work we 
have performed, we conclude that there is a material 
misstatement of the other information, we are required to 
report that fact.

We have nothing to report in this regard.

Opinions on other matters prescribed by the 
Companies Act 2006
In our opinion, the part of the Directors’ Remuneration Report 
to be audited has been properly prepared in accordance with 
the Companies Act 2006.

In our opinion, based on the work undertaken in the course 
of the audit:

•  the information given in the strategic report and the directors’ 
report for the financial year for which the financial statements 
are prepared is consistent with the financial statements; and

•  the strategic report and the directors’ report have been 

prepared in accordance with applicable legal requirements.

Matters on which we are required to report 
by exception
In the light of the knowledge and understanding of the Group 
and the parent company and its environment obtained in the 
course of the audit, we have not identified material 
misstatements in the strategic report or the directors’ report.

We have nothing to report in respect of the following matters in 
relation to which the Companies Act 2006 requires us to report 
to you if, in our opinion:

•  adequate accounting records have not been kept by the 

parent company, or returns adequate for our audit have not 
been received from branches not visited by us; or

•  the parent company financial statements and the part of the 
Directors’ Remuneration Report to be audited are not in 
agreement with the accounting records and returns; or

•  certain disclosures of directors’ remuneration specified by law 

are not made; or

•  we have not received all the information and explanations 

we require for our audit.

Corporate Governance Statement
We have reviewed the directors’ statement in relation to going 
concern, longer-term viability and that part of the Corporate 
Governance Statement relating to the Group and parent 
company’s compliance with the provisions of the UK Corporate 
Governance Code specified for our review by the Listing Rules.

Based on the work undertaken as part of our audit, we have 
concluded that each of the following elements of the Corporate 
Governance Statement is materially consistent with the financial 
statements or our knowledge obtained during the audit:

•  Directors’ statement with regards to the appropriateness 

of adopting the going concern basis of accounting and any 
material uncertainties identified set out on pages 76 and 77;

•  Directors’ explanation as to their assessment of the 

company’s prospects, the period this assessment covers and 
why the period is appropriate set out on pages 76 and 77;
•  Directors’ statement on whether they have a reasonable 
expectation that the Group will be able to continue in 
operation and meets its liabilities set out on pages 76 and 77;

•  Directors’ statement on fair, balanced and understandable 

set out on page 94;

•  Board’s confirmation that it has carried out a robust 

assessment of the emerging and principal risks set out 
on page 95;

•  The section of the Annual Report that describes the review 
of effectiveness of risk management and internal control 
systems set out on page 95; and

•  The section describing the work of the Audit Committee set 

out on pages 93 to 99.

Responsibilities of directors
As explained more fully in the Directors’ Responsibilities 
Statement set out on pages 100 to 115, the directors are 
responsible for the preparation of the financial statements and 
for being satisfied that they give a true and fair view, and for 
such internal control as the directors determine is necessary to 
enable the preparation of financial statements that are free from 
material misstatement, whether due to fraud or error.

In preparing the financial statements, the directors are 
responsible for assessing the Group and parent company’s 
ability to continue as a going concern, disclosing, as applicable, 
matters related to going concern and using the going concern 
basis of accounting unless the directors either intend to liquidate 
the Group or the parent company or to cease operations, 
or have no realistic alternative but to do so.

prevent, deter and detect fraud; and how senior management 
monitors those programmes and controls. Where the risk 
was considered to be higher, we performed audit procedures 
to address each identified fraud risk. These procedures 
included testing manual journals and were designed to 
provide reasonable assurance that the financial statements 
were free from material fraud or error.

•  Based on this understanding we designed our audit 

procedures to identify non-compliance with such laws and 
regulations. Our procedures involved: journal entry testing, 
with a focus on manual consolidation journals and journals 
indicating large or unusual transactions based on our 
understanding of the business; enquiries of legal counsel, 
Group management, internal audit, divisional management 
and all full and specific scope management; and focused 
testing, as referred to in the key audit matters section above.

A further description of our responsibilities for the audit 
of the financial statements is located on the Financial 
Reporting Council’s website at https://www.frc.org.uk/
auditorsresponsibilities. This description forms part of our 
auditor’s report.

Other matters we are required to address 
Following the recommendation from the Audit Committee, 
we were appointed by the shareholders on 4 December 2015 
to audit the financial statements for the 52 weeks ending 
17 September 2016 and subsequent financial periods. 

The period of total uninterrupted engagement including previous 
renewals and reappointments is eight years, covering the 52 
weeks ending 17 September 2016 until the 52 weeks ending 
16 September 2023. The audit opinion is consistent with the 
additional report to the Audit Committee.

Use of our report
This report is made solely to the company’s members, as a 
body, in accordance with Chapter 3 of Part 16 of the Companies 
Act 2006. Our audit work has been undertaken so that we might 
state to the company’s members those matters we are required 
to state to them in an auditor’s report and for no other purpose. 
To the fullest extent permitted by law, we do not accept or 
assume responsibility to anyone other than the company and 
the company’s members as a body, for our audit work, for this 
report, or for the opinions we have formed.

Auditor’s responsibilities for the audit of the 
financial statements 
Our objectives are to obtain reasonable assurance about 
whether the financial statements as a whole are free from 
material misstatement, whether due to fraud or error, and to 
issue an auditor’s report that includes our opinion. Reasonable 
assurance is a high level of assurance, but is not a guarantee 
that an audit conducted in accordance with ISAs (UK) will always 
detect a material misstatement when it exists. Misstatements 
can arise from fraud or error and are considered material if, 
individually or in aggregate, they could reasonably be expected 
to influence the economic decisions of users taken on the basis 
of these financial statements. 

Explanation as to what extent the audit was considered 
capable of detecting irregularities, including fraud 
Irregularities, including fraud, are instances of non-compliance 
with laws and regulations. We design procedures in line with 
our responsibilities, outlined above, to detect irregularities, 
including fraud. The risk of not detecting a material misstatement 
due to fraud is higher than the risk of not detecting one resulting 
from error, as fraud may involve deliberate concealment by, for 
example, forgery or intentional misrepresentations, or through 
collusion. The extent to which our procedures are capable 
of detecting irregularities, including fraud, is detailed below. 
However, the primary responsibility for the prevention and 
detection of fraud rests with both those charged with governance 
of the company and management.

Our approach was as follows:

•  We obtained an understanding of the legal and regulatory 

frameworks that are applicable to the Group and determined 
that the most significant frameworks which are directly 
relevant to specific assertions in the financial statements are 
those that relate to the reporting framework (UK adopted 
International Accounting Standards, United Kingdom Generally 
Accepted Accounting Practice, the Companies Act 2006 and 
the UK Corporate Governance Code) and the relevant tax 
laws and regulations in the jurisdictions in which the Group 
operates. In addition, we concluded that there are certain 
significant laws and regulations which may have an effect 
on the determination of the amounts and disclosures in the 
financial statements being the Listing Rules of the UK Listing 
Authority, and those laws and regulations relating to health 
and safety, employee matters, food standards and food safety.

•  We understood how Associated British Foods plc is 

complying with those frameworks by observing the oversight 
of those charged with governance, the culture of honesty 
and ethical behaviour and whether a strong emphasis is 
placed on fraud prevention, which may reduce opportunities 
for fraud to take place, and fraud deterrence, which could 
persuade individuals not to commit fraud because of the 
likelihood of detection and punishment. 

•  We assessed the susceptibility of the Group’s financial 

statements to material misstatement, including how fraud 
might occur by meeting with management from various parts 
of the business to understand where it considered there 
was susceptibility to fraud. We also considered performance 
targets and their influence on efforts made by management 
to manage earnings or influence the perceptions of analysts. 
We considered the programmes and controls that the Group 
has established to address risks identified, or that otherwise

Associated British Foods plc is domiciled in the United Kingdom. 
The Company’s consolidated financial statements for the 
52 weeks ended 16 September 2023 comprise those of the 
Company, its subsidiaries and its interest in joint ventures 
and associates.

The directors authorised the consolidated financial statements 
for issue on 7 November 2023. The directors prepared and 
approved the consolidated financial statements in accordance 
with UK-adopted IAS (‘Adopted IFRS’).

The Company has elected to prepare the parent company 
financial statements under FRS 101. These are presented 
on pages 194 to 200.

Basis of preparation
The Company presents its consolidated financial statements 
in sterling, rounded to the nearest million, prepared on the 
historical cost basis except that current biological assets and 
certain financial instruments are stated at fair value, and assets 
classified as held for sale are stated at the lower of carrying 
amount and fair value less costs to sell.

The preparation of financial statements under Adopted IFRS 
requires management to make judgements, estimates and 
assumptions about the reported amounts of assets and liabilities, 
income and expenses and the disclosure of contingent assets 
and liabilities. The estimates and associated assumptions 
are based on experience. Actual results may differ from 
these estimates.

Judgements made by management in the application of 
Adopted IFRS that have a significant effect on the financial 
statements, and estimates with a significant risk of material 
adjustment next year, are discussed in Accounting estimates 
and judgements detailed on page 139.

The estimates and underlying assumptions are reviewed 
regularly. Revisions to accounting estimates are recognised 
prospectively from when the estimates are revised.

The accounting policies set out below apply to all periods 
presented, except where stated otherwise.

Details of accounting standards which came into force in the 
year are set out at the end of this note.

The Group’s consolidated financial statements are prepared to 
the Saturday nearest to 15 September. Accordingly, they have 
been prepared for the 52 weeks ended 16 September 2023 
(2022 – 52 weeks ended 17 September 2022).

To avoid delay in the preparation of the consolidated financial 
statements, the results of certain subsidiaries, joint ventures 
and associates are included to 31 August each year.

Adjustments have been made where appropriate for significant 
transactions or events occurring between 31 August and 
16 September.

The Group’s business activities, together with factors likely 
to affect its future development, performance and position are 
set out in the Strategic Report on pages 1 to 77. The financial 
position of the Group, its cash flows, liquidity position and 
borrowing facilities are described in the Financial review 
on pages 36 to 39.

In addition, the Principal risks and uncertainties on pages 68 to 
77 and note 26 on pages 166 to 177 provide details of the 
Group’s policy on managing its financial and commodity risks.

Climate change
In preparing the consolidated financial statements, management 
has considered the impact of climate change, particularly in 
the context of the TCFD disclosures set out on pages 56 to 67 
and our sustainability targets. These considerations did not have 
a material impact on the financial reporting judgements and 
estimates, consistent with the assessment that climate change 
is not expected to have a significant impact on the Group’s 
going concern assessment to 1 March 2025 nor the viability 
of the Group over the next three years.

Management has considered the impact of climate change 
on a number of key estimates within the financial statements, 
including the estimates of future cash flows used in impairment 
assessments of the carrying value of goodwill and other 
non-current assets. The assessment with respect to the impact 
of climate change will be kept under review by management, 
as the future impacts depend on factors outside of the Group’s 
control, which are not all currently known.

Going concern
After making enquiries, the directors have a reasonable 
expectation that the Group has adequate resources to continue 
in operational existence for the foreseeable future. For this 
reason, they continue to adopt the going concern basis 
in preparing the consolidated financial statements. 

The forecast for the going concern assessment period to 
1 March 2025 has been updated for the business’s latest 
trading in October and is the best estimate of cashflow in the 
period. Having reviewed this forecast and having applied a 
downside sensitivity analysis and performed a reverse stress 
test, the directors consider it a remote possibility that the 
financial headroom could be exhausted.

The Board’s treasury policies are in place to maintain a strong 
capital base and manage the Group’s balance sheet and liquidity 
to ensure long-term financial stability. These policies are the 
basis for investor, creditor and market confidence and enable 
the successful development of the business. The financial 
leverage policy requires that, in the ordinary course of business, 
the Board prefers to see the Group’s ratio of net debt including 
lease liabilities to adjusted EBITDA to be well under 1.5x. At the 
end of this financial year, the financial leverage ratio was 1.0x 
and the Group had total cash of £1.5bn and an undrawn 
committed Revolving Credit Facility of £1.5bn.

In March 2023, S&P Global Ratings reaffirmed their assignment 
to the Group of an ‘A’ grade long-term issuer credit rating. The 
Group’s funding basis is supported by the existing £400m public 
bond due in 2034 furthermore the Group’s committed Revolving 
Credit Facility is free of performance covenants and matures in 
2028, with one 1-year extension option remaining (after the first 
was utilised during the year). The $100m of outstanding private 
placement notes are due in March 2024 after which point Group 
funding will not be subject to financial performance covenants.

In reviewing the cash flow forecast for the period, the directors 
reviewed the trading for both Primark and the food businesses 
in light of the experience gained from events of the last three 
years of trading and emerging trading patterns. The directors 
have a thorough understanding of the risks, sensitivities and 
judgements included in these elements of the cash flow forecast 
and have a high degree of confidence in these cash flows.

FINANCIAL STATEMENTS

Significant accounting policies

for the 52 weeks ended 16 September 2023

As a downside scenario the directors considered the adverse 
scenario in which inflationary costs are not fully recovered, there 
are adverse foreign exchange impacts and there is a global 
recession, reducing demand for goods further than the base levels 
forecast. This downside scenario was modelled without taking 
any mitigating actions within their control. Under this downside 
scenario the Group forecasts liquidity throughout the period.

In addition, the directors also considered the circumstances 
which would be needed to exhaust the Group’s total liquidity 
over the assessment period – a reverse stress test. This indicates 
that, on top of the downside scenario outlined above, cost 
inflation would need to exceed £1.9bn without any price 
increases or other mitigating actions being taken before total 
liquidity is exhausted. The likelihood of these circumstances 
is considered remote for two reasons. Firstly, over such a long 
period, management could take substantial mitigating actions, 
such as reviewing pricing, cost cutting measures and reducing 
capital investment. Secondly, the Group has significant business 
and asset diversification and would be able to, if it were 
necessary, dispose of assets and/or businesses to raise 
considerable levels of funds.

Basis of consolidation
These consolidated financial statements include the results 
of the Company and its subsidiaries from the date that control 
commences to the date that control ceases.

They also include the Group’s share of the after-tax results, 
other comprehensive income and net assets of its joint ventures 
and associates on an equity-accounted basis from the point at 
which joint control or significant influence respectively 
commences, to the date that it ceases.

Subsidiaries are entities controlled by the Company. Control 
exists when the Company has the power, directly or indirectly, 
to direct the activities of an entity so as to affect significantly 
the returns of that entity.

Changes in the Group’s ownership interest in a subsidiary that 
do not result in a loss of control are accounted for within equity.

All the Group’s joint arrangements are joint ventures, which 
are entities over whose activities the Group has joint control, 
typically established by contractual agreement and requiring 
the venturers’ unanimous consent for strategic, financial and 
operating decisions.

Associates are those entities in which the Group has significant 
influence, being the power to participate in the financial and 
operating policy decisions of the entity, but which does not 
amount to control or joint control.

Where the Group’s share of losses exceeds its interest in 
a joint venture or associate, the carrying amount is reduced 
to zero and recognition of further losses is discontinued except 
to the extent that the Group has incurred legal or constructive 
obligations or made payments on behalf of an investee.

Control, joint control and significant influence are generally 
assessed by reference to equity shareholdings and voting rights.

Business acquisitions
On acquisition of a business, the Group attributes fair values to 
the identifiable assets, liabilities and contingent liabilities acquired, 
reflecting conditions at the date of acquisition. These include 
aligning accounting policies with those of the Group.

The Group finalises provisional fair values within 12 months 
of the date of acquisition and, where significant, reflects them 
by restatement of the comparative period in which the 
acquisition occurred.

The Group measures non-controlling interests at the 
proportionate share of the net identifiable assets acquired.

The Group remeasures existing equity interests in the acquiree 
to fair value at the date of acquisition, with any resulting gain 
or loss taken to the income statement.

Goodwill arising on acquisition of a business is the excess of 
the remeasured carrying amount of any existing equity interest 
plus the fair value of consideration payable for the additional 
stake over the fair value of the share of net identifiable assets 
and liabilities acquired (including separately identified intangible 
assets), net of non-controlling interests. Total consideration 
does not include transaction costs, which the Group 
expenses as incurred.

The Group measures contingent consideration at fair value 
at the date of acquisition, classified as a liability or equity 
(usually as a liability).

Other than for the finalisation of provisional fair values, the 
Group accounts for changes in contingent consideration 
classified as a liability in the income statement.

Revenue
Revenue represents the value of sales made to customers after 
deduction of discounts, sales taxes and a provision for returns. 
Discounts include sales rebates, price discounts, customer 
incentives, some promotional activities and similar items. 
Revenue does not include sales between Group companies.

The Group recognises revenue when performance obligations 
are satisfied, goods are delivered to customers and control 
of goods is transferred to the buyer.

In the food businesses, the Group generally recognises revenue 
from the sale of goods on dispatch or delivery to customers, 
dependent on shipping terms, and provides for discounts and 
returns as a reduction to revenue when sales are recorded, 
based on management’s best estimate of the amount required 
to meet claims by customers, taking into account contractual 
and legal obligations, historical trends and past experience.

In the Retail business, the Group generally recognises revenue 
from the sale of goods when a customer purchases goods, and 
provides for returns as a reduction to revenue when sales are 
recorded, based on management’s best estimate of the amount 
required to meet claims by customers, taking into account 
historical trends and past experience.

Borrowing costs
The Group accounts for borrowing costs using the effective 
interest method. The Group capitalises borrowing costs directly 
attributable to the acquisition, construction or production 
of qualifying items of property, plant and equipment as part 
of their cost.

Foreign currencies
Individual group companies record transactions in foreign 
currencies at the exchange rate at the date of the transaction, and 
translate monetary assets and liabilities in foreign currencies at 
the exchange rate at the balance sheet date, with any resulting 
differences taken to the income statement, unless designated 
in a hedging relationship, in which case hedge accounting applies.

On consolidation, the Group translates the assets and liabilities 
of operations denominated in foreign currencies into sterling 
at the exchange rate at the balance sheet date and the income 
statements of those operations into sterling at average 
exchange rates.

The Group records differences arising from the retranslation 
of opening net assets of group companies, together with 
differences arising from the restatement of the net results of 
group companies from average exchange rates to those at the 
balance sheet date, in the translation reserve in equity.

Pensions and other post-employment benefits
The Group’s pension and other post-employment benefit 
arrangements comprise defined benefit plans, defined 
contribution plans and other unfunded post-employment plans.

For defined benefit plans, the income statement charge 
comprises the cost of benefits earned by members and benefit 
improvements granted to members during the year, as well as 
net interest income/(expense) calculated by applying the liability 
discount rate to the opening net pension asset or liability.

The Group records the difference between the market value 
of scheme assets and the present value of scheme liabilities 
on a scheme-by-scheme basis as net pension assets (to the 
extent recoverable) or liabilities.

The Group recognises remeasurements and movements 
in irrecoverable surpluses in other comprehensive income.

The Group charges contributions payable in respect of defined 
contribution plans to operating profit as incurred.

The Group accounts for other unfunded post-employment plans 
in the same way as defined benefit plans.

Share-based payments
The Group recognises the fair value of share awards at grant 
date as an employee expense with a corresponding increase in 
equity, spread over the period during which employees become 
unconditionally entitled to the shares.

The Group adjusts the amount recognised to reflect expected 
and actual levels of vesting except where the failure to vest 
is as a result of not meeting a market condition.

Income tax
Income tax on profit or loss for the period comprises current 
and deferred tax. The Group recognises income tax in the 
income statement except to the extent that it relates to items 
taken directly to equity.

Current tax is the tax expected to be payable on taxable income 
for the year, using tax rates enacted or substantively enacted 
during the period, together with any adjustment to tax payable 
in respect of prior periods.

The Group provides for deferred tax using the balance sheet 
liability method, providing for temporary differences between 
the carrying amounts of assets and liabilities for financial 
reporting purposes and the amounts used for tax purposes.

The Group does not provide for the following temporary 
differences: initial recognition of goodwill; initial recognition 
of assets or liabilities affecting neither accounting nor taxable 
profit other than those acquired in a business combination; and 
differences relating to investments in subsidiaries to the extent 
that they will probably not reverse in the foreseeable future.

The Group bases the amount of deferred tax provided on the 
expected manner of realisation or settlement of the carrying 
amount of assets and liabilities, using tax rates enacted or 
substantively enacted at the balance sheet date.

The Group recognises deferred tax assets only to the extent 
that it is probable that future taxable profits will be available 
against which the asset can be utilised.

The Group offsets deferred tax assets and liabilities if, and only 
if, it has a legally enforceable right to set off current tax assets 
and liabilities and the deferred tax assets and liabilities relate 
to income taxes levied by the same taxation authority on either 
the same taxable entity or different taxable entities which intend 
either to settle current tax liabilities and assets on a net basis, 
or to realise the assets and settle the liabilities simultaneously, 
in each future period in which significant amounts of deferred 
tax liabilities or assets are expected to be settled or recovered.

As required by IAS 12, we have applied the exception to 
recognising and disclosing information about deferred tax assets 
and liabilities related to Pillar Two income taxes.

The Group recognises income tax arising from dividend 
distributions at the same time as the liability to pay the 
related dividend.

Financial assets and liabilities
The Group recognises financial assets and liabilities when 
it becomes a party to the contractual provision of the relevant 
financial instrument.

Trade and other receivables
The Group records trade and other receivables initially at fair 
value and subsequently at amortised cost. This generally results 
in recognition at nominal value less an expected credit loss 
provision, which is recognised based on management’s 
expectation of losses without regard to whether or not a specific 
impairment trigger has occurred.

Other non-current receivables
Other non-current receivables comprise finance lease 
receivables due from a joint venture and minority shareholdings 
in private companies. The Group accounts for finance lease 
receivables in the same way as for trade and other receivables.

The Group records minority shareholdings in private companies 
initially at fair value, including directly attributable transaction 
costs, and subsequently at fair value through other 
comprehensive income.

On disposal of a minority shareholding, the cumulative gain 
or loss previously recognised in other comprehensive income 
is included directly in retained earnings, without recycling it to 
the income statement.

Bank and other borrowings
The Group records bank and other borrowings initially at fair value, 
which equals the proceeds received, net of direct issue costs, and 
subsequently at amortised cost. The Group accounts for finance 
charges, including premiums payable on settlement or redemption 
and direct issue costs, using the effective interest rate method.

Trade payables
The Group records trade payables initially at fair value and 
subsequently at amortised cost. This generally results in 
recognition at nominal value.

FINANCIAL STATEMENTS

Significant accounting policies

for the 52 weeks ended 16 September 2023

Cash and cash equivalents
Cash and cash equivalents comprise bank and cash balances, 
deposits and short-term investments with original maturities 
of three months or less.

For the purposes of the cash flow statement, the Group includes 
bank overdrafts that are repayable on demand and form an 
integral part of the Group’s cash management as a component 
of cash and cash equivalents.

Derivative financial instruments and hedging
The Group primarily uses derivatives to manage economic 
exposure to financial and commodity risks. The principal 
instruments used are foreign exchange and commodity 
contracts, futures, swaps and options. The Group does not 
use derivatives for speculative purposes.

The Group recognises derivatives at fair value based on market 
prices or rates, or calculated using discounted cash flow or 
option pricing models.

The Group recognises changes in the fair value of derivatives 
in the income statement unless the derivative is designated 
in a hedging relationship, when recognition of the change in 
fair value depends on the nature of the item being hedged.

The purpose of hedge accounting is to mitigate the impact on 
the Group of changes in foreign exchange or interest rates and 
commodity prices.

At the inception of each hedging relationship, the Group 
documents the hedging instrument, the hedged item, the risk 
management objectives and strategy for undertaking the hedge, 
and assesses hedge effectiveness.

During the life of each hedging relationship, the Group performs 
testing to demonstrate that the hedge remains effective.

For derivatives hedging of future cash flows, the Group 
recognises the change in fair value through other comprehensive 
income in either the cost of hedging reserve (for the element 
of the change in fair value relating to the currency spread) or 
in the hedging reserve (for the remaining change in fair value). 
Any ineffective portion is recognised immediately in the 
income statement.

When the future cash flow results in the recognition of a 
non-financial asset or liability, then at the time that asset or 
liability is recognised, the Group includes the associated gains 
and losses previously recognised in the hedging reserve in the 
initial measurement of that asset or liability.

When the future cash flow does not result in the recognition of 
a non-financial asset or liability, the Group includes the associated 
gains and losses previously recognised in the hedging reserve 
in the income statement in the same period in which the 
hedged item affects profit or loss.

Hedges of the Group’s net investment in foreign operations 
principally comprise borrowings in the currency of the 
investment’s net assets.

For derivative or non-derivative financial instruments used as 
hedges of the Group’s net investment in foreign operations, 
the Group recognises the change in fair value through other 
comprehensive income in the net investment hedging reserve. 
Any ineffective portion is recognised immediately in the 
income statement.

The Group discontinues hedge accounting when a hedging 
instrument expires or is sold, terminated, exercised, or no longer 
qualifies for hedge accounting. At that time, the Group retains 
the cumulative associated gain or loss recognised in the hedging 
reserve until the forecast transaction occurs. Gains or losses 
on hedging instruments relating to an underlying exposure that 
no longer exists are taken to the income statement.

The Group economically hedges foreign currency exposure on 
recognised monetary assets and liabilities but does not normally 
seek hedge accounting. The Group records any derivatives held 
to hedge this exposure at fair value through profit and loss.

Intangible assets other than goodwill
Non-operating intangible assets are generally intangible assets 
that arise on business combinations and typically include 
technology, brands, customer relationships and grower 
agreements. The Group acquires operating intangible assets in 
the ordinary course of business, typically including computer 
software, land use rights and emissions trading licences.

The Group records intangible assets other than goodwill at cost 
less accumulated amortisation and impairment charges.

Amortisation is charged to the income statement on a straight-
line basis over the estimated useful lives of intangible assets 
from the date they are available for use. Estimated useful lives 
are generally deemed to be no longer than:

Technology and brands – up to 15 years

Customer relationships – up to 10 years

Grower agreements – up to 10 years

Operating intangibles – up to 10 years

Goodwill
Goodwill is defined under ‘Business acquisitions’ on page 134. 
Certain commercial assets associated with the acquisition of a 
business are not capable of being recognised in the acquisition 
balance sheet. In such circumstances, goodwill is recognised, 
which may include, but is not necessarily limited to, workforce 
assets and the benefits of expected future synergies.

Goodwill is subject to an annual impairment review.

Research and development
The Group expenses research and development expenditure 
as incurred, unless development expenditure relates to products 
or processes which are technically and commercially feasible, 
in which case it is capitalised. The Group records capitalised 
development expenditure at cost less accumulated amortisation 
and impairment charges.

Impairment
The Group reviews the carrying amounts of intangible assets 
and property, plant and equipment at each balance sheet date to 
determine whether there is any indication of impairment. If any 
such indication exists, the Group estimates the indicated asset’s 
recoverable amount. For goodwill and intangibles without a 
finite life, the Group does this at least annually.

The Group recognises an impairment charge in the income 
statement whenever the carrying amount of an asset or its CGU 
exceeds its recoverable amount.

The Group allocates impairment charges recognised in respect 
of CGUs first to reduce the carrying amount of any goodwill 
relating to that CGU and then to reduce the carrying amount 
of the other assets in the CGU on a pro rata basis.

Calculation of recoverable amount
The recoverable amount of assets is the greater of their fair 
value less costs to sell and their value in use. In assessing value 
in use, the Group discounts estimated future cash flows to 
present value using a pre-tax discount rate reflective of current 
market assessments of the time value of money and the risks 
specific to the asset.

For an asset that does not generate largely independent cash 
inflows, the Group determines recoverable amount for the CGU 
to which the asset belongs.

Reversals of impairment
The Group does not subsequently reverse impairments of 
goodwill. For other assets, the Group may reverse an 
impairment charge if there has been a change in the estimates 
used to determine the recoverable amount, but only to the 
extent that the new carrying amount does not exceed the 
carrying amount that would have been determined, net of 
depreciation or amortisation, if no impairment charge had 
previously been recognised.

Property, plant and equipment
The Group records property, plant and equipment at cost less 
accumulated depreciation and impairment charges.

The Group charges depreciation to the income statement on a 
straight-line basis over the estimated useful economic lives of 
each item sufficient to reduce it to its estimated residual value. 
Land is not depreciated. Estimated useful economic lives are 
generally deemed to be no longer than:

Freehold buildings
Plant and equipment, fixtures and fittings
•  sugar factories, yeast plants, mills and 

bakeries

•  other operations
Vehicles
Sugar cane roots

up to 66 years

up to 20 years
up to 12 years
up to 10 years
up to 10 years

Leases
A lease is an agreement whereby the lessor conveys to the 
lessee, in return for a payment or a series of payments, the right 
to use a specific asset for an agreed period.

Where the Group is a lessee, the following accounting policy 
is applied.

Right-of-use assets
The Group records right-of-use assets at cost at the 
commencement date of the lease, which is the date the 
underlying asset is available for use, less any accumulated 
depreciation and impairment losses, and adjusted for 
subsequent remeasurement of lease liabilities.

Cost includes the amount of lease liabilities recognised, initial 
direct costs incurred, and lease payments made at or before 
the commencement date, less any lease incentives received.

The Group charges depreciation to the income statement on 
a straight-line basis over the shorter of the estimated useful life 
and the lease term.

Lease liabilities
The Group records lease liabilities at the commencement date 
of the lease at the present value of lease payments to be made 
over the lease term, discounted using the incremental 
borrowing rate at the commencement date of the lease if the 
interest rate implicit in the lease is not readily determinable.

Lease payments include fixed payments, including in-substance 
fixed payments, and variable lease payments that depend on 
an index or a rate, less any lease incentives receivable.

Variable lease payments that do not depend on an index or a 
rate are recognised as an expense in the period in which the 
event or condition that triggers the payment occurs.

The Group subsequently measures lease liabilities at amortised 
cost using the effective interest rate method. The Group records 
the accretion and settlement of interest through accruals and 
reduces the carrying amount of lease liabilities for the capital 
element of lease payments made.

The carrying amount of lease liabilities is remeasured when 
there is a change in future lease payments due to a change 
in the lease term, a change in the in-substance fixed lease 
payments or a change in the assessment of whether to 
purchase the underlying asset.

Short-term leases and leases of low-value assets
The Group applies the short-term lease recognition exemption 
to leases that have a lease term of 12 months or less from the 
commencement date and do not contain a purchase option. 
It also applies the low-value asset recognition exemption to 
groups of underlying leases considered uniformly low-value.

The Group expenses lease payments on short-term leases and 
leases of low-value assets in the income statement as incurred.

Lessor accounting
When subleasing assets, the Group assesses the sublease 
classification with reference to the head lease right-of-use asset, 
which considers, among other factors, whether the sublease 
represents a majority of the remaining life of the head lease.

The ratio of rental income to head lease rental payments is used 
to determine how much of the right-of-use asset should be 
derecognised, taking into account whether the sublease/head 
lease are above or below market rate.

The Group records amounts due from lessees under finance 
leases as a receivable at an amount equal to the net investment 
in the lease, calculated using the incremental borrowing rate 
at the date of recognition. The Group recognises any difference 
between the derecognised right-of-use asset and the newly 
recognised amounts due from lessees under finance leases 
in the income statement.

The Group recognises finance income over the lease term, 
reflecting a constant periodic rate of return on the net 
investment in the lease.

The Group recognises operating lease income as earned 
on a straight-line basis over the lease term.

FINANCIAL STATEMENTS

Significant accounting policies

Accounting estimates and judgements

for the 52 weeks ended 16 September 2023

for the 52 weeks ended 16 September 2023

Current biological assets
The Group records current biological assets at fair value less 
costs to sell.

The basis of valuation for growing cane is estimated sucrose 
content valued at estimated sucrose price for the following 
season, less estimated costs for harvesting and transport.

When harvested, the Group transfers growing cane to inventory 
at fair value less costs to sell.

Inventories
The Group records food inventories at the lower of cost and net 
realisable value. Cost includes raw materials, direct labour and 
expenses and an appropriate proportion of production and other 
overheads, calculated on a first-in first-out basis.

The Group records retail inventories at the lower of cost and net 
realisable value using the retail method, calculated on the basis 
of selling price less appropriate trading margin. All retail 
inventories are finished goods.

On acquisition of a business, the Group records inventories at 
fair value. Subsequently, the Group charges the book value of 
the inventories to adjusted operating profit as they are sold or 
used. Any significant fair value uplift is charged below adjusted 
operating profit as the inventories are sold or used.

Grants
The Group recognises grants only when there is reasonable 
assurance that the Group will comply with the conditions 
attached and that the grants will be received. Grants receivable 
as compensation for expenses already incurred are recognised 
in profit or loss in the period in which they become receivable.

Hyperinflation
The Argentinian economy was designated hyperinflationary 
from 1 July 2018. The Turkish economy was designated 
hyperinflationary from 1 July 2022.

The Group has applied IAS 29 Financial Reporting in 
Hyperinflationary Economies to its Argentinian operations from 
the beginning of the 2019 financial year and for its Turkish 
operations from the beginning of the 2022 financial year. IAS 29 
requires that hyperinflationary adjustments are reflected from 
the start of the reporting period in which it is applied. For the 
Group’s Argentinian operations this was 1 September 2018, and 
for the Group’s Turkish operations this was 1 September 2021.

The adjustments required by IAS 29 are set out below:

•  adjustment of historical cost non-monetary assets and 

liabilities from their date of initial recognition to the balance 
sheet date to reflect the changes in purchasing power of the 
currency caused by inflation, according to the official indices 
for Argentina published by the Federación Argentina de 
Consejos Profesionales de Ciencias Económicas (‘FACPCE’) 
and for Turkey published by Turkish Statistical Institute (‘TUIK’);

•  adjustment of the components of the income statement 
and cash flow statement for the inflation index since their 
generation, with a balancing entry in the income statement 
and a reconciling item in the cash flow statement, respectively;

•  adjustment of the income statement to reflect the impact 

of inflation on holding monetary assets and liabilities 
in local currency;

•  the financial statements of the Group’s Argentinian and 

Turkish operations have been translated into sterling at the 
closing exchange rate at 16 September 2023 (ARS 433.88:£1; 
TRL 33.45:£1); and

•  the cumulative impact corresponding to previous years has 
been reflected in other comprehensive income in the year.

In Argentina, the FACPCE index was 911.1316 at 31 August 
2022 and 2044.2832 at 31 August 2023. The inflation index for 
the year is therefore 2.244.

In Turkey, the TUIK index was 80.21 at 31 August 2022 and 
58.94 at 31 August 2023. The inflation index for the year is 
therefore 0.735.

The Venezuelan economy has been designated hyperinflationary 
for a number of years, but the impact on the Group’s results 
remains immaterial.

New accounting standards
The Group adopted the following accounting standards and 
amendments during the year with no significant impact:

•  Reference to the Conceptual Framework (Amendments 

to IFRS 3)

•  Property, Plant and Equipment: Proceeds before Intended 

Use (Amendments to IAS 16)

•  Onerous Contracts – Cost of Fulfilling a Contract 

(Amendments to IAS 37)

•  Annual Improvements to IFRS 2018–2020

The Group is assessing the impact of the following standards, 
interpretations and amendments that are not yet effective. 
Where already endorsed by the UKEB, these changes will be 
adopted on the effective dates noted. Where not yet endorsed 
by the UKEB, the adoption date is less certain:

•  IFRS 17 Insurance Contracts, Amendments to IFRS 17, Initial 
Application of IFRS 17 and IFRS 9 – Comparative Information, 
effective 2024 financial year

•  Disclosure of Accounting policies (Amendments to IAS 1 and 

IFRS Practice Statement 2), effective 2024 financial year
•  Definition of Accounting Estimates (Amendments to IAS 8), 

effective 2024 financial year

•  Deferred Tax related to Assets and Liabilities arising from 

a Single Transaction (Amendments to IAS 12), effective 2024 
financial year

•  Lease Liability in a Sale and Leaseback (Amendments to IFRS 

16), effective 2024 financial year

•  International Tax Reform – Pillar Two Model Rules 

(Amendments to IAS 12), effective 2024 financial year

•  Amendments to IAS 1 Presentation of Financial Statements, 

effective 2024 financial year

•  Supplier Finance Arrangements (Amendments to IAS 7 and 
IFRS 7), effective 2025 financial year (not yet endorsed by 
the UKEB)

•  Amendments to IAS 21 The Effects of Changes in Foreign 
Exchange Rates: Lack of Exchangeability, effective 2026 
financial year (not yet endorsed by the UKEB)

Significant accounting estimates
The preparation of the Group’s consolidated financial 
statements includes the use of estimates and assumptions. 
Although the estimates used are based on management’s best 
information about current circumstances and future events and 
actions, actual results may differ from those estimates.

The accounting estimates with a significant risk of a material 
change to the carrying value of assets and liabilities within the 
next year are set out below.

Forecasts and discount rates
The carrying values of a number of items on the balance sheet 
are dependent on estimates of future cash flows arising from 
the Group’s operations which, in some circumstances, are 
discounted to arrive at a net present value.

Assessment for impairment involves comparing the book value 
of an asset with its recoverable amount (the higher of value in 
use and fair value less costs to sell). Value in use is determined 
with reference to projected future cash flows discounted at an 
appropriate rate. Both the cash flows and the discount rate 
involve a significant degree of estimation uncertainty.

The recovery of deferred tax assets is dependent on the 
generation of sufficient future taxable profits. The Group 
recognises deferred tax assets to the extent that it is 
considered probable that sufficient taxable profits will be 
available in the future. This involves a significant degree 
of estimation uncertainty.

When considering sources of future taxable profit, the Group 
firstly considers existing deferred tax liabilities. However, the 
majority of deferred tax assets are recognised based on future 
profit forecasts, including the deferred tax assets in the Group’s 
most material jurisdictions of the United Kingdom, the United 
States, Australia, Germany and Spain.

When relying on profit forecasts, the assessment of whether to 
recognise deferred tax assets is based on the following year’s 
budget and expectations of the future performance of individual 
businesses (or groups of businesses in the case of national tax 
groups). Where possible, this is consistent with forecasts used 
for impairment assessments. Forecasts for impairment 
assessments are discounted, but this is not permitted for 
recognition of deferred tax assets.

Deferred tax assets are reduced when it is no longer considered 
probable that the related tax benefit will be realised.

The widespread nature of the Group’s activities across multiple 
jurisdictions means that it is not practical to provide detailed 
sensitivities in respect of individual deferred tax assets.

Further details of deferred tax assets are included in note 13.

Post-retirement benefits
The Group’s defined benefit pension schemes and similar 
arrangements are assessed annually in accordance with IAS 19 
Employee Benefits. The accounting valuations, assessed using 
assumptions determined with independent actuarial advice, 
resulted in a significant net surplus as at 16 September 2023, 
principally relating to the UK defined benefit scheme, which 
is separately disclosed.

The net surplus is highly sensitive to the market value of scheme 
assets, to discount rates used in assessing liabilities, to actuarial 
assumptions (including price inflation, rates of pension and 
salary increases, mortality and other demographic assumptions) 
and to the level of contributions.

Further details are included in note 12, including associated 
sensitivities.

Other areas of judgement and 
accounting estimates
The consolidated financial statements include other areas of 
judgement and accounting estimates. While these areas do not 
meet the definition of significant accounting estimates or critical 
accounting judgements, the recognition and measurement of 
certain material assets and liabilities are based on assumptions 
and/or are subject to longer term uncertainties. The other areas 
of judgement and accounting estimates are set out below.

Biological assets
In valuing growing cane, estimating sucrose content requires 
management to assess expected cane and sucrose yields 
for the following season considering weather conditions and 
harvesting programmes. Estimating sucrose price requires 
management to assess into which markets the forthcoming 
crop will be sold and to assess domestic and export prices as 
well as related foreign currency exchange rates. The carrying 
value of growing cane and associated sensitivities is disclosed 
in note 17.

Income tax
The Group is exposed to a range of uncertain tax positions. 
It provides for open tax matters, where it believes it is probable 
that payments will be required, including those for routine tax 
audits, which are by nature complex and may take a number 
of years to resolve. Uncertainty is driven by the resolution of the 
issue and estimation process in arriving at the amount. The Group 
has recognised potential current corporate tax liabilities for a 
number of uncertain tax positions, none of which are individually 
material. The provision for these uncertain tax positions was 
2023 – £55m (2022 – £102m). The reduction in the provision 
is due to the conclusion of UK tax audits covering several 
businesses and years. The majority of the remaining provisions 
relate to transfer pricing risks across a number of jurisdictions 
in which the Group has operations. Transfer pricing is a complex 
area with resolution of matters taking many years. Given the 
underlying nature of these risks, the timing of when they will 
resolve is uncertain.

The Group applies IFRIC 23 Uncertainty over Income Tax 
Treatments to measure uncertain tax positions. The Group 
calculates each provision using management’s best estimate of 
the liability based on interpretation of tax law in each jurisdiction 
and ongoing monitoring of tax cases and rulings. The Group 
believes it has adequate provision for these matters. Final 
conclusion of each matter may result in an outcome different 
to any amounts provided, but the Group has concluded that this 
is unlikely to have a material impact.

FINANCIAL STATEMENTS

Notes forming part of the financial statements

for the 52 weeks ended 16 September 2023

1. Operating segments
The Group has five operating segments, as described below. These are the Group’s operating divisions, based on the management 
and internal reporting structure, which combine businesses with common characteristics, primarily in respect of the type of products 
offered by each business, but also the production processes involved and the manner of the distribution and sale of goods. The Board 
is the chief operating decision-maker.

Inter-segment pricing is determined on an arm’s length basis. Segment result is adjusted operating profit, as shown on the face of the 
consolidated income statement. Segment assets comprise all non-current assets except employee benefits assets, income tax 
assets, deferred tax assets and all current assets except cash and cash equivalents, current asset investments and income tax assets. 
Segment liabilities comprise trade and other payables, derivative liabilities, provisions and lease liabilities.

Segment results, assets and liabilities include items directly attributable to a segment as well as those that can be allocated on a 
reasonable basis. Unallocated items comprise mainly corporate assets and expenses, cash, borrowings, employee benefits balances 
and current and deferred tax balances.

Segment non-current asset additions are the total cost incurred during the period to acquire segment assets that are expected to be 
used for more than one year, comprising property, plant and equipment, right-of-use assets, operating intangibles and biological assets.

Businesses disposed are shown separately and comparatives are re-presented for businesses sold or closed during the year.

The Group comprises the following operating segments:

Grocery
The manufacture of grocery products, including hot beverages, sugar and sweeteners, vegetable oils, balsamic vinegars, bread 
and baked goods, cereals, ethnic foods and meat products, which are sold to retail, wholesale and foodservice businesses.

Ingredients

Amortisation of non-operating intangibles of £41m (2022 – £47m) shown as adjusting item in the income statement, include £3m 
(2022 – £3m) incurred by joint ventures, in addition to the amounts shown above.

Exceptional items
2023
The income statement this year included a non-cash exceptional impairment charge of £109m. In Grocery, the Don business has 
been adversely affected by inflationary pressures, a surplus supply of fresh pork in the market, labour constraints and equipment 
reliability causing production shortfalls and additional transportation costs following the unforeseen liquidation of its distribution 
partner. As a result, the Group has recognised impairment write-downs of £39m against property, plant and equipment, £1m against 
right-of-use assets and £1m against intangible assets.

In the Sugar segment, north China recognised a £15m impairment write down against property, plant and equipment. This business 
was classified as held for sale in the previous year, but the potential buyer withdrew their offer in the second half of the year. Due to 
the severe flooding in Mozambique, the related damage to the sugar crop fields and the inability to plant for the foreseeable future, 
Illovo Mozambique recognised a £25m impairment write-down against property, plant and equipment, £7m against current biological 
assets, provided £2m for personnel costs and wrote down inventory by £1m.

In the Retail segment, the Group recognised £13m of exceptional impairment charges relating to the German store portfolio. 
This primarily related to stores impaired in the previous year after additional right-of-use assets were recognised due to rent indexation 
adjustments. The Group also recognised a £4m charge including a £3m exceptional impairment for the write-down of property, plant 
and equipment for the right-sizing of four further German stores and £1m to write down a freehold store. 

2022
The income statement included an exceptional impairment charge of £206m comprising non-cash writedowns of £72m against 
property, plant and equipment and a write-down of £134m of right-of-use assets relating to the capitalisation of store leases 
for Primark. Also £49m of the £63m exceptional charge included in the Group's total tax charge for this financial year was the 
de-recognition of the deferred tax assets relating to Germany.

In the second half of last year a deferred tax asset arose mainly in relation to the charge taken for the impairment of property, plant 
and equipment and store leases in Primark Germany. A significant proportion of this asset was deemed not to be recoverable and was 
written off as an exceptional tax charge. Since then, further work has been undertaken to assess the amount of the deferred tax asset 
that is expected to be recoverable. This work determined that the deferred tax asset at last year end was understated in error.

The directors believe that this understatement of the deferred tax asset was not material to the prior period financial statements. 
Accordingly, an exceptional tax credit of £58m has been recognised in this year.

We recognise the importance of complying fully with all applicable tax laws as well as paying and collecting the right amount of tax 
in every country in which the Group operates. Our tax strategy, approved by the Board, is based on seven tax principles that are 
embedded in the financial and non financial processes and controls of the Group. This tax strategy is available in the Policies section 
of the Group’s website.

Deferred taxation balances are analysed in note 13.

The 2023 interim dividend was declared on 25 April 2023 and paid on 7 July 2023. Given the outlook for the Group, the strength of the 
balance sheet and the underlying cash generation of the business, we have declared the payment of a special dividend, to be paid as 
a second interim dividend at 12.7p per share at an estimated cost of £97m.

The Board has proposed a final dividend of 33.1p per share at an estimated cost of £252m. The combined 2023 final and special 
dividend of 45.8p, with an estimated value of £349m, will be paid on 12 January 2024 to shareholders on the register on 
15 December 2023.

Dividends relating to the period including the special dividend were 60.0p per share totalling £459m (2022 – 43.7p per share 
totalling £345m).

7. Earnings per share
The calculation of basic earnings per share at 16 September 2023 was based on the net profit attributable to equity shareholders 
of £1,044m (2022 – £700m), and a weighted average number of shares outstanding during the year of 778 million (2022 – 789 million). 
The calculation of the weighted average number of shares excludes the shares held by the Employee Share Ownership Plan Trust 
on which the dividends are being waived. The weighted average number of shares has reduced as a result of our first share buyback 
programme. In the year, we repurchased 23.7 million shares which were cancelled.

Adjusted earnings per ordinary share, which exclude the impact of profits less losses on disposal of non-current assets and the sale 
and closure of businesses, amortisation of acquired inventory fair value adjustments, transaction costs, amortisation of non-operating 
intangibles, exceptional items and any associated tax credits, is shown to provide clarity on the underlying performance of the Group.

Amortisation of non-operating intangibles of £41m (2022 – £47m) shown as adjusting item below include £3m (2022 – £3m) incurred 
by joint ventures.

The UK corporation tax rate of 19% increased to 25% from 1 April 2023. The legislation to effect these changes was enacted before 
the balance sheet date and UK deferred tax has been calculated accordingly.

The diluted earnings per share calculation takes into account the dilutive effect of share incentives. The diluted, weighted average 
number of shares is 778 million (2022 – 789 million). There is no difference between basic and diluted earnings.

In April 2019 the European Commission published its decision on the Group Financing Exemption in the UK’s controlled foreign 
company legislation. The Commission found that the UK law did not comply with EU State Aid rules in certain circumstances. 
The Group has arrangements that may be impacted by this decision as might other UK-based multinational groups that had financing 
arrangements in line with the UK’s legislation in force at the time. The UK Government, the Group and a number of other UK 
companies appealed against this decision to the General Court of the European Union (‘GCEU’). On 8 June 2022, the GCEU found 
in favour of the Commission's original decision. As a result of this, in August 2022, the UK Government, the Group and various other 
UK companies appealed GCEU’s decision to the Court of Justice of the European Union. We have calculated our maximum potential 
liability to be £26m (2022 – £26m), however we do not consider that any provision is required in respect of this amount based on our 
current assessment of the issue. Following receipt of charging notices from HM Revenue & Customs (‘HMRC’), we made payments 
to HMRC in 2021. Our assessment remains that no provision is required in respect of this amount. We will continue to consider the 
impact of the Commission’s decision on the Group and the potential requirement to record a provision.

In addition to the amounts disclosed above, there are £nil (2022 – £12m) intangible assets classified as assets held for sale (see note 15).

Amortisation of non-operating intangibles of £41m (2022 – £47m) shown as an adjusting item in the income statement includes 
£3m (2022 – £3m) incurred by joint ventures in addition to the amounts shown above.

Impairment
As at 16 September 2023, the consolidated balance sheet included goodwill of £1,266m (2022 – £1,292m). Goodwill is allocated 
to the Group’s cash-generating units (CGUs), or groups of CGUs, that are expected to benefit from the synergies of the business 
combination that gave rise to the goodwill, as follows:

CGU or group of CGUs
Acetum

A CGU, or group of CGUs, to which goodwill has been allocated must be assessed for impairment annually, or more frequently 
if events or circumstances indicate that the carrying amount may not be recoverable. There has been no change in CGUs or group 
of CGUs from the prior year.

The carrying value of goodwill is assessed by reference to its value in use reflecting the projected cash flows of each of the CGUs 
or group of CGUs. These projections are based on the most recent budget, which has been approved by the Board and reflects 
management’s expectations of sales growth, operating costs and margin, taking into consideration past experience and external 
sources of information. Long-term growth rates for periods not covered by the annual budget reflect the products, industries and 
countries in which the relevant CGU, or group of CGUs, operate.

Management expects to achieve growth over the next three to five years in excess of the long-term growth rates for the applicable 
country or region. In these circumstances, budgeted cash flows are extended, generally to between three and five years, using 
specific growth assumptions and taking into account the specific business risks.

The key assumptions in the most recent annual budget on which the cash flow projections are based relate to discount rates, growth 
rates and expected changes in volumes, selling prices and direct costs.

The cash flow projections have been discounted using a pre-tax weighted average cost of capital for each business, adjusted for 
country, industry and market risk. Inflation assumptions used to calculate discount rates are aligned with those used in the cash flow 
projections. The rates used were between 10.2% and 23.7% (2022 – between 9.8% and 23.4%).

The long-term growth rates beyond the initial budgeted cash flows, applied in the value in use calculations for goodwill allocated 
to each of the CGUs or groups of CGUs that are significant to the total carrying amount of goodwill, were in a range between 0% 
and 6.0%, consistent with the inflation factors included in the discount rates applied (2022 – between 0% and 6.7%).

Changes in volumes, selling prices and direct costs are based on past results and expectations of future changes in the market.

Sensitivity to changes in key assumptions
Impairment testing is dependent on management’s estimates and judgements, particularly as they relate to the forecasting of future 
cash flows, the discount rates selected and expected long-term growth rates. Each of the Group’s CGUs had headroom under the 
annual impairment review.

In light of the supply side inflationary pressures combined with the cost of living pressures faced by our UK Grocery business, 
management performed a detailed impairment review of Jordans Dorset Ryvita, and concluded that no impairment was required. 
Key drivers of the forecast improvement in performance include annualisation of price increases, completion of a number of margin 
improvement initiatives, implementation of planned strategic initiatives and the completion of ongoing new product development. 
Headroom was £59m on a CGU carrying value of £137m (2022 – headroom of £26m on a CGU carrying value at £147m). 
The discount rate used was 12.2% and would have to increase to more than 15.7% before value in use fell below the CGU carrying 
value. The long-term growth rate applied into perpetuity was 2.8%, based on forecast industry growth of 2.5% for breakfast cereals 
and 3.3% for biscuits.

Impairment
The methodology used to assess property, plant and equipment for impairment is the same as that described for impairment 
assessments of goodwill. See note 8 for further details. In addition where the fair value less costs of disposal is higher than value 
in use, this methodology has been used to determine the recoverable amount. This method uses inputs that are unobservable, 
using the best information available in the circumstances for valuing the CGU, and therefore falls into the Level 3 category of fair 
value measurement.

In Grocery, the Australian Don business has been adversely affected by inflationary pressures, a surplus supply of fresh pork in 
the market, labour constraints and equipment reliability causing production shortfalls and additional transportation costs following 
the unforeseen liquidation of its distribution partner. Management therefore performed a detailed impairment review and concluded 
that an impairment of A$72m (£39m) should be recognised, A$62m (£34m) against plant and equipment and A$10m (£5m) against 
buildings. The impairment model assumed long-term growth rates beyond the forecast period of 2.0% (2022 – 2.0%) and a discount 
rate of 12.6% (2022 – 11.9%). 

The sugar business in north China recognised a £15m write down against property, plant and equipment. This business was classified 
as held for sale in the previous year, but the potential buyer withdrew their offer in the second half of the year. 

Due to severe flooding in Mozambique, the related damage to the sugar crop fields and the inability to plant for the foreseeable future, 
Illovo Mozambique recognised a £25m write-down against property, plant and equipment. Primark recognised a £3m write down 
against fixtures and fittings for the right-sizing of four German stores and £1m to write down a freehold store.

FINANCIAL STATEMENTS

Notes forming part of the financial statements

for the 52 weeks ended 16 September 2023

12. Employee entitlements
The Group operates a number of defined benefit and defined contribution retirement benefit schemes in the UK and overseas.

The defined benefit schemes expose the Group to a variety of actuarial risks including demographic assumptions such as mortality 
and financial assumptions such as discount rate, inflation risk and market (investment) risk. The Group is not exposed to any unusual, 
entity-specific or scheme-specific risks. All schemes comply with local legislative requirements.

UK defined benefit scheme
The Group’s principal UK defined benefit scheme is the Associated British Foods Pension Scheme (the ‘Scheme’), which is a funded 
final salary scheme that is closed to new members. Defined contribution arrangements are in place for other employees. The UK 
defined benefit scheme represents 90% (2022 – 90%) of the Group’s defined benefit scheme assets and 85% (2022 – 86%) 
of defined benefit scheme liabilities. The Scheme is governed by a trustee board which is independent of the Group and which 
agrees a schedule of contributions with the Company each time a formal funding valuation is performed.

The most recent triennial funding valuation of the Scheme was carried out as at 5 April 2023, using the current unit method, and 
revealed a surplus of £1,013m. The market value of the Scheme assets was £3,648m, representing 138% of members’ accrued 
benefits after allowing for expected future salary increases.

The Scheme’s assets are managed using a risk-controlled investment strategy, which includes a liability-driven investment policy 
that seeks to match, where appropriate, the profile of the liabilities. This includes the use of derivative instruments to hedge inflation, 
interest and foreign exchange risks. The Scheme utilises both market and solvency triggers to develop the level of hedges in place. 
To date, the Scheme is fully hedged for 75% of inflation sensitivity and 76% of interest rate risk. It is intended to hedge 80% of total 
exposure.

The Scheme is forbidden by the trust deed from holding direct investments in the equity of the Company, although it is possible that 
the Scheme may hold indirect interests through investments in some equity funds.

Overseas defined benefit schemes
The Group also operates defined benefit retirement schemes in a number of overseas businesses, which are primarily funded final 
salary schemes, as well as a small number of unfunded post-retirement medical benefit schemes, which are accounted for in the 
same way as defined benefit retirement schemes.

Defined contribution schemes
The Group operates a number of defined contribution schemes for which the charge was £47m in the UK and £48m overseas, 
totalling £95m (2022 – UK £42m, overseas £45m, totalling £87m).

Actuarial assumptions
The principal actuarial assumptions for the Group’s defined benefit schemes at the year end were:

Discount rate
Inflation
Rate of increase in salaries
Rate of increase for pensions in payment
Rate of increase for pensions in deferment (where provided)

Discount rates are determined by reference to market yields at the balance sheet date on high-quality corporate bonds consistent with 
the estimated term of the obligations. This has been done in conjunction with independent actuaries in each jurisdiction.

The UK inflation assumption includes assumptions on both the Retail Price Index and Consumer Price Index measures of inflation 
on the basis that the gap between the two measures is expected to remain stable in the long term.

The mortality assumptions used to value the UK defined benefit schemes in 2023 are derived from the S3 mortality tables with 
improvements in line with the 2022 projection model prepared by the Continuous Mortality Investigation of the UK actuarial profession 
(2022 – S3 mortality tables with improvements in line with the 2020 projection model), with a 0-year rating movement for males and 
females (2022 – 0-year rating movement for males and females), both with a long-term trend of 1.75% (2022 – 1.5%). These mortality 
assumptions take account of experience to date, and assumptions for further improvements in life expectancy of scheme members. 
Examples of the resulting life expectancies in the UK defined benefit schemes are as follows:

Life expectancy from age 65 (in years)
Member aged 65 in 2023 (2022)
Member aged 65 in 2043 (2042)

2023

23.7

Female
24.2
26.2

2022

Male
22.1
23.7

Female
24.3
26.1

An allowance has been made for cash commutation in line with emerging scheme experience. Other demographic assumptions 
for the UK defined benefit schemes are set having regard to the latest trends in scheme experience and other relevant data.

The assumptions are reviewed and updated as necessary as part of the periodic funding valuation of the schemes.

For the overseas schemes, regionally appropriate assumptions for mortality, financial and demographic factors have been used.

A sensitivity analysis on the principal assumptions used to measure UK defined benefit scheme liabilities at 16 September 2023 is:

Discount rate
Inflation
Rate of real increase in salaries

Rate of mortality

Change in assumption
decrease/increase by 0.1%
increase/decrease by 0.1%
increase/decrease by 0.1%
members assumed to be one 
year younger/older

Impact on scheme liabilities
increase/decrease by 1.2%
increase by 0.6%/decrease by 0.9%
increase/decrease by 0.9%

increase/decrease by 2.9%

A sensitivity to the rate of increase in pensions in payment and pensions in deferment is represented by the inflation sensitivity, 
as all pensions increases and deferred revaluations are linked to inflation.

The sensitivity analysis above has been determined based on reasonably possible changes in the respective assumptions occurring 
at the end of the period and may not be representative of the actual change. It is based on a change in the specific assumption while 
holding all other assumptions constant. When calculating the sensitivities, the same method used to calculate scheme liabilities 
recognised in the balance sheet has been applied. The method and assumptions used in preparing the sensitivity analysis have not 
changed since the prior year.

FINANCIAL STATEMENTS

Notes forming part of the financial statements

for the 52 weeks ended 16 September 2023

12. Employee entitlements continued

UK Scheme
Scheme assets include £64m (2022 – £50m) of derivative instruments, £409m (2022 – £441m) of corporate debt instruments and 
£1,119m (2022 – £861m) of government debt.

Corporate and other bonds assets of £619m (2022 – £767m) include £235m (2022 – £248m) of assets whose valuation is not derived 
from quoted market prices. The valuation for all other equity assets, government bonds, and corporate and other bonds is derived 
from quoted market prices. The carrying value of UK property assets is based on a 30 June market valuation, adjusted for purchases, 
disposals and price indexation between the valuation and the balance sheet date. Cash and other assets includes £888m (2022 – £820m) 
of assets whose valuation is not derived from quoted market prices.

For financial reporting in the Group’s financial statements, liabilities are assessed by actuaries using the projected unit method.

The accounting value is different from the result obtained using the funding basis, mainly due to different assumptions used to project 
scheme liabilities.

The defined benefit scheme liabilities comprise 18% (2022 – 24%) in respect of active participants, 21% (2022 – 20%) for deferred 
participants and 61% (2022 – 56%) for pensioners.

The weighted average duration of the defined benefit scheme liabilities at the end of the year is 12 years for both UK and overseas 
schemes (2022 – 15 years for both UK and overseas schemes).

The Group recognises the accounting surplus as it has the ability to use the surplus to meet employer contributions to the UK 
Scheme, covering both the defined benefit and defined contribution sections. This has been agreed with the independent Trustee 
Board for the new financial year. See the Cash flow section below for further details.

Cash flow
Group cash flow in respect of employee benefits schemes comprises contributions paid to funded schemes of £36m (2022 – £36m) 
and benefits paid in respect of unfunded schemes of £5m (2022 – £2m). Contributions to funded defined benefit schemes are subject 
to periodic review. Contributions to defined contribution schemes amounted to £95m (2022 – £87m).

Total contributions to funded schemes and benefit payments by the Group in respect of unfunded schemes in 2024 are currently 
expected to be approximately £3m in the UK and £10m overseas, totalling £13m (2022 – UK £29m, overseas £10m, totalling £39m). 

As part of the triennial funding valuation of the UK Scheme as at 5 April 2023, which was finalised with the independent trustee board 
in September 2023, the Company has agreed an abatement of all UK employer contributions to the UK Scheme, covering both the 
defined benefit and defined contribution sections from the start of the new financial year. The employer contributions will instead be 
met from the surplus in the UK Scheme. This is subject to a solvency check, assessed annually by the Scheme Actuary. This is 
expected to result in approximately £70m cash flow benefit for the Group in the new financial year.

Other comprehensive income
Remeasurements of the net pension asset recognised in other comprehensive income are as follows:

Return on scheme assets excluding amounts included in net interest in the income statement
Actuarial gains arising from changes in financial assumptions
Actuarial gains arising from changes in demographic assumptions
Experience losses on scheme liabilities
Change in unrecognised surplus

13. Deferred tax assets and liabilities continued
Provisions and other temporary differences include provisions of £(103)m (2022 – £(93)m), biological assets of £33m (2022 – £32m), 
tax credits of £(9)m (2022 – £(16)m) and other temporary differences of £nil (2022 – £2m).

Certain deferred tax assets and liabilities have been offset in the table above. The following is the analysis of the deferred tax balances 
(after offset) for financial reporting purposes:

In addition to the amounts disclosed above, there are £nil (2022 – £5m) deferred tax assets classified as assets held for sale (see note 15).

Deferred tax assets have not been recognised in respect of tax losses of £358m (2022 – £348m). Of these tax losses, £186m 
(2022 – £188m) will expire at various dates between 2023 and 2028 (2022: 2022 and 2027). Deferred tax assets have also not been 
recognised in respect of other temporary differences of £353m (2022 – £516m). This includes £160m (2022 – £378m) relating to 
property, plant and equipment and leases in Germany which were derecognised following the impairment in 2022 (see notes 9 and 10 
for further details). These deferred tax assets have not been recognised on the basis that their future economic benefit is uncertain.

In addition, the Group’s overseas subsidiaries have net unremitted earnings of £2,527m (2022 – £2,029m), resulting in temporary 
differences of £1,426m (2022 – £1,495m). No deferred tax has been provided in respect of these differences since the timing of the 
reversals can be controlled and it is probable that the temporary differences will not reverse in the foreseeable future.

In addition to the amounts disclosed above, there are £nil (2022 – £3m) trade and other receivables classified as assets held for sale 
(see note 15).

The directors consider that the carrying amount of receivables approximates fair value.

For details of credit risk exposure on trade and other receivables, see note 26.

Trade and other receivables include £32m (2022 – £29m) in respect of finance lease receivables, with £28m in non-current loans 
and receivables and £4m in current other receivables (2022 – £25m in non-current loans and receivables and £4m in current other 
receivables). Minimum lease payments receivable are £4m within one year, £11m between one and five years and £17m in more than 
five years (2022 – £4m within one year, £16m between one and five years and £9m in more than five years).

The finance lease receivables relate to property, plant and equipment leased to a joint venture of the Group (see note 28).

15. Assets and liabilities classified as held for sale
The Group has no assets and liabilities classified as held for sale at year end. In the prior year, the Group’s north China sugar business 
was classified as held for sale. The proposed buyer withdrew their offer in the second half of this year and the Group has since 
recognised a £15m non-cash exceptional impairment charge to write down the property, plant and equipment in that business.

Impairment
The methodology used to assess current biological assets for impairment is the same as that described for impairment assessments 
of goodwill. See note 8 for further details.

In the year there was a £7m (2022 – £nil) impairment of current biological assets in Illovo Mozambique due to the severe flooding 
and damage to the sugar crop fields (included within exceptional items).

Growing cane
The fair value of growing cane is determined using inputs that are unobservable, using the best information available in the 
circumstances for valuing the growing cane and therefore falls into the Level 3 category of fair value measurement. The following 
assumptions were used in the determination of the estimated sucrose tonnage at 16 September 2023:

Average maturity of growing cane

Cash at bank and in hand generally earns interest at rates based on the applicable daily bank deposit rate.

Cash equivalents generally comprise deposits placed on money markets for periods of up to three months and money market funds 
which earn interest at a short-term deposit rate.

The carrying amount of cash and cash equivalents approximates fair value.

In addition to the amounts disclosed above, there are no trade and other payables (2022 – £14m) classified as liabilities held for sale 
(see note 15).

For payables with a remaining life of less than one year, carrying amount is deemed to reflect fair value.

In a small number of businesses, the Group utilises supplier financing arrangements to enable participating suppliers, at each 
supplier’s sole discretion, to sell any or all amounts due from the Group to a third party bank earlier than the invoice due date, at better 
financing rates than the supplier alone could achieve. Payment terms for suppliers are identical, irrespective of whether they choose 
to participate. The Group receives no benefit from these arrangements. Contractual terms and invoice due dates are unchanged 
and the Group considers amounts owed to the third party bank as akin to amounts owed to the supplier. Such amounts are therefore 
included within trade payables and associated cash flows are included within operating cash flows, as they continue to be part 
of the Group’s normal operating cycle.

At year end, the value of invoices sold by suppliers under supply chain financing arrangements was £75m (2022 – £45m).

FINANCIAL STATEMENTS

Notes forming part of the financial statements

for the 52 weeks ended 16 September 2023

21. Provisions continued
Restructuring
Restructuring provisions include business restructure costs, including redundancy, associated with the Group’s announced 
reorganisation plans. These restructuring provisions are largely expected to be utilised in the next financial year.

Deferred consideration
Deferred consideration comprises estimates of amounts due to the previous owners of businesses acquired by the Group which are 
often linked to performance or other conditions.

Other
Other provisions mainly comprise litigation claims and warranty claims arising from the sale and closure of businesses. The extent 
and timing of the utilisation of these provisions is more uncertain given the nature of the claims and the period of the warranties.

22. Share capital and reserves
Share capital
At 16 September 2023, the Company’s issued and fully paid share capital comprised 767,953,088 ordinary shares of 515⁄22p, each 
carrying one vote per share (2022 – 791,674,183). Total nominal value was £44m (2022 – £45m).

Other reserves
£173m of other reserves arose from the cancellation of share premium account by the Company in 1993. £2m arose in 2010 as a 
transfer to capital redemption reserve following redemption of two million £1 deferred shares at par. £1m arose in 2023 as a transfer 
to capital redemption reserve following the purchase and subsequent cancellation of shares (2022 – nil).

The remaining £3m comprises a £4m unrealised gain on investments held at fair value through other comprehensive income, 
net of £1m deferred tax (2022 – £3m, £4m and £1m, respectively).

Translation reserve
The translation reserve comprises all foreign exchange differences arising from the translation of the financial statements of foreign 
operations, as well as from the translation of liabilities that hedge the Group’s net investment in foreign subsidiaries.

Hedging reserve
The hedging reserve comprises all changes in the value of derivatives to the extent that they are effective cash flow hedges, net 
of amounts recycled from the hedging reserve on occurrence of the hedged transaction or when the hedged transaction is no longer 
expected to occur.

23. Acquisitions and disposals
Acquisitions
2023
In the first half, the Agriculture division acquired Kite Consulting, Advance Sourcing and Progres. Kite Consulting is a specialist dairy 
consultant and Advance Sourcing provides specialist products to create value by improving herd performance and supports dairy 
farmers to improve herd efficiency and build resilience across the agri-food supply chain. Progres in Finland uses a patented additive 
to support good health, reduce inflammation and stimulate recovery, which improves gut integrity and the performance of animals.

In April, the Ingredients division acquired Vital Solutions, a German company specialising in natural science-based ingredients for 
application in dietary supplements and functional foods.

The Agriculture division acquired IFCN AG, a dairy research and consulting company in June and in August acquired National Milk 
Records plc (NMR) for £48m. NMR is the leading agri-tech supplier of management information and testing services to the UK dairy 
supply chain, developing technology used to inform farming efficiency and animal welfare, and quantify food provenance.

Pre-acquisition carrying amounts were the same as recognised values on acquisition apart from £32m of non-operating intangibles in 
respect of brands, technology and customer relationships, a £7m related deferred tax liability, a £6m uplift to the investment in joint 
ventures and goodwill of £39m. Cash flow on acquisition of subsidiaries, joint ventures and associates of £94m comprised £78m cash 
consideration less £1m cash and overdrafts acquired, £16m of deferred consideration relating to previous acquisitions and a £1m 
contribution to an existing joint venture in China.

2022
In January, the Group acquired 100% of Fytexia, a B2B specialty ingredients business in France and Italy producing and formulating 
polyphenols-based active ingredients for the dietary supplements industry. In July, the Group acquired Greencoat, a UK-based animal 
supplement and care business. During the year, the Group also acquired a small grocery company in New Zealand, a small agriculture 
business in Finland and a small ingredients business in Australia.

Pre-acquisition carrying amounts were the same as recognised values on acquisition apart from £88m of non-operating intangibles in 
respect of brands, technology and customer relationships, an £8m uplift to inventory, a £16m related deferred tax liability and goodwill 
of £85m. Cash flow on acquisition of subsidiaries, joint ventures and associates of £154m comprised £153m cash consideration less 
£10m cash and overdrafts acquired, £7m of deferred consideration relating to previous acquisitions and a £4m contribution to an 
existing joint venture in China.

Disposals
2023
The Group agreed to sell property, plant and equipment to its Chinese joint venture partner. Profit on sale was £3m. In March 
Gledhow, the Group’s 30% equity-accounted associate in Illovo South Africa, formally went into business rescue. A non-cash 
provision of £6m was booked on the financial guarantee held on this business' liabilities.

2022
The proposed sale of a yeast company to the joint venture with Wilmar International in China (classified as held for sale at the 2021 
year end) is not going ahead. The £10m non-cash impairment reversed in 2021 through profit/(loss) on sale and closure of business 
has been reinstated at a cost of £11m.

The Group’s investment in north China Sugar is classified as held-for-sale at year end and an associated £19m non-cash write-down 
has been charged to loss on sale and closure of business.

The Group also released £3m of closure provisions in Vivergo in the UK and £4m of warranty provisions no longer required for a disposed 
Ingredients business in the United States.

24. Share-based payments
The annual charge in the income statement for equity-settled share-based payments schemes was £18m (2022 – £19m). 
The Group had the following principal equity-settled share-based payment plans in operation during the period:

Associated British Foods 2016 Long-term Incentive Plan (‘the 2016 LTIP’)
The 2016 LTIP was approved and adopted by the Company at the AGM held on 9 December 2016. It takes the form of conditional 
allocations of shares which are released if, and to the extent that, performance targets are satisfied, typically over a three-year vesting 
period.

Associated British Foods 2016 Short-term Incentive Plan (‘the 2016 STIP’)
The 2016 STIP was approved and adopted by the Board on 2 November 2016. It takes the form of conditional allocations of shares 
which are released at the end of a three-year vesting period if, and to the extent that, performance targets are satisfied, over a one-
year performance period.

Further information regarding the operation of the above plans can be found in the Remuneration Report on pages 100 to 115.

Total conditional allocations under the Group’s equity-settled share-based payment plans are as follows:

Employee Share Ownership Plan Trust
Shares subject to allocation under the Group’s equity-settled share-based payment plans are held in a separate Employee Share 
Ownership Plan Trust funded by the Company. Voting rights attached to shares held by the Trust are exercisable by the trustee, who 
is entitled to consider any recommendation made by a committee of the Company. At 16 September 2023 the Trust held 4,734,992 
(2022 – 3,042,132) ordinary shares of the Company. The market value of these shares at the year end was £99m (2022 – £40m). 
The Trust has waived its right to dividends. Movements in the year were a release of 607,140 shares and the purchase of 2,300,000 
shares (2022 – release of 718,185 shares and the purchase of 2,413,228 shares).

Fair values
The weighted average fair value of conditional grants made was determined by taking the market price of the shares at the time 
of grant and discounting for the fact that dividends are not paid during the vesting period. The weighted average fair value of the 
conditional shares allocated during the year was 1,544p (2022 – 1,660p) and the weighted average share price was 1,925p (2022 
– 1,975p). The dividend yield used was 2.5% (2022 – 2.5%).

(2022 – £157m) of current loans and overdrafts shown on the face of the balance sheet.

Current and non-current lease liabilities shown on the face of the balance sheet of £335m and £2,825m respectively (2022 – £316m 
and £2,936m respectively) comprise the £3,160m (2022 – £3,252m) of lease liabilities shown above.

Current asset investments comprise term deposits and short-term investments with original maturities of greater than three months.

Interest paid is included within financing activities. The roll-forward of the liabilities associated with interest paid is an opening balance 
of £(18)m, expense of £(128)m, payments of £118m, effect of hyperinflationary economies of £3m and a closing balance of £(25)m 
(2022 – opening balance of £(20)m, expense of £(111)m, payments of £114m, fx of £(1)m and a closing balance of £(18)m).

Valuation of financial instruments carried at fair value
Financial instruments carried at fair value on the balance sheet comprise derivatives and investments. The Group classifies these 
financial instruments using a fair value hierarchy that reflects the relative significance of both objective evidence and subjective 
judgements on the inputs used in making the fair value measurements:

•  Level 1: financial instruments are valued using observable inputs that reflect unadjusted quoted market prices in an active market for 
identical instruments. An example of an item in this category is a widely traded equity instrument with a normal quoted market price.
•  Level 2: financial instruments are valued using techniques based on observable inputs, either directly (i.e. market prices and rates) 

or indirectly (i.e. derived from market prices and rates). An example of an item in this category is a currency derivative, where 
forward exchange rates and yield curve data, which are observable in the market, are used to derive fair value.

•  Level 3: financial instruments are valued using techniques involving significant unobservable inputs.

b) Derivatives
All derivatives are classified as current on the face of the balance sheet. The table below analyses the carrying amount of derivatives 
and their contractual/notional amounts, together with an analysis of derivatives by the level in the fair value hierarchy into which their 
fair value measurement method is categorised.

£(154)m attributable to equity shareholders and £nil to non-controlling interests). Of the net movement in the year of £(152)m, £(152m 
is attributable to equity shareholders and £nil to non-controlling interests (2022 – £(111)m, £(111)m attributable to equity shareholders 
and £nil to non-controlling interests).

The balance remaining in the commodity cash flow hedge reserve from hedging relationships for which hedge accounting is no longer 
applied is £3m (2022 – £1m).

The balance in the cost of hedging reserve was not significant at 17 September 2022 or 16 September 2023.

d) Financial risk identification and management
The Group is exposed to the following financial risks from the use of financial instruments:

•  market risk; and
•  credit risk.

The Group’s financial risk management process seeks to enable the early identification, evaluation and effective management of key 
risks facing the business. Risk management policies and governance committees have been established and are reviewed regularly 
to reflect changes in market conditions and the Group’s activities. The Group, through its policies and procedures, aims to develop 
a disciplined and constructive control environment in which all employees understand their roles and obligations.

The Group sources and sells products and manufactures goods in many locations around the world. These operations expose the 
Group to potentially significant price volatility in the financial and commodity markets. Risk management teams have been established 
to manage this exposure by entering into a range of products, including physical and financial forward contracts, futures, swaps, and, 
where appropriate, options. These teams work closely with Group Treasury and report regularly to executive management.

Treasury activities and commodity hedging are conducted within a clearly defined framework of Board-approved policies and 
guidelines to manage the Group’s financial and commodity risks. Group Treasury works closely with the Group’s commercial and 
procurement teams to manage commodity risks. Group Treasury policy seeks to ensure that adequate financial resources are available 
at all times for the management and development of the Group’s businesses, whilst effectively managing its market risk and credit 
risk. The Group’s risk management policy explicitly forbids the use of financial or commodity derivatives for speculative purposes.

e) Foreign currency translation
The Group presents its financial statements in sterling. As a result of its worldwide operations, the Group is exposed to foreign 
currency translation risk where overseas operations have a functional currency other than sterling. Changes in foreign currency 
exchange rates impact the translation into sterling of both the income statement and net assets of these foreign operations.

The Group typically finances its operations using own funds generated in the functional currency of its operations and where 
appropriate, by borrowing locally in the same functional currency. This reduces net asset values reported in functional currencies other 
than sterling, thereby reducing the economic exposure to fluctuations in foreign currency exchange rates on translation.

The Group also finances its operations by obtaining funding at Group level through external borrowings and, where they are not in 
sterling, these borrowings may be designated as net investment hedges. This enables gains and losses arising on retranslation of 
these foreign currency borrowings to be charged to other comprehensive income, providing a partial offset in equity against the gains 
and losses arising on translation of the net assets of foreign operations. 

The Group also holds cross-currency interest rate swaps to hedge its fixed rate non-sterling debt. These are reported as cash flow 
hedges and net investment hedges. The change in fair value of the hedging instrument, to the degree effective, is retained in other 
comprehensive income. Under IFRS 9, the currency basis on the cross-currency swaps is excluded from the hedge designation 
and recognised in other comprehensive income – cost of hedging. The value of the currency basis is not significant. Effectiveness 
is measured using the hypothetical derivative approach. The hypothetical derivative is based on the critical terms of the debt and 
therefore the only ineffectiveness that might arise is in relation to credit risk. Credit risk is monitored regularly and is not a significant 
factor in the hedge relationship.

The Group does not actively hedge the translation impact of foreign exchange rate movements on the income statement (other than 
via the partial economic hedge arising from the servicing costs on non-sterling borrowings).

The Group designates certain of its intercompany loan arrangements as quasi-equity for the purposes of IAS 21. The effect of the 
designation is that any foreign exchange volatility arising within the borrowing entity and/or the lending entity is accounted for directly 
within other comprehensive income.

A net foreign exchange loss of £2m (2022 – £nil) on retranslation of these loans has been taken to the translation reserve on 
consolidation, all of which was attributable to equity shareholders. The Group also held cross-currency swaps that have been 
designated as hedges of its net investments in euros, whose change in fair value of £nil to the translation reserve, all of which was 
attributable to equity shareholders (2022 – £1m has been debited to the translation reserve).

f) Market risk
Market risk is the risk of movements in the fair value of future cash flows of a financial instrument or forecast transaction as 
underlying market prices change. The Group is exposed to changes in the market price of commodities, interest rates and foreign 
exchange rates. These risks are known as ‘transaction’ (or recognised) exposures and ‘economic’ (or forecast) exposures.

(i) Commodity price risk
Commodity price risk arises from the procurement of raw materials and sale of finished goods linked to market indices, the 
consequent exposure to changes in market prices.

The Group purchases a wide range of commodities in the ordinary course of business and has some sales contracts which are linked 
to financial market indices. Exposure to changes in the market price of certain of these commodities including sugar raws, energy, 
wheat, edible oils, soya beans, tea, lean hog, cocoa and rice is managed through the use of forward physical contracts and hedging 
instruments, including futures, swaps and options primarily to convert floating prices to fixed prices. The use of such contracts to 
hedge commodity exposures is governed by the Group’s risk management policies and is continually monitored by Group Treasury. 
Commodity derivatives also provide a way to meet customers’ pricing requirements whilst achieving a price structure consistent 
with the Group’s overall pricing strategy.

FINANCIAL STATEMENTS

Notes forming part of the financial statements

for the 52 weeks ended 16 September 2023

26. Financial instruments continued
Some of the Group’s commodity forward contracts are classified as ‘own use’ contracts, since they are entered into, and continue 
to be held, for the purposes of the Group’s ordinary operations. In this instance the Group takes physical delivery of the commodity 
concerned. Own use contracts do not require accounting entries until the commodity purchase actually crystallises. Where possible, 
other commodity derivatives are accounted for as cash flow hedges (typically with a one-to-one hedge ratio), but there are some 
commodity derivatives for which the strict requirements of hedge accounting cannot be satisfied. Such commodity derivatives are 
used only where the business believes they provide an economic hedge of an underlying exposure. These instruments are classified 
as held for trading and are marked to market through the income statement.

The majority of the Group’s forward physical contracts and commodity derivatives have maturities of less than one year.

The Group’s sensitivities in respect of commodity derivatives for a +/- 20% movement in underlying commodity prices are £16m 
(2022 – £62m) and £(13)m (2022 – £(57)m), respectively.

(ii) Interest rate risk
Interest rate risk comprises two primary elements:

•  interest price risk results from financial instruments bearing fixed interest rates. Changes in floating interest rates therefore affect 

the fair value of these financial instruments; and

•  interest cash flow risk results from financial instruments bearing floating rates. Changes in floating interest rates affect cash flows 

on interest receivable or payable.

The Group’s policy is to manage its mix of fixed and floating rate debt, cash and investments so that a significant change in interest 
rates does not have a material negative impact on the Group’s cash flows.

At 16 September 2023, £475m (85%) (2022 – £487m and 76%) of total debt was subject to fixed rates of interest, the majority 
of which is the 2034 public bond. Floating rate debt comprises other bank borrowings bearing interest rates for various time periods 
up to 12 months, by reference to the relevant market rate for the currency and location of the borrowing.

The Group’s cash and cash equivalents and current asset investments are subject to floating rates of interest, typically fixed for 
periods up to 3 months by reference to the relevant market rate for the currency of the cash placing or investment.

£400m of sterling interest rate swaps have been entered into so that the floating interest rate received on an equivalent balance 
of the Group’s cash and cash equivalents is fixed for the 13-month period to September 2024.

(iii) Foreign currency risk
The Group conducts business worldwide and consequently in many foreign currencies. As a result, it is exposed to movements 
in foreign currency exchange rates which affect the Group’s transaction costs. The Group also publishes its financial statements 
in sterling and is therefore exposed to movements in foreign exchange rates on the translation of the results and underlying net 
assets of its foreign operations into sterling.

Translation risk is discussed in section e) on page 169.

Transaction risk
Currency transaction exposure occurs where a business makes sales and purchases in a currency other than its functional currency. 
It also arises where monetary assets and liabilities of a business are not denominated in its functional currency, and where dividends 
or surplus funds are remitted from overseas. The Group’s policy is to match transaction exposures wherever possible, and to hedge 
actual exposures and firm commitments as soon as they occur by using forward foreign currency contracts.

The Group uses derivatives (principally forward foreign currency contracts) to hedge its exposure to movements in exchange rates on 
its foreign currency trade receivables and payables. The Group does not seek formal fair value hedge accounting for such transaction 
hedges. Instead, such derivatives are classified as held for trading and marked to market through the income statement. This offsets 
the income statement impact of the retranslation of the foreign currency trade receivables and payables.

Economic (forecast) risk
The Group principally uses forward foreign currency contracts to hedge its exposure to movements in exchange rates on its highly 
probable forecast foreign currency sales and purchases typically on a rolling 12-month basis. The Group does not formally define the 
proportion of highly probable forecast sales and purchases to hedge, but agrees an appropriate percentage on an individual basis with 
each business by reference to the Group’s risk management policies and prevailing market conditions. The Group designates currency 
derivatives used to hedge its highly probable forecast transactions as cash flow hedges. Under IFRS 9, the spot component is 
designated in the hedging relationship and forward points and currency basis are excluded and recognised in other comprehensive 
income – cost of hedging. The cost of hedging value during the period and at the balance sheet date was not material. The economic 
relationship is based on critical terms and a one-to-one hedge ratio. To the extent that cash flow hedges are effective, gains and 
losses are deferred in equity until the forecast transaction occurs, at which point the gains and losses are recycled either to the 
income statement or to the non-financial asset acquired.

The majority of the Group’s currency derivatives have original maturities of less than one year.

The Group’s most significant currency transaction exposures are:

•  sourcing for Primark – costs are denominated in a number of currencies, predominantly US dollars, euros and sterling.
•  sugar sales in British Sugar to movements in the sterling/euro exchange rate.

Elsewhere, a number of businesses make sales and purchase a variety of raw materials in foreign currencies (primarily US dollars and 
euros), giving rise to transaction exposures. In all other material respects, businesses tend to operate in their functional currencies.

The table below illustrates the effects of hedge accounting on the consolidated balance sheet and consolidated income statement 
by disclosing separately by risk category, and each type of hedge, the details of the associated hedging instrument and hedged item.

Notes forming part of the financial statements

for the 52 weeks ended 16 September 2023

26. Financial instruments continued
Hedging relationships are typically based on a one-to-one hedge ratio. The economic relationship between the hedged item and the 
hedging instrument is analysed on an ongoing basis. Sources of possible ineffectiveness include changes in forecast transactions as a 
result of timing or value or, in certain cases, different indices linked to the hedged item and the hedging instrument. As at 16 September 
2023, £2,045m of forward foreign currency contracts designated as cash flow hedges were outstanding (2022 – £2,134m), largely 
in relation to purchases of USD (£1,702m) and sales of EUR (£203m) with varying maturities up to April 2025. Weighted average 
hedge rates for these contracts are GBPUSD: 1.264, EURUSD: 1.098 and GBPEUR: 1.145. Weighted average hedge rates for the 
cross-currency swaps are GBPUSD: 1.70 and GBPEUR: 1.26. Commodity derivatives designated as cash flow hedges related to 
a range of underlying hedged items, with varying maturities up to February 2025.

The analysis of the Group’s foreign currency exposure to financial assets and liabilities by currency of denomination is as follows:

Sensitivity analysis – translation impact of non-functional assets and liabilities

The following sensitivity analysis illustrates the impact that a 10% strengthening of the Group’s transactional currencies against 
local functional currencies would have had on profit and equity. The analysis covers currency translation exposures at year end on 
businesses’ financial assets and liabilities that are not denominated in the functional currencies of those businesses. A similar but 
opposite impact would be felt on both profit and equity if the Group’s main operating currencies weakened against local functional 
currencies by a similar amount.

The exposure to foreign exchange gains and losses on translating the financial statements of subsidiaries into sterling is not included 
in this sensitivity analysis, as there is no impact on the income statement, and the gains and losses are recorded directly in the 
translation reserve in equity (see below for a separate sensitivity). This sensitivity is presented before taxation and non-controlling 
interests.

A second sensitivity analysis calculates the impact on the Group’s profit before tax if the average rates used to translate the results 
of the Group’s foreign operations into sterling were adjusted to show a 10% strengthening of sterling. A similar but opposite impact 
would be felt on profit before tax if sterling weakened against the other currencies by a similar amount.

g) Credit risk
Credit risk is the risk that counterparties to financial transactions can not perform according to the terms of the contract. The Group’s 
businesses are principally exposed to counterparty credit risk when dealing with their customers, suppliers, and from financial 
institutions.

The immediate credit exposure of financial derivatives is represented by those financial derivatives that have a net positive fair value 
by counterparty at 16 September 2023. The Group considers its maximum exposure to credit risk to be:

Cash and cash equivalents
Current asset investments
Trade and other receivables
Other non-current receivables
Investments
Derivative assets at fair value through profit and loss
Derivative assets in designated cash flow hedging relationships

In the current year, we have included cash equivalents in the above disclosure and have re-presented the prior year comparatives 
on a consistent basis.

Cash of £481m (2022 – £674m) has been excluded from this analysis as the balances are available on demand. The significant majority 
of cash balances and short-term deposits are held with strong investment-grade banks or financial institutions.

Trade and other receivables
Significant concentrations of credit risk are very limited as a result of the Group’s large and diverse customer base. The Group has 
an established credit policy applied by each business under which the credit status of each new customer is reviewed before credit 
is advanced. This includes external credit evaluations where possible and in some cases bank references. Credit limits are established 
for all significant or high-risk customers, which represent the maximum amount permitted to be outstanding without requiring 
additional approval from the appropriate level of management. Outstanding debts are continually monitored by each business. Credit 
limits are reviewed on a regular basis, and at least annually. Customers that fail to meet the Group’s benchmark creditworthiness may 
only transact on a prepayment basis. Aggregate exposures are monitored at Group level.

Many customers have been transacting with the Group for many years and the incidence of bad debts has been low. Where 
appropriate, goods are sold subject to retention of title so that, in the event of non-payment, the Group may have a secured claim. 
The Group does not typically require collateral in respect of trade and other receivables.

The Group provides for impairment of financial assets including trade and other receivables based on known events, and makes a 
collective provision for losses yet to be identified, based on historical data. The majority of the provision comprises specific amounts.

To measure expected credit losses, gross trade receivables are assessed regularly by each business locally with reference to 
considerations such as the current status of the relationship with the customer, the geographical location of each customer, and days 
past due (where applicable).

Expected losses are determined based on the historical experience of write-offs compared to the level of trade receivables. These 
historical loss expectations are adjusted for current and forward-looking information where it is identified to be significant. The Group 
considers factors such as national economic outlooks and bankruptcy rates of the countries in which its goods are sold to be the most 
relevant factors. Where the impact of these is assessed as significant, the historical loss expectations are amended accordingly.

The Group considers credit risk to have significantly increased for debts aged 180 days or over and expects these debts to be 
provided for in full. Where the Group holds insurance or has a legal right of offset with debtors who are also creditors, the loss 
expectation is applied only to the extent of the uninsured or net exposure.

Trade receivables are written off when there is no reasonable expectation of recovery, indicators of which may include the failure 
of the debtor to engage in a payment plan, and failure to make contractual payments within 180 days past due.

The maximum exposure to credit risk for trade and other receivables at the reporting date by geographic region of origin was:

UK
Europe & Africa
The Americas
Asia Pacific

Trade receivables can be analysed as follows:

Not overdue
Up to one month past due
Between one and two months past due
Between two and three months past due
More than three months past due
Expected loss provision

Trade receivables are stated net of the following expected loss provision:

No trade receivables were written off directly to the income statement in either year.

The geographical and business line complexity of the Group, combined with the fact that expected credit loss assessments are all 
performed locally, means that it is not practicable to present further analysis of expected credit losses.

In relation to other receivables not forming part of trade receivables, a similar approach has been taken to assess expected credit 
losses. No significant expected credit loss has been identified.

The directors consider that the carrying amount of trade and other receivables approximates fair value.

Cash and cash equivalents
Policies including choice of bank, opening of bank accounts and repatriation of funds must be agreed with Group Treasury. The Group 
has not recorded impairments against cash or cash equivalents, nor have any recoverability issues been identified with such balances.

h) Liquidity risk
Liquidity risk is the risk that the Group will encounter difficulty in meeting its obligations associated with its financial liabilities as they 
fall due. Group Treasury is responsible for monitoring and managing liquidity and ensures that the Group has sufficient headroom 
in its committed facilities to meet unforeseen or abnormal requirements. The Group also has access to uncommitted facilities to 
assist with short-term funding requirements.

Available headroom is monitored via the use of detailed cash flow forecasts prepared by each business, which are reviewed at least 
quarterly, or more often, as required. Actual results are compared to budget and forecast each period, and variances investigated and 
explained. Particular focus is given to management of working capital.

The Board’s treasury policies are in place to maintain a strong capital base and manage the Group’s balance sheet to ensure long-term 
financial stability. This includes maintaining access to significant total liquidity comprised of both cash and undrawn committed credit 
facilities. These policies are the basis for investor, creditor and market confidence and enable the successful development of the 
business.

Details of the Group’s borrowing facilities are given in section i) on page 176.

The above tables do not include forecast data for liabilities which may be incurred in the future but which were not contracted 
at 16 September 2023.

The principal reasons for differences between carrying values and contractual undiscounted cash flows are coupon payments on 
the fixed rate debt to which the Group is already committed, future interest payments on the Group’s lease liabilities, and cash flows 
on derivative financial instruments which are not aligned with their fair value.

i) Borrowing facilities
The Group has substantial borrowing facilities available to it. The undrawn committed facilities at 16 September 2023 amounted to 
£1,516m (2022 – £1,567m):

In addition to the above facilities there are also £149m (2022 – £114m) of undrawn and available credit lines for the purposes of issuing 
letters of credit and guarantees in the normal course of business.

The Group has issued a public bond of £400m due in 2034. Included are deferred financing costs totalling £10m which have been 
capitalised against the bond and are to be amortised over its term.

Uncommitted bank borrowing facilities are normally reaffirmed by the banks annually, although they can be withdrawn at any time.

Refer to note 9 for details of the Group’s capital commitments and to note 27 for a summary of the Group’s guarantees.

An assessment of the Group’s current liquidity position is given in the Financial Review on pages 36 to 39.

j) Capital management
The capital structure of the Group is presented in the consolidated balance sheet. For the purpose of the Group’s capital management, 
capital includes issued capital and all other reserves attributable to equity shareholders, totalling £11,093m (2022 – £11,448m). 
The consolidated statement of changes in equity provides details on equity and note 19 provides details of loans and overdrafts. 
Short- and medium-term funding requirements are provided by a variety of loan and overdraft facilities, both committed and 
uncommitted, with a range of counterparties and maturities. Longer-term debt funding is sourced from the 2034 Public Bond and 
committed revolving credit facilities.

The Board’s policy is to maintain a strong capital base so as to maintain investor, creditor and market confidence and to enable 
successful future development of the business. The financial leverage policy is that, in the ordinary course of business, the Board prefers 
to see the Group’s ratio of net debt including lease liabilities to Adjusted EBITDA to be well under 1.5 times at each half year and year 
end reporting date. The Board monitors return on capital by division and determines the overall level of dividends payable to shareholders.

From time to time the trustee of the Employee Share Ownership Plan Trust purchases the Company’s shares in the market to satisfy 
awards under the Group’s incentive plans. Once purchased, shares are not sold back into the market. The Group does not have 
a defined share buy-back plan.

There were no changes to the Group’s approach to capital management during the year. Neither the Company nor any of its 
subsidiaries is subject to externally-imposed capital requirements.

27. Contingencies
Litigation and other proceedings against the Group are not considered material in the context of these financial statements.

Where Group companies enter into financial guarantee contracts to guarantee the indebtedness of other Group companies, the Group 
considers these to be insurance arrangements and has elected to account for them as such in accordance with IFRS 4. In this respect, 
the guarantee contract is treated as a contingent liability until such time as it becomes probable that the relevant Group company 
issuing the guarantee will be required to make a payment under the guarantee.

As at 16 September 2023, Group companies have provided guarantees in the ordinary course of business amounting to £1,724m 
(2022 – £1,754m).

In 2021, a Thai court ruled in favour of the Group’s Ovaltine business in Thailand in a legal action it brought against one of its suppliers 
in respect of a contractual dispute. The court concluded that between 2009 and 2019 the supplier had overcharged Ovaltine Thailand 
and should pay compensation of 2.2 billion Thai baht (£50m; 2022 – £52m). The relevant contractual relationship between the Group 
and its supplier terminated at the end of 2019. The Group has not yet recorded an asset in respect of this matter as the defendant 
is appealing the judgment. Since the balance sheet date, a proclamation from the appeal court in Thailand has been made regarding 
the appeal by the defendant that reverses the previous judgement that was given in 2021. We are currently reviewing next steps 
with legal counsel.

1.  The Garfield Weston Foundation (‘the Foundation’) is an English charitable trust, established in 1958 by the late W. Garfield Weston. The Foundation has no 
direct interest in the Company, but as at 16 September 2023 was the beneficial owner of 683,073 shares (2022 – 683,073 shares) in Wittington Investments 
Limited representing 79.2% (2022 – 79.2%) of that company’s issued share capital and is, therefore, the Company’s ultimate controlling party. At 16 September 
2023, the trustees of the Foundation comprised nine grandchildren of the late W. Garfield Weston of whom five are children of the late Garry H. Weston.

2.  Details of the directors are given on pages 80 and 81. Their interests, including family interests, in the Company and its subsidiary undertakings are 

given on page 112 and 114. Key management personnel are considered to be the directors, and their remuneration is disclosed within the Remuneration Report 
on pages 100 to 115.

3.  The fellow subsidiary undertaking is Fortnum and Mason plc.
4.  The company with common key management personnel is the George Weston Limited group, in Canada.

Amounts due from joint ventures include £32m (2022 – £29m) of finance lease receivables (see note 14). The remainder of the balance 
is trading balances. All but £4m (2022 – £4m) of the finance lease receivables are non-current.

29. Group entities
Control of the Group
The largest group in which the results of the Company are consolidated is that headed by Wittington Investments Limited 
(‘Wittington’), the accounts of which are available at Companies House, Crown Way, Cardiff CF14 3UZ. It is the ultimate holding 
company, is incorporated in Great Britain and is registered in England.

At 16 September 2023 Wittington, together with its subsidiary, Howard Investments Limited, held 431,515,108 ordinary shares (2022 
– 431,515,108) representing in aggregate 56.2% (2022 – 54.5%) of the total issued ordinary share capital of Associated British Foods plc.

Wittington, and through their control of Wittington, the trustees of the Garfield Weston Foundation (‘the Foundation’), are controlling 
shareholders of the Company. Certain other individuals, including certain members of the Weston family who hold shares in the 
Company (and including two of the Company’s directors, George Weston and Emma Adamo) are, under the Listing Rules, treated 
as acting in concert with Wittington and the trustees of the Foundation and are therefore also treated as controlling shareholders 
of the Company. Wittington, the trustees of the Foundation and these individuals together comprise the controlling shareholders 
of the Company and, at 16 September 2023, have a combined interest in approximately 59.8% (2022 – 58.4%) of the Company’s 
voting rights. Information on the relationship agreement between the Company and its controlling shareholders is set out on pages 
116 and 117 of the Directors’ Report.

Subsidiary undertakings
A list of the Group’s subsidiaries as at 16 September 2023 is given below. The entire share capital of subsidiaries is held within the 
Group except where ownership percentages are shown. These percentages give the Group’s ultimate interest and therefore allow 
for situations where subsidiaries are owned by partly owned intermediate subsidiaries. Where subsidiaries have different classes of 
shares, this is largely for historical reasons and the effective percentage holdings given represent both the Group’s voting rights and 
equity holding. Shares in ABF Investments plc and ABF Investments (No. 2) Limited are held directly by Associated British Foods plc. 
All other holdings in subsidiaries are owned by members of the Associated British Foods plc group. All subsidiaries are consolidated 
in the Group’s financial statements.

30. Alternative performance measures
In reporting financial information, the Board uses various APMs which it believes provide useful additional information for understanding 
the financial performance and financial health of the Group. These APMs should be considered in addition to IFRS measures and are 
not intended to be a substitute for them. Since IFRS does not define APMs, they may not be directly comparable to similar measures 
used by other companies.

The Board also uses APMs to improve the comparability of information between reporting periods and geographical units (such as 
like-for-like sales) by adjusting for non-recurring or uncontrollable factors which affect IFRS measures, to aid users in understanding 
the Group’s performance.

Consequently, the Board and management use APMs for performance analysis, planning, reporting and incentive-setting.

APM

Closest equivalent 
IFRS measure

Definition/purpose

Reconciliation/calculation

Like-for-like 
sales

No direct 
equivalent

The like-for-like sales metric enables measurement of the 
performance of our retail stores on a comparable year-on-year basis.

Consistent with the 
definition given

This measure represents the change in sales at constant currency in 
our retail stores adjusted for new stores, closures and relocations. 
Refits, extensions and downsizes are also adjusted for if a store’s 
retail square footage changes by 10% or more. For each change 
described above, a store’s sales are excluded from like-for-like sales 
for one year.

No adjustments are made for disruption during refits, extensions or 
downsizes if a store’s retail square footage changes by less than 
10%, for cannibalisation by new stores, or for the timing of national or 
bank holidays.

It is measured against comparable trading days in each year.

Adjusted operating profit is stated before amortisation of non-
operating intangibles, transaction costs, amortisation of fair value 
adjustments made to acquired inventory, profits less losses on 
disposal of non-current assets and exceptional items.

Items defined above which arise in the Group’s joint ventures and 
associates are also treated as adjusting items for the purposes of 
Adjusted operating profit.

Accounting estimates and judgements

for the 52 weeks ended 16 September 2023

Significant accounting estimates
The preparation of the Company’s financial statements includes 
the use of estimates and assumptions. Although the estimates 
used are based on management’s best information about 
current circumstances and future events and actions, actual 
results may differ from those estimates. The accounting 
estimates with a significant risk of a material change to the 
carrying value of assets and liabilities within the next year are 
forecasts and discount rates, and pensions.

These are set out in Accounting estimates and judgements 
in the consolidated financial statements on page 139.

Other areas of judgement and accounting estimates
The Company’s financial statements include other areas of 
judgement and accounting estimates. While these areas do not 
meet the definition of significant accounting estimates or critical 
accounting judgements, the recognition and measurement of 
certain material assets and liabilities are based on assumptions 
and/or are subject to longer term uncertainties.

FINANCIAL STATEMENTS

for the 52 weeks ended 16 September 2023

Basis of preparation

basis, except that derivative financial instruments are stated at 
fair value, and in accordance with FRS 101 and the Companies

As permitted by FRS 101, the Company takes advantage of 
the disclosure exemptions available in relation to share-based 
payments, financial instruments, capital management, 
presentation of comparative information in respect of certain 
assets, presentation of a cash flow statement, standards not 
yet effective, impairment of assets and certain related party 
transactions. Where required, equivalent disclosures are given 
in the consolidated financial statements.

As permitted by section 408(4) of the Companies Act 2006, 
a separate income statement and statement of comprehensive 
income for the Company are not included in these financial 
statements. The principal accounting policies adopted are 
described below. They have all been applied consistently to all 
years presented.

Intangible assets
Intangible assets comprise goodwill arising on business 
combinations and operating intangibles. Goodwill is defined 
under ‘Business acquisitions’ on page 134 of the consolidated 
financial statements. The Companies Act 2006 requires goodwill 
to be amortised on a systematic basis over its useful economic 
life. Under FRS 101, goodwill is not amortised but is instead 
reviewed for impairment annually or whenever there are 
indicators of impairment. The Company previously invoked a 
‘true and fair view override’ to overcome the requirement to 
amortise goodwill in the Companies Act 2006.

Operating intangibles are stated at cost less accumulated 
amortisation and impairment charges. Amortisation is charged 
to the income statement on a straight-line basis over the 
estimated useful economic lives of intangible assets from the 
date they are available for use. The estimated useful lives are 
generally deemed to be no longer than five years.

Investments in subsidiaries
Investments in subsidiaries are stated at cost less any provision 
for impairment.

Impairment
The Company reviews the carrying amount of investments 
in subsidiaries and other assets at each balance sheet date 
to determine whether there is any indication of impairment. 
If any such indication exists, the Company estimates the asset’s 
recoverable amount. The Company recognises an impairment 
charge in the income statement whenever the carrying amount 
of an asset exceeds its recoverable amount.

The recoverable amount of assets is the greater of their fair 
value less costs to sell and their value in use. In assessing value 
in use, the Company discounts estimated future cash flows to 
present value using a pre-tax discount rate reflective of current 
market assessments of the time value of money and the risks 
specific to the asset.

The Company may reverse an impairment charge if there 
has been a change in the estimates used to determine the 
recoverable amount, but only to the extent that the new carrying 
amount does not exceed the carrying amount that would have 
been determined, net of depreciation or amortisation, if no 
impairment charge had previously been recognised.

Financial assets and liabilities
The Company recognises financial assets and financial liabilities, 
except for derivatives, initially at fair value and subsequently 
at amortised cost.

Derivatives
The Company uses derivatives to manage its economic 
exposure to financial risks. The principal instruments used are 
foreign exchange contracts and swaps and interest rate swaps. 
The Company recognises derivatives at fair value based on 
market prices or rates, or calculated using discounted cash flow 
or option pricing models. The Company recognises changes in 
the value of derivatives in the income statement unless the 
derivative is designated in a hedging relationship, when 
recognition of any change in fair value depends on the nature 
of the item being hedged.

Pensions
The Company operates one defined contribution and two 
defined benefit pension schemes. The Company is the principal 
employer of the Associated British Foods Pension Scheme, 
which is a funded final salary scheme that is closed to new 
members, as well as a small unfunded final salary scheme. 
The accounting policy for pensions is the same as for the Group, 
which is set out on page 135.

Income tax
The accounting policy for income tax is the same as for the 
Group, which is set out on page 135.

Share-based payments
The Company recognises the fair value of share awards at grant 
date as an employee expense with a corresponding increase in 
equity, spread over the period during which employees become 
unconditionally entitled to the shares.

The Company adjusts the amount recognised to reflect 
expected and actual levels of vesting except where the failure 
to vest is as a result of not meeting a market condition.

Where the Company grants allocations of shares to employees 
of its subsidiaries, these are accounted for on the same basis as 
allocations to employees of the Company, except that the fair 
value is recognised as an increase to investment in subsidiaries 
with a corresponding increase in equity.

Cash and cash equivalents
Cash and cash equivalents comprise bank and cash balances, 
deposits and short-term investments with original maturities 
of three months or less.

Leases
The accounting policy for leases is the same as for the Group, 
which is set out on page 137.

carrying one vote per share (2022 – 791,674,183). Total nominal value was £44m (2022 – £45m).

Capital redemption reserve
£2m arose in 2010 following redemption of two million £1 deferred shares at par. £1m arose in 2023 following the purchase 
and subsequent cancellation of shares (2022 – nil). The capital redemption reserve is regarded as non-distributable.

Dividends
Details of dividends paid and proposed are provided in note 6 to the consolidated financial statements.

Share-based payments
Details of the Company’s equity-settled share-based payment plans are provided in note 24 to the consolidated financial statements.

Hedging reserve
The hedging reserve comprises all changes in the value of derivatives to the extent that they are effective cash flow hedges, net 
of amounts recycled from the hedging reserve on occurrence of the hedged transaction or when the hedged transaction is no longer 
expected to occur.

9. Contingent liabilities
Where the Company enters into financial guarantee contracts to guarantee the indebtedness of other companies within its group, 
the Company considers these to be insurance arrangements and accounts for them as such. The guarantee contract is treated as a 
contingent liability until such time as it becomes probable that the Company will be required to make a payment under the guarantee.

At year end, the Company had provided £480m of guarantees in the ordinary course of business (2022 – £484m).

party relationship with its subsidiaries, associates and joint ventures and directors. In the course of normal operations, related party 
transactions entered into by the Company have been contracted on an arm’s length basis.

Warning about share fraud
From time to time, companies, their subsidiary companies, and shareholders can be the subject of investment scams. The perpetrators 
obtain lists of shareholders or subsidiaries and make unsolicited phone calls or correspondence concerning investment matters. 
They may offer to sell worthless or high-risk shares and may offer to buy your current shareholdings at an unrealistic price. They will 
often also inform you of untrue scenarios to make you think that you need to sell your shares or to justify an offer that seems too 
good to be true. These operations are commonly known as ‘boiler rooms’.

Shareholders are advised to be very wary of any offers of unsolicited advice, discounted shares, premium prices for shares they own 
or unsolicited investment opportunities. If you receive any such unsolicited calls, correspondence or investment advice:

•  ensure you get the correct name of the person and firm;
•  check that the firm is on the Financial Conduct Authority (FCA) Register to ensure they are authorised at https://register.fca.org.uk/;
•  use the details on the FCA Register to contact the firm;
•  call the FCA Consumer Helpline (0800 111 6768) if there are no contact details in the Register or you are told they are out of date; and
•  if you feel uncomfortable with the call or the calls persist, simply hang up.

Forward-looking statements
This report contains forward-looking statements. These have been made by the directors in good faith based on the information 
available to them up to the time of their approval of this report. The directors can give no assurance that these expectations will 
prove to have been correct. Due to the inherent uncertainties, including both economic and business risk factors underlying such 
forward-looking information, actual results may differ materially from those expressed or implied by these forward-looking statements. 
The directors undertake no obligation to update any forward-looking statements whether as a result of new information, future 
events or otherwise.
