(1)  Net  Sales  Value  (NSV)  growth  is  calculated  on  budgeted  currency  exchange  rates,  after  adjustments  for  acquisitions  and  disposals  and  incorporates  the  organic  treatment  of 

hyperinflationary economies.

(2)   Profit before exceptionals and tax growth is presented on a constant currency basis and it excludes the impact of acquisitions and disposals. The impact of hyperinflation on operating 

profit is considered under the same organic methodology as for net sales while the impact on other lines (primarily on finance charges) is excluded. This metric also includes adjustment 
to exclude the fair value remeasurement of contingent considerations, earn out arrangements and biological assets and to exclude post-employment credits. Furthermore, the metric 
excluded the interest on current year’s share repurchase program (SRP) and excludes the year-over-year change of M&A related interest.

(3)  Cumulative FCF is based on the outcome for each of the three years within the performance period, measured before exceptional items and on an FX neutral basis by adjusting actual 

outcomes back to the base year exchange rates, and incorporates the organic treatment of hyperinflationary economies. Furthermore, the cash flow impact of any material business 
development activities such as share repurchase programmes, acquisitions and disposals, which were not known and planned at the beginning of the vesting period, are excluded from 
the 3-year performance.

(4)  Relative total shareholder return (TSR) is measured as the percentage growth in Diageo’s share price (assuming all dividends and capital distributions are re-invested) compared to the 
TSR of a peer group of 16 international drinks and consumer goods companies. TSR calculations are based on an averaging period of 6 months and converted to a common currency 
(US dollars). Calculation is performed and provided by FIT.

(5)   No discretion was exercised by the Remuneration Committee in determining the long-term incentive outcomes.
(6)  At the time of grant of the 2020 awards, Debra Crew and Lavanya Chandrashekar were not Executive Directors. The vesting schedule for awards granted to executives below the Board 

has a threshold vesting of 25% of maximum (62.5% at midpoint). Vesting at threshold for awards granted to Executive Directors is 20% of maximum (60.0% at midpoint). No options 
were granted to Lavanya Chandrashekar in 2020 as she was not on the Executive Committee at the time of grant.

Pensions and benefits in the year ended 30 June 2023 
Benefits provisions for the Executive Directors are in accordance with the information set out in the Directors’ remuneration policy. 

Pension arrangements (audited)
Ivan Menezes was a member of the Diageo North America Inc. Supplemental Executive Retirement Plan (SERP), with an accrual rate of 20% of 
base salary until 1 January 2023 when it was reduced to 14% of base salary, until his date of death of 6 June 2023. Debra Crew and Lavanya 
Chandrashekar are members of the SERP with an accrual rate of 14% of base salary respectively during the year ended 30 June 2023. The SERP is 
an unfunded, non-qualified supplemental retirement programme. Under the plan, accrued company contributions are subject to quarterly interest 
credits. Under the rules of the SERP, Debra Crew and Lavanya Chandrashekar can withdraw the balance of the plan six months after leaving service 
or age 55, if later and the balance may be withdrawn in either a lump sum or five equal annual instalments, depending on the size of the balance. 

Ivan Menezes, Debra Crew and Lavanya Chandrashekar participated in the US Cash Balance Plan and the Benefit Supplemental Plan (BSP), until 
August 2012, 30 September 2022 and June 2021 respectively, and have accrued benefits under both plans. The Cash Balance Plan is a qualified 
funded pension arrangement. Employer contributions were 10% of pay capped at the Internal Revenue Service (IRS) limit. The BSP is a non-qualified 
unfunded arrangement; notional employer contributions were 10% of pay above the IRS limit. Interest (notional for the BSP) is credited quarterly on 
both plans. 

Ivan Menezes was also a member of the Diageo Pension Scheme (DPS) in the United Kingdom between 1 February 1997 and 30 November 1999. 
The accrual of pensionable service ceased in 1999 but the linkage to salary remained until January 2012.    

Upon death in service on 6 June 2023, a life insurance benefit of $3 million became payable by the insurance provider for Ivan Menezes. In the 
event of death in service, a lump sum of six times base salary is payable to Debra Crew and Lavanya Chandrashekar. 

The table below shows the pension benefits accrued by each Executive Director as at year end (or to 6 June 2023 in the case of Ivan Menezes). The 
accrued United Kingdom benefits for Ivan Menezes are annual pension amounts, whereas the accrued US benefits for Ivan Menezes, Debra Crew 
and Lavanya Chandrashekar are one-off cash balance amounts.

Ivan Menezes' US benefits are higher at 6 June 2023  than at 30 June 2022 by £312k. The breakdown of this relates to £452k of which is due to pension benefits earned over the year 
(none of which is over and above the increase due to inflation – as reported in the single figure of remuneration, see page 139), £103k of which is due to interest earned on his deferred 
US benefits until his death in service and a reduction of (£243k) which is due to exchange rate movements over the year.

(2)   Debra Crew's US benefits are the same at 30 June 2023 than at the date of her appointment to interim CEO and Executive Director and CEO. The breakdown of this relates to £10k of 

which is due to pension benefits earned over the year (all of which is over and above the increase due to inflation – as reported in the single figure of remuneration, see page 139), £1k of 
which is due to interest earned on her deferred US benefits over the year and a reduction of (£11k) of which is due to exchange rate movements over the year.

(3)    Lavanya Chandrashekar's US benefits are higher at 30 June 2023 than at 30 June 2022 by £111k. The breakdown of this relates to £122k of which is due to pension benefits earned over 

the year (£110k of which is over and above the increase due to inflation – as reported in the single figure of remuneration, see page 139),  £7k of which is due to interest earned on her 
deferred US benefits over the year and a reduction of (£18k) of which is due to exchange rate movements over the year.

(1)   The total long-term incentives value shown in the single figure of remuneration on page 139 is split between performance shares and share options in the table above and is based on an 

average ADR price for the last three months of the fiscal year ($178.52).

(2)  The value of performance share awards and options awarded and vesting included in the table above for Debra Crew are pro-rata amounts reflecting the period from 5 to 30 June as a 
proportion of the three-year performance period, as shown in the single figure of remuneration on page 139. The 1,176 pro-rata performance shares awarded comprises 714 performance 
shares granted under the DLTIP (total award of 30,076 ADRs) and 462 performance shares granted under the DESAP (total award of 19,494 ADRs), which was granted in recognition of 
equity which was forfeited on joining Diageo. The pro-rata share options number reflects 714 share options granted under the DLTIP (total award of 30,076 ADRs)

In considering the vesting outcome of the 2020 DLTIP awards, the Remuneration Committee was especially cognisant of investor concerns around 
the potential risk of windfall gains following volatility in global stock markets at the time of grant as a result of the Covid-19 pandemic. The 
Committee considered a number of factors including share price movement over the performance period (up 26%), Diageo's underlying financial 
performance, historical award and vesting levels and absolute award value. The Committee noted that the 2020 DLTIP awards were made in 
September 2020 and, in line with usual Diageo practice, the number of awards granted was determined using a six-month average share price up 
to 30 June. This helps to smooth out share price volatility and, at $143.63 for the 2020 grants, the price used to calculate the awards was only 
around 10% lower than the prior year's price. The Committee considered Diageo’s overall business performance and value created for shareholders 
and other relevant factors over the period and determined that the outcomes were fair and appropriate and made no adjustment to the payouts. It 
also considered the level of difficulty of the targets set at a time of uncertainty and determined that the vesting outcome was consistent with Diageo's 
long-term performance and returns to shareholders. Diageo's compound annual growth in net sales and profit over this period have also been at 
the top end of the global peer group.

Long-term incentive awards made during the year ended 30 June 2023 (audited)

Outstanding share plan interests (audited)

On 3 September 2022, Ivan Menezes, Debra Crew and Lavanya Chandrashekar received awards of performance shares and market-priced share 
options under the DLTIP based on a percentage of base salary as outlined below. Ms Crew was not an Executive Director at the time of grant. The 
three-year period over which performance will be measured is 1 July 2022 to 30 June 2025. 

The performance measures and targets for awards made in September 2022 are outlined below. Net sales and profit before exceptional items and 
tax are key levers for driving top and bottom line growth. The free cash flow measure was selected because it represents a robust measure of cash 
performance consistent with typical external practice and is a key strategic priority. Total shareholder return, the only relative performance measure 
under the plan, provides good alignment with shareholder interests and increases the leverage based on share price growth. Finally, the 
environmental, social and governance (ESG) measure (20% of total performance share award), which was introduced in 2020, reinforces the 
stretching and strategically important goals under the ‘Society 2030: Spirit of Progress’ ambition, Diageo’s 10-year action plan to help create an 
inclusive and sustainable world. The definition of the ESG measures was set out on page 130 of the annual remuneration report for fiscal 22.

The cumulative free cash flow (FCF) targets have been restated in USD following the change in reporting currency from fiscal 24 onwards (original GBP target range was £7,650m - 
£9,450m). More details can be found on page 36.

20% (25% for Ms Crew as the awards were made before she became an Executive Director) of DLTIP awards will vest at threshold, with vesting in a 
straight line up to 100% if the maximum level of performance is achieved. As explained in the remuneration policy, one performance share is 
deemed equal in value at grant to three share options.

The proportion of the awards outlined above that will vest is dependent on the achievement of performance conditions and continued employment, 
and the actual value received may be nil. The vesting outcomes will be disclosed in the 2025 annual remuneration report. 

In accordance with the plan rules, the number of performance shares and share options granted under the DLTIP was calculated by using the 
average closing ADR price for the last six months of the preceding financial year ($195.29). This price is used to determine the face value in the table 
above. In accordance with the plan rules, the exercise price was calculated using the average closing ADR price of the three days preceding the 
grant date ($176.95).

(1)   For unvested awards, this is the number of shares/options initially awarded. For exercisable share options, this is the number of outstanding options. All share options have an expiry date 

of 10 years after the date of grant. 

(2)   ADRs have been converted to ORDs (one ADR is equivalent to four ordinary shares) for the purpose of calculating the total number of vested and unvested shares and options. 
(3)   The total number of share options granted under the DLTIP in September 2017, 2018 and 2019 showing as outstanding as at 30 June 2023 are vested but unexercised share options. 
(4)  Performance shares and share options granted under the DLTIP in September 2020 and due to vest in September 2023 are included here as unvested share awards subject to 

performance conditions, although the awards have also been included in the single figure of remuneration table on page 139, since the performance period ended during the year 
ended 30 June 2023. 

(5)    Details of the performance conditions attached to DLTIP and DESAP awards of performance shares and share options granted in 2020 are organic net sales growth (4%-8%), organic 
growth in profit before exceptional items and tax (4.5%-12%), reduction in greenhouse gas emissions (6.3% - 14.3%), improvement in water efficiency (5.8%-11.2%), changing attitudes 
on dangers of underage drinking (0.75m-1.25m), % of female leaders (41%-43%), % of ethnically diverse leaders (38%-40%), cumulative free cash flow (£6,200m-£8,200m) and 
relative total shareholder return (median-upper quintile). 

(6)   Details of the performance conditions attached to DLTIP awards of performance shares and share options granted in 2021 are organic net sales growth (5%-9%), organic growth in profit 
before exceptional items and tax (6.5%-13.5%), reduction in greenhouse gas emissions (19.1%-27.1%), improvement in water efficiency (6.3%-12.1%), changing attitudes on dangers of 
underage drinking (2.3m-3.7m), % of female leaders (44%-46%), % of ethnically diverse leaders (39%-41%), cumulative free cash flow ($10,058m-$12,488m) and relative total 
shareholder return (median-upper quintile). 

(7)  Details of the performance conditions attached to DLTIP awards of performance shares and share options granted in 2022 are organic net sales growth (4.5%-8.5%), organic growth in 
profit before exceptional items and tax (5.0%-12.0%), reduction in greenhouse gas emissions (10.7%-17.6%), improvement in water efficiency (6.3%-12.1%), changing attitudes on 
dangers of underage drinking (2.6m-4.0m), % of female leaders (45%-47%), % ethnically diverse leaders (42%-44%), cumulative free cash flow ($10,175m-$12,569m) and relative total 
shareholder return (median-upper quintile).

(8)  The performance shares awarded to Debra Crew in 2020 under the Diageo Exceptional Stock Award Plan (DESAP) were granted in recognition of equity which was forfeited on joining 

Diageo in 2020 and have the same performance measures and targets as the 2020 DLTIP performance shares (see footnote 5).  Debra Crew was granted a number of performance 
shares and restricted stock units under the DESAP in March 2022 for incentive and retention purposes. The DESAP performance shares will vest based on a performance hurdle of winning 
or holding market share in at least 2/3rs of total NSV in measured markets over the respective three-year performance periods (F23-F25 for awards due to vest in September 2026, F24-
F26 for awards due to vest in September 2027 and F25-F27 for awards due to vest in September 2028). The DESAP restricted stock units vest subject to continued employment up to the 
vesting date. 
In accordance with the policy and plan rules treatment on death-in-service, the 2020, 2021 and 2022 awards for Ivan Menezes vested early on 2 August 2023 based on an assessment of 
performance as at 30 June 2023. Further information can be found on page 150. 

(9) 

(10)  Lavanya Chandrashekar was granted a number of restricted stock units prior to her appointment as CFO and joining the Board.
(11)  The Free Cash Flow (FCF) performance targets for both the 2021 and 2022 DLTIP awards have been restated in USD following the change in functional currency. More details can be 

found on page 36.

Remuneration for the wider workforce and CEO pay ratio

Alignment of Executive pay with the wider workforce 
There is clear alignment in the approach to pay for executives and the wider workforce in the way that remuneration principles are followed, as well 
as the mechanics of the salary review process and incentive plan design, which are broadly consistent throughout the organisation. There is a strong 
focus on performance-related pay, and the performance measures under the annual incentive plan and long-term incentive plan are the same for 
executives and other eligible employees. The reward package for Executive Directors is consistent with that of the senior management population, 
however, a much higher proportion of total remuneration for the Executive Directors is linked to business performance, compared to the rest of the 
employee population.  The Chairman also explains the Directors' remuneration policy to employees and seeks their feedback as part of the 
workforce engagement sessions.

The structure of our reward packages is based on the principle that it should enable Diageo to attract and retain the best talent globally within our 
broader industry. It is driven by local market practice, as well as the level of seniority and accountability, reflecting the global nature of our business. 
Diageo is committed to fostering an inclusive and diverse workplace, and creating a culture where every individual can thrive. Reflective of this, pay 
parity and consistency of treatment for all employees are critical to the reward practices across the organisation. The reward framework is regularly 
reviewed to ensure employees are rewarded fairly and appropriately, in line with the business strategy, performance outcomes, competitive paid 
market practice and our diversity agenda. 

During the year, the Chairman explained the directors' remuneration policy and alignment with wider workforce pay to employees as part of the 
workforce engagement sessions. 

Remuneration Committee review of wider workforce pay
Each year, the Remuneration Committee has a detailed session reviewing wider workforce remuneration. In fiscal 23, the review focussed on the 
prior year’s annual reward cycle outcomes, including improvements made to base pay competitive positions, the level of differentiation across our 
reward programmes, gender pay equity analysis, how cost-of-living challenges were addressed and how we have used reward structures to attract 
talent in key skills areas. The all-employee reward priorities for the coming year were also reviewed by the Committee. Information on wider 
workforce reward is also provided as required throughout the year to enable the Committee to consider the broader employee context when 
making executive remuneration decisions, for example the annual salary increase budgets by country.

Supporting our employees
We continue to focus on all aspects of the wellbeing of our employees. Early in fiscal 2023, we made a one-time recognition payment of £1,000 
gross (capped at 15% of local equivalent annual salary) to thank employees for their ongoing efforts and support them with the rising cost of living 
in many locations. Since then, the Executive Committee has continued to monitor the cost-of-living in all our geographies using a formal monitoring 
process and has implemented actions as required, for example off-cycle salary increases in 16 high-inflation geographies. We have also provided 
financial education to all employees to support them in managing their personal finances more effectively.

Other reward based initiatives include the roll out of a new recognition platform into North America and the UK, with more regions planned for fiscal 
24. We have deployed global support for menopause, including a global app for employees.

We continue to innovate with market leading benefit policies that support and demonstrate our commitment to diversity and inclusion, including  
increasing the provision of fertility support and personal counselling. We have continued to evolve our flexible working policy, creating guidelines to 
empower employees and leaders to decide how, when and where they create their best work, making sure our people consider what works best for 
the individual's and team's success.

The renewed focus on our employee assistance programmes continued with the deployment of a global mental health online tool in November 
2022. This enables employees to proactively manage their mental health and covers key topics like sleep, diet, relationships and managing stress. 
To date the tool has been downloaded by over 4.7k employees, which is 19% of the global population. 

CEO pay ratio
In accordance with The Companies (Miscellaneous Reporting) Regulations 2018, the table below sets out Diageo’s CEO pay ratios for the year 
ended 30 June 2023. These CEO pay ratios provide a comparison of the Chief Executive’s total remuneration, comprising the sum of both Ivan 
Menezes and Debra Crew's total single figure of remuneration, converted into sterling, with the equivalent remuneration for the employees paid at 
the 25th (P25), 50th (P50) and 75th (P75) percentile of Diageo’s workforce in the United Kingdom. Also shown are the salary and total remuneration 
for each quartile employee.

(1)   2022 CEO pay ratios have been updated to reflect the value of the updated 2022 single figure which incorporates long-term incentives based on the actual share price at vesting, rather 

than the average share price in the last three months of the financial year which had been used for the 2022 disclosure.

(2)  Only people employed in the United Kingdom and with the same number of contractual working hours throughout the full 12-month period have been included in the calculation. 

Inclusion of employees outside of this group would require a complex simulation of full-time annual remuneration based on a number of assumptions and would not have a meaningful 
impact on the ratio.

Methodology 
Consistent with the approach for Diageo’s disclosure in previous years, the methodology used to identify the employees at each quartile for 2023 is 
Option A, as defined in the regulations. We believe this is the most robust and accurate approach, and is in line with shareholder expectations. 

Total full-time equivalent remuneration for employees reflects all pay and benefits received by an individual in respect of the relevant year and has, 
other than where noted below, been calculated in line with the methodology for the ‘single figure of remuneration’ for the Chief Executive (shown on 
page 139 of this report). The total remuneration calculations were based on data as at 30 June 2023. Actual remuneration was converted into the 
full-time equivalent for the role and location by pro-rating earnings to reflect full-time contractual working hours and these figures were then ranked 
to identify the employees sitting at the percentiles. To ensure that the total remuneration for the selected median, 25th and 75th percentile employee 
is sufficiently representative of those positions, we calculated the total remuneration for a number of employees above and below each of the 
selected median, 25th and 75th percentile UK employees and used the median value.  In light of financial performance outcomes being signed off 
close to the publication of the Annual Report, the Diageo Group business multiple, which is applicable to the majority of UK employees, has been 
used to calculate all payments under the annual incentive, although some employees may receive a variation on this multiple in practice. Pension 
values for each employee are not calculated on an actuarial basis as for the Chief Executive, but rather as the notional cost of the company’s 
pension contribution during the financial year, according to the relevant section of the pension scheme for each individual. This approach allows 
meaningful data for a large group of people to be obtained in a more efficient way.

Points to note for the year ended 30 June 2023   
Diageo has delivered a strong set of results for fiscal 23 during a period of volatility, however payouts under the annual incentive plan both for 
Diageo’s Chief Executive and the wider UK workforce are lower than the prior two years which saw double digit growth in organic net sales and 
operating profit. The annual incentive plan outcome is directly linked to awards made under the Freeshares scheme, which all UK employees are 
eligible to participate in. The median remuneration and resulting pay ratio for 2023 are consistent with the pay and progression policies for Diageo’s 
UK employees as a whole and reflect the impact of performance-related pay on total remuneration for the year. As the Chief Executive has a larger 
proportion of their total remuneration linked to business performance than other employees in the UK workforce, the ratio has increased versus last 
year due to a significantly higher performance outcome under the 2020 long-term incentives which vested this year, compared to the 2019 awards

Executive's remuneration. However, total remuneration for employees is reduced by the lower bonus outcome for fiscal 23 relative to fiscal 22.

(1) Around 60 UK-based employees are employed by Diageo plc. Their remuneration has been calculated in line with the approach used for the CEO pay-ratio calculation and the average 

year-on-year change has been reported. Only those employed during the full financial year have been included in calculations.

(2) Calculated by dividing staff cost related to salaries, bonus and benefits by the average number of employees on a full-time equivalent basis, as disclosed in note 3c to the financial 

statements under staff costs and average number of employees on page 178, but reduced to account for the inclusion of Executive Directors in reported figures. The salary, bonus and 
benefits cost data used for calculation are subsets of the Wages and salaries figure disclosed in this note. The salary data used for this calculation has been adjusted to exclude costs 
related to severance payments which are included in staff costs, and last year’s disclosure has been updated in line with this for consistency. In line with the approach for Directors, the 
bonus values used for the calculation reflect the bonus earned in relation to performance during the relevant financial year.

(3) Calculated using the data from the single figure table in the annual report on remuneration (page 139) in US dollars, reflecting payment currency for Ivan Menezes, Debra Crew and 

Lavanya Chandrashekar.

(4) Calculated using the fees and taxable benefits disclosed under Non-Executive Directors’ remuneration in the table on page 151. Taxable benefits for Non-Executive Directors comprise a 

product allowance as well as expense reimbursements relating to attendance at Board meetings, which may vary year-on-year.

(5) N/A refers to a nil value in the previous year or an incomplete prior year, meaning that the year-on-year change cannot be calculated.
The year-on-year percentage change for Ivan Menezes for 2023 is not included as we are not reporting full year values for 2023.
(6)
The increase in benefits value in fiscal 23 relates to an increase in travel expenses due to more in-person meetings taking place in fiscal 23. 
(7)

Payments to former Directors (audited) 
There were no payments to former Directors in the year ended 30 June 2023.

Payments for loss of office (audited)
Details of Sir Ivan Menezes' salary, benefits and bonus payable up to and including the date of his death, which was also his last day of 
employment (6 June 2023) are set out in the single total figure table on page 139. The time pro-rated bonus is based on full year performance and is 
payable at the normal time entirely in cash, the Committee having exercised its discretion to waive the one-third payment in deferred shares. Sir 
Ivan’s deferred bonus shares from fiscal 21 and fiscal 22 vested on the date of death in accordance with the plan rules. 

Sir Ivan’s unvested long-term incentive awards granted in 2020, 2021 and 2022 vested early on 2 August 2023 in accordance with the treatment 
under the plan rules on death-in-service, subject to an assessment against the performance measures and time pro-rating. The Committee exercised 
its discretion under the policy to slightly extend the time pro-rating from 6 to 30 June 2023 on compassionate grounds to reflect the full fiscal 23 year. 
The 2020 award vested based on actual performance measured over the full three-year period to 30 June 2023 as disclosed on pages 141 and 142. 
The 2021 and 2022 awards vested subject to an assessment by the Committee against the performance measures as at 30 June 2023. Sir Ivan was 
originally awarded 36,675 PSP and 36,675 SESOP options in 2021 which were each time pro-rated to 24,427 awards. The 2021 PSP award vested at 
81.2% and the 2021 SESOP award vested at 10.0%. The 2022 awards (33,845 PSP awards and 33,845 SESOP awards) were each time pro-rated to 
11,271 awards and vested at 48.0% (PSP) and 0.0% (SESOP). The total vesting value of the 2021 and 2022 awards was $3,693k and $987k 
respectively, calculated based on the average Diageo ADR share price over the three months from 1 April 2023 to 30 June 2023 of $178.52. The 
Committee has chosen not to disclose the detail of performance relative to the targets set for each performance measure for the 2021 and 2022 
awards, measured over the shortened period, on the basis that the information is regarded as commercially sensitive. SESOP options will be 
exercisable for 24 months from the date of death (already vested options) and the date of vesting (options vesting early on 2 August 2023), the 
Committee having exercised discretion to extend from 12 months to give the estate sufficient time to exercise the options. The two-year post-vesting 
holding periods will not apply and the post-employment shareholding requirement falls away.

Sir Ivan’s 2006 employment contract provided for lifetime medical cover for Sir Ivan and his spouse on a cost sharing basis with the company. The 
lifetime medical cover will continue for Sir Ivan’s surviving spouse, the company cost of which for the first year is $12,381, based on 2023 rates. The 

company will continue to provide tax support up to a maximum annual amount of £28,000 (excl. VAT) for fees incurred in connection with UK and 
US tax return submissions up to and including the 2023 US tax return and the 2023/24 UK tax return, which are the final returns required to be 
submitted on behalf of Sir Ivan before tax filings become a matter for his estate. Upon death-in-service, a life assurance benefit of $3 million became 
payable by the insurance provider and Sir Ivan’s pension benefits will be treated in accordance with the terms of the relevant pension plans.

Non-Executive Directors 
Fee policy 
Javier Ferrán’s fee as non-executive Chairman was increased by 3% from £650,000 per annum to £670,000 on 1 October 2022. The Chairman’s

Annual incentive design for the year ending 
30 June 2024

The measures and targets for the annual incentive plan are reviewed 
annually by the Remuneration Committee and are carefully chosen to 
drive financial and individual business performance goals related to 
the company’s short-term strategic operational objectives. The plan 
design for Executive Directors for the year ending 30 June 2024 will 
comprise the following performance measures and weightings (no 
change from last year), with targets set for the full financial year: 

• net sales (% growth) (26.67% weighting): a key performance 

measure of year-on-year top line growth;

• operating profit (% growth) (26.67% weighting): stretching profit 

targets drive operational efficiency and influence the level of returns 
that can be delivered to shareholders through increases in share 
price and dividend income not including exceptional items or 
exchange; 

• operating cash conversion (26.67% weighting): ensures focus on 

efficient cash delivery by the end of the year; and

• individual business objectives (20% weighting): measurable 

deliverables that are specific to the individual and are focussed on 
supporting the delivery of key strategic objectives.  

The Committee has discretion to adjust the payout to reflect underlying 
business performance and any other relevant factors.  

Details of the targets for the year ending 30 June 2024 will be disclosed 
retrospectively in next year’s annual report on remuneration, by which 
time they will no longer be deemed commercially sensitive by the 
Board.

The annual incentive opportunity for Executive Directors will remain 
consistent with prior years, equal to 100% of base salary at target, with 
a maximum opportunity of 200% of base salary. 

Long-term incentive awards to be made in the 
year ending 30 June 2024 

The long-term incentive plan measures are reviewed annually by the 
Remuneration Committee and are selected to reward long-term 
consistent performance in line with Diageo’s business strategy and to 
create alignment with the delivery of value for shareholders. The 
Committee has ensured that the incentive structure for senior 
management does not raise environmental, social and governance 
risks by inadvertently motivating irresponsible behaviour.

 As per last year, DLTIP awards to be made in September 2023 will 
comprise awards of both performance shares and share options, 

based on stretching targets against the key performance measures as 
outlined in the table on page 153, assessed over a three-year 
performance period. The relative total shareholder return measure is 
based on the same constituent group and vesting schedule as outlined 
on page 141.

The performance share element of the DLTIP applies to the Executive 
Committee and the top level of senior leaders across the organisation 
worldwide, whilst the share option element is applicable to a much 
smaller population comprising only members of the Executive 
Committee. One market price performance-based option is valued at 
one-third of a performance share. 

The ESG measures in the DLTIP comprise four goals reflecting the 
‘Society 2030: Spirit of Progress‘ strategy, to make a positive impact on 
the environment and society. Each goal is weighted equally:

• reduction in greenhouse gas emissions in our direct operations 

(scope 1&2);

• improvement in the water efficiency index;
• number of people who confirm changed attitudes to the dangers of 

underage drinking after participating in a Diageo-supported 
education programme; and

• inclusion and diversity (percentage of female leaders globally and 

percentage of ethnically diverse leaders globally).

From fiscal 24, the water efficiency KPI under the 'Society 2023: Spirit of 
Progress' goals will use an index approach which links directly to the 
underlying water efficiency of the two production pillars of distillation 
and brewing & packaging. This methodology is described further on 
page 79 and the water efficiency component of the 2023 DLTIP awards 
reflects the updated 'Society 2030: Spirit of Progress' KPI.

Awards are calculated on the basis of a six-month average share price 
for the period ending 30 June 2023.

It is intended that a DLTIP award to the equivalent of 500% of base 
salary will be made to Debra Crew in September 2023, comprising 
375% of salary in performance shares and the equivalent of 125% of 
salary in market price performance-based share options. It is intended 
that a DLTIP award to the equivalent of 480% of salary will be made to 
Lavanya Chandrashekar in September 2023, comprising 360% of 
salary in performance shares and the equivalent of 120% of salary in 
market price share options. In performance share equivalents, one 
market price option is valued at one-third of a performance share. 

The table below summarises the annual DLTIP awards to Debra Crew 
and Lavanya Chandrashekar to be made in September 2023.

with the UK Corporate Governance Code, all the Directors will retire by 
rotation at the AGM and offer themselves for re-election. Further details 
of Directors’ contracts, remuneration and their interests in the shares of 
the company at 30 June 2023 are given in the Directors’ remuneration 
report. The Directors’ powers are determined by UK legislation and 
Diageo’s articles of association. The Directors may exercise all the 
company’s powers provided that Diageo’s articles of association or 
applicable legislation do not stipulate that any powers must be 
exercised by the members.

Auditor
The auditor, PricewaterhouseCoopers LLP, is willing to continue in office 
and a resolution for its re-appointment as auditor of the company will 
be submitted to the AGM. 

Disclosure of information to the auditor 
In accordance with Section 418 of the Companies Act 2006, the 
Directors who held office at the date of approval of this Directors’ report 
confirm that, so far as they are each aware, there is no relevant audit

Director has taken all reasonable steps to ascertain any relevant audit 
information and to ensure that the company’s auditor is aware of that 
information.

Corporate governance statement
The corporate governance statement, prepared in accordance with 
rule 7.2 of the Financial Conduct Authority’s Disclosure Guidance and 
Transparency Rules, comprises the following sections of the Annual 
Report: the ‘Corporate governance report’, the ‘Audit Committee 
report’ and the ‘Additional information for shareholders’.

Significant agreements – change of control
The following significant agreements contain certain termination and 
other rights for Diageo’s counterparties upon a change of control of the 
company. Under the partners agreement governing the company’s 
34% investment in Moët Hennessy SAS (MH) and Moët Hennessy 
International SAS (MHI), if a Competitor (as defined therein) directly or 
indirectly takes control of the company (which, for these purposes, 
would occur if such Competitor acquired more than 34% of the voting 
rights or equity interests in the company), LVMH Moët Hennessy – Louis 
Vuitton SA (LVMH) may require the company to sell its interests in MH 
and MHI to LVMH.

The master agreement governing the operation of the group’s market-
level distribution joint ventures with LVMH states that if any person 

154

Diageo  Annual Report 2023

acquires interests and rights in the company resulting in a Control 
Event (as defined) occurring in respect of the company, LVMH may 
within 12 months of the Control Event either appoint and remove the 
chairman of each joint venture entity governed by such master 
agreement, who shall be given a casting vote, or require each 
distribution joint venture entity to be wound up. Control Event for these 
purposes is defined as the acquisition by any person of more than 30% 
of the outstanding voting rights or equity interests in the company, 
provided that no other person or entity (or group of affiliated persons 
or entities) holds directly or indirectly more than 30% of the voting 
rights in the company.

Transactions with related parties are disclosed in note 21 to the 
consolidated financial statements.

(1) On 3 February 2023, BlackRock Inc. filed an Amendment to Schedule 13G with the 
SEC in respect of the calendar year ended 31 December 2010, reporting that, as of 
December 31, 2022, 190,024,658 ordinary shares representing 8.4% of the issued 
ordinary share capital were beneficially owned by BlackRock Inc. and its subsidiaries 
(including BlackRock Investment Management (UK) Limited).

(2) On 8 February 2023, Massachusetts Financial Services Company filed an Amendment 
to Schedule 13G with the SEC in respect of the calendar year ended 31 December 
2018, reporting that, as of December 31, 2022, 118,813,187 ordinary shares representing 
5.2% of the issued ordinary share capital were beneficially owned by Massachusetts 
Financial Services Company.

The company has not been notified of any other substantial interests in 
its securities since 30 June 2023. The company’s substantial 
shareholders do not have different voting rights. Diageo, so far as is 
known by the company, is not directly or indirectly owned or controlled 
by another corporation or by any government. Diageo knows of no 
arrangements, the operation of which may at a subsequent date result 
in a change of control of the company.

As at the close of business on 26 July 2023, 324,354,320 ordinary 
shares, including those held through American Depositary Shares 
(ADSs), were held by approximately 2,678 holders (including American 
Depositary Receipt (ADR) holders) with registered addresses in the 
United States, representing approximately 14.43% of the outstanding 
ordinary shares (excluding treasury shares). At such date, 81,014,846 
ADSs were held by 2,224 registered ADR holders. Since certain of such 
ordinary shares and ADSs are held by nominees or former Grand 
Metropolitan PLC or Guinness plc ADR holders who have not re-
registered their ADSs, the number of holders may not be representative 
of the number of beneficial owners in the United States or the ordinary 
shares held by them. 

Employment policies 
A key strategic imperative of the company is to attract, retain and grow 
a pool of diverse, talented employees. Diageo recognises that a 
diversity of skills and experiences in its workplace and communities will 
provide a competitive advantage. To enable this, the company has 
various global employment policies and standards, covering such 
issues as resourcing, data protection, human rights, dignity at work, 
health, safety and wellbeing. These policies and standards seek to 
ensure that the company treats current or prospective employees justly, 
solely according to their abilities to meet the requirements and 
standards of their role and in a fair and consistent way. This includes 
giving full and fair consideration to applications from prospective 
employees who are disabled, having regard to their aptitudes and 
abilities, and not discriminating against employees under any 
circumstances (including in relation to applications, training, career 
development and promotion) on the grounds of any disability. In the 
event that an employee, worker or contractor becomes disabled in the 
course of their employment or engagement, Diageo aims to ensure 
that reasonable steps are taken to accommodate their disability by 
making reasonable adjustments to their existing employment or

Diageo plc ordinary shares are listed on the London Stock Exchange 
(LSE). Diageo ADSs, representing four Diageo ordinary shares each, 
are listed on the New York Stock Exchange (NYSE). Diageo plc 
completed the voluntary delisting of its shares from the Dublin Euronext 
and Paris Euronext Exchanges by 30 May 2023. The principal trading 
market for the ordinary shares is the LSE. Diageo shares are traded on 
the LSE’s electronic order book. Orders placed on the order book are 
displayed on-screen through a central electronic system and trades are 
automatically executed, in price and then time priority, when orders 
match with corresponding buy or sell orders. Only member firms of the 
LSE, or the LSE itself if requested by the member firm, can enter or 
delete orders on behalf of clients or on their own account. All orders 
are anonymous. Although use of the order book is not mandatory, all 
trades, whether or not executed through the order book and regardless 
of size, must be reported within three minutes of execution, but may be 
eligible for deferred publication.

The Markets in Financial Instruments Directive (MiFID) allows for 
delayed publication of large trades with a sliding scale requirement 
based on qualifying minimum thresholds for the amount of 
consideration to be paid/the proportion of average daily turnover 
(ADT) of a stock represented by a trade. Provided that a trade/
consideration equals or exceeds the qualifying minimum size, it will be 
eligible for deferred publication ranging from 60 minutes from time of 
trade to three trading days after time of trade. Fluctuations in the 
exchange rate between sterling and the US dollar will affect the US 
dollar equivalent of the sterling price of the ordinary shares on the LSE 
and, as a result, will affect the market price of the ADSs on the NYSE. In 
addition, such fluctuations will affect the US dollar amounts received by 
holders of ADSs on conversion of cash dividends paid in pounds 
sterling on the underlying ordinary shares.

American depositary shares
Fees and charges payable by ADR holders
Citibank N.A. serves as the depositary (Depositary) for Diageo’s ADS 
programme. Pursuant to the deposit agreement dated 14 February 
2013 between Diageo, the Depositary and owners and holders of ADSs 
(the Deposit Agreement), ADR holders may be required to pay various 
fees to the Depositary, and the Depositary may refuse to provide any 
service for which a fee is assessed until the applicable fee has been 
paid. In particular, the Depositary, under the terms of the Deposit 
Agreement, shall charge a fee of up to $5.00 per 100 ADSs (or fraction 
thereof) relating to the issuance of ADSs; delivery of deposited 
securities against surrender of ADSs; distribution of cash dividends or

other cash distributions (i.e. sale of rights and other entitlements); 
distribution of ADSs pursuant to stock dividends or other free stock 
distributions, or exercise of rights to purchase additional ADSs; 
distribution of securities other than ADSs or rights to purchase 
additional ADSs (i.e. spin-off shares); and depositary services. Citibank 
N.A. is located at 388 Greenwich Street, New York, New York, 10013, 
United States. In addition, ADR holders may be required under the 
Deposit Agreement to pay the Depositary (a) taxes (including 
applicable interest and penalties) and other governmental charges; 
(b) registration fees; (c) certain cable, telex, and facsimile transmission 
and delivery expenses; (d) the expenses and charges incurred by the 
Depositary in the conversion of foreign currency; (e) such fees and 
expenses as are incurred by the Depositary in connection with 
compliance with exchange control regulations and other regulatory 
requirements; and (f) the fees and expenses incurred by the Depositary, 
the custodian, or any nominee in connection with the servicing or 
delivery of ADSs. The Depositary may (a) withhold dividends or other 
distributions or sell any or all of the shares underlying the ADSs in order 
to satisfy any tax or governmental charge and (b) deduct from any 
cash distribution the applicable fees and charges of, and expenses 
incurred by, the Depositary and any taxes, duties or other 
governmental charges on account.

Direct and indirect payments by the Depositary
The Depositary reimburses Diageo for certain expenses it incurs in 
connection with the ADR programme, subject to a ceiling set out in the 
Deposit Agreement pursuant to which the Depositary provides services 
to Diageo. The Depositary has also agreed to waive certain standard 
fees associated with the administration of the programme. Under the 
contractual arrangements with the Depositary, Diageo has received 
approximately $2.6 million arising out of fees charged in respect of 
dividends paid during the year and a fixed contribution to the 
company’s ADR programme costs. These payments are received for 
expenses associated with non-deal road shows, third-party investor 
relations consultant fees and expenses, Diageo’s cost for administration 
of the ADR programme not absorbed by the Depositary and related 
activities (e.g. expenses associated with the AGM), travel expenses to 
attend training and seminars, exchange listing fees, legal fees, auditing 
fees and expenses, the SEC filing fees, expenses related to Diageo’s 
compliance with US securities law and regulations (including, without 
limitation, the Sarbanes-Oxley Act) and other expenses incurred by 
Diageo in relation to the ADR programme.

Articles of association
The company is incorporated under the name Diageo plc, and is 
registered in England and Wales under registered number 23307. The 
following description summarises certain provisions of Diageo’s articles 
of association (as adopted by special resolution at the Annual General 
Meeting on 28 September 2020) and applicable English law 
concerning companies (the Companies Acts), in each case as at 26 
July 2023. This summary is qualified in its entirety by reference to the 
Companies Acts and Diageo’s articles of association. Investors can 
obtain copies of Diageo’s articles of association by contacting the 
Company Secretary at the.cosec@diageo.com. Any amendment to the 
articles of association of the company may be made in accordance 
with the provisions of the Companies Act 2006, by way of special 
resolution.

Directors
Diageo’s articles of association provide for a board of directors, 
consisting (unless otherwise determined by an ordinary resolution of 
shareholders) of not fewer than three directors and not more than 25 
directors, in which all powers to manage the business and affairs of 
Diageo are vested. Directors may be elected by the members in a 
general meeting or appointed by the Board. At each annual general 
meeting, all the directors shall retire from office and may offer 
themselves for re-election by members. There is no age limit 

Diageo  Annual Report 2023

A shareholder is not entitled to vote at any general meeting or class 
meeting in respect of any share held by them if they have been served 
with a restriction notice (as defined in Diageo’s articles of association) 
after failure to provide Diageo with information concerning interests in 
those shares required to be provided under the Companies Acts. 

Pre-emption rights and new issues of shares
While holders of ordinary shares have no pre-emptive rights under 
Diageo’s articles of association, the ability of the Directors to cause 
Diageo to issue shares, securities convertible into shares or rights to 
shares, otherwise than pursuant to an employee share scheme, is 
restricted. Under the Companies Acts, the directors of a company are, 
with certain exceptions, unable to allot any equity securities without 
express authorisation, which may be contained in a company’s articles 
of association or given by its shareholders in a general meeting, but 
which in either event cannot last for more than five years. Under the 
Companies Acts, Diageo may also not allot shares for cash (otherwise 
than pursuant to an employee share scheme) without first making an 
offer to existing shareholders to allot such shares to them on the same 
or more favourable terms in proportion to their respective 
shareholdings, unless this requirement is waived by a special resolution 
of the shareholders.

Repurchase of shares
Subject to authorisation by special resolution, Diageo may purchase its 
own shares in accordance with the Companies Acts. Any shares which 
have been bought back may be held as treasury shares or, if not so 
held, must be cancelled immediately upon completion of the purchase, 
thereby reducing the amount of Diageo’s issued share capital. 

Restrictions on transfers of shares
The Board may decline to register a transfer of a certificated Diageo 
share unless the instrument of transfer (a) is duly stamped or certified or 
otherwise shown to the satisfaction of the Board to be exempt from 
stamp duty, and is accompanied by the relevant share certificate and 
such other evidence of the right to transfer as the Board may 
reasonably require, (b) is in respect of only one class of share and (c) if 
to joint transferees, is in favour of not more than four such transferees. 
Registration of a transfer of an uncertificated share may be refused in 
the circumstances set out in the uncertificated securities rules (as 
defined in Diageo’s articles of association) and where, in the case of a 
transfer to joint holders, the number of joint holders to whom the 
uncertificated share is to be transferred exceeds four.

The Board may decline to register a transfer of any of Diageo’s 
certificated shares by a person with a 0.25% interest (as defined in 
Diageo’s articles of association) if such a person has been served with 
a restriction notice (as defined in Diageo’s articles of association) after 
failure to provide Diageo with information concerning interests in those 
shares required to be provided under the Companies Acts, unless the 
transfer is shown to the Board to be pursuant to an arm’s-length sale 
(as defined in Diageo’s articles of association).

DIRECTORS' REPORT  contin ued

requirement in respect of directors. Directors may also be removed 
before the expiration of their term of office in accordance with the 
provisions of the Companies Acts.

Voting rights
Voting on any resolution at any general meeting of the company is by 
a show of hands unless a poll is duly demanded. On a show of hands, 

(a) every shareholder who is present in person at a general meeting, 
and every proxy appointed by any one shareholder and present at a 
general meeting, has/have one vote regardless of the number of 
shares held by the shareholder (or, subject to (b), represented by the 
proxy), and 

(b) every proxy present at a general meeting who has been appointed 
by more than one shareholder has one vote regardless of the number 
of shareholders who have appointed him/her or the number of shares 
held by those shareholders, unless he/she has been instructed to vote 
for a resolution by one or more shareholders and to vote against the 
resolution by one or more shareholders, in which case he/she has one 
vote for and one vote against the resolution.

On a poll, every shareholder who is present in person or by proxy has 
one vote for every share held by that shareholder, but a shareholder or 
proxy entitled to more than one vote need not cast all his/her votes or 
cast them all in the same way (the deadline for exercising voting rights 
by proxy is set out in the form of proxy).

A poll may be demanded by any of the following:

• the chairman of the general meeting;
• at least three shareholders entitled to vote on the relevant resolution 

and present in person or by proxy at the meeting;

• any shareholder or shareholders present in person or by proxy and 
representing in the aggregate not less than one-tenth of the total 
voting rights of all shareholders entitled to vote on the relevant 
resolution; or

• any shareholder or shareholders present in person or by proxy and 
holding shares conferring a right to vote on the relevant resolution 
on which there have been paid up sums in the aggregate equal to 
not less than one-tenth of the total sum paid up on all the shares 
conferring that right.

Diageo’s articles of association and the Companies Acts provide for 
matters to be transacted at general meetings of Diageo by the 
proposing and passing of two kinds of resolutions:

• ordinary resolutions, which include resolutions for the election, re-

election and removal of directors, the declaration of final dividends, 
the appointment and re-appointment of the external auditor, the 
remuneration report and remuneration policy, the increase of 
authorised share capital and the grant of authority to allot shares; 
and 

• special resolutions, which include resolutions for the amendment of 

Diageo’s articles of association, resolutions relating to the 
disapplication of pre-emption rights, and resolutions modifying the 
rights of any class of Diageo’s shares at a meeting of the holders of 
such class. 

An ordinary resolution requires the affirmative vote of a simple majority 
of the votes cast by those entitled to vote at a meeting at which there is 
a quorum in order to be passed. Special resolutions require the 
affirmative vote of not less than three-quarters of the votes cast by 
those entitled to vote at a meeting at which there is a quorum in order 
to be passed. The necessary quorum for a meeting of Diageo is a 
minimum of two shareholders present in person or by proxy and 
entitled to vote.

INDEPEND ENT AU DITORS' REPORT TO THE MEMBERS OF DIAGEO PLC

Independent auditors' report to the members of Diageo plc 
1. Our unmodified opinion
In our opinion:

• Diageo plc’s (“Diageo”) group financial statements and company financial statements (the “financial statements”) give a true and fair view of the 
state of the group’s and of the company’s affairs as at 30 June 2023 and of the group’s profit and the group’s cash flows for the year then ended;

• the group financial statements have been properly prepared in accordance with UK-adopted international accounting standards as applied in 

accordance with the provisions of the Companies Act 2006;

• the group financial statements have been properly prepared in accordance with International Financial Reporting Standards (“IFRS”) as issued 

by the International Accounting Standards Board;

• the company financial statements have been properly prepared in accordance with United Kingdom Generally Accepted Accounting Practice 

(United Kingdom Accounting Standards, comprising FRS 101 “Reduced Disclosure Framework”, and applicable law); and

• the financial statements have been prepared in accordance with the requirements of the Companies Act 2006.

Our opinion is consistent with our reporting to the Audit Committee.

What we audited
We have audited the financial statements, included within the Annual Report 2023 (the “Annual Report”), which comprise: the consolidated and 
company balance sheets as at 30 June 2023; the consolidated income statement and consolidated statement of comprehensive income, the 
consolidated statement of cash flows, and the consolidated and company statements of changes in equity for the year then ended; and the notes to 
the financial statements, which include a description of the significant accounting policies.

Basis for our opinion
We conducted our audit in accordance with International Standards on Auditing (UK) (“ISAs (UK)”) and applicable law. Our responsibilities under 
ISAs (UK) are further described in ”The scope of an audit and our responsibility” section of this report. We believe that the audit evidence we have 
obtained is sufficient and appropriate to provide a basis for our opinion.

Our independence
We remained independent of Diageo in accordance with the ethical requirements that are relevant to our audit of the financial statements in the UK, 
which includes the Financial Reporting Council’s (“FRC”) Ethical Standard, as applicable to listed public interest entities, and we have fulfilled our 
other ethical responsibilities in accordance with these requirements.

To the best of our knowledge and belief, we declare that non-audit services prohibited by the FRC’s Ethical Standard were not provided.
Other than those disclosed in note 3(b) to the group financial statements, we have provided no non-audit services to Diageo or its controlled 

undertakings in the period under audit.

PwC was initially appointed by you on 15 October 2015 and has acted for eight uninterrupted years. This is the third and final year that Richard 

Oldfield has acted as your Senior Statutory Auditor, with other changes in senior audit team members reflecting required partner rotation in 
Australia, Scotland, and over the group’s Treasury, Tax and technology functions.

Our independence, including the nature and size of non-audit services provided, was reviewed during the year by the Audit Committee.

2. Our audit
The scope of an audit and our responsibility
An audit has an important role in providing confidence in the financial statements that are provided by companies to their members. The scope of 
an audit is sometimes not fully understood. We believe that it is important that you understand the scope and the concept of materiality in order to 
understand the assurance that this opinion provides. A description of the scope of an audit is provided on the FRC’s website at www.frc.org.uk/
auditorsresponsibilities; we recommend that you read this description carefully. It is also important that you understand the inherent limitations of the 
audit, for example:

• the risk of not detecting a material misstatement due to fraud is higher than the risk of not detecting one resulting from error, as fraud may 

involve deliberate concealment by, for example, forgery or intentional misrepresentations, or through collusion; and

• our audit testing includes, in a limited number of cases, testing of complete populations of certain transactions and balances, predominantly 

using data auditing techniques, e.g. the testing of manual journals and the deactivation of leaver accounts on key applications. However, in most 
cases it involves selecting a limited number of items for testing. In some situations, we target particular items for testing based on their size or risk 
characteristics. In other cases, we will use audit sampling to enable us to draw a conclusion about the population from which the sample is 
selected. An approach based upon sampling may not identify all issues.

Our objectives are to obtain reasonable assurance that the financial statements as a whole are free from material misstatement, whether due to 
fraud or error, and to issue a report to you that includes our opinion. This opinion is not over any particular number or disclosure. Reasonable 
assurance is a high level of assurance, but is not a guarantee that an audit conducted in accordance with ISAs (UK) will always detect a material 
misstatement when it exists. Misstatements are considered material if, individually or in the aggregate, they could reasonably be expected to 
influence the economic decisions you take on the basis of these financial statements.

Irregularities,  including  fraud,  are  instances  of  non-compliance  with  laws  and  regulations.  We  designed  procedures  in  line  with  our 
responsibilities,  capable  of  detecting  material  misstatements  caused  by  such  irregularities,  albeit  these  are  subject  to  the  inherent  limitations 
discussed above. We focused on any known and potential instances of non-compliance with laws and regulations that could give rise to a material 
misstatement in the financial statements, including, but not limited to, the Companies Act 2006, the Listing Rules, international tax legislation and 
anti-bribery legislation. Examples of the procedures which we performed included:

• gaining an understanding of the legal and regulatory framework applicable to Diageo and the alcoholic beverage industry, and considering the 

risk of acts by Diageo which are contrary to applicable laws and regulations, including fraud;

• performing inquiries of senior management, including but not limited to members of the Group Executive and regional and market chief financial 

officers, to identify areas of possible breaches of laws and regulations;

• reviewing correspondence with regulators, including the FRC, Securities and Exchange Commission and the tax authorities in Diageo’s key 

markets;

• assessing matters reported through the group’s whistleblowing programme and the results of management’s investigation in so far as they 

related to the financial statements;

• challenging assumptions and judgements made by management in its significant accounting estimates, in particular in relation to key audit 

matters;

• agreeing the financial statement disclosures to underlying supporting documentation; and
• inspecting correspondence with legal advisors and internal audit reports in so far as they related to the financial statements.

We also evaluated management’s incentives and opportunities for fraudulent manipulation of the financial statements, including the risk of 
management override of internal controls. We determined that the principal risks were related to posting inappropriate journal entries to, for 
example, suppress expenses such as trade spend to improve financial performance, and management bias in accounting estimates. We did not 
identify any key audit matters specific to irregularities, including fraud.

How we structured the audit scope
Partners and staff from 12 countries across the PwC network have spent more than 85,000 hours supporting this report, which in addition to the 
opinion provides amongst other things, information on how we approached the audit and how it changed from the previous year.

We tailored the scope of our audit to ensure that we performed enough work to be able to give an opinion on the financial statements as a 

whole, taking into account the structure of the group and the company, the accounting processes and controls, and the alcoholic beverage industry. 
There were three important aspects of our work; in which they operate.

1)  Audit work performed on individual business units
We received opinions from nine PwC member firms which had been appointed as the auditors of twenty-two group business units, either in relation 
to all of the financial information or specific accounts and balances. This included eighteen operating business units and four treasury business units. 
We also obtained reporting from a non-PwC member firm over the financial information of Moët Hennessy, the group’s principal associate.

In September 2022, we hosted in London an in-person meeting for senior staff from PwC member firms involved in the audit. At this meeting we 

considered developments specific to Diageo, key audit matters and changes to the audit necessitated by the macro-economic instability 
experienced during the financial year. We heard from key members of management and the Chair of the Audit Committee.

We issued formal, written instructions to each business unit audit team setting out the work to be performed by each of them. We were in active 
dialogue throughout the year with the teams responsible for these audits; this included consideration of how they planned and performed their work. 
Senior team members visited the business unit audit teams in Great Britain, Hungary, Ireland, India, Mexico, Turkey and the United States. We also 
visited the audit team in China to further our understanding of the group’s businesses. These gave us an opportunity to discuss the audit with local 
teams, but also to meet directly with management to hear about the market and Diageo opportunities and challenges. Senior team members also 
attended via video conference the final audit meetings for certain business units, including Great Britain, Turkey, and the United States. During these 
meetings, the findings reported by each of the audit teams were discussed. We evaluated the sufficiency of the audit evidence obtained through 
discussions with each team and a review of the audit working papers.

2)  Audit work performed at shared service centres
A significant number of operational processes which are critical to financial reporting are undertaken in the GBO captive shared business service 
centres in Colombia, Hungary, India and the Philippines. PwC teams in these locations tested controls and transactions which supported the 
financial information for many of the twenty-one business units in scope, to ensure that adequate audit evidence was obtained.

3)  Audit procedures undertaken at a group level and on the company
We ensured that appropriate further audit work was undertaken at a group level and for the company. This work included auditing, for example, 
the consolidation of the group’s results, the preparation of the financial statements, certain disclosures within the Directors’ Remuneration Report, 
litigation provisions and exposures and management’s entity level and oversight controls relevant to financial reporting. We also performed work 
centrally for the audit of technology and IT general controls, goodwill and intangible assets, taxation, and one-off transactions, including acquisitions 
and disposals, undertaken during the year. This work was supported by team members who are based in Budapest and Bangalore. 

Collectively, these three areas of work covered 73% of group net sales, 82% of group total assets, and 71% of group profit before exceptional

items and tax (PBET (as defined in note 4)).

In planning our audit, we continued to embrace technology and innovation in the audit process to drive quality and efficiency. We continued to 
expand the deployment of technology solutions on our audit and for the first time relied on data auditing of revenue for Diageo Great Britain, testing 
the full population by tracing sales orders through to delivery note, invoice and ultimately the general ledger and cash. We also used artificial 
intelligence in the testing of some cash balances, and continued using our technology tools to enhance our scoping and risk assessment, with more 
targeted testing and real time reporting by our global team.

Changes to the audit in 2023
The audit approach remained broadly unchanged.

We considered the changing relative contribution of individual business units in determining which ones should be included within the audit 

scope, with the only change being the removal of the group’s business in Kenya. 

As required by auditing standards, our team undertook procedures which were deliberately unexpected and could not have reasonably been 
predicted by Diageo’s management. As an example, performing procedures over balances and transactions which otherwise wouldn’t have been 
subject to audit procedures due to their size such as the group’s acquisition of Balcones Distilling and rotating the inventory count locations and 
approach year on year. The results of these procedures were consistent with our expectations.

In executing our audit, we were particularly mindful of the changing economic and political conditions. Whilst the group delivered continued 
growth during the year benefiting from price increases and productivity savings, this growth has not been consistent across all business units or

management, and to understand the scenarios considered. 

By their nature financial statements present historical information which does not fully capture future events. We did determine that the key areas 
in the financial statements that are more likely to be materially impacted by climate change are those areas that are based on estimated future cash 
flows. As a result, we considered in particular how climate risks and the impact of the ‘Society 2030: Spirit of Progress‘ commitments would impact 
the assumptions made in the forecasts prepared by Diageo used in the group’s impairment analysis (see also key audit matter on Valuation of 
goodwill and brand intangibles) and for going concern purposes. We challenged how longer term physical chronic risks had been considered such 
as water scarcity from water stress together with the impacts of chronic weather on agricultural supply chains, and shorter-term transitional risks such 
as the introduction of carbon taxes. Our procedures did not identify any material impact on our audit for the year ended 30 June 2023. We ensured 
that the assumptions used in preparation of the financial statements are consistent with the Task Force on Climate-related Financial Disclosures 
(“TCFD”) disclosure.

The accuracy of Diageo’s progress against its ‘Society 2030: Spirit of Progress‘ metrics set out on pages 57 - 87 is not included within the scope of 

this audit. We were engaged separately to provide independent limited assurance to the Directors over some of these metrics marked with the 
symbol ∆. The independent limited assurance report, which explains the scope of our work and the limited procedures undertaken is included in the 
Annual Report 2023 on page 263. Limited assurance varies significantly and is substantially less in scope than that of our financial audit, which 
provides reasonable assurance.

3. Our conclusions relating to going concern
Based on the work we have performed, which included understanding and evaluating the group’s financial forecasts and the stress testing of 
liquidity, assessing and testing risk factors that could impact the going concern basis of accounting such as the impacts of an inflationary 
environment and testing the amounts of debt maturing during the assessment period, we have not identified any material uncertainties relating to 
events or conditions that, individually or collectively, may cast significant doubt on the group's and the company’s ability to continue as a going 
concern for a period of at least twelve months from when the financial statements are authorised for issue.

In auditing the financial statements, we have concluded that the directors’ use of the going concern basis of accounting in the preparation of the 

financial statements is appropriate.

However, because not all future events or conditions can be predicted, this conclusion is not a guarantee as to the group's and the company's 

ability to continue as a going concern.

In relation to the directors’ reporting on how they have applied the UK Corporate Governance Code (“the Code”), we have nothing material to 

add or draw attention to in relation to the directors’ statement in the financial statements about whether the directors considered it appropriate to 
adopt the going concern basis of accounting.

Our responsibilities and the responsibilities of the directors with respect to going concern are described in the relevant sections of this report.

4. Reporting on other information
The other information comprises all of the information in the Annual Report other than the financial statements and our auditors’ report thereon. The 
directors are responsible for the other information, which includes reporting based on the TCFD recommendations. Our opinion on the financial 
statements does not cover the other information and, accordingly, we do not express an audit opinion or, except to the extent otherwise explicitly 
stated in this report, any form of assurance thereon.

In connection with our audit of the financial statements, our responsibility is to read the other information and, in doing so, consider whether the 

other information is materially inconsistent with the financial statements or our knowledge obtained in the audit, or otherwise appears to be 
materially misstated. If we identify an apparent material inconsistency or material misstatement, we are required to perform procedures to conclude 
whether there is a material misstatement of the financial statements or a material misstatement of the other information. If, based on the work we 
have performed, we conclude that there is a material misstatement of this other information, we are required to report that fact. We have nothing to 
report based on these responsibilities.

With respect to the Strategic report and Directors' report, we also considered whether the disclosures required by the UK Companies Act 2006 

have been included.

Based on our work undertaken in the course of the audit, the Companies Act 2006 requires us also to report certain opinions and matters as 

described below.

Strategic report and Directors’ report
In our opinion, based on the work undertaken in the course of the audit, the information given in the Strategic report and Directors' report for the 
year ended 30 June 2023 is consistent with the financial statements and has been prepared in accordance with applicable legal requirements.

In light of the knowledge and understanding of the group and company and their environment obtained in the course of the audit, we did not 

identify any material misstatements in the Strategic report and Directors' report.

Directors’ Remuneration
In our opinion, the part of the Directors’ Remuneration Report to be audited has been properly prepared in accordance with the Companies Act 
2006.

Corporate governance statement
The Listing Rules require us to review the directors’ statements in relation to going concern, longer-term viability and that part of the corporate 
governance statement relating to the company’s compliance with the provisions of the UK Corporate Governance Code specified for our review. 
Our additional responsibilities with respect to the corporate governance statement as other information are described in the Reporting on other 
information section of this report.

Based on the work undertaken as part of our audit, we have concluded that each of the following elements of the corporate governance 

statement is materially consistent with the financial statements and our knowledge obtained during the audit, and we have nothing material to add 
or draw attention to in relation to:

• The directors’ confirmation that they have carried out a robust assessment of the emerging and principal risks;
• The disclosures in the Annual Report that describe those principal risks, what procedures are in place to identify emerging risks and an 

explanation of how these are being managed or mitigated;

INDEPEND ENT AU DITORS' REPORT TO THE MEMBERS OF DIAGEO PLC  continued

• The directors’ statement in the financial statements about whether they considered it appropriate to adopt the going concern basis of accounting 
in preparing them, and their identification of any material uncertainties to the group’s and company’s ability to continue to do so over a period of 
at least twelve months from the date of approval of the financial statements;

• The directors’ explanation as to their assessment of the group's and company’s prospects, the period this assessment covers and why the period 

is appropriate; and

• The directors’ statement as to whether they have a reasonable expectation that the company will be able to continue in operation and meet its 
liabilities as they fall due over the period of its assessment, including any related disclosures drawing attention to any necessary qualifications or 
assumptions.

Our review of the directors’ statement regarding the longer-term viability of the group and company was substantially less in scope than an audit 
and only consisted of making inquiries and considering the directors’ process supporting their statement; checking that the statement is in alignment 
with the relevant provisions of the UK Corporate Governance Code; and considering whether the statement is consistent with the financial 
statements and our knowledge and understanding of the group and company and their environment obtained in the course of the audit.

In addition, based on the work undertaken as part of our audit, we have concluded that each of the following elements of the corporate 

governance statement is materially consistent with the financial statements and our knowledge obtained during the audit:

• The directors’ statement that they consider the Annual Report, taken as a whole, is fair, balanced and understandable, and provides the 

information necessary for the members to assess the group’s and company's position, performance, business model and strategy;
• The section of the Annual Report that describes the review of effectiveness of risk management and internal control systems; and
• The section of the Annual Report describing the work of the Audit Committee.

We have nothing to report in respect of our responsibility to report when the directors’ statement relating to the company’s compliance with the 

Code does not properly disclose a departure from a relevant provision of the Code specified under the Listing Rules for review by the auditors.

5. Exception reporting required by the Companies Act 2006
Under the Companies Act 2006 we are required to report to you if, in our opinion:

• we have not obtained all the information and explanations we require for our audit; or
• adequate accounting records have not been kept by the company, or returns adequate for our audit have not been received from branches not 

visited by us; or

• certain disclosures of directors’ remuneration specified by law are not made; or
• the company financial statements and the part of the Directors’ Remuneration Report to be audited are not in agreement with the accounting 

records and returns.

We have no exceptions to report arising from this responsibility.

6. Responsibilities of the directors for the financial statements
As explained more fully in the Directors' responsibilities in respect of the Annual Report, Form 20-F and financial statements set out on page 116, the 
directors are responsible for the preparation of the financial statements in accordance with the applicable framework and for being satisfied that 
they give a true and fair view. The directors are also responsible for such internal control as they determine is necessary to enable the preparation of 
financial statements that are free from material misstatement, whether due to fraud or error.

In preparing the financial statements, the directors are responsible for assessing the group’s and the company’s ability to continue as a going 
concern, disclosing, as applicable, matters related to going concern and using the going concern basis of accounting unless the directors either 
intend to liquidate the group or the company or to cease operations, or have no realistic alternative but to do so.

The directors are also responsible for the other information referenced above.

7. Use of this report
This report, including the opinions, has been prepared for and only for the company’s members as a body in accordance with Chapter 3 of Part 16 
of the Companies Act 2006 and for no other purpose. We do not, in giving these opinions, accept or assume responsibility for any other purpose or 
to any other person to whom this report is shown or into whose hands it may come save where expressly agreed by our prior consent in writing.

Appendix: Key audit matters
Key audit matters are those matters that, in our professional judgement, were of most significance in the audit of the financial statements and 
include the most significant assessed risks of potential material misstatement (whether or not due to fraud) identified by us. They include those which 
had the greatest effect on; the overall audit strategy; the allocation of resources in the audit; and directing the efforts of the audit team. These 
matters, and any comments we make on the results of our procedures, were addressed in the context of our audit of the financial statements as a 
whole, and in forming our opinion thereon, and we do not provide a separate opinion on these matters.

This is not a complete list of all risks identified by our audit.

Goodwill and brand assets have been recognised as a result of acquisitions, in the current and prior years. Diageo is required to perform testing of 
the recoverable amounts of these assets at least annually because they are deemed to have an indefinite life and are therefore not amortised. 
Testing was primarily performed by Diageo over goodwill on a number of cash generating units (CGUs) and brands in May and impairment 
triggers considered up to the balance sheet date. The testing, with supporting sensitivity analyses, calculated the value in use (VIU) and fair value 
less cost of disposal and compared this amount to the carrying value. VIU was predominantly used, unless management believed that fair value 
less cost of disposal would result in a higher recoverable amount for any CGU or brand. 
Certain CGUs and brands were identified as being sensitive to reasonable changes in significant assumptions and are required to be disclosed in 
the Annual Report. 

The methodology in the models is dependent on various assumptions, both short term and long term in nature. These assumptions, which are 
subject to estimation uncertainty, are derived from a combination of management’s judgement, experts engaged by management and market 
data. The significant assumptions that we focused our audit on were those with greater levels of management judgement and for which variations 
had the most significant impact on the recoverable amounts. Specifically, these included Diageo’s strategic plans for fiscal years 2024 to 2026 
including long-term growth rates, discount rates, and forecasts for volume, revenue and operating profit growth.
The discussion with the Audit Committee
We discussed with the Audit Committee the methodologies and significant assumptions used to determine the recoverable values of the goodwill 
in India and Turkey, the Yeni Raki brand, and the portfolio of USL (India) brands. 
These discussions covered:
• the macroeconomic environment; 
• the consistency of assumptions of the impact of climate change with the impacts discussed in the unaudited disclosures on pages 71-87  in 

response to the recommendations of the Task Force for Climate related Financial Disclosures;

• reasonably possible alternatives for significant assumptions for example, the appropriateness of discount rates relative to our independently 

calculated ranges; and

• the disclosures made in relation to goodwill and brand intangibles, including the use of sensitivity analysis to explain estimation uncertainty and 

the conditions that would result in an impairment being recognised.

How our audit addressed the Key Audit Matter
We validated the appropriateness of the CGUs selected. 

We evaluated the design and operation of controls in place over the methodologies and calculation of fair value less cost of disposal and VIU 

for each CGU and selection of the significant assumptions used.

We agreed the mathematical accuracy of the calculations, to estimate the VIU.
In respect of the significant assumptions, our testing included the following: 

• challenging the achievability of management’s strategic plan and the prospects for Diageo’s businesses for the specific CGUs and brands. We 
paid particular attention to achievement of the strategic plan and margin improvements through productivity initiatives in light of historical 
ability to achieve these and the current elevated inflationary environment;

• obtaining and evaluating evidence where available for critical data relating to significant assumptions of forecasted growth, from a 

combination of historic experience, external market (e.g. IWSR, the leading source of data and analysis on the global beverage alcohol 
market) and other financial information; 

• assessing whether the cash flows included in the model were in accordance with the accounting standard IAS 36 “Impairment of Assets”; 
• independently assessing the sensitivity of the VIU to reasonable variations in significant assumptions, both individually and in aggregate; and 
• determining a reasonable range for the discount rate used within the model, with the assistance of PwC valuation experts, and comparing it to 

the discount rate used by management.

We evaluated and tested the disclosures made in the Annual Report in relation to goodwill and indefinite-lived intangibles, and considered them to 
be reasonable.

The group operates across a large number of jurisdictions and in the normal course of business is subject to periodic challenges by tax authorities 
on a range of matters, including transfer pricing, direct and indirect taxes, and transaction related matters. In common with all alcohol beverage 
companies, taxation is particularly challenging because of specific alcohol duties and the international distribution of certain brands.

Diageo makes judgements in assessing the likelihood of potentially material exposures, develops estimates to determine provisions where 
required, and considers whether contingent liability disclosures should be made. Of particular significance are direct and indirect tax assessments 
in developing markets and assessments relating to financing and transfer pricing arrangements. The impact of a more aggressive tax stance by 
tax authorities to deal with government financing requirements following the Covid pandemic, and, in certain instances, changes in local tax 
regulations together with ongoing inspections by local tax and customs authorities and international bodies could materially impact the amounts 
recorded in the group financial statements.
The discussion with the Audit Committee
We discussed with the Audit Committee the judgements taken by management in assessing the risk of a potentially material exposure, and the 
significant assumptions used by management in determining the level of direct and indirect tax provisioning. Our discussions specifically covered 
matters in Brazil and India. We also discussed the disclosures, including those made in note 7 and note 19 to the Annual Report.
How our audit addressed the Key Audit Matter
We evaluated the design and implementation of controls to identify uncertain tax positions related to direct and indirect taxes, and the related 
accounting policy for providing for and disclosing tax exposures. 

PwC tax specialists gained an understanding of the current status of tax assessments and investigations and monitored developments in 

ongoing disputes. We read recent rulings and correspondence with tax authorities, as well as external advice provided by the group’s tax experts 
and legal advisors to satisfy ourselves that the tax provisions had been appropriately recorded or adjusted to reflect the latest developments. 

Where the basis for the conclusion reached was less clear, we challenged the advice from legal advisors and tax experts on how their view was 

reached. We also challenged management’s key assumptions. 

We agreed the mathematical accuracy of the provision calculation.
We evaluated and tested the related disclosures in relation to uncertain tax positions and considered them to be reasonable.

The most significant post-employment schemes are within the United Kingdom, Ireland and the United States; all of which are in a net surplus 
position as at 30 June 2023.

Within the UK and Ireland pension schemes, the group invests in pension investment vehicles (PIVs) which are increasingly complex to value 

and in the current environment are experiencing a significant amount of volatility. 

The valuation of pension plan liabilities is dependent on a number of actuarial assumptions. Management uses external actuaries to assist in 
determining these assumptions, and to determine the valuation of the defined benefit obligation. The experts use valuation methodologies that 
require a number of market-based inputs and other financial and demographic assumptions, including salary increases, mortality rates, discount 
rates, inflation levels and the impact of any changes in individual pension plans. The significant assumptions that we focused our audit on were 
those with greater levels of management judgement, and for which variations had the most significant impact on the liabilities. 

Specifically, these included the discount rates, inflation rates and mortality rates.

The discussion with the Audit Committee
We discussed with the Audit Committee the methodologies and significant assumptions used by management to determine the value of the 
defined benefit assets and liabilities for the significant plans. We have performed our procedures over the following:

• the valuation of pension investment vehicles by sending confirmation requests to investment managers and custodians and reperforming the 

asset valuation calculations; and

• the methodology used by management’s experts to update key assumptions used in calculating the defined benefit obligations, including 

changes to discount rates reflecting inflationary pressure in the year and updates to mortality assumptions for the UK and Irish schemes in line 
with the Continuous Mortality Investigation (“CMI”) model published at the year end.

How our audit addressed the Key Audit Matter
We evaluated the design and implementation of controls in place over both the pension investments and defined benefit pension obligations. 
We also evaluated the objectivity and competence of Diageo’s experts involved in the valuation of the defined benefit obligations.

We have confirmed the year end valuation of pension assets, including investments in pension investment vehicles, with both investment 
managers and custodians, and reperformed the year end valuation calculations of these assets. In addition, we have reviewed the latest service 
organisation reports for the investment managers in order to determine the effectiveness of controls they operate related to investment valuation.

Our actuarial experts assessed the appropriateness of the methodology used to estimate the liabilities, and to review the calculations prepared 

by Diageo’s actuarial experts. They also understood the judgments made by Diageo and their actuarial experts in determining the significant 
assumptions, and compared these assumptions to our independently compiled expected ranges based on market observable indices, relevant 
national and industry benchmarks, and our market experience, for the significant plans.

Based on our procedures, we considered management’s significant assumptions to be within reasonable ranges. We evaluated and tested the 

related disclosures in relation to the defined benefit obligation, and considered them to be reasonable.

(1)   For the years ended 30 June 2022 and 30 June 2021, the previously reported line item of 'Acquisition of businesses' has been replaced with 'Acquisition of subsidiaries' and 'Investments in 

associates and joint ventures' to show separately the amounts which had previously been shown combined.

The accompanying notes are an integral part of these consolidated financial statements. 

Accounting information and policies 
Introduction 
This section describes the basis of preparation of the consolidated financial statements and the group’s accounting policies that are applicable to 
the financial statements as a whole. Accounting policies, critical accounting estimates and judgements specific to a note are included in the note to 
which they relate. Furthermore, the section details new accounting standards, amendments and interpretations, that the group has adopted in the 
current financial year or will adopt in subsequent years. 
1. Accounting information and policies 
(a) Basis of preparation 
The consolidated financial statements are prepared in accordance with 
international accounting standards in conformity with the requirements 
of the Companies Act 2006 and International Financial Reporting 
Standards (IFRSs) adopted by the UK (UK-adopted International 
Accounting Standards) and IFRSs, as issued by the IASB, including 
interpretations issued by the IFRS Interpretations Committee. IFRS as 
adopted by the UK differs in certain respects from IFRS as issued by the 
IASB. The differences have no impact on the group’s consolidated 
financial statements for the years presented. The consolidated financial 
statements are prepared on a going concern basis under the historical 
cost convention, unless stated otherwise in the relevant accounting 
policy. 

The income statements and cash flows of non-sterling entities are 
translated into sterling at weighted average rates of exchange, except 
for subsidiaries in hyperinflationary economies that are translated with 
the closing rate at the end of the year and for substantial transactions 
that are translated at the rate on the date of the transaction. Exchange 
differences arising on the retranslation to closing rates are taken to the 
exchange reserve. 

functional currency). The consolidated financial statements are 
presented in sterling, which is the functional currency of the parent 
company, Diageo plc. The functional currency of Diageo plc is 
determined by using management judgement that considers the parent 
company as an extension of its subsidiaries. 

The preparation of financial statements in conformity with IFRS 
requires management to make estimates and assumptions that affect 
the reported amounts of assets and liabilities, the disclosure of 
contingent assets and liabilities at the date of the financial statements, 
and the reported amounts of revenues and expenses during the year. 
Actual results could differ from those estimates.  
(b) Going concern
Management prepared cash flow forecasts which were also sensitised 
to reflect severe but plausible downside scenarios taking into 
consideration the group's principal risks. In the base case scenario, 
management included assumptions for mid-single digit net sales 
growth, operating margin improvement and global TBA market share 
growth. In light of the ongoing geopolitical volatility, the base case 
outlook and severe but plausible downside scenarios incorporated 
considerations for a prolonged global recession, supply chain 
disruptions, higher inflation and further geopolitical deterioration. Even 
under these scenarios, the group’s liquidity is still expected to remain 
strong, as it was protected by issuing €500 million of fixed rate euro 
and $2 billion of fixed rate dollar-denominated bonds in the year ended 
30 June 2023. Mitigating actions, should they be required, are all within 
management’s control and could include reductions in discretionary 
spending such as acquisitions and capital expenditure, as well as a 
temporary suspension of the share buyback programme and dividend 
payments in the next 12 months, or drawdowns on committed facilities. 
Having considered the outcome of these assessments, the Directors are 
comfortable that the company is a going concern for at least 12 months 
from the date of signing the group's consolidated financial statements.
(c) Consolidation 
The consolidated financial statements include the results of the 
company and its subsidiaries together with the group’s attributable 
share of the results of associates and joint ventures. A subsidiary is an 
entity controlled by Diageo plc. The group controls an investee when it is 
exposed, or has rights, to variable returns from its involvement with the 
investee and has the ability to affect those returns through its power 
over the investee. Where the group has the ability to exercise joint 
control over an entity but has rights to specified assets and obligations 
for liabilities of that entity, the entity is included on the basis of the 
group’s rights over those assets and liabilities. 
(d) Foreign currencies 
Items included in the financial statements of the group’s subsidiaries, 
associates and joint ventures are measured using the currency of the 
primary economic environment in which each entity operates (its 

Assets and liabilities are translated at closing rates. Exchange 
differences arising on the retranslation at closing rates of the opening 
balance sheets of overseas entities are taken to the exchange reserve, 
as are exchange differences arising on foreign currency borrowings and 
financial instruments designated as net investment hedges, to the extent 
that they are effective. Tax charges and credits arising on such items are 
also taken to the exchange reserve. Gains and losses accumulated in 
the exchange reserve are recycled to the income statement when the 
foreign operation is sold. Other exchange differences are taken to the 
income statement. Transactions in foreign currencies are recorded at 
the rate of exchange at the date of the transaction.  

The principal foreign exchange rates used in the translation of 

financial statements for the three years ended 30 June 2023, expressed 
in US dollars and euros per £1, were as follows:

(e) Critical accounting estimates and judgements  
Details of critical estimates and judgements which the Directors consider 
could have a significant impact on the financial statements are set out 
in the related notes as follows: 

• Exceptional items – management judgement whether exceptional or 

not – page 179

• Taxation – management judgement whether a provision is required 
and management estimate of amount of corporate tax payable or 
receivable, the recoverability of deferred tax assets and expectation 
on manner of recovery of deferred taxes – pages 183 and 216

• Brands, goodwill, other intangibles and contingent considerations – 
management judgement whether the assets and liabilities are to be 
recognised and synergies resulting from an acquisition. 
Management judgement and estimate are required in determining 
future cash flows and appropriate applicable assumptions to support 
the intangible asset and contingent consideration value – pages 184 
and 206

(f) Hyperinflationary accounting
The group applied hyperinflationary accounting for its operations in 
Turkey, Venezuela and Lebanon. Turkey has been a hyperinflationary 
economy where cumulative inflation for the three years ended 30 June 
2022 exceeded 100%. Consequently, since March 2022, the group 
applies hyperinflationary accounting for its Turkish operations. The 
group’s consolidated financial statements for the years ended 30 June 
2023 and 30 June 2022 include the results and financial position of its 
Turkish operations restated to the measuring unit current at the end of 
each period, with hyperinflationary gains and losses in respect of 
monetary items being reported in finance income and charges. 
Comparative amounts presented in the consolidated financial 
statements were not restated. Hyperinflationary accounting needs to be 
applied as if Turkey has always been a hyperinflationary economy, 
hence, as per Diageo’s accounting policy choice, the differences 
between equity at 30 June 2021 as reported and the equity after the 
restatement of the non-monetary items to the measuring unit current at 
30 June 2021 were recognised in retained earnings. Such restatement 
includes impairment of TRL 2,133 million (£177 million) recognised on the 
goodwill in the Turkey cash-generating unit and TRL 1,627 million (£135 
million) in respect of the Yenì Raki brand, as a result of the increased 
carrying values for those due to hyperinflation adjustments. When 
applying IAS 29 on an ongoing basis, comparatives in stable currency 
are not restated and the effect of inflating opening net assets to the 
measuring unit current at the end of the reporting period is presented in 
other comprehensive income. The inflation rate used by the group is the 
official rate published by the Turkish Statistical Institute. The movement 
in the publicly available official price index for the year ended 30 June 
2023 was 38% (2022 – 79%).

Venezuela is a hyperinflationary economy where the government 

maintains a regime of strict currency controls with multiple foreign 
currency rate systems. The exchange rate used to translate the results of 
the group’s Venezuelan operations was VES/£ 3,807 for the year ended 
30 June 2023 (2022 – VES/£ 759). This rate reflects management’s 
estimate of the exchange rate considering inflation and the most 
appropriate official exchange rate. Movement in the price index for the 
year ended 30 June 2023 was 382% (2022 – 268%). The inflation rate 
used by the group is provided by an independent valuer because no 
reliable, officially published rate is available for Venezuela. 

The following table presents the contribution of the group’s 
Venezuelan operations to consolidated net sales, operating profit, 
operating cash flow and assets for the years ended 30 June 2023 and 
30 June 2022 and with the amounts that would have resulted if the 
official reference exchange rate had been applied:

both in the current and comparative periods. 
(g) New accounting standards and interpretations 
The following amendments to the accounting standards, issued by the 
IASB and endorsed by the UK, were adopted by the group from 1 July 
2022 with no impact on the group’s consolidated results, financial 
position or disclosures: 

• Amendments to IFRS 3 Updating a Reference to the Conceptual 

Framework

• Amendments to IAS 16 Property, Plant and Equipment: Proceeds 

before Intended Use

• Amendments to IAS 37 Onerous Contracts - Cost of Fulfilling a 

Contract

• Amendments to Annual improvements 2018-2020 - IFRS 9 - Fees in 
the '10 per cent' Test, IFRS 16 - Lease incentives, IAS 41 - Taxation in 
Fair Value Measurements

• Amendments to IAS 12 International Tax Reform – Pillar Two Model 

Rules

The following standard and amendments issued by the IASB have been 
endorsed by the UK and have not been adopted by the group: 

• IFRS 17 – Insurance contracts (effective from the year ending 30 June 

2024) is ultimately intended to replace IFRS 4. Based on a 
preliminary assessment, the group believes that the adoption of IFRS 
17 will not have a significant impact on its consolidated results or 
financial position. 

• Amendments to IAS 12 - Income taxes (effective from the year ending 
30 June 2024) requires an entity to recognise deferred tax on initial 
recognition of particular transactions to the extent that the 
transaction gives rise to equal amounts of deferred tax assets and 
liabilities. The proposed amendments would apply to transactions 
such as leases and decommissioning obligations for which an entity 
recognises both an asset and a liability. The group believes that the 
adoption of these amendments will not have a significant impact on 
its consolidated results and financial position. 

There are a number of other amendments and clarifications to IFRSs, 
effective in future years, which are not expected to significantly impact 
the group’s consolidated results or financial position. 
(h) Climate change considerations
The impact of climate change assessment and the net zero carbon 
emission target for Diageo's direct operations (Scope 1 & 2) for 2030 
have been considered as part of the assessment of estimates and 
judgements in preparing the group's consolidated financial statements.

The climate change scenario analyses performed in 2023 – 

conducted in line with TCFD recommendations (‘Transition 
Scenario’ (RCP 2.6), a ‘Moderate Warming’ Scenario (RCP 4.5) and a 
‘Severe Warming Scenario’ (RCP 8.5)) – identified no material financial 
impact to these financial statements.

The following considerations were made in respect of the financial 

statements:

• The impact of climate change on factors (like residual values, useful 
lives and depreciation methods) that determine the carrying value of 
non-current assets.

• The impact of climate change on forecasts of cash flows used 

(including forecast depreciation in line with capital expenditure plans 
for Diageo's net zero carbon emission commitment) in impairment 
assessments for the value-in-use of non-current assets including 
goodwill (see note 9).

• The impact of climate change on post-employment assets.

Results for the year

Introduction
This section explains the results and performance of the group for the three years ended 30 June 2023. Disclosures are provided for segmental 
information, operating costs, exceptional items, finance income and charges, the group's share of results of associates and joint ventures, taxation. 
For associates, joint ventures and taxation, balance sheet disclosures are also provided in this section.

2. Segmental information 

Accounting policies
Sales comprise revenue from contracts with customers from the sale of goods, royalties and rents receivable. Revenue from the sale of goods 
includes excise and other duties which the group pays as principal but excludes duties and taxes collected on behalf of third parties, such as 
value added tax. Sales are recognised as or when performance obligations are satisfied by transferring control of a good or service to the 
customer, which is determined by considering, among other factors, the delivery terms agreed with customers. For the sale of goods, the 
transfer of control occurs when the significant risks and rewards of ownership are passed to the customer. Based on the shipping terms 
agreed with customers, the transfer of control of goods occurs at the time of dispatch for the majority of sales. Where the transfer of control is 
subsequent to the dispatch of goods, the time between dispatch and receipt by the customer is generally less than five days. The group 
includes in sales the net consideration to which it expects to be entitled. Sales are recognised to the extent that it is highly probable that a 
significant reversal will not occur. Therefore, sales are stated net of expected price discounts, allowances for customer loyalty and certain 
promotional activities and similar items. Generally, payment of the transaction price is due within credit terms that are consistent with industry 
practices, with no element of financing.
Net sales are sales less excise duties. Diageo incurs excise duties throughout the world. In the majority of countries, excise duties are 
effectively a production tax which becomes payable when the product is removed from bonded premises and is not directly related to the 
value of sales. It is generally not included as a separate item on external invoices; increases in excise duty are not always passed on to the 
customer and where a customer fails to pay for products received the group cannot reclaim the excise duty. The group therefore recognises 
excise duty, unless it regards itself as an agent of the regulatory authorities, as a cost to the group.
Advertising costs, point of sale materials and sponsorship payments are charged to marketing in operating profit when the company has a 
right of access to the goods or services acquired.

Diageo is an international manufacturer and distributor of premium drinks. Diageo also owns a number of investments in associates and joint 
ventures, as set out in note 6. 

The segmental information presented is consistent with management reporting provided to the Executive Committee (the chief operating 

decision-maker). 

The Executive Committee considers the business principally from a geographical perspective based on the location of third-party sales and the 

business analysis is presented by geographical segment. In addition to these geographical selling segments, a further segment reviewed by the 
Executive Committee is the Supply Chain and Procurement (SC&P) segment, which manufactures products for other group companies and includes 
the production sites in the United Kingdom, Ireland, Italy, Guatemala and Mexico, as well as comprises the global procurement function.

The group's operations also include the Corporate segment. Corporate costs are in respect of central costs, including finance, marketing, 
corporate relations, human resources and legal, as well as certain information systems, facilities and employee costs that are not allocable to the 
geographical segments or to the SC&P. 

Diageo uses shared services operations to deliver transaction processing activities for markets and operational entities. These centres are located 

in India, Hungary, Colombia and the Philippines. These captive business service centres also perform certain central finance activities, including 
elements of financial planning and reporting, treasury and HR services. The costs of shared services operations are recharged to the regions.    

For planning and management reporting purposes, Diageo uses budgeted exchange rates that are set at the prior year's weighted average 
exchange rate. In order to ensure a consistent basis on which performance is measured through the year, prior period results are also restated to the 
budgeted exchange rate. Segmental information for net sales and operating profit before exceptional items are reported on a consistent basis with 
management reporting. The adjustments required to retranslate the segmental information to actual exchange rates and to reconcile it to the 
group’s reported results are shown in the tables below. The comparative segmental information, prior to retranslation, has not been restated at the 
current year’s budgeted exchange rates but is presented at the budgeted rates for the respective year. 

In addition, for management reporting purposes, Diageo presents the result of acquisitions and disposals completed in the current and prior year 

separately from the results of the geographical segments. The impact of acquisitions and disposals on net sales and operating profit is disclosed 
under the appropriate geographical segments in the tables below at budgeted exchange rates.

Accounting policies 

Critical accounting judgements 

Exceptional items are those that in management’s judgement 
need to be disclosed separately. Such items are included within 
the income statement caption to which they relate. Management 
believes that separate disclosure of exceptional items and the 
classification between operating and non-operating further helps 
investors to understand the performance of the group.

Changes in estimates and reversals in relation to items 
previously recognised as exceptional are presented consistently 
as exceptional in the current year.

Operating items 
Exceptional operating items are those that are considered to be 
material and unusual or non-recurring in nature and are part of 
the operating activities of the group, such as one-off global 
restructuring programmes which can be multi-year, impairment 
of intangible assets and fixed assets, indirect tax settlements, 
property disposals and changes in post employment plans. 

Non-operating items 
Gains and losses on the sale or directly attributable to a 
prospective sale of businesses, brands or distribution rights, step 
up gains and losses that arise when an investment becomes an 
associate or an associate becomes a subsidiary and other 
material, unusual non-recurring items, that are not in respect of 
the production, marketing and distribution of premium drinks, 
are disclosed as exceptional non-operating items below 
operating profit in the income statement. 

Taxation items 
Exceptional current and deferred tax items comprise material 
and unusual or non-recurring items that impact taxation. 
Examples include direct tax provisions and settlements in respect 
of prior years and the remeasurement of deferred tax assets and 
liabilities following tax rate changes.

(4) In the year ended 30 June 2023, Diageo released unutilised 
provisions of £20 million from the £50 million exceptional charge taken 
in the year ended 30 June 2022, in respect of winding down its 
operations in Russia.

(5) Other exceptional operating items include subsequent gains and 
charges of items that were originally recognised as exceptional at 
inception. In the year ended 30 June 2022, other exceptional operating 
items resulted in a loss of £2 million driven by the reinvestment of 
'Raising the Bar' corporate tax benefits. In the year ended 30 June 2021, 
other exceptional operating items were a loss of £15 million mainly 
driven by the charge of the ongoing litigation in Turkey.

(6) On 26 May 2023, Diageo announced the completion of the sale of 
its wholly owned subsidiary in Cameroon, Guinness Cameroun S.A., to 
the Castel Group for an aggregate consideration of £384 million 
resulting in an exceptional gain of £310 million, including cumulative 
translation gain in the amount of £17 million recycled to the income 
statement. 

(7) On 26 October 2022, Diageo completed the sale of its Archers 
brand. The transaction resulted in an exceptional gain of £20 million.

(8) On 30 September 2022, Diageo announced the completion of the 
sale of the Popular brands of its United Spirits Limited (USL) business. 
The transaction resulted in an exceptional gain of £4 million.

(9) Certain subsidiaries of USL were sold in the year ended 30 June 
2023. The sale of these subsidiaries resulted in an exceptional gain of 
£1 million (2022 – nil; 2021 – £3 million).

(10) In the year ended 30 June 2023, Diageo sold its Tyku brand. The 
transaction resulted in an exceptional loss of £3 million.

(108)   

(374)   

(85) 

(11) In May 2022, Diageo sold its Picon brand. The sale resulted in an 
exceptional non-operating gain of £91 million, net of disposal costs.

(1) In the year ended 30 June 2023, an impairment charge of 
£498 million was recognised in exceptional operating items mainly 
driven by the McDowell's brand in India.
In the year ended 30 June 2022, an impairment charge of £336 million 
was recognised in exceptional operating items in respect of the 
McDowell's brand (£240 million), the Bell's brand (£77 million) and 
goodwill related to Smirnov (£19 million). 
For further information, see note 9 (d).

(2) In the year ended 30 June 2023, an exceptional charge of £100 
million was accounted for in respect of the supply chain agility 
programme announced in July 2022. With this five-year spanning 
programme, Diageo expects to strengthen its supply chain, improve its 
resilience and agility, drive efficiencies, deliver additional productivity 
savings and make its supply operations more sustainable. Total 
implementation cost of the programme is expected to be up to £500 
million over the five-year period, which will comprise non-cash items 
and one-off expenses, the majority of which are expected to be 
recognised as exceptional operating items. The exceptional charge for 
the year ended 30 June 2023 was primarily in respect of accelerated 
depreciation, being additional depreciation of assets in the period 
directly attributable to the programme, and impairment of property, 
plant and equipment in respect of North America and India. 
Restructuring cash expenditure was £12 million in the year ended 30 
June 2023.

(3) In the year ended 30 June 2023, Diageo agreed with one of its 
distributors in Africa to terminate the distribution license of one of its 
spirits brands, in respect of which a provision of £44 million was 
provided for and was recognised as an operating exceptional charge. 
No payment was made in the period.

Diageo  Annual Report 2023

(12) In the year ended 30 June 2022, a loss of £95 million was 
recognised as a non-operating item attributable to the sale of Meta Abo 
Brewery Share Company in Ethiopia.

(13) On 25 March 2022, Diageo agreed to the sale of its Windsor 
business in Korea. At 30 June 2022, assets and liabilities attributable to 
Windsor business were classified as held for sale and were measured at 
the lower of their cost and fair value less cost of disposal. In the year 
ended 30 June 2022, a loss of £19 million was recognised as a non-
operating item, mainly in relation to transaction and other costs directly 
attributable to the prospective sale of the business. The conditional 
agreement was terminated in the year ended 30 June 2023 as the 
buyer was unable to meet certain conditions to completion.

(14) On 29 September 2022, the group acquired the part of the entire 
issued share capital of Mr Black Spirits Pty Ltd, owner of Mr Black, the 
Australian premium cold brew coffee liqueur, that it did not already 
own. As a result of Mr Black becoming a subsidiary of the group in the 
year ended 30 June 2023, a loss of £8 million arose, being the 
difference between the book value of the associate prior to the 
transaction and its fair value plus transaction costs. 

(15) Other exceptional non-operating items include subsequent gains 
and charges of items that were originally recognised as exceptional at 
inception. In the year ended 30 June 2023, other exceptional non-
operating items resulted in a net gain of £4 million (2022 – £6 million; 
2021 – £11 million), mainly driven by the deferred consideration received 
in respect of the sale of United National Breweries.

For further information on acquisition and sale of businesses and 
brands, see notes 8 (a) and 8 (b).

Cash payments and receipts included in net cash inflow from operating 
activities in respect of exceptional items were as follows:

5. Finance income and charges 

Accounting policies
Net interest includes interest income and charges in respect of 
financial instruments and the results of hedging transactions 
used to manage interest rate risk.  

Finance charges directly attributable to the acquisition, 
construction or production of a qualifying asset, being an asset 
that necessarily takes a substantial period of time to get ready 
for its intended use or sale, are added to the cost of that asset. 
Borrowing costs which are not capitalised are recognised in the 
income statement using the effective interest method. All other 
finance charges are recognised primarily in the income 
statement in the year in which they are incurred.  

Net other finance charges include items in respect of post 
employment plans, the discount unwind of long-term obligations 
and hyperinflation charges. The results of operations in 
hyperinflationary economies are adjusted to reflect the changes 
in the purchasing power of the local currency of the entity before 
being translated to sterling.  

The impact of derivatives, excluding cash flow hedges that 
are in respect of commodity price risk management or those that 
are used to hedge the currency risk of highly probable future 
currency cash flows, is included in interest income or interest 
charge.

6. Investments in associates and joint ventures 

Accounting policies
An associate is an undertaking in which the group has a long-term 
equity interest and over which it has the power to exercise significant 
influence. A joint venture is a joint arrangement whereby the parties 
that have joint control of the arrangement have rights to the net 
assets of the arrangement. The group’s interest in the net assets of 
associates and joint ventures is reported in investments in the 
consolidated balance sheet and its interest in their results (net of tax) 
is included in the consolidated income statement below the group’s 
operating profit. Associates and joint ventures are initially recorded at 
cost including transaction costs. Investments in associates and joint 
ventures are reviewed for impairment whenever events or 
circumstances indicate that the carrying amount may not be 
recoverable. The impairment review compares the net carrying value 
with the recoverable amount, where the recoverable amount is the 
higher of the value in use calculated as the present value of the 
group’s share of the associate’s future cash flows and its fair value 
less costs of disposal. 

Diageo’s principal associate is Moët Hennessy of which Diageo owns 
34%. Moët Hennessy is the wines and spirits division of LVMH Moët 
Hennessy Louis Vuitton SA (LVMH). LVMH is based in France and is 
listed on the Paris Stock Exchange. Moët Hennessy is also based in 
France and is a producer and exporter of champagne and cognac 
brands. 

A number of joint distribution arrangements have been established 
with LVMH in Asia Pacific and France, principally covering distribution of 
Diageo’s Scotch whisky and gin premium brands and Moët Hennessy’s 
champagne and cognac premium brands. Diageo and LVMH have 
each undertaken not to engage in any champagne or cognac activities 
competing with those of Moët Hennessy. The arrangements also contain 
certain provisions for the protection of Diageo as a non-controlling 
shareholder in Moët Hennessy.

£1,384 million (2022 – £1,340 million), plus the group’s share of post 
acquisition reserves of £2,445 million (2022 – £2,312 million). 

(e) The associates and joint ventures have not reported any material 
contingent liabilities in their latest financial statements. 

7. Taxation 

Accounting policies
Current tax is based on taxable profit for the year. Taxable profit is different from accounting profit due to temporary differences between 
accounting and tax treatments, and due to items that are never taxable or tax deductible. Tax treatments are not recognised unless it is 
probable that a tax authority will accept the treatment. Once considered to be probable, tax treatments are reviewed each year to assess 
whether a provision should be taken against full recognition of the treatment on the basis of potential settlement through negotiation and/or 
litigation with the relevant tax authorities. Tax provisions are included in current liabilities. Penalties and interest on tax liabilities are included 
in operating profit and finance charges, respectively.

Full provision for deferred tax is made for temporary differences between the carrying value of assets and liabilities for financial reporting 
purposes and their value for tax purposes, except for deferred tax provision arising on goodwill from business combinations. The amount of 
deferred tax reflects the expected recoverable amount and is based on the expected manner of recovery or settlement of the carrying 
amount of assets and liabilities, using the basis of taxation enacted or substantively enacted by the balance sheet date. Deferred tax assets 
are not recognised where it is more likely than not that the assets will not be realised in the future. No deferred tax liability is provided in 
respect of any future remittance of earnings of foreign subsidiaries where the group is able to control the remittance of earnings and it is 
probable that such earnings will not be remitted in the foreseeable future, or where no liability would arise on the remittance.
Critical accounting estimates and judgements 
The group is required to estimate the corporate tax in each of the jurisdictions in which it operates. Management is required to estimate the 
amount that should be recognised as a tax liability or tax asset in many countries which are subject to tax audits which by their nature are 
often complex and can take several years to resolve; current tax balances are based on such estimations. Tax provisions are based on 
management’s judgement and interpretation of country specific tax law and the likelihood of settlement. However, the actual tax liabilities 
could differ from the provision and in such event the group would be required to make an adjustment in a subsequent period which could 
have a material impact on the group’s profit for the year.

The evaluation of deferred tax asset recoverability requires estimates to be made regarding the availability of future taxable income. For 

brands with an indefinite life, management’s intention is to recover the book value through a potential sale in the future, and therefore the 
deferred tax on the brand value is generally recognised using the appropriate country capital gains tax rate. To the extent brands with an 
indefinite life have been impaired, management considers this to be an indication of recovery through use and in such a case deferred tax 
on the brand value is recognised using the appropriate country corporate income tax rate.

the exceptional tax credit of £55 million consists of tax impact on the impairment of the McDowell's and Bell's brands for £35 million and £20 million, respectively. 
In the year ended 30 June 2023, an exceptional tax credit of £57 million was recognised in respect of the deductibility of fees paid to Diageo plc for guaranteeing externally issued debt 
of US group entities. Following engagement with the tax authorities, guarantee fees for the periods ended 30 June 2012 to 30 June 2022 are fully deductible.
In the year ended 30 June 2023, the exceptional net tax charge of £29 million mainly comprised of a tax charge of £42 million in respect of the sale of Guinness Cameroun S.A., partly 
offset by a tax credit of £10 million in respect of the sale of certain USL businesses. In the year ended 30 June 2022, a £23 million exceptional tax charge was recognised in respect of the 
gain on the sale of the Picon brand.

(4)   On 24 May 2021, legislation was substantively enacted in the UK to increase the corporate tax rate to 25% with effect from 1 April 2023. As a result of the change, an exceptional tax 

charge of £46 million was recognised for the year ended 30 June 2021 in relation to the remeasurement of deferred tax assets and liabilities. In addition, there was a one-off charge of 
£48 million to other comprehensive income and equity, mainly in respect of the remeasurement of the deferred tax liabilities on the post employment assets.

(5)  On 15 December 2020, legislation was substantively enacted in the Netherlands to maintain the headline corporate tax rate at 25%, reversing a previously enacted reduction in the 

corporate tax rate to 21.7% from 2021. As a result of the change, an exceptional tax charge of £42 million was recognised for the year ended 30 June 2021 in relation to the 
remeasurement of deferred tax liabilities. In the year ended 30 June 2022, the Dutch Senate enacted an increased tax rate of 25.8%. The remeasurement of deferred tax liabilities was 
recognised as an underlying tax charge.

(1)  Movement in provision in respect of uncertain tax positions includes both current and prior year uncertain tax position movements.
(2)  Changes in tax rates for the year ended 30 June 2021 are mainly due to the tax rate change in the Netherlands and the United Kingdom. 
(3)  Excludes prior year movement in provisions. Also included an exceptional tax credit of £57 million in respect of the deductibility of fees paid to Diageo plc for guaranteeing externally 

issued debt of its US group entities.

The table above reconciles the notional taxation charge calculated at the UK tax rate, to the actual total tax charge. As a group operating in 
multiple countries, the actual tax rates applicable to profits in those countries are different from the UK tax rate. The impact is shown in the table 
above as differences in overseas tax rates. The group’s worldwide business leads to the consideration of a number of important factors which may 
affect future tax charges, such as the levels and mix of profitability in different jurisdictions, transfer pricing regulations, tax rates imposed and tax 
regime reforms, acquisitions, disposals, restructuring activities, and settlements or agreements with tax authorities.

Significant ongoing changes in the international tax environment and an increase in global tax audit activity means that tax uncertainties and 
associated risks have been gradually increasing. In the medium term, these risks could result in an increase in tax liabilities or adjustments to the 
carrying value of deferred tax assets and liabilities. See note 19 (f).

The group has a number of ongoing tax audits worldwide for which provisions are recognised in line with the relevant accounting standard, 
taking into account best estimates and management’s judgements concerning the ultimate outcome of the tax audits. For the year ended 30 June 
2023, ongoing audits that are provided for individually are not expected to result in a material tax liability. The current tax asset of £232 million (30 
June 2022 – £149 million) and tax liability of £135 million (30 June 2022 – £252 million) include £173 million (30 June 2022 – £156 million) of 
provisions for tax uncertainties.

The cash tax paid in the year ended 30 June 2023 amounts to £1,201 million (30 June 2022 – £949 million) and is £231 million higher than the 
current tax charge (30 June 2022 – £100 million lower). This arises as a result of timing differences between the accrual of income taxes, the 
movement in the provision for uncertain tax positions and the actual payment of cash.  

In December 2021, the OECD released a framework for Pillar Two Model Rules which will introduce a global minimum corporate tax rate of 15% 

applicable to multinational enterprise groups with global revenue over €750 million. The legislation implementing the rules in the UK was 
substantively enacted on 20 June 2023 and will apply to Diageo from the financial year ending 30 June 2025 onwards. Diageo is reviewing this 
legislation and also monitoring the status of implementation of the model rules outside of the UK to understand the potential impact on the group. 
Diageo has applied the temporary exception under IAS 12 in relation to the accounting for deferred taxes arising from the implementation of the 
Pillar Two rules.

(1)  Deferred tax on other temporary differences includes hyperinflation, fair value movement on cross-currency swaps, interest and finance costs, share-based payments and intra-group 

sales of products. 

After offsetting deferred tax assets and liabilities that relate to taxes 
levied by the same taxation authority on the same taxable fiscal unit, 
the net deferred tax liability comprises:

Deferred tax assets of £141 million include £65 million (2022 – £47 
million) arising in jurisdictions with prior year taxable losses, primarily in 
Germany and Brazil. It is considered more likely than not that there will 
be sufficient future taxable profits to realise these deferred tax assets, 
which for the most part arose on losses from a historic one-off 
transaction, and on existing provisions. The majority of deferred tax 
assets can be carried forward indefinitely. From the total recognised tax 
losses of £49 million, it is expected that £10 million will be utilised in the 
year ending 30 June 2024.

(e) Unrecognised deferred tax assets 
The following table shows the tax value of tax losses which has not been 
recognised due to uncertainty over their utilisation in future periods. The 
gross value of those losses is £632 million (2022 – £674 million).

Additionally, no deferred tax asset has been recognised in respect of 
certain temporary differences arising from brand valuations, as the 
group is not planning to sell those brands thus the benefit from the 
temporary differences is unlikely to be realised.

(f) Unrecognised deferred tax liabilities 
Relevant legislation largely exempts overseas dividends remitted from 
tax. A tax liability is more likely to arise in respect of withholding taxes 
levied by the overseas jurisdiction. Deferred tax is provided where there 
is an intention to distribute earnings, and a tax liability arises. It is 
impractical to estimate the amount of unrecognised deferred tax 
liabilities in respect of these unremitted earnings. 

The aggregate amount of temporary differences in respect of 
investments in subsidiaries, branches, interests in associates and joint 
ventures for which deferred tax liabilities have not been recognised is 
approximately £19.8 billion (2022 – £21.0 billion).

Operating assets and liabilities

Introduction 
This section describes the assets used in the group’s operations and the liabilities incurred. Liabilities relating to the group’s financing activities are 
included in section ‘Risk management and capital structure’ and balance sheet information in respect of associates, joint ventures and taxation are 
covered in section ‘Results for the year’. This section also provides detailed disclosures on the group’s recent acquisitions and disposals, performance 
and financial position of its defined benefit post employment plans. 

8. Acquisition and sale of businesses and brands and purchase of non-controlling interests 

Accounting policies
The consolidated financial statements include the results of the company and its subsidiaries together with the group’s attributable share of 
the results of associates and joint ventures. The results of subsidiaries acquired or sold are included in the income statement from, or up to, 
the date that control passes. 

Business combinations are accounted for using the acquisition method. Identifiable assets, liabilities and contingent liabilities acquired are 
measured at fair value at acquisition date. The consideration payable is measured at fair value and includes the fair value of any contingent 
consideration. Among other factors, the group considers the nature of, and compensation for the selling shareholders' continuing 
employment to determine if any contingent payments are for post-combination employee services, which are excluded from consideration. 

On the acquisition of a business, or of an interest in an associate or joint venture, fair values, reflecting conditions at the date of 

acquisition, are attributed to the net assets, including identifiable intangible assets and contingent liabilities acquired. Directly attributable 
acquisition costs in respect of subsidiary companies acquired are recognised in other external charges as incurred. 

The non-controlling interests on the date of acquisition can be measured either at the fair value or at the non-controlling shareholder’s 

proportion of the net fair value of the identifiable assets assumed. This choice is made separately for each acquisition. 

Where the group has issued a put option over shares held by a non-controlling interest, the group derecognises the non-controlling 

interests and instead recognises a contingent deferred consideration liability for the estimated amount likely to be paid to the non-controlling 
interest on the exercise of those options. Movements in the estimated liability in respect of put options are recognised in retained earnings. 

Transactions with non-controlling interests are recorded directly in retained earnings. 
For all entities in which the company directly or indirectly owns equity, a judgement is made to determine whether it controls and therefore 

should fully consolidate the investee. An assessment is carried out to determine whether the group has the exposure or rights to the variable 
returns of the investee and has the ability to affect those returns through its power over the investee. To establish control, an analysis is carried 
out of the substantive and protective rights that the group and the other investors hold. This assessment is dependent on the activities and 
purpose of the investee and the rights of the other shareholders, such as which party controls the board, executive committee and material 
policies of the investee. Determining whether the rights that the group holds are substantive, requires management judgement. 

Where less than 50% of the equity of an investee is held, and the group holds significantly more voting rights than any other vote holder 

or organised group of vote holders, this may be an indicator of de facto control. An assessment is needed to determine all the factors 
relevant to the relationship with the investee to ascertain whether control has been established and whether the investee should be 
consolidated as a subsidiary. Where voting power and returns from an investment are split equally between two entities then the 
arrangement is accounted for as a joint venture. 

On an acquisition, fair values are attributed to the assets and liabilities acquired. This may involve material judgement to determine these 

values. 

(a) Acquisition of businesses

Acquisitions in the year
On 10 March 2023, Diageo completed the acquisition of Kanlaon 
Limited and Chat Noir Co. Inc., (the owner of Don Papa Rum) to 
support Diageo’s participation in the super-premium dark rum segment 
for upfront cash consideration of €246 million (£218 million), deferred 
consideration of €4 million (£4 million) and contingent consideration of 
up to €178 million (£158 million) through to 2028 subject to certain 
financial performance targets, reflecting the brand’s expected growth 
potential. The fair value of the contingent consideration of €82 million 
(£72 million) was estimated by calculating the present value of the 
future expected cash flows which is dependent on management’s 
estimates in respect of the forecasting of future cash flows and the 
discount rates applicable to the future cash flows. The goodwill arising 
on the acquisition of Don Papa Rum represents expected revenue 
synergies and the acquired workforce. Don Papa Rum contributed 
£10 million to net sales and £15 million operating loss to the period, out 

of which £15 million is related to acquisition transaction and integration 
costs in the year ended 30 June 2023. The fair value measurement of 
assets and liabilities acquired is in progress. The fair values of assets 
and liabilities acquired are provisional and will be finalised in the year 
ending 30 June 2024. 

Diageo completed further acquisitions in the year ended 30 June 
2023: (i) on 29 September 2022, the acquisition of the remaining issued 
share capital of Mr Black Spirits Pty Ltd, owner of Mr Black, the 
Australian premium cold brew coffee liqueur, that it did not already 
own; and (ii) on 2 November 2022, the acquisition of the entire issued 
share capital of Balcones Distilling, a Texas craft distiller and one of the 
leading producers of American single malt whiskey in the United States. 
The aggregate up-front cash consideration paid on completion of these 
transactions in the year ended 30 June 2023 was £98 million.   

Prior year acquisitions
On 31 March 2022, Diageo acquired 100% equity interest in 21Seeds, to 
support Diageo's participation in the super premium flavoured tequila 
segment, for a total consideration of £62 million upfront in cash and a 
contingent consideration of up to £61 million linked to performance 
targets. 

Diageo completed further acquisitions in the year ended 30 June 
2022, including (i) on 27 January 2022, the acquisition of Casa UM, to 
expand Reserve portfolio with premium artisanal mezcal brand, Mezcal 
Unión and (ii) on 29 June 2022, the acquisition of Vivanda, owner of the 
technology behind 'What's your Whisky' platform and the Journey of 
Flavour experience at Johnnie Walker Princes Street, to support 
Diageo's ambition to provide customised brand experiences across all 
channels. The aggregate upfront cash consideration paid on 
completion of these transactions in the year ended 30 June 2022 was 
£26 million. In addition, these transactions included provision for further 
contingent consideration of up to £18 million in aggregate, linked to 
performance targets and a further deferred consideration of £4 million.

On 30 September 2020, Diageo completed the acquisition of 

Aviation Gin LLC (Aviation Gin) and Davos Brands LLC (Davos Brands) 
to support Diageo's participation in the super-premium gin segment for 
a total consideration of $337 million (£263 million) upfront in cash and 
contingent consideration of up to $275 million (£214 million) linked to 
performance targets.

Diageo also completed a number of additional acquisitions in the year 
ended 30 June 2021, comprising: (i) in February 2021, the acquisition of 
Chase Distillery Limited, to further support Diageo's participation in the 
premium-plus gin segment in the United Kingdom; (ii) in March 2021, 
the acquisition of Far West Spirits LLC, owner of the Lone River Ranch 
Water brand, to improve Diageo's participation in the ready to drink 
category in the United States; and (iii) in April 2021, the acquisition of 
Sons of Liberty Spirits Company, to expand Diageo's spirits-based ready 
to drink portfolio with Loyal 9 Cocktails. The aggregate upfront cash 
consideration paid on completion of these three transactions in the year 
ended 30 June 2021 was £95 million. In addition, two of these 
transactions included provision for further contingent consideration of 
up to £86 million in aggregate, in each case linked to performance 
targets, and one of the transactions provided for a further £2 million of 
deferred consideration, of which £1 million was paid by 30 June 2021. 

Purchase of shares of non-controlling interests 
On 24 March 2023, Diageo completed the purchase of 14.97% of the 
share capital of EABL for an aggregate consideration of KES 22,732 
million (£142 million) in cash and transaction costs of £4 million. This 
took Diageo’s shareholding in EABL from 50.03% to 65%. EABL was 
already controlled and therefore consolidated prior to this transaction.

In the year ended 30 June 2021, EABL, a Diageo subsidiary 
completed the acquisition of 30% of shares in Serengeti Breweries 
Limited for a consideration of $55 million (£42 million) in cash and 
£16 million in the form of shareholder loan from two Diageo subsidiaries 
in 2021, increasing Diageo's effective economic interest from 40.2% to 
47.0%. 

All transactions were recognised in retained earnings. 

(b) Sale of businesses and brands

On 26 May 2023, Diageo completed the sale of Guinness Cameroun S.A., its brewery in Cameroon. The aggregate consideration for the disposal 
was £384 million, the disposed net asset of £63 million mainly included property, plant and equipment and trade and other payables. The 
transaction resulted in a non-operating exceptional gain of £310 million. The disposed Cameroon operations contributed net sales of £101 million 
(2022 – £124 million; 2021 – £113 million), operating profit of £26 million (2022– £27 million; 2021– £22 million) in the year ended 30 June 2023. 

On 30 September 2022, Diageo completed the sale of the Popular brands of its USL business. The aggregate consideration for the disposal was 

£87 million, the disposed net assets included net working capital of £31 million and brands of £22 million, and £16 million goodwill was 
derecognised. The transaction resulted in a non-operating exceptional gain of £4 million. Popular brands contributed net sales of £34 million (2022– 
£139 million; 2021 – £148 million), operating profit of £5 million (2022– £26 million; 2021– £30 million) in the year ended 30 June 2023. 

On 25 April 2022, Diageo sold its Ethiopian subsidiary, Meta Abo Brewery Share Company. A loss of £95 million was recognised as a non-
operating item attributable to the sale, including cumulative translation losses in the amount of £63 million recycled to the income statement.
On 10 May 2022, Diageo completed the sale of the Picon brand for an upfront consideration of €117 million (£100 million). The gain of 

£91 million, net of disposal cost, was recognised as a non-operating item in the income statement.

In the year ended 30 June 2022, ZAR 133 million (£6 million) (2021 – £10 million) of deferred consideration was paid to Diageo in respect of the 
sale of United National Breweries. The disposal was completed on 1 April 2020 for an aggregate consideration of ZAR 600 million (£27 million) from 
which ZAR 378 million (£17 million) was deferred.
Prior year disposals further included the sale of certain USL subsidiaries in the year ended 30 June 2021 for an aggregate consideration of £3 million, 
which resulted in an exceptional gain of £3 million. 

(c) Assets and liabilities held for sale
Assets and liabilities held for sale at 30 June 2022 included Diageo’s Windsor business in Korea and the portfolio of Popular brands of USL. 

In March 2022, Diageo agreed to sell its Windsor business in Korea to Bayside/Metis Private Equity Consortium. On 27 September 2022, Diageo 

announced the termination of the conditional agreement. Consequently, the recoverable assets and liabilities attributable to the business were 
reclassified out of held for sale.

On 27 May 2022, USL reached agreement with Inbrew Beverages Pvt Limited for the sale of Popular brands. On 30 September 2022, Diageo 

announced the completion of the sale of the selected Popular brands, accordingly the assets and liabilities attributable to the business were 
disposed from held for sale.

9. Intangible assets 

Accounting policies
Acquired intangible assets are held on the consolidated balance sheet at cost less accumulated amortisation and impairment losses. 
Acquired brands and other intangible assets are initially recognised at fair value if they are controlled through contractual or other legal 
rights, or are separable from the rest of the business, and the fair value can be reliably measured. Where these assets are regarded as 
having indefinite useful economic lives, they are not amortised.

Goodwill represents the excess of the aggregate of the consideration transferred, the value of any non-controlling interests and the fair 
value of any previously held equity interest in the subsidiary acquired over the fair value of the identifiable net assets. Goodwill arising on 
acquisitions prior to 1 July 1998 was eliminated against reserves, and this goodwill has not been reinstated. Goodwill arising subsequent to 1 
July 1998 has been capitalised.

Amortisation and impairment of intangible assets is based on their useful economic lives and they are amortised on a straight-line basis 

and reviewed for impairment whenever events or circumstances indicate that the carrying amount may not be recoverable. Goodwill and 
intangible assets that are regarded as having indefinite useful economic lives are not amortised and are reviewed for impairment at least 
annually or when there is an indication that the assets may be impaired. Impairment reviews compare the net carrying value with the 
recoverable amount (where recoverable amount is the higher of fair value less costs of disposal and value in use) and in case the net 
carrying value exceeds the recoverable amount an impairment charge is recognised. Amortisation and any impairment write downs are 
charged to other operating expenses in the income statement.

Computer software is amortised on a straight-line basis to estimated residual value over its expected useful life. Residual values and 

useful lives are reviewed each year. Subject to these reviews, the estimated useful lives are up to eight years.   

Critical accounting estimates and judgements
Assessment of the recoverable amount of an intangible asset and the useful economic life of an asset are based on management's estimates.
Impairment reviews are carried out to ensure that intangible assets, including brands, are not carried at above their recoverable amounts. 

Value in use and fair value less costs of disposal are both considered for these reviews and any impairment charge is based on these. The 
tests are dependent on management’s estimates in respect of the forecasting of future cash flows, the discount rates applicable to the future 
cash flows and what expected growth rates are reasonable. Judgement is required in determining the cash-generating units. Such estimates 
and judgements are subject to change as a result of changing economic conditions and actual cash flows may differ from forecasts.
The below additional considerations have been applied by management regarding the potential financial impacts of increasing 

inflationary pressures, recently observable worldwide:
• changes in the interest rate environment are taken into consideration when determining the discount rates;
• terminal growth rates do not exceed the long-term annual inflation rate of the country or region, thus excluding any increased inflation 

growth experienced in the short-term;

• additional sensitivity scenarios are applied for those markets or regions where the inflation and/or the exchange devaluation is 

considered significant based on management’s judgement.

Consideration of climate risk impact
The impact of climate risk on the future cash flows has also been considered for scenarios analysed in line with the climate change risk 
assessment. The climate change scenario analyses performed in 2023 – conducted in line with TCFD recommendations (‘Transition 
Scenario’ (RCP 2.6), a ‘Moderate Warming’ Scenario (RCP 4.5) and a ‘Severe Warming Scenario (RCP 8.5)) – identified no material financial 
impact to the current year impairment assessments.

(a) Brands 
The principal acquired brands, all of which are regarded as having indefinite useful economic lives, are as follows: 

Crown Royal whisky

Captain Morgan rum

Smirnoff vodka

Johnnie Walker whisky

Casamigos tequila

McDowell's No.1 whisky, rum and brandy

Don Papa rum

Yenì raki

Shui Jing Fang Chinese white spirit

Don Julio tequila

Aviation American gin

The brands are protected by trademarks which are renewable indefinitely 
in all of the major markets where they are sold. There are not believed 
to be any legal, regulatory or contractual provisions that limit the useful 
lives of these brands. The nature of the premium drinks industry is that 
obsolescence is not a common issue, with indefinite brand lives being 
commonplace, and Diageo has a number of brands that were originally 
created more than 100 years ago. Accordingly, the Directors believe 
that it is appropriate that the brands are treated as having indefinite 
lives for accounting purposes and are therefore not amortised. 

(b) Goodwill 
For the purposes of impairment testing, goodwill has been attributed to 
the following cash-generating units: 

North America

Europe

Turkey

Asia Pacific

Greater China

India

Latin America and Caribbean – Mexico

Goodwill has arisen on the acquisition of businesses and includes synergies 
arising from cost savings, the opportunity to utilise Diageo’s distribution 
network to leverage marketing of the acquired products and the extension 
of the group’s portfolio of brands in new markets around the world. 

(c) Other intangibles 
Other intangibles principally comprise distribution rights. Diageo owns 
the global distribution rights for Ketel One vodka products in perpetuity, 
and the Directors believe that it is appropriate to treat these rights as 
having an indefinite life for accounting purposes. The carrying value at 
30 June 2023 was £1,428 million (2022 – £1,488 million).

(d) Impairment testing 
Impairment tests are performed annually, or more frequently if events or 
circumstances indicate that the carrying amount may not be 
recoverable. Recoverable amounts are calculated based on the value 
in use approach, also considering fair value less costs of disposal. The 
value in use calculations are based on discounted forecast cash flows 
using the assumption that cash flows continue in perpetuity at the 
terminal growth rate of each country or region. The individual brands, 
other intangibles with indefinite useful lives and the associated property, 
plant and equipment are aggregated as separate cash-generating 
units. Separate tests are carried out for each cash-generating unit and 
for each of the markets. Goodwill is attributed to each of the markets. 
The key assumptions used for the value in use calculations are as 

follows: 

Cash flows  
Cash flows are forecasted for each cash-generating unit for the financial 
years based on management's approved plans and reflect the 
following assumptions:

• Cash flows are projected based on the actual operating results and 
a three-year strategic plan approved by management. Cash flows 
are extrapolated up to five years using expected growth rates in line 
with management’s best estimates. Growth rates reflect expectations 
of sales growth, operating costs and margin, based on past 
experience and external sources of information. A simple average of 
these projections serves as the estimation of the recoverable amount 
of the cash-generating units. Management has no information which 
would indicate that any of the scenarios are more likely than others;    

• The five-year forecast period is extended by up to an additional ten 
years at acquisition date for some intangible assets and goodwill 
when management believes that this period is justified by the 
maturity of the market and expects to achieve growth in excess of 
the terminal growth rate driven by Diageo’s sales, marketing and 
distribution expertise. These cash flows beyond the five-year period 
are projected using steady or progressively declining growth rates.

FINANCIAL STATEMENTS  contin ued

The main exception is India and the USL brands, where the forecast 
period is extended by an additional one year of detailed forecasts;    

• Cash flows for the subsequent years after the forecast period are 
extrapolated based on a terminal growth rate which does not 
exceed the long-term annual inflation rate of the country or region. 

Discount rates 
The discount rates used are the weighted average cost of capital which 
reflect the returns on government bonds and an equity risk premium 
adjusted for the drinks industry specific to the cash-generating units. The 

group applies post-tax discount rates to post-tax cash flows as the 
valuation calculated using this method closely approximates to 
applying pre-tax discount rates to pre-tax cash flows. 

For goodwill, these assumptions are based on the cash-generating 

unit or group of units to which the goodwill is attributed. For brands, 
they are based on a weighted average taking into account the country 
or countries where sales are made. 

The pre-tax discount rates, terminal and long-term growth rates used 

for impairment testing are as follows:

As a result of the impairment review, in the year ended 30 June 2023, an impairment charge of £420 million in respect of the McDowell's brand and 
£24 million in respect of the Director’s Special brand were recognised in exceptional operating items. Value in use and fair value less costs of 
disposal methodologies were both considered to assess the recoverable amount. The value in use that was calculated exceeded the fair value less 
costs of disposal. The charge is mainly driven by the adverse inflationary environment and the reduction in forecast cash flow assumptions in Lower 
Prestige and Popular segments in India. The brand impairment reduced the deferred tax liability by £111 million. The recoverable amount is 
£379 million in respect of the McDowell's brand and £11 million in respect of the Director’s Special brand cash-generating units. 

As a result of the impairment review, in the year ended 30 June 2023, an additional impairment charge of £54 million was recognised in 
exceptional operating items in respect of some brands where book value was not recoverable. The charge is mainly driven by strategic change in 
some categories as a result of the challenging operating environment and premiumisation. Value in use and fair value less costs of disposal 
methodologies were both considered to assess the recoverable amount. The value in use that was calculated exceeded the fair value less costs of 
disposal. The brand impairment reduced the deferred tax liability by £13 million.

In the year ended 30 June 2022, an impairment charge of £240 million in respect of the McDowell's brand was recognised in exceptional 

operating items, based on its value in use. The brand impairment reduced the deferred tax liability by £35 million.

Further, in the year ended 30 June 2022, an impairment charge of £77 million in respect of the Bell’s brand was recognised in exceptional 

operating items, based on its value in use. The impairment reduced the deferred tax liability attributable to the brand by £20 million.

In  the  year  ended  30  June  2022,  Diageo  decided  to  wind  down  its  operations  in  Russia.  As  a  result,  an  impairment  charge  of £19  million  in 

respect of the Smirnov goodwill was recognised in exceptional operating items.

The Turkish economy became hyperinflationary for the year ended 30 June 2022, and an impairment charge of TRY 3,760 million (£312 million) 

on the opening carrying amount of the Turkey cash-generating unit was recognised in retained earnings. From this impairment charge, TRY 1,627 
million (£135 million) was directly attributable to the Yenì Raki brand and the remaining TRY 2,133 million (£177 million) impairment charge was 
recognised on the Turkey goodwill. 
(e) Sensitivity to change in key assumptions 
Impairment testing for the year ended 30 June 2023 has identified the following cash-generating units as being sensitive to reasonably possible 
changes in assumptions.  

The table below shows the headroom at 30 June 2023 and the impairment charge that would be required if the assumptions in the calculation 

of their value in use were changed:

Diageo  Annual Report 2023

10. Property, plant and equipment

Accounting policies
Land and buildings are stated at cost less accumulated depreciation. Freehold land is not depreciated. Leaseholds are generally depreciated 
over the unexpired period of the lease. Other property, plant and equipment are depreciated on a straight-line basis to estimated residual 
values over their expected useful lives, and these values and lives are reviewed each year. Subject to these reviews, the estimated useful lives 
fall within the following ranges: buildings – 10 to 50 years; within plant and equipment casks and containers – 15 to 50 years; other plant and 
equipment – 5 to 40 years; fixtures and fittings – 5 to 10 years; and returnable bottles and crates – 5 to 10 years.

Reviews are carried out if there is an indication that assets may be impaired, to ensure that property, plant and equipment are not carried 

at above their recoverable amounts.

Government grants
Government grants are not recognised until there is reasonable assurance that the group will comply with the conditions pursuant to which 
they have been granted and that the grants will be received. Government grants in respect of property, plant and equipment are deducted 
from the asset that they relate to, reducing the depreciation expense charged to the income statement.

The future cash outflows, which are not included in lease liabilities on 
the balance sheet, in respect of extension and termination options 
which are not reasonably expected to be exercised are estimated at 
£261 million (2022 – £282 million).

(c) Amounts recognised in the consolidated income 
statement 
In the year ended 30 June 2023, other external charges (within other 
operating items) included £57 million (2022 – £39 million) in respect 
of leases of low value assets and short term leases and £4 million (2022 
– £9 million) in respect of variable lease payments. Refer to note 5 for 
further information relating to the interest expenses on lease liabilities.  

The total cash outflow for leases in the year ended 30 June 2023 was 

£172 million (2022 – £154 million).

11. Biological assets

Accounting policies
Biological assets held by the group consist of agave (Agave Azul 
Tequilana Weber) plants. The harvested plants are used during 
the production of tequila. 

Biological assets are measured at fair value less costs to sell 

on initial recognition and at the end of each reporting period 
based on the present value of future cash flows discounted at an 
appropriate rate for Mexico. 

Agricultural produce is measured at fair value less costs to 
sell at the point of harvest which is used as the cost of inventory 
when the harvested agave is transferred.

Changes in biological assets were as follows:

At 30 June 2023, the number of agave plants was approximately 
37 million (2022 – 33 million), ranging from new plantations up to seven 
year-old plants.

12. Leases 

Accounting policies
Where the group is the lessee, all leases are recognised on the 
balance sheet as right-of-use assets and depreciated on a 
straight-line basis with the charge recognised in cost of sales or 
in other operating items depending on the nature of the costs. 
The liability, recognised as part of net borrowings, is measured at 
a discounted value and any interest is charged to finance 
charges.

The group recognises services associated with a lease as 
other operating expenses. Payments associated with leases 
where the value of the asset when it is new is lower than $5,000 
(leases of low value assets) and leases with a lease term of 12 
months or less (short term leases) are recognised as other 
operating expenses. A judgement in calculating the lease 
liability at initial recognition includes determining the lease term 
where extension or termination options exist. In such instances, 
any economic incentive to retain or end a lease are considered 
and extension periods are only included when it is considered 
reasonably certain that an option to extend a lease will be 
exercised.

13. Other investments 

14. Post employment benefits    

Accounting policies
Other investments are equity investments that are not classified 
as investments in associates or joint arrangements nor 
investments in subsidiaries. They are included in non-current 
assets. Subsequent to initial measurement, other investments are 
stated at fair value. Gains and losses arising from the changes in 
fair value are recognised in the income statement or in other 
comprehensive income on a case by case basis. Accumulated 
gains and losses included in other comprehensive income are 
not recycled to the income statement. Dividends from other 
investments are recognised in the consolidated income 
statement.

Loans receivable are non-derivative financial assets that are not 
classified as equity investments. They are subsequently 
measured either at amortised cost using the effective interest 
method less allowance for impairment or at fair value with gains 
and losses arising from changes in fair value recognised in the 
income statement or in other comprehensive income that are 
recycled to the income statement on the de-recognition of the 
asset. Allowances for expected credit losses are made based on 
the risk of non-payment taking into account ageing, previous 
experience, economic conditions and forward-looking data. 
Such allowances are measured as either 12-months expected 
credit losses or lifetime expected credit losses depending on 
changes in the credit quality of the counterparty.

At 30 June 2023, loans comprise £6 million (2022 – £6 million; 2021 – 
£3 million) of loans to customers and other third parties, after 
allowances of £121 million (2022 – £129 million; 2021 – £113 million), and 
£29 million (2022 – £12 million; 2021 – £7 million) of loans to associates. 

Accounting policies
The group’s principal post employment funds are defined benefit 
plans. In addition, the group has defined contribution plans, 
unfunded post employment medical benefit liabilities and other 
unfunded defined benefit post employment liabilities. For post 
employment plans other than defined contribution plans, the 
amount charged to operating profit is the cost of accruing 
pension benefits promised to employees over the year, plus any 
changes arising on benefits granted to members by the group 
during the year. Net finance charges comprise the net deficit/
surplus on the plans at the beginning of the year, adjusted for 
cash flows in the year, multiplied by the discount rate for plan 
liabilities. The differences between the fair value of the plans’ 
assets and the present value of the plans’ liabilities are disclosed 
as an asset or liability on the consolidated balance sheet. Any 
differences due to changes in assumptions or experience are 
recognised in other comprehensive income. The amount of any 
pension fund asset recognised on the balance sheet is limited to 
any future refunds from the plan or the present value of 
reductions in future contributions to the plan.

Contributions payable by the group in respect of defined 
contribution plans are charged to operating profit as incurred.
Critical accounting estimates and judgements 
Application of IAS 19 requires the exercise of estimate and 
judgement in relation to various assumptions.

Diageo determines the assumptions on a country by country 
basis in conjunction with its actuaries. Estimates are required in 
respect of uncertain future events, including the life expectancy 
of members of the funds, salary and pension increases, future 
inflation rates, discount rates and employee and pensioner 
demographics. The application of different assumptions could 
have a significant effect on the amounts reflected in the income 
statement, other comprehensive income and the balance sheet. 
There may be interdependencies between the assumptions.

Where there is an accounting surplus on a defined benefit 

plan, management judgement is necessary to determine 
whether the group can obtain economic benefits through a 
refund of the surplus or by reducing future contributions to the 
plan.

(a) Post employment benefit plans 
The group operates a number of pension plans throughout the world, 
devised in accordance with local conditions and practices. Diageo's 
most significant plans are defined benefit plans and are funded by 
payments to separately administered trusts or insurance companies. The 
group also operates a number of plans that are generally unfunded, 
primarily in the United States, which provide to employees post 
employment medical benefits.

The principal plans are in the United Kingdom, Ireland and the 
United States where benefits are based on employees’ length of service 
and salary at retirement. All valuations were performed by independent 
actuaries using the projected unit credit method to determine pension 
costs.

The Diageo Pension Scheme (DPS, the UK Scheme) closed to new members in 
November 2005. Employees who joined Diageo in the United Kingdom between 
November 2005 and January 2018, had been eligible to become members of the 
Diageo Lifestyle Plan (a cash balance defined benefit plan). Since then, new employees 
have been eligible to become members of a master trust defined contribution plans. 

(2)  The Guinness Ireland Group Pension Scheme (GIGPS, the Irish scheme) closed to new 

members in May 2013. Employees who have joined Diageo in Ireland since the defined 
benefit scheme closed have been eligible to become members of a master trust 
defined contribution plans.   

The assets of the UK and Irish pension plans are held in separate trusts 
administered by trustees who are required to act in the best interests of 
the plans’ beneficiaries. For DPS, the trustee is Diageo Pension Trust 
Limited. As required by legislation, one-third of the directors of the Trust 
are nominated by the members of the DPS, member nominated 
directors are appointed from both the pensioner member community 
and the active member community. For the Irish Scheme, Diageo 
Ireland makes four nominations and appoints three further candidates 
nominated by representative groupings. 

The amounts charged to the consolidated income statement and 
statement of comprehensive income for the group’s defined benefit 
plans for the three years ended 30 June 2023 are as follows:

The disclosures have been prepared in accordance with IFRIC 14. In 
particular, where the calculation for a plan results in a surplus, the 
recognised asset is limited to the present value of any available future 
refunds from the plan or reductions in future contributions to the plan, 
and any additional liabilities are recognised as required. At 30 June 
2023, the DPS had a net surplus of £589 million (2022 – £1,174 million; 
2021 – £840 million) and the GIGPS had a net surplus of £260 million 
(2022 a surplus of £221 million; 2021 a deficit of £79 million) and other 
schemes in a surplus totalled of £111 million (2022 – £158 million; 2021 – 
£178 million). Both of these surpluses have been recognised, with no 
provision made against them, as they are expected to be recoverable 
through a combination of a reduction in future cash contributions or 
ultimately via a cash refund when the last member’s obligations have 
been met.  

(b) Principal risks and assumptions 
The material post employment plans are not exposed to any unusual, 
entity-specific or scheme-specific risks but there are general risks: 

Inflation – The majority of the plans’ obligations are linked to inflation. 
Higher inflation will lead to increased liabilities which is partially offset 
by the plans holding inflation linked gilts, swaps and caps against the 
level of inflationary increases. 

Interest rate – The plan liabilities are determined using discount rates 
derived from yields on AA-rated corporate bonds. A decrease in 
corporate bond yields will increase plan liabilities though this will be 
partially offset by an increase in the value of the bonds held by the post 
employment plans. 

Mortality – The majority of the obligations are to provide benefits for the 
life of the members and their partners, so any increase in life 
expectancy will result in an increase in the plans’ liabilities. 

Asset returns – Assets held by the pension plans are invested in a 
diversified portfolio of equities, bonds and other assets. Volatility in asset 
values will lead to movements in the net deficit/surplus reported in the 
consolidated balance sheet for post employment plans which in 
addition will also impact the post employment expense in the 
consolidated income statement. 

The following weighted average assumptions were used to 
determine the group’s deficit/surplus in the main post employment 
plans at 30 June in the relevant year. The assumptions used to calculate 
the charge/credit in the consolidated income statement for the year 
ending 30 June are based on the assumptions disclosed as at the 
previous 30 June.

The salary increase assumption in the United States is not a significant assumption as only a minimal amount of members’ pension entitlement is dependent on a member’s projected 
final salary. 

(2)  The salary increase assumptions include an allowance for age-related promotional salary increases. 

For the principal UK and Irish pension funds, the table below illustrates the expected age at death of an average worker who retires currently at the 
age of 65, and one who is currently aged 45 and subsequently retires at the age of 65:

The estimated effect on the liabilities excludes the impact of any interest rate and inflation swaps held by the pension plans.  
The sensitivity analyses above have been determined based on reasonably possible changes of the respective assumptions and may not be representative of the actual change. Each 
sensitivity is calculated on a change in the key assumption while holding all other assumptions constant. The sensitivity to inflation includes the impact on all inflation linked assumptions 
(e.g. pension increases and salary increases where appropriate).

FINANCIAL STATEMENTS  contin ued

(c) Investment and hedging strategy 
The investment strategy for the group’s funded post employment plans is determined locally by the trustees of the plan and/or Diageo, as 
appropriate, and takes account of the relevant statutory requirements. The objective of the investment strategy is to achieve a target rate of return in 
excess of the movement on the liabilities, whilst taking an acceptable level of investment risk relative to the liabilities. This objective is implemented 
by using the funds of the plans to invest in a variety of asset classes that are expected over the long-term to deliver a target rate of return. The 
majority of the investment strategies have significant amounts allocated to bonds, in order to provide a natural hedge against movements in the 
liabilities of the plans. At 30 June 2023, approximately 97% and 98% (2022 – 100% and 103%) of the UK plans’ liabilities measured on the Trustee's 
funding basis (gilts+50bp) were hedged against future movements in interest rates and inflation, respectively, through the combined effect of bonds 
and swaps. At 30 June 2023, approximately 92% and 112% (2022 – 70% and 76%) of the Irish plans’ liabilities measured on the Trustee's funding 
basis (euro-swaps+50bp) were hedged against future movements in interest rates and inflation, respectively, through the combined effect of bonds 
and swaps.  

The discount rates used are based on the yields of high-quality fixed income investments. For the UK plans, which represent approximately 65% 
of total plan liabilities, the discount rate is determined by reference to the yield curves of AA-rated corporate bonds for which the timing and amount 
of cash outflows are similar to those of the plans. A similar process is used to determine the discount rates used for the non-UK plans. 

An analysis of the fair value of the plan assets is as follows:

(d) Deficit funding arrangements 
UK plans 
In the year ended 30 June 2011, the group established a Pension Funding Partnership (PFP) in respect of the UK Scheme. Whisky inventory was 
transferred into the partnership but the group retains control over the partnership which at 30 June 2023 held inventory with a book value of £732 
million (2022 – £561 million). The partnership is fully consolidated in the group financial statements. The UK Scheme has a limited interest in the 
partnership and, as a partner, is entitled to a distribution from the profits of the partnership. The arrangement is expected to cease in 2030, and 
contributions to the UK scheme in any year will be dependent on the funding position of the UK scheme at the previous 31 March. Given the surplus 
funding position in the DPS, there were no contributions to the DPS in the years ended 30 June 2023 and 30 June 2022.

In 2030, the group will be required, dependent upon the funding position of the UK Scheme at that time, to pay an amount not greater than the 
actuarial deficit at that time, up to a maximum of £430 million in cash, to purchase the UK Scheme’s interest in the partnership. If the UK Scheme is 
in surplus at an actuarial triennial valuation excluding the value of the PFP, then the group can exit the PFP with the agreement of the trustees.
During the year ended 30 June 2023, following a remeasurement of the Diageo Lifestyle Plan, Diageo made a £16 million one-off deficit contribution 
to satisfy minimum funding requirement.

Irish plans
The 31 December 2021 triennial actuarial valuation of the Guinness Ireland Group Pension Scheme was completed during the year ended 30 June 
2023 showing the Scheme is fully funded on the Trustee’s ongoing funding basis and the statutory minimum funding standard basis. Given the fully 
funded position, no deficit contributions were payable in the year ended 30 June 2023 and the Trustee agreed to the company's request to 
terminate the contingent arrangements comprising mortgages over certain land and buildings and fixed and floating charges over certain 
receivables of the group up to a value of €200 million (£171 million). The company has agreed with the Trustee conditional contributions of up to 
€35 million (£30 million) by 31 December 2024, €39 million (£33 million) by 31 December 2027 and €39 million (£33 million) by 31 December 2030 
if a deficit is identified at those valuations.

The projected benefit payments are based on the assumptions underlying the assessment of the obligations, including inflation. They are disclosed 
undiscounted and therefore appear large relative to the discounted value of the plan liabilities recognised on the consolidated balance sheet. They 
are in respect of benefits that have accrued at the balance sheet date and make no allowance for any benefits to be accrued subsequently.

The asset classes include some cash holdings that are temporary. This cash is likely to be invested imminently and so has been included in the asset class where it is anticipated to be 
invested in the long-term.

Total cash contributions by the group to all post employment plans in the year ending 30 June 2024 are estimated to be approximately £75 million 
($95 million).

Interest payable at 30 June 2023 includes interest on non-derivative financial instruments of £217 million (2022 – £141 million). Accruals at 30 June 
2023 include £561 million (2022 – £613 million) accrued discounts attributed to sales recognised. Deferred income represents amounts paid by 
customers in respect of performance obligations not yet satisfied. The amount of contract liabilities recognised as revenue in the current year is 
£90 million (2022 – £72 million). Non-current liabilities include the net present value of contingent consideration in respect of prior acquisitions of 
£293 million (2022 – £353 million). For further information on contingent consideration, please refer to note 16 (g). 

Together with the group’s partner banks, supply chain financing (SCF) facilities are provided to suppliers in certain countries. These arrangements 

enable suppliers to receive funding earlier than the invoice due date at their discretion and at their own cost. Payment terms continue to be agreed 
directly between the group and suppliers, independently from the availability of SCF facilities. Liabilities are settled in accordance with the original 
due date of invoices. The group does not incur any fees or receive any rebates where the suppliers choose to utilise these facilities. The group has 
determined that it is appropriate to present amounts outstanding subject to SCF arrangements as trade payables. Consistent with this classification, 
cash flows are presented either as operating cash flows or cash flows from investing activities, when related to the acquisition of non-current assets. 
At 30 June 2023, the amount that has been subject to SCF and accounted for as trade payables was £727 million (2022 – £789 million).

15. Working capital 

Accounting policies
Inventories are stated at the lower of cost and net realisable 
value. Cost includes raw materials, direct labour and expenses, 
an appropriate proportion of production and other overheads, 
but not borrowing costs. Cost is calculated at the weighted 
average cost incurred in acquiring inventories. Maturing 
inventories and raw materials which are retained for more than 
one year are classified as current assets, as they are expected to 
be realised in the normal operating cycle.
Trade and other receivables are initially recognised at fair value 
less transaction costs and subsequently carried at amortised cost 
less any allowance for discounts and doubtful debts. Trade 
receivables arise from contracts with customers, and are 
recognised when performance obligations are satisfied, and the 
consideration due is unconditional as only the passage of time is 
required before the payment is received. Allowance losses are 
calculated by reviewing lifetime expected credit losses using 
historic and forward-looking data on credit risk.
Trade and other payables are initially recognised at fair value 
including transaction costs and subsequently carried at 
amortised costs. Contingent considerations recognised in 
business combinations are subsequently measured at fair value 
through income statement. The group evaluates supplier 
arrangements against a number of indicators to assess if the 
liability has the characteristics of a trade payable or should be 
classified as borrowings. This assessment considers the 
commercial purpose of the facility, whether payment terms are 
similar to customary payment terms, whether the group is legally 
discharged from its obligation towards suppliers before the end 
of the original payment term, and the group’s involvement in 
agreeing terms between banks and suppliers.

Provisions are liabilities of uncertain timing or amount. A 
provision is recognised if, as a result of a past event, the group 
has a present legal or constructive obligation that can be 
estimated reliably, and it is probable that an outflow of 
economic benefits will be required to settle the obligation. 
Provisions are calculated on a discounted basis. The carrying 
amounts of provisions are reviewed at each balance sheet date 
and adjusted to reflect the current best estimate.

Risk management and capital structure 

Introduction 
This section sets out the policies and procedures applied to manage the group’s capital structure and the financial risks the group is exposed to. 
Diageo considers the following components of its balance sheet to be capital: borrowings and equity. Diageo manages its capital structure to 
achieve capital efficiency, provide flexibility to invest through the economic cycle and give efficient access to debt markets at attractive cost levels. 

16. Financial instruments and risk management 

Accounting policies 

Financial assets and liabilities are initially recorded at fair value including, where permitted by IFRS 9, any directly attributable transaction 
costs. For those financial assets that are not subsequently held at fair value, the group assesses whether there is evidence of impairment at 
each balance sheet date.

The group classifies its financial assets and liabilities into the following categories: financial assets and liabilities at amortised cost, financial 

assets and liabilities at fair value through income statement and financial assets at fair value through other comprehensive income.

The accounting policies for other investments and loans are described in note 13, for trade and other receivables and payables in note 15 

and for cash and cash equivalents in note 17.

Financial assets and liabilities at fair value through income statement include derivative assets and liabilities. Where financial assets or 
liabilities are eligible to be carried at either amortised cost or fair value through other comprehensive income, the group does not apply the 
fair value option.

Derivative financial instruments are carried at fair value using a discounted cash flow model based on market data applied consistently 
for similar types of instruments. Gains and losses on derivatives that do not qualify for hedge accounting treatment are taken to the income 
statement as they arise. 

Other financial liabilities are carried at amortised cost unless they are part of a fair value hedge relationship. The difference between the 
initial carrying amount of the financial liabilities and their redemption value is recognised in the income statement over the contractual terms 
using the effective interest rate method. Financial liabilities in respect of the Zacapa acquisition are recognised at fair value.

Hedge accounting 

The group designates and documents certain derivatives as hedging instruments against changes in fair value of recognised assets and 
liabilities (fair value hedges), commodity price risk of highly probable forecast transactions, as well as the cash flow risk from a change in 
exchange or interest rates (cash flow hedges) and hedges of net investments in foreign operations (net investment hedges). The designated 
portion of the hedging instruments is included in other financial assets and liabilities on the consolidated balance sheet. The effectiveness of 
such hedges is assessed at inception and at least on a quarterly basis, using prospective testing. Methods used for testing effectiveness 
include dollar offset, critical terms, regression analysis and hypothetical models. 

Fair value hedges are used to manage the currency and/or interest rate risks to which the fair value of certain assets and liabilities are 
exposed. Changes in the fair value of the derivatives are recognised in the income statement, along with any changes in the relevant fair 
value of the underlying hedged asset or liability. If such a hedge relationship no longer meets hedge accounting criteria, fair value 
movements on the derivative continue to be taken to the income statement while any fair value adjustments made to the underlying hedged 
item to that date are amortised through the income statement over its remaining life using the effective interest rate method.

Cash flow hedges are used to hedge the foreign currency risk of highly probable future foreign currency cash flows, the commodity price risk 
of highly probable future transactions, as well as the cash flow risk from changes in exchange or interest rates. The effective portion of the 
gain or loss on the hedges is recognised in other comprehensive income, while any ineffective part is recognised in the income statement. 
Amounts recorded in other comprehensive income are recycled to the income statement in the same period in which the underlying foreign 
currency, commodity or interest exposure affects the income statement. 

Net investment hedges take the form of either foreign currency borrowings or derivatives. Foreign exchange differences arising on translation 
of net investments are recorded in other comprehensive income and included in the exchange reserve. Liabilities used as hedging 
instruments are revalued at closing exchange rates and the resulting gains or losses are also recognised in other comprehensive income to 
the extent that they are effective, with any ineffectiveness taken to the income statement. Foreign currency contracts hedging net investments 
are carried at fair value. Effective fair value movements are recognised in other comprehensive income, with any ineffectiveness taken to the 
income statement.

The group’s funding, liquidity and exposure to foreign currency and 
interest rate risks are managed by the group’s treasury department. The 
treasury department uses a range of financial instruments to manage 
these underlying risks. 

Treasury operations are conducted within a framework of Board-

approved policies and guidelines, which are recommended and 
monitored by the Finance Committee, chaired by the Chief Financial 
Officer. The policies and guidelines include benchmark exposure and/
or hedge cover levels for key areas of treasury risk which are 

periodically reviewed by the Board following, for example, significant 
business, strategic or accounting changes. The framework provides for 
limited defined levels of flexibility in execution to allow for the optimal 
application of the Board-approved strategies. Transactions arising from 
the application of this flexibility are carried at fair value, gains or losses 
are taken to the income statement as they arise and are separately 
monitored on a daily basis using Value at Risk analysis. In the years 
ended 30 June 2023 and 30 June 2022, gains and losses on these 
transactions were not material. The group does not use derivatives for 

speculative purposes. All transactions in derivative financial instruments 
are initially undertaken to manage the risks arising from underlying 
business activities. 

The group purchases insurance for commercial or, where required, 
for legal or contractual reasons. In addition, the group retains insurable 
risk where external insurance is not considered an economic means of 
mitigating these risks.

The Finance Committee receives a quarterly report on the key 
activities of the treasury department, however any exposures which 
differ from the defined benchmarks are reported as they arise.  

(a) Currency risk  
The group presents its consolidated financial statements in sterling and 
conducts business in many currencies. As a result, it is subject to foreign 
currency risk due to exchange rate movements, which will affect the 
group’s transactions and the translation of the results and underlying 
net assets of its operations. To manage the currency risk, the group uses 
certain financial instruments. Where hedge accounting is applied, 
hedges are documented and tested for effectiveness on an ongoing 
basis.

Hedge of net investment in foreign operations  
The group hedges a certain portion of its exposure to fluctuations in the 
sterling value of its foreign operations by designating borrowings held in 
foreign currencies and using foreign currency spots, forwards, swaps 
and other financial derivatives. For the year ended 30 June 2023, the 
group’s intention was to maintain total net investment Value at Risk to 
total net asset value below 20%, where Value at Risk is defined as the 
maximum amount of loss over a one-year period with a 95% 
probability confidence level.  

At 30 June 2023, foreign currency borrowings designated in net 
investment hedge relationships amounted to £10,627 million (2022 –
£8,742 million), including financial derivatives.  

Hedge of foreign currency debt  
The group uses cross currency interest rate swaps to hedge the foreign 
currency risk associated with certain foreign currency denominated 
borrowings.  

Transaction exposure hedging  
The group’s policy is to hedge forecast transactional foreign currency 
risk on major currency pair exposures up to 24 months, targeting 75% 
coverage for the current financial year, and on other currency 
exposures up to 18 months. The group’s exposure to foreign currency 
risk arising principally on forecasted sales transactions is managed 
using forward agreements and options.    

(b) Interest rate risk  
The group has an exposure to interest rate risk, arising principally on 
changes in US dollar, euro and sterling interest rates. To manage 
interest rate risk, the group manages its proportion of fixed to floating 
rate borrowings within limits approved by the Board, primarily through 
issuing fixed and floating rate borrowings, and by utilising interest rate 
swaps. These practices aim to minimise the group’s net finance charges 
with acceptable year-on-year volatility. To facilitate operational 
efficiency and effective hedge accounting, for the year ended 30 June 
2023 the group’s policy was to maintain fixed rate borrowings within a 
band of 40% to 90% of forecast net borrowings. For these calculations, 
net borrowings exclude interest rate related fair value adjustments. The 
majority of the group’s existing interest rate derivatives are designated 
as hedges and are expected to be effective. Fair value of these 
derivatives is recognised in the income statement, along with any 
changes in the relevant fair value of the underlying hedged asset or 
liability. The interest rate profile of the group's net borrowings is as 
follows:

(i)   For this calculation, net interest charge excludes fair value adjustments to derivative 

financial instruments and average monthly net borrowings include the impact of interest 
rate swaps that are no longer in a hedge relationship but exclude the market value 
adjustment for cross currency interest rate swaps.  

IBOR reform
In accordance with the UK Financial Conduct Authority’s 
announcement on 5 March 2021, LIBOR benchmark rates were 
discontinued after 31 December 2021, except for the majority of the US 
dollar settings which are discontinued from 30 June 2023. There have 
been amendments to the contractual terms of IBOR-referenced interest 
rates and the corresponding update of the hedge designations. By 30 
June 2022, changes required to systems and processes in relation to the 
fair valuation of financial instruments were implemented and the 
transition had no material tax or accounting implications. The group 
also evaluated the implications of the reference rate changes in relation 
to other valuation models and credit risk, and concluded that they were 
not material.

In line with the relief provided by the amendment, the group 

assumes that the interest rate benchmark on which the cash flows of the 
hedged item, the hedging instrument or the hedged risk are based are 
not altered by the IBOR reform. The derivative hedging instruments 
provide a close approximation to the extent and nature of the risk 
exposure the group manages through hedging relationships.

Included in floating rate net borrowings are interest rate swaps 

designated in fair value hedges, with a notional amount of 
£2,063 million (2022 – £2,893 million) whose interest rates are based on 
USD LIBOR. In preparation for the discontinuation of USD LIBOR, the 
group have amended these agreements to reference the Secured 
Overnight Financing Rate (SOFR) resulting in economically equivalent 
trades upon transition. The floating legs of the transitioned trades will 
become SOFR based subsequent to the last USD LIBOR based interest 
payments.

(c) Commodity price risk  
Commodity price risk is managed in line with the principles approved 
by the Board either through long-term purchase contracts with suppliers 
or, where appropriate, derivative contracts. The group policy is to 
maintain the Value at Risk of commodity price risk arising from 
commodity exposures below 75 bps of forecast gross profit in any given 
financial year. Where derivative contracts are used, the commodity 
price risk exposure is hedged up to 24 months of forecast volume 
through exchange-traded and over-the-counter contracts (futures, 
forwards and swaps) and cash flow hedge accounting is applied.

(d) Market risk sensitivity analysis 
The group uses a sensitivity analysis that estimates the impacts on the 
consolidated income statement and other comprehensive income of 
either an instantaneous increase or decrease of 0.5% in market interest 
rates or a 10% strengthening or weakening in sterling against all other 
currencies, from the rates applicable for each class of financial 
instruments on the consolidated balance sheet at these dates with all 
other variables remaining constant. The sensitivity analysis excludes the 
impact of market risk on the net post employment benefit liabilities and 
assets, and corporate tax payable. This analysis is for illustrative 
purposes only, as in practice interest and foreign exchange rates rarely 
change in isolation.  

The sensitivity analysis estimates the impact of changes in interest 

and foreign exchange rates. All hedges are expected to be highly 
effective for this analysis and it considers the impact of all financial 
instruments including financial derivatives, cash and cash equivalents, 
borrowings and other financial assets and liabilities. The results of the 
sensitivity analysis should not be considered as projections of likely 
future events, gains or losses as actual results in the future may differ 
materially due to developments in the global financial markets which 
may cause fluctuations in interest and exchange rates to vary from the 
hypothetical amounts disclosed in the table below.

The impact on foreign currency borrowings and derivatives in net investment hedges is 
largely offset by the foreign exchange difference arising on the translation of net 
investments.    

(2)  The impact on the consolidated statement of comprehensive income includes the 

impact on the income statement.  

(e) Credit risk   
Credit risk refers to the risk that a counterparty will default on its 
contractual obligations resulting in financial loss to the group. Credit risk 
arises on cash balances (including bank deposits and cash and cash 
equivalents), derivative financial instruments and credit exposures to 
customers, including outstanding loans, trade and other receivables, 
financial guarantees and committed transactions.  

The carrying amount of financial assets of £4,637 million (2022 – 
£5,445 million) represents the group’s exposure to credit risk at the 
balance sheet date as disclosed in section (i), excluding the impact of 
any collateral held or other credit enhancements. A financial asset is in 
default when the counterparty fails to pay its contractual obligations. 
Financial assets are written off when there is no reasonable expectation 
of recovery.  

Credit risk is managed separately for financial and business related 

credit exposures.  

Financial credit risk   
Diageo aims to minimise its financial credit risk through the application 
of risk management policies approved and monitored by the Board. 
Counterparties are predominantly limited to investment grade banks 
and financial institutions, and policy restricts the exposure to any one 
counterparty by setting credit limits taking into account the credit quality 
of the counterparty. The group’s policy is designed to ensure that 
individual counterparty limits are adhered to and that there are no 
significant concentrations of credit risk. The Board also defines the types 
of financial instruments which may be transacted. The credit risk arising 
through the use of financial instruments for currency, interest rate and 
commodity price risk management is estimated with reference to the 
fair value of contracts with a positive value, rather than the notional 
amount of the instruments themselves. Diageo annually reviews the 
credit limits applied and regularly monitors the counterparties’ credit 
quality reflecting market credit conditions.  

When derivative transactions are undertaken with bank 

counterparties, the group may, where appropriate, enter into certain 
agreements with such bank counterparties whereby the parties agree to 
post cash collateral for the benefit of the other if the net valuations of 
the derivatives are above a predetermined threshold. At 30 June 2023, 
the collateral held under these agreements amounted to $(19) million 
(£(15) million) (2022 – $23 million (£19 million)).  

Business related credit risk   
Exposures from loan, trade and other receivables are managed locally 
in the operating units where they arise and active risk management is 
applied, focusing on country risk, credit limits, ongoing credit evaluation 
and monitoring procedures. There is no significant concentration of 
credit risk with respect to loans, trade and other receivables as the 
group has a large number of customers which are internationally 
dispersed.  

(f) Liquidity risk   
Liquidity risk is the risk of Diageo encountering difficulties in meeting its 
obligations associated with financial liabilities that are settled by 
delivering cash or other financial assets. The group uses short-term 
commercial paper to finance its day-to-day operations. The group’s 
policy with regard to the expected maturity profile of borrowings is to 
limit the amount of such borrowings maturing within 12 months to 50% 
of gross borrowings less money market demand deposits, and the level 
of commercial paper to 30% of gross borrowings less money market 
demand deposits. In addition, the group’s policy is to maintain 
backstop facilities with relationship banks to support commercial paper 
obligations.

The following tables provide an analysis of the anticipated 
contractual cash flows including interest payable for the group’s 
financial liabilities and derivative instruments on an undiscounted basis. 
Where interest payments are calculated at a floating rate, rates of each 
cash flow until maturity of the instruments are calculated based on the 
forward yield curve prevailing at the respective year ends. The gross 
cash flows of cross currency swaps are presented for the purposes of 
this table. All other derivative contracts are presented on a net basis. 
Financial assets and liabilities are presented gross in the consolidated 
balance sheet although, in practice, the group uses netting 
arrangements to reduce its liquidity requirements on these instruments.

For the purpose of these tables, borrowings are defined as gross borrowings excluding lease liabilities and fair value of derivative instruments as disclosed in note 17.   

(1) 
(2)  Carrying amount of interest on borrowings, interest on derivatives and interest on other payable is included within interest payable in note 15.   
(3)  Primarily consists of trade and other payables that meet the definition of financial liabilities under IAS 32.  

The group had available undrawn committed bank facilities as follows:

The facilities can be used for general corporate purposes and, together 
with cash and cash equivalents, support the group’s commercial paper 
programmes.

There are no financial covenants on the group’s material short- and 
long-term borrowings. Certain of these borrowings contain cross default 
provisions and negative pledges.

The committed bank facilities are subject to a single financial 
covenant, being minimum interest cover ratio of two times (defined as 
the ratio of operating profit before exceptional items, aggregated with 
share of after tax results of associates and joint ventures, to net interest 
charges). They are also subject to pari passu ranking and negative 
pledge covenants.

Any non-compliance with covenants underlying Diageo’s financing 

arrangements could, if not waived, constitute an event of default with 
respect to any such arrangements, and any non-compliance with 
covenants may, in particular circumstances, lead to an acceleration of 
maturity on certain borrowings and the inability to access committed 
facilities. Diageo was in full compliance with its financial, pari passu 
ranking and negative pledge covenants in respect of its material short- 
and long-term borrowings throughout each of the years presented.

(g) Fair value measurements  
Fair value measurements of financial instruments are presented through 
the use of a three-level fair value hierarchy that prioritises the valuation 
techniques used in fair value calculations.  

The group maintains policies and procedures to value instruments 
using the most relevant data available. If multiple inputs that fall into 
different levels of the hierarchy are used in the valuation of an 
instrument, the instrument is categorised on the basis of the most 
subjective input.   

Foreign currency forwards and swaps, cross currency swaps and 
interest rate swaps are valued using discounted cash flow techniques. 
These techniques incorporate inputs at levels 1 and 2, such as foreign 
exchange rates and interest rates. These market inputs are used in the 
discounted cash flow calculation incorporating the instrument’s term, 
notional amount and discount rate, and taking credit risk into account. 
As significant inputs to the valuation are observable in active markets, 
these instruments are categorised as level 2 in the hierarchy.   

Other financial liabilities include a put option, which does not have 
an expiry date, held by Industrias Licoreras de Guatemala (ILG) to sell 
the remaining 50% equity stake in Rum Creation & Products Inc., the 
owner of the Zacapa rum brand, to Diageo. The liability is fair valued 
using the discounted cash flow method and as at 30 June 2023, an 
amount of £218 million (30 June 2022 – £216 million) is recognised as a 
liability with changes in the fair value of the put option included in 
retained earnings. As the valuation of this option uses assumptions not 
observable in the market, it is categorised as level 3 in the hierarchy. As 
at 30 June 2023, because it is unknown when or if ILG will exercise the 
option, the liability is measured as if the exercise date is on the last day 
of the next financial year considering forecast future performance. The

option is sensitive to reasonably possible changes in assumptions; if the 
option were to be exercised as at 30 June 2025, the fair value of the 
liability would increase by approximately £30 million.

Included in other financial liabilities, the contingent consideration on 
acquisition of businesses represents the present value of payments up to 
£422 million, which are expected to be paid over the next eight years. 
Contingent considerations linked to certain volume targets at 30 June 
2023 included £113 million in respect of the acquisition of Aviation Gin 
and Davos Brands (2022 – £157 million), £59 million in respect of the 
acquisition of 21Seeds (2022 – £59 million) and £18 million in respect of 
the acquisition of Lone River Ranch Water (2022 – £57 million). 
Contingent consideration of £70 million in respect of the acquisition of 
Don Papa Rum (2022 – £nil) is linked to certain financial performance 
targets. Contingent considerations are fair valued based on discounted

cash flow method using assumptions not observable in the market. 
Contingent considerations are sensitive to possible changes in 
assumptions; a 10% increase or decrease in volume would increase or 
decrease the fair value of contingent considerations linked to certain 
volume targets by approximately £30 million and £50 million, 
respectively, and a 10% increase or decrease in cash flows would 
increase or decrease the fair value of contingent considerations linked 
to certain financial performance targets by approximately £25 million.

There were no significant changes in the measurement and 
valuation techniques, or significant transfers between the levels of the 
financial assets and liabilities in the year ended 30 June 2023.  

The group’s financial assets and liabilities measured at fair value are 

categorised as follows: 

In the years ended 30 June 2023 and 30 June 2022, the increase in financial assets - other of £8 million (2022 – £46 million) is principally in respect 
of acquisitions.

The movements in level 3 instruments, measured on a recurring basis, are as follows:

(h) Results of hedge relationships  
The group targets a one-to-one hedge ratio. The strength of the economic relationship between the hedged items and the hedging instruments is 
analysed on an ongoing basis. Ineffectiveness can arise from subsequent change in the forecast transactions as a result of differences in timing, 
cash flows or value except when the critical terms of the hedging instrument and hedged item are closely aligned. The change in the credit risk of 
the hedging instruments or the hedged items is not expected to be the primary factor in the economic relationship.

In case of derivatives in cash flow hedges (commodity price risk and foreign currency risk), the range of the most significant contract’s hedged rates are presented. 

For hedges of the cash flow risk from a change in forward exchange rates using cross currency interest rate swaps, the retranslation of the related 
bond principal to closing exchange rates and recognition of interest on the related bonds will affect the income statement in each year until the 
related bonds mature in 2036 and 2043. Exchange retranslation and the interest on the hedged bonds in the income statement are expected to 
offset those on the cross currency swaps in each of the years.   

In respect of cash flow hedging instruments, a gain of £247 million (2022 – £124 million gain; 2021 – £157 million loss) was recognised in other 
comprehensive income due to changes in fair value. A gain of £13 million was transferred out of other comprehensive income to other operating 
expenses and a loss of £54 million to other finance charges, respectively, (2022 – a loss of £42 million and a gain of £239 million; 2021 – a loss of 
£10 million and a loss of £175 million) to offset the foreign exchange impact on the underlying transactions. A gain of £33 million (2022 – £46 million 
gain, 2021 – £2 million gain) was transferred out of other comprehensive income to operating profit in relation to commodity hedges. The carrying 
amount of hedged items recognised in the consolidated balance sheet in relation to hedges of cash flow risk arising from foreign currency debts 
equals the notional value of the hedging instruments at 30 June 2023 and are included within borrowings. The notional amount for cash flow 
hedges of foreign currency debt at 30 June 2023 was £873 million (2022 – £1,694 million). 

For cash flow hedges of forecast transactions at 30 June 2023, based on year end interest and exchange rates, a gain to the income statement 

of £143 million in the year ending 30 June 2024 and a gain of £20 million in the year ending 30 June 2025 is expected to be recognised.  

In respect of hedges of foreign currency borrowings that are no longer applicable at 30 June 2023, a loss of £18 million (2022 – a loss of £19 
million) was reported in reserves. There was no significant ineffectiveness on net investment and cash flow hedges during the year ended 30 June 
2023.  

The £3,999 million (2022 – £4,444 million) notional value of hedged items in fair value hedges equals to the notional value of hedging 
instruments designated in these relationships at 30 June 2023 and the carrying amount of hedged items are included within borrowings in the 
consolidated balance sheet.   

For fair value hedges that are no longer applicable, the accumulated fair value changes shown on the consolidated balance sheet at 30 June 

2023 was £nil (2022 – £1 million).

At 30 June 2023, the fair value of borrowings, based on unadjusted quoted market data, was £15,641 million (2022 – £15,628 million).  

 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
FINANCIAL STATEMENTS  contin ued

(j) Capital management  
The group’s management is committed to enhancing shareholder value 
in the long-term, both by investing in the business and brands so as to 
deliver continued improvement in the return from those investments and 
by managing the capital structure. Diageo manages its capital structure 
to achieve capital efficiency, provide flexibility to invest through the 
economic cycle and give efficient access to debt markets at attractive 
cost levels. This is achieved by targeting an adjusted net borrowings 
(net borrowings aggregated with post employment benefit liabilities) to 
adjusted EBITDA leverage of 2.5 - 3.0 times, this range for Diageo being 
currently broadly consistent with an A band credit rating. Diageo would 
consider operating outside of this range in order to effect strategic 
initiatives within its stated goals, which could have an impact on its 
rating. If Diageo’s leverage was to be negatively impacted by the 
financing of an acquisition, it would seek over time to return to the 
range of 2.5 – 3.0 times. The group regularly assesses its debt and 
equity capital levels against its stated policy for capital structure. As at 
30 June 2023, the adjusted net borrowings (£15,914 million) to adjusted 
EBITDA ratio was 2.6 times. For this calculation, net borrowings are 
adjusted by post employment benefit liabilities before tax (£373 million) 
whilst adjusted EBITDA (£6,120 million) comprises operating profit 
excluding exceptional operating items and depreciation, amortisation 
and impairment and includes share of after tax results of associates and 
joint ventures. 

17. Net borrowings 

Accounting policies 
Borrowings are initially recognised at fair value net of transaction 
costs and are subsequently reported at amortised cost. Certain 
bonds are designated in fair value hedge relationship. In these 
cases, the amortised cost is adjusted for the fair value of the risk 
being hedged, with changes in value recognised in the income 
statement. The fair value adjustment is calculated using a 
discounted cash flow technique based on unadjusted market 
data.  

Bank overdrafts form an integral part of the group’s cash 
management and are included as a component of net cash and 
cash equivalents in the consolidated statement of cash flows. 

Cash and cash equivalents comprise cash in hand and deposits 
which are readily convertible to known amounts of cash and 
which are subject to insignificant risk of changes in value and 
have an original maturity of three months or less, including 
money market deposits, commercial paper and investments. 

Net borrowings are defined as gross borrowings (short-term 
borrowings and long-term borrowings plus lease liabilities plus 
interest rate hedging instruments, cross currency interest rate 
swaps and foreign currency forwards and swaps used to 
manage borrowings) less cash and cash equivalents.

£2 million cash outflow in respect of derivatives designated in forward point hedges 
(2022 – £4 million). 
In the year ended 30 June 2023, other non-cash items are principally in respect of fair 
value changes of cross currency interest rate swaps and interest rate swaps of 
£(34) million and lease liabilities of £(82) million, partially offset by the £84 million fair 
value change of borrowings. In the year ended 30 June 2022, other non-cash items are 
principally in respect of fair value changes of cross currency interest rate swaps and 
interest rate swaps of £(346) million and lease liabilities of £(183) million, partially offset 
by the £331 million fair value change of borrowings.

18. Equity 

Accounting policies
Own shares represent shares and share options of Diageo plc 
that are held in treasury or by employee share trusts for the 
purpose of fulfilling obligations in respect of various employee 
share plans or were acquired as part of a share buyback 
programme. Own shares are treated as a deduction from equity 
until the shares are cancelled, reissued or disposed of and when 
vest are transferred from own shares to retained earnings at their 
weighted average cost.

Share-based payments include share awards and options 
granted to directors and employees. The fair value of equity 
settled share options and share grants is initially measured at 
grant date based on Monte Carlo and Black Scholes models 
and is charged to the income statement over the vesting period. 
For equity settled shares, the credit is included in retained 
earnings. Cancellations of share options are treated as an 
acceleration of the vesting period and any outstanding charge is 
recognised in operating profit immediately. Any surplus or deficit 
arising on the sale of the Diageo plc shares held by the group is 
included as a movement in equity.

Dividends are recognised in the financial statements in the year 
in which they are approved.

Purchase of own shares  
Authorisation was given by shareholders on 6 October 2022 to 
purchase a maximum of 227,870,414 ordinary shares at a minimum 
price of 28101/108 pence and a maximum price of the higher of (a) 
105% of the average market value of the company's ordinary shares for 
the five business days prior to the day the purchase is made and (b) the 
higher of the price of the last independent trade and the highest current 
independent bid on the trading venue where the purchase is carried 
out. The programme expires at the conclusion of the next Annual 
General Meeting or on 5 January 2024, if earlier.   

Diageo completed a total of £1.4 billion return of capital for the year 

ended 30 June 2023, which included £0.9 billion related to the 
successful completion of Diageo’s previous share buyback programme 
in which £4.5 billion of capital was returned to shareholders finalised in 

The proposed final dividend of £1,113 million (49.17 pence per share) for 
the year ended 30 June 2023 was approved by a duly authorised 
committee of the Board of Directors on 31 July 2023. As this was after 
the balance sheet date and the dividend is subject to approval by 
shareholders at the Annual General Meeting, this dividend has not been 
included as a liability in these consolidated financial statements. There 
are no corporate tax consequences arising from this treatment. 

Dividends are waived on all treasury shares owned by the company 

and all shares owned by the employee share trusts.

(Loss)/profit for the year includes exceptional operating expenses attributable to non-controlling interests.

(1) 
(2)  Other comprehensive (loss)/income is principally in respect of exchange on translating the subsidiaries to sterling.  
(3)  Non-current assets include the global distribution rights to distribute Ketel One vodka products throughout the world. The carrying value of the distribution rights at 30 June 2023 was 

£1,428 million (2022 – £1,488 million; 2021 – £1,295 million).

(i)   On 31 December 2022, USL completed the merger with its subsidiary, Pioneer Distilleries Limited (PDL) 75% owned by USL. Under the terms, PDL's minority shareholders received 

additional shares in USL in exchange for their 25% interest in PDL and non-controlling interest increased from 42.73% to 42.79%.

(ii)   On 24 March 2023, Diageo completed the purchase of an additional 14.97% of the share capital of EABL. This increased Diageo’s controlling shareholding position in EABL from 50.03% 

to 65.00%.

(f) Employee share compensation  
The group uses a number of share award and option plans to grant to 
its directors and employees.

Executive share awards have been made primarily under the Diageo 
2014 Long Term Incentive Plan (DLTIP) from September 2014 onwards 
and delivered in conditional awards in the form of performance shares, 
performance share options, time-vesting restricted stock units (RSUs) 
and/or time-vesting share options (or cash-based equivalents in certain 
locations for regulatory reasons). Share options are granted at the 
market value at the time of grant. Prior to the introduction of the DLTIP, 
employees in associated companies were granted awards under the 
Diageo plc 2011 Associated Companies Share Incentive Plan (DACSIP). 
In the case of Executive Directors, conditional awards of time-vesting 
RSUs or forfeitable shares may be awarded under the 2020 Deferred 

Bonus Share Plan (DBSP), with vesting not subject to any performance 
conditions and not subject to a post-vesting retention period. The DLTIP 
plan rules will be presented for renewal at the AGM in September 2023 
and any future awards made post approval will be made under the 
new plan rules.

Share awards normally vest and are released on the third 

anniversary of the grant date. Participants do not make a payment to 
receive the award at grant. Executive Directors are required to hold any 
vested shares awarded under DLTIP for a further two-year post-vesting 
holding period. Share options may normally be exercised between 
three and ten years after the grant date. Executives in North America 
and Latin America and Caribbean are granted awards over the 
company’s ADRs (one ADR is equivalent to four ordinary shares). 
Performance shares under the DLTIP (for awards in 2020 and 
thereafter) are subject to the achievement of three performance 
measures: 1) compound annual growth in profit before exceptional 
items over three years; 2) compound annual growth in organic net sales 
over three years; 3) environmental, social and governance (ESG) 
priorities, weighted 40%, 40% and 20% of the maximum respectively, 
as set out in the Directors’ remuneration report. Performance share 
options under the DLTIP are subject to the achievement of two equally 
weighted performance measures: 1) a comparison of Diageo’s three-
year TSR with a peer group; 2) cumulative free cash flow over a three-
year period, measured at constant exchange rates. Performance 
measures and targets are set annually by the Remuneration Committee.

The vesting range is 20% for Executive Directors and 25% for other 
participants for achieving minimum performance targets, up to 100% 
for achieving the maximum target level. Retesting of the performance 
measures is not permitted.  

For performance shares under the DLTIP, dividends are accrued on 

awards and are given to participants to the extent that the awards 
actually vest at the end of the performance period. Dividends are 
normally paid out in the form of shares. 

Savings plans are provided in the form of a savings-related share 
option plan. For UK employees, awards were made under the Diageo 
2010 Sharesave plan (for options granted up until 2020) and the 
Diageo 2020 Sharesave plan (for options granted from 2021).

For Republic of Ireland (ROI) based employees, awards were made 
under the Diageo 2009 Irish Sharesave Scheme (for options granted up 
until 2019) and the Diageo 2019 Irish Sharesave Scheme (for options 
granted in 2020). These are HMRC and Irish Revenue approved all-
employee savings plans.

For ROI employees, grants from 2021 and 2022 were made under 
the Diageo 2020 Sharesave plan which is not an approved plan in the 
Republic of Ireland. These plans are made available to UK and ROI 
employees who are employed on the annual results announcement 
date. Participants can save monthly, with deductions taken directly from 
net pay, for a period of 3 or 5 years. In return, employees are granted 
the option to buy Diageo shares using the savings accrued at the end of 
the relevant savings period and at a 20% discounted option price, 
which is set at the time of grant. Provided participants fulfil the terms set 
out within the relevant UK or ROI tax approved scheme rules, any gains 
from the option exercise are free from UK or ROI income tax. For the 
ROI Sharesave awards granted in 2021 and 2022, as these are not 
made under a Revenue tax approved plan, the gains from the option 
exercise are subject to ROI income tax.

For US employees, the awards are made under the Diageo plc 2017 
United States Employee Stock Purchase Plan. Employees agree to make 
regular monthly savings for a period of one year and acquire American 
Depositary Receipts (ADRs) at 15% discounted price (which is set at the 
time of grant) using their contributions at the end of the plan cycle. They 
receive the benefit of tax relief if certain conditions are satisfied. 

For the three years ended 30 June 2023, the calculation of the fair value

Other financial statements disclosures 

Introduction 
This section includes additional financial information that are either required by the relevant accounting standards or management considers these 
to be material information for shareholders. 

19. Contingent liabilities and legal proceedings

Accounting policies 
Provision is made for the anticipated settlement costs of legal or 
other disputes against the group where it is considered to be 
probable that a liability exists and a reliable estimate can be 
made of the likely outcome. Where it is possible that a settlement 
may be reached or it is not possible to make a reliable estimate 
of the estimated financial effect, appropriate disclosure is made 
but no provision created. 

Critical accounting judgements and estimates 
Judgement is necessary in assessing the likelihood that a claim 
will succeed, or a liability will arise, and an estimate to quantify 
the possible range of any settlement. Due to the inherent 
uncertainty in this evaluation process, actual losses may be 
different from the liability originally estimated. The group may be 
involved in legal proceedings in respect of which it is not 
possible to make a reliable estimate of any expected settlement. 
In such cases, appropriate disclosure is provided but no 
provision is made and no contingent liability is quantified. 

(a) Guarantees and related matters  
As of 30 June 2023, the group has no material unprovided guarantees 
or indemnities in respect of liabilities of third parties. 

(b) Acquisition of USL shares from UBHL and related 
proceedings in relation to the USL transaction 
On 4 July 2013, Diageo completed its acquisition, under a share 
purchase agreement with United Breweries (Holdings) Limited (UBHL) 
and various other sellers (the SPA), of shares representing 14.98% in 
USL, including shares representing 6.98% from UBHL. The SPA was 
signed on 9 November 2012 as part of the transaction announced by 
Diageo in relation to USL on that day (the Original USL Transaction). 
Following a series of further transactions, as of 30 June 2023, Diageo 
has a 55.88% investment in USL (excluding 2.38% owned by the USL 
Benefit Trust).  

Prior to the acquisition from UBHL on 4 July 2013, the High Court of 
Karnataka (High Court) had granted leave to UBHL under the Indian 
Companies Act 1956 (the Leave Order) to enable the sale by UBHL to 
Diageo to take place (the UBHL Share Sale) notwithstanding the 
continued existence of certain winding-up petitions that were pending 
against UBHL on the date of the SPA. At the time of the completion of 
the UBHL Share Sale, the Leave Order remained subject to review on 
appeal. However, as stated by Diageo at the time of closing, it was 
considered unlikely that any appeal process in respect of the Leave 
Order would definitively conclude on a timely basis and, accordingly, 
Diageo waived the conditionality under the SPA relating to the absence 
of insolvency proceedings in relation to UBHL and acquired the 6.98% 
stake in USL from UBHL at that time.

Following appeal and counter-appeal in respect of the Leave Order, 

this matter is now before the Supreme Court of India which has issued 
an order that the status quo be maintained with regard to the UBHL 
Share Sale pending a hearing on the matter before it. Following a 
number of adjournments, the next date for a substantive hearing is yet 
to be fixed.

In separate proceedings, the High Court passed a winding-up order 
against UBHL on 7 February 2017, and appeals filed by UBHL against 
that order have since been dismissed, initially by a division bench of the 
High Court and subsequently by the Supreme Court of India.

Diageo continues to believe that the acquisition price of INR 1,440 

per share paid to UBHL for the USL shares is fair and reasonable as 
regards UBHL, UBHL’s shareholders and UBHL’s secured and unsecured 
creditors. However, adverse results for Diageo in the proceedings 
referred to above could, absent leave or relief in other proceedings, 
ultimately result in Diageo losing title to the 6.98% stake in USL 
acquired from UBHL. Diageo believes, including by reason of its rights 
under USL’s articles of association to nominate USL’s CEO and CFO 
and the right to appoint, through USL, a majority of the directors on the 
boards of USL’s subsidiaries as well as its ability as promoter to 
nominate for appointment up to two-thirds of USL’s directors for so long 
as the chairperson of USL is an independent director, that it would 
remain in control of USL and would continue to be able to consolidate 
USL as a subsidiary for accounting purposes regardless of the outcome 
of this litigation.

There can be no certainty as to the outcome of the existing or any 
further related legal proceedings or the time frame within which they 
would be concluded. 

(c) Continuing matters relating to Dr Vijay Mallya and 
affiliates 
On 25 February 2016, Diageo and USL each announced that they had 
entered into arrangements with Dr Mallya under which he had agreed 
to resign from his position as a director and as chairman of USL and 
from his positions in USL’s subsidiaries.    

Diageo’s agreement with Dr Mallya (the February 2016 Agreement) 
provided for a payment of $75 million (£60 million) to Dr Mallya over a 
five-year period of which $40 million (£32 million) was paid on signing 
of the February 2016 Agreement with the balance being payable in 
equal instalments of $7 million (£6 million) a year over five years 
(2017-2021). All payments were subject to and conditional on Dr 
Mallya’s compliance with the agreement. The February 2016 Agreement 
also provided for the release of Dr Mallya’s personal obligations to 
indemnify Diageo Holdings Netherlands B.V. (DHN) in respect of its 
earlier liability ($141 million (£112 million)) under a backstop guarantee 
of certain borrowings of Watson Limited (Watson) (a company affiliated 
with Dr Mallya).

On account of various breaches and other provisions of agreements 

between Dr Mallya and persons connected with him and Diageo and/
or USL, Diageo did not make the five instalment payments due during 
the five-year period between 2017 and 2021. In addition, Diageo has 
also demanded that Dr Mallya repay the $40 million (£32 million) paid 
by Diageo in February 2016 and sought compensation for various losses 
incurred by the relevant members of the Diageo group.

On 16 November 2017, Diageo and other relevant members of the 

Diageo group commenced claims in the High Court of Justice in 
England and Wales (the English High Court) against Dr Mallya in 
relation to these matters. At the same time DHN also commenced 
claims in the English High Court against Dr Mallya, his son Sidhartha 
Mallya, Watson and Continental Administration Services Limited (CASL) 
(a company affiliated with Dr Mallya and understood to hold assets on 
trust for him and certain persons affiliated with him) for in excess of $142 
million (£113 million) (plus interest) in relation to Watson’s liability to DHN 
in respect of its borrowings referred to above and the breach of 
associated security documents. Dr Mallya, Sidhartha Mallya and the

relevant affiliated companies filed a defence to these claims, and Dr 
Mallya also filed a counterclaim for payment of the two instalment 
payments that had by that time been withheld as described above. 
Diageo continues to prosecute its claims and to defend the 
counterclaim. As part of these proceedings, Diageo and the other 
relevant members of its group filed an application for strike out and/or 
summary judgement in respect of certain aspects of the defence filed by 
Dr Mallya and the other defendants, including their defence in relation 
to Watson and CASL’s liability to repay DHN. The application was 
successful resulting in Watson being ordered to pay approximately $135 
million (£107 million) plus various amounts in respect of interest to DHN, 
with CASL being held liable as co-surety for 50% of any such amount 
unpaid by Watson. These amounts were, contrary to the relevant orders, 
not paid by the relevant deadlines and Watson and CASL’s remaining 
defences in the proceedings were struck out. Diageo and DHN have 
accordingly sought asset disclosure and are considering further 
enforcement steps against Watson and CASL, both in the United 
Kingdom and in other jurisdictions where they are present or hold 
assets.

A trial of the remaining elements of these claims was due to 

commence on 21 November 2022. However, on 26 July 2021 Dr Mallya 
was declared bankrupt by the English High Court pursuant to a 
bankruptcy petition presented by a consortium of Indian banks. Diageo 
and the relevant members of its group have informed the Trustee in 
Bankruptcy of their position as creditors in the bankruptcy and have 
engaged with the Trustee regarding their claims and the status of the 
current proceedings. An appeal by Dr Mallya against his bankruptcy 
(and an appeal by the bank consortium against orders made in the 
course of the bankruptcy proceedings) are pending. In light of the 
uncertainty posed by the ongoing bankruptcy proceedings, the trial of 
Diageo’s claim was initially relisted to take place in February 2024. 
However, Dr Mallya’s appeal against his bankruptcy and the banks’ 
cross appeal will not now be heard until April 2024, and thus the trial of 
Diageo’s claim has been deferred from February 2024 until after those 
appeals have been determined.

At this stage, it is not possible to assess the extent to which the 
various ongoing proceedings related to the bankruptcy will affect the 
remaining elements of the claims by Diageo and the relevant members 
of its group. 

Upon completion of an initial inquiry in April 2015 into past improper 
transactions which identified references to certain additional parties and 
matters, USL carried out an additional inquiry into these transactions 
(Additional Inquiry) which was completed in July 2016. The Additional 
Inquiry, prima facie, identified transactions indicating actual and 
potential diversion of funds from USL and its Indian and overseas 
subsidiaries to, in most cases, entities that appeared to be affiliated or 
associated with Dr Mallya. All amounts identified in the Additional 
Inquiry have been provided for or expensed in the financial statements 
of USL or its subsidiaries in the respective prior periods. USL has filed 
recovery suits against relevant parities identified pursuant to the 
Additional Inquiry.

Further, at this stage, it is not possible for the management of USL to 
estimate the financial impact on USL, if any, arising out of potential non-
compliance with applicable laws in relation to such fund diversions.

(d) Other matters in relation to USL
In respect of the Watson backstop guarantee arrangements, the 
Securities and Exchange Board of India (SEBI) issued a notice to Diageo 
on 16 June 2016 that if there is any net liability incurred by Diageo (after 
any recovery under relevant security or other arrangements, which 
matters remain pending) on account of the Watson backstop 
guarantee, such liability, if any, would be considered to be part of the 
price paid for the acquisition of USL shares under the SPA which formed 
part of the Original USL Transaction and that, in that case, additional 
equivalent payments would be required to be made to those 
shareholders (representing 0.04% of the shares in USL) who tendered in 
the open offer made as part of the Original USL Transaction. Diageo 

216

Diageo  Annual Report 2023

believes that the Watson backstop guarantee arrangements were not 
part of the price paid or agreed to be paid for any USL shares under the 
Original USL Transaction and that therefore SEBI's decision was not 
consistent with applicable law, and Diageo appealed against it before 
the Securities Appellate Tribunal, Mumbai (SAT). On 1 November 2017, 
SAT issued an order in respect of Diageo’s appeal in which, amongst 
other things, it observed that the relevant officer at SEBI had neither 
considered Diageo’s earlier reply nor provided Diageo with an 
opportunity to be heard, and accordingly directed SEBI to pass a fresh 
order after giving Diageo an opportunity to be heard. Following SAT’s 
order, Diageo made its further submissions in the matter, including at a 
personal hearing before a Deputy General Manager of SEBI. On 26 
June 2019, SEBI issued an order reiterating the directions contained in its 
previous notice dated 16 June 2016. As with the previous SEBI notice, 
Diageo believes that SEBI's latest order is not consistent with applicable 
law. Diageo appealed against this order before SAT and, after a 
hearing in March 2023, SAT allowed Diageo’s appeal on 26 July 2023. 
Accordingly, SEBI’s order dated 26 June 2019 stands quashed. Under 
applicable law, SEBI is entitled to file an appeal against SAT’s order 
before the Supreme Court of India. Therefore, pending any appeal 
which may be filed by SEBI, there can be no certainty as to its outcome 
or the timeframe within which any such appeal would be concluded.

 (e) USL’s dispute with IDBI Bank Limited  

Prior to the acquisition by Diageo of a controlling interest in USL, USL 
had prepaid a term loan of INR 6,280 million (£60 million) taken 
through IDBI Bank Limited (IDBI), an Indian bank, which was secured on 
certain fixed assets and brands of USL, as well as by a pledge of certain 
shares in USL held by the USL Benefit Trust (of which USL is the sole 
beneficiary). The maturity date of the loan was 31 March 2015. IDBI 
disputed the prepayment, following which USL filed a writ petition in 
November 2013 before the High Court of Karnataka (the High Court) 
challenging the bank’s actions. 

Following the original maturity date of the loan, USL received notices 

from IDBI seeking to recall the loan, demanding a further sum of INR 
459 million (£4 million) on account of the outstanding principal, 
accrued interest and other amounts, and also threatening to enforce the 
security in the event that USL did not make these further payments. 
Pursuant to an application filed by USL before the High Court in the writ 
proceedings, the High Court directed that, subject to USL depositing 
such further amount with the bank (which amount was duly deposited 
by USL), the bank should hold the amount in a suspense account and 
not deal with any of the secured assets including the shares until 
disposal of the original writ petition filed by USL before the High Court. 
On 27 June 2019, a single judge bench of the High Court issued an 
order dismissing the writ petition filed by USL, amongst other things, on 
the basis that the matter involved an issue of breach of contract by USL 
and was therefore not maintainable in exercise of the court’s writ 
jurisdiction. USL filed an appeal against this order before a division 
bench of the High Court, which on 30 July 2019 issued an interim order 
directing the bank to not deal with any of the secured assets until the 
next date of hearing. On 13 January 2020, the division bench of the 
High Court admitted the writ appeal and extended the interim stay. This 
appeal is currently pending. Based on the assessment of USL’s 
management supported by external legal opinions, USL continues to 
believe that it has a strong case on the merits and therefore continues to 
believe that the secured assets will be released to USL and the aforesaid 
amount of INR 459 million (£4 million) remains recoverable from IDBI.

(f) Tax
The international tax environment has seen increased scrutiny and rapid 
change over recent years bringing with it greater uncertainty for 
multinationals. Against this backdrop, Diageo has been monitoring 
developments and continues to engage transparently with the tax 
authorities in the countries where Diageo operates to ensure that the 
group manages its arrangements on a sustainable basis. 

The group operates in a large number of markets with complex tax 
and legislative regimes that are open to subjective interpretation, and 
for which tax audits can take several years to resolve. In the context of 
these operations, it is possible that tax exposures which have not yet 
materialised (including those which could arise as a result of tax 
assessments) may result in losses to the group. In the circumstances 
where tax authorities have raised assessments, challenging 
interpretations which may lead to a possible material outflow, these 
have been included as contingent liabilities. Where the potential tax 
exposures are known to us and have not been assessed, the group 
considers disclosure of such matters taking into account their size and 
nature, relevant regulatory requirements and potential prejudice of the 
future resolution or assessment thereof. 

Diageo has a large number of ongoing tax cases in Brazil and India. 

Since assessing an accurate value of contingent liabilities in these 
markets requires a high degree of judgement, contingent liabilities are 
disclosed on the basis of the current known possible exposure from tax 
assessment values. While not all of these cases are individually 
significant, the current aggregate known possible exposure from tax 
assessment values is up to approximately £616 million for Brazil and up 
to approximately £90 million for India. The group believes that the 
likelihood that the tax authorities will ultimately prevail is lower than 
probable but higher than remote. Due to the fiscal environment in Brazil 
and in India, the possibility of further tax assessments related to the 
same matters cannot be ruled out and the judicial processes may take 
extended periods to conclude. Based on its current assessment, Diageo 
believes that no provision is required in respect of these issues. 

Payments were made under protest in India in respect of the periods 

1 April 2006 to 31 March 2019 in relation to tax assessments where the 
risk is considered to be remote or possible. These payments have to be 
made in order to be able to challenge the assessments and as such 
have been recognised as a receivable in the group's balance sheet. The 
total amount of payments under protest recognised as a receivable as 
at 30 June 2023 is £116 million (corporate tax payments of £104 million 
and indirect tax payments of £12 million). 

(g) Other disputes
On 31 May 2023, a complaint against Diageo North America, Inc (DNA) 
was filed in the Supreme Court of New York by Combs Wine and Spirits 
LLC (an entity associated with Mr Sean Combs) alleging, inter alia, 
breach of contract in respect of a joint venture agreement related to 
DeLeón tequila. DNA has also served notice of material breaches and 
termination to Mr Combs and his relevant associated entities of certain 
agreements related to services provided by Mr Combs and these 
entities in respect of Cîroc, and notice of material breaches and an 
intent to arbitrate in respect of the DeLeón joint venture agreement. 
Diageo categorically denies the allegations that have been made by Mr 
Combs and his associated parties in the complaint and will defend itself 
vigorously. Diageo will refrain from making any further disclosures given 
the inherent uncertainties of these matters and the prejudicial nature 
any such disclosures may have on the potential outcomes related 
thereto or other associated matters.

(h) Other
The group has extensive international operations and routinely makes 
judgements on a range of legal, customs and tax matters which are 
incidental to the group's operations. Some of these judgements are or 
may become the subject of challenges and involve proceedings, the 
outcome of which cannot be foreseen. In particular, the group is 
currently a defendant in various customs proceedings that challenge 
the declared customs value of products imported by certain Diageo 
companies. Diageo continues to defend its position vigorously in these 
proceedings.  

Save as disclosed above, neither Diageo, nor any member of the 

Diageo group, is or has been engaged in, nor (so far as Diageo is 
aware) is there pending or threatened by or against it, any legal or 

arbitration proceedings which may have a significant effect on the 
financial position of the Diageo group.

20. Commitments

recognised as lease liabilities at 30 June 2023, are estimated at £11 
million (2022 – £11 million; 2021 – £132 million).

21. Related party transactions 
Transactions between the group and its related parties are made on 
terms equivalent to those that prevail in arm’s length transactions.

Non-Executive Directors do not receive share-based payments or post 
employment benefits. 

There were no transactions with these related parties during the year 

ended 30 June 2023 on terms other than those that prevail in arm’s 
length transactions. 

(d) Pension plans 
In October 2022, Diageo plc provided an interim credit facility to 
Diageo Pension Trust Limited, consisting of £850 million for the Diageo 
Pension Scheme, to support temporary liquidity challenges until 29 
December 2022. In December 2022, the maturity date was extended to 
29 June 2023. The facility amount was reduced on 22 May 2023 to 
£350 million and on 14 June 2023 the maturity date was extended to 11 
October 2023. The facility was subsequently cancelled on 25 July 2023.

The Diageo pension plans are recharged with the cost of 

administration services provided by the group to the pension plans and 
with professional fees paid by the group on behalf of the pension plans. 
The total amount recharged for the year was £0.1 million (2022 – £0.1 
million; 2021 – £0.1 million).

23. Post balance sheet events 
Starting 1 July 2023, in line with reporting requirements the functional currency of Diageo plc has changed from sterling to US dollar which is applied 
prospectively. This is because the group's share of net sales and expenses in the US and other countries whose currencies correlate closely with the 
US dollar has been increasing over the years, and that trend is expected to continue in line with the group's strategic focus. Diageo has also decided 
to change its presentation currency to US dollar with effect from 1 July 2023, applied retrospectively, as it believes that this change will provide better 
alignment of the reporting of performance with its business exposures.

Diageo will propose adopting new Articles of Association (New Articles) at the AGM to be held on 28 September 2023 which reflects the change 

in the functional currency of Diageo plc and presentation currency of the group from sterling to US dollar. The New Articles shall, among other 
things, empower the Board to declare and/or pay dividends in any currency or currencies and enable the Board to make provisions for 
shareholders to receive dividends in a different currency to the currency in which dividends were declared. Subject to the approval of the New 
Articles by shareholders at the AGM and commencing with the interim dividend that is expected to be declared in January 2024, Diageo’s future 
dividends will be declared in US dollar. Holders of ordinary shares will continue to receive their dividends in sterling but will have the option to elect 
to receive it in US dollar. Holders of ADRs will continue to receive dividends in US dollar.

On 31 July 2023, the Board approved plans for a further return of capital programme of $1.0 billion to shareholders.

The accompanying notes are an integral part of these parent company financial statements.

1. Accounting policies of the company
Basis of preparation
The financial statements of Diageo plc (the company) are prepared in 
accordance with Financial Reporting Standard 101 Reduced Disclosure 
Framework (FRS 101).

In preparing these financial statements, the company applies the 
recognition, measurement, and disclosure requirements of International 
Financial Reporting Standards as adopted by the UK (IFRS), but makes 
amendments where necessary in order to comply with the Companies 
Act 2006 and has excluded certain information as permitted by FRS 101. 
The financial statements are prepared on a going concern basis 

under the historical cost convention, except for certain financial 
instruments and post employment benefits which are measured and 
stated at their fair value.

By virtue of section 408 of the Companies Act 2006, the company is 
exempt from presenting an income statement and disclosing employee 
numbers and staff costs. The company has taken advantage of the 
exemption under FRS 101 from preparing a cash flow statement and 
related notes, disclosures in respect of transactions and the capital 
management of wholly owned subsidiaries, the effects of new but not 
yet effective IFRSs and disclosures in respect of the compensation of key 
management personnel. As the consolidated financial statements of 
Diageo plc include equivalent disclosures, the company has also utilised 
exemptions available under FRS 101 from disclosing IFRS 2 Share-based 
Payment in respect of group settled share-based payments, disclosures 
required by IFRS 7 Financial Instruments Disclosures and by IFRS 13 Fair 
Value Measurement. 

Investments in subsidiaries
Investments in subsidiaries are stated at historical cost less impairment 
provisions for any permanent decrease in value. The carrying amounts 
of the company’s investments are reviewed at each reporting date to 
determine whether there is an indication of impairment. If such an 
indication exists, then the asset’s recoverable amount is estimated. 
Losses are recognised in the statement of comprehensive income and 
reflected in an allowance against the carrying value. Where an event 
results in the asset’s recoverable amount being higher than the 
previously impaired carrying value, the original impairment may be 
reversed through the statement of comprehensive income in subsequent 
periods.

Dividends
Dividends payable and dividends receivable are recognised in the 
financial statements in the year in which they are approved.

Share-based payments – employee benefits
The company’s accounting policy for share-based payments is the 
same as set out in note 18 to the consolidated financial statements. 
Where the company grants options over its own shares to the 
employees of its subsidiaries, it generally recharges the cost to the 
relevant group company. Where the amount is not recharged, the value 
of the options is recognised as a capital contribution to the subsidiaries 
and increases the cost of investment.

Pensions and other post employment benefits
The company’s accounting policy for post employment benefits is the 
same as set out in note 14 to the consolidated financial statements. The 
company acts as sponsor of all UK post employment plans for the 
benefit of employees and former employees throughout the group. 
There is no contractual agreement or stated policy for charging the net 
defined benefit costs for the plan measured in accordance with FRS 101, 
to other group companies whose employees participate in these group 
wide plans. However, recharges to other group companies are made 
on a funding basis and are credited against post employment service 
costs to the extent they are in respect of current service. The fair value of 
the plans’ assets less the present value of the plans’ liabilities are 
disclosed as a net asset or net liability on the company’s balance sheet 
as it is deemed to be the legal sponsor of these plans. The net income 
charge/credit reflects the change in the defined benefit obligation, 
resulting from service in the current year, benefit changes, curtailments 
and settlements. Past service costs are recognised in income. The net 
interest cost is calculated by applying the discount rate to the net 
balance of the defined benefit obligation and the fair value of the plan 
assets and is included in the income statement. Any differences due to 
changes in assumptions or experience are recognised in other 
comprehensive income.

Provisions
The company’s accounting policy for provisions is the same as set out in 
note 15 to the consolidated financial statements.

Taxation
The company’s accounting policy for taxation is the same as set out in 
note 7 to the consolidated financial statements.

Financial assets and liabilities
Financial assets and liabilities are initially recorded at fair value 
including, where permitted by IFRS 9, any directly attributable 
transaction costs. For those financial assets that are not subsequently 
held at fair value, the company assesses whether there is evidence of 
impairment at each balance sheet date. The company classifies its 
financial assets and liabilities into the following categories: financial 
assets and liabilities at amortised cost, financial assets and liabilities at 
fair value through income statement and financial assets at fair value 
through other comprehensive income. Where financial assets or 
liabilities are eligible to be carried at either amortised cost or fair value, 
the company does not apply the fair value option.

Amounts owed by group undertakings are initially measured at fair 
value and are subsequently reported at amortised cost. Non-interest 
bearing trade receivables are stated at their nominal value as they are 
due on demand. Allowances for expected credit losses are made based 
on the risk of non-payment, taking into account ageing, previous 
experience, economic conditions and forward-looking data. Such 
allowances are measured as either 12-month expected credit losses or 
lifetime expected credit losses depending on changes in the credit 
quality of the counterparty. Expected credit loss is immaterial for 
amounts owed by group undertakings.

Amounts owed to group undertakings are initially measured at fair 
value and are subsequently reported at amortised cost. Non-interest 
bearing trade payables are stated at their nominal value as they are 
due on demand. For a number of loans owed to other group 
companies, the company has a contractual right to defer payment by 
one year and one day and therefore these amounts are disclosed as 
non-current liabilities.

4. Financial assets and liabilities
Other financial assets and liabilities are recorded at fair value through 
income statement and comprise the fair value of interest rate swaps 
and cross currency interest rate swaps with subsidiary undertakings, 
where the company acts as an intermediary between group companies, 
therefore it is not expected that there will be any net impact on future 
cash flows. 

Amounts owed by and to group undertakings, trade and other 
receivables and trade and other payables are measured at amortised 
cost. 

Amounts owed by and to group undertakings are interest bearing 

and unsecured. For a majority of the loans owed to other group 
companies, the company has a contractual right to defer payment by 
one year and one day and they are therefore classified as non-current

Additional estimates have been applied by management regarding 

Recognised in income statement

FINANCIAL STATEMENTS  contin ued

Financial guarantee contract liabilities
Financial guarantee contract liabilities are measured initially at their fair 
values. These liabilities are subsequently measured at the higher of the 
amount determined under IAS 37 and the amount initially recognised 
(fair value) less where appropriate, cumulative amortisation of the initial 
amount recognised.
Judgements in applying accounting policies and key 
sources of estimation uncertainty 
The preparation of financial statements requires the directors to make 
estimates and assumptions that affect the reported amounts of assets 
and liabilities, the disclosure of contingent assets and liabilities at the 
date of the financial statements, and the reported amounts of revenues 
and expenses during the year. Actual results could differ from those 
estimates.

The critical accounting policies, which the directors consider are of 

greater complexity and/or particularly subject to the exercise of 
estimates and judgements, are the same as those disclosed in note 1 to 
the consolidated financial statements in respect of taxation, post 
employment benefits, contingent liabilities and legal proceedings. 
A critical accounting estimate, specific to the company is the 

assessment of the recoverable amount of the investments in 
subsidiaries. Impairment reviews are carried out to ensure that the value 
of the investments in subsidiaries are not carried at above their 
recoverable amounts. The tests are dependent on management’s 
estimates in respect of the forecasting of future cash flows, the discount 
rates applicable to the future cash flows and expected growth rates. 
Such estimates and judgements are subject to change as a result of 
changing economic conditions and actual cash flows may differ from 
forecasts.

the potential financial impacts of increasing inflationary pressures. 
Details are set out in note 9 to the consolidated financial statements.

2. Income statement
Note 3 to the consolidated financial statements provides details of the 
remuneration of the company’s auditor for the group.

Information on Directors’ emoluments, share and other interests, 

transactions and pension entitlements is included in the Directors’

The company’s commitment to the UK Thalidomide Trust is discounted 
and will be utilised over the period of the commitment up to 2037.
At 30 June 2023, £12 million (2022 – £11 million) of provision is 

current and £149 million (2022 – £158 million) is non-current.

The company has also provided irrevocable guarantees relating to 

the liabilities of certain of its Dutch subsidiaries. The company has 
assessed that the likelihood of these guarantees being called is remote. 
The Directors do not expect the company to be liable for any legal 
obligation in respect of these financial guarantee agreements, and they 
have been recognised at nil fair value.

The company issues letter of comfort to provide sufficient funds to 

directly owned subsidiary undertakings as and when required.

9. Shareholders’ funds
(a) Merger reserve 
On the acquisition of a business, or of an interest in an associate, fair 
values, reflecting conditions at the date of acquisition, are attributed to 
the net assets acquired. Where merger relief is applicable under the UK 
Companies Acts, the difference between the fair value of the business 
acquired and the nominal value of shares issued as purchase 
consideration is treated as a merger reserve.

(b) Own shares
At 30 June 2023, own shares comprised 3 million ordinary shares held 
by employee share trusts (2022 – 2 million; 2021 – 2 million) and 213 
million ordinary shares repurchased and held as treasury shares (2022 – 
217 million; 2021 –221 million).

During the year ended 30 June 2023, the group purchased 

38 million ordinary shares (2022 – 61 million; 2021 – 3 million), 
representing approximately 1.5% of the issued ordinary share capital 
(2022 – 2.4%; 2021 – 0.1%) at an average price of 3616 pence per 
share, and an aggregate cost of £1,381 million (including £13 million of 
transaction costs) (2022 – 3709 pence per share, and an aggregate 
cost of £2,284 million, including £16 million of transaction costs; 2021 – 
3407 pence per share, and an aggregate cost of £109 million, including 
£1 million of transaction costs) under the share buyback programme. 
The shares purchased under the share buyback programmes were 
cancelled. 

Information on movements in own shares is provided in note 18(c) to 

the consolidated financial statements.

(c) Retained earnings
£7,236 million (2022 – £7,672 million) of retained earnings is available 
for the payment of dividends or purchases of own shares. Determining 
the company’s reserves available for distribution is complex and 
requires, in some instances, the application of judgement. The company 
has determined what is realised and unrealised profits in accordance 
with the Companies Act 2006 and the guidance included in ICAEW 
Technical Release TECH 02/17BL ‘Guidance on realised and 
distributable profits under the Companies Act 2006’. The company’s 
reserves available for distribution include adjustments to retained 
earnings in respect of the unrealised portion of the dividend in specie 
received by the company, post employment benefit surpluses and 
share-based payment charges capitalised to investments.

11. Post balance sheet events 
Starting 1 July 2023, in line with reporting requirements the functional currency of Diageo plc has changed from sterling to US dollar which is applied 
prospectively. This is because the group's share of net sales and expenses in the US and other countries whose currencies correlate closely with the 
US dollar has been increasing over the years, and that trend is expected to continue in line with the group's strategic focus. The change in functional 
currency is not expected to significantly impact Diageo plc’s retained earnings that are available for the payment of dividends or purchases of own 
shares. Diageo has also decided to change its presentation currency to US dollar with effect from 1 July 2023, applied retrospectively, as it believes 
that this change will provide better alignment of the reporting of performance with its business exposures.

On 31 July 2023, the Board approved plans for a further return of capital programme of $1.0 billion to shareholders.

Unaudited financial information

1. Definitions and reconciliation of non-GAAP measures to GAAP measures

Diageo’s strategic planning process is based on certain non-GAAP 
measures, including organic movements. These non-GAAP measures 
are chosen for planning and reporting, and some of them are used for 
incentive purposes. The group’s management believes that these 
measures provide valuable additional information for users of the 
financial statements in understanding the group’s performance. These 
non-GAAP measures should be viewed as complementary to, and not 
replacements for, the comparable GAAP measures and reported 
movements therein.

It is not possible to reconcile the forecast tax rate before exceptional 
items, forecast organic net sales growth and forecast organic operating 
profit growth to the most comparable GAAP measure as it is not 
possible to predict, without unreasonable effort, with reasonable 
certainty, the future impact of changes in exchange rates, acquisitions 
and disposals and potential exceptional items. 

Volume 
Volume is a performance indicator that is measured on an equivalent 
units basis to nine-litre cases of spirits. An equivalent unit represents 
one nine-litre case of spirits, which is approximately 272 servings. A 
serving comprises 33ml of spirits, 165ml of wine, or 330ml of ready to 
drink or beer. Therefore, to convert volume of products other than 
spirits to equivalent units, the following guide has been used: beer in 
hectolitres, divide by 0.9; wine in nine-litre cases, divide by five; ready 
to drink and certain pre-mixed products that are classified as ready to 
drink in nine-litre cases, divide by ten. 

Organic movements 
Organic information is presented using sterling amounts on a constant 
currency basis excluding the impact of exceptional items, certain fair 
value remeasurement, hyperinflation and acquisitions and disposals. 
Organic measures enable users to focus on the performance of the 
business which is common to both years and which represents those 
measures that local managers are most directly able to influence. 

Calculation of organic movements 
The organic movement percentage is the amount in the row titled 
‘Organic movement’ in the tables below, expressed as a percentage of 
the relevant absolute amount in the row titled ‘2022 adjusted’. Organic 
operating margin is calculated by dividing operating profit before 
exceptional items by net sales after excluding the impact of exchange 
rate movements, certain fair value remeasurements, hyperinflation and 
acquisitions and disposals.

(a) Exchange rates 
Exchange in the organic movement calculation reflects the adjustment 
to recalculate the reported results as if they had been generated at the 
prior period weighted average exchange rates.
Exchange impacts in respect of the external hedging of intergroup 
sales by the markets in a currency other than their functional currency 
and the intergroup recharging of services are also translated at prior 
period weighted average exchange rates and are allocated to the 
geographical segment to which they relate. Residual exchange 
impacts are reported as part of the Corporate segment. Results from 
hyperinflationary economies are translated at forward-looking rates.

(b) Acquisitions and disposals  
For acquisitions in the current period, the post-acquisition results are 
excluded from the organic movement calculations. For acquisitions in 
the prior period, post-acquisition results are included in full in the prior 
period but are included in the organic movement calculation from the 
anniversary of the acquisition date in the current period. The acquisition 
row also eliminates the impact of transaction costs that have been 
charged to operating profit in the current or prior period in respect of 
acquisitions that, in management’s judgement, are expected to be 
completed. 

Where a business, brand, brand distribution right or agency 

agreement was disposed of or terminated in the reporting period, the 
group, in the organic movement calculations, excludes the results for 
that business from the current and prior period. In the calculation of 
operating profit, the overheads included in disposals are only those 
directly attributable to the businesses disposed of, and do not result 
from subjective judgements of management.

(c) Exceptional items 
Exceptional items are those that in management’s judgement need to 
be disclosed separately. Such items are included within the income 
statement caption to which they relate, and are excluded from the 
organic movement calculations. Management believes that that 
separate disclosure of exceptional items and the classification between 
operating and non-operating items further helps investors to 
understand the performance of the group. Changes in estimates and 
reversals in relation to items previously recognised as exceptional are 
presented consistently as exceptional in the current year. 

Exceptional operating items are those that are considered to be 
material and unusual or non-recurring in nature and are part of the 
operating activities of the group, such as one-off global restructuring 
programmes which can be multi-year, impairment of intangible assets 
and fixed assets, indirect tax settlements, property disposals and 
changes in post employment plans. 

Gains and losses on the sale or directly attributable to a prospective 

sale of businesses, brands or distribution rights, step up gains and 
losses that arise when an investment becomes an associate or an 
associate becomes a subsidiary and other material, unusual non-
recurring items that are not in respect of the production, marketing and 
distribution of premium drinks, are disclosed as exceptional non-
operating items below operating profit in the income statement. 

Exceptional current and deferred tax items comprise material and 
unusual or non-recurring items that impact taxation. Examples include 
direct tax provisions and settlements in respect of prior years and the 
remeasurement of deferred tax assets and liabilities following tax rate 
changes.

(d) Fair value remeasurement 
Fair value remeasurement in the organic movement calculation reflects 
an adjustment to eliminate the impact of fair value changes in 
biological assets, earn-out arrangements that are accounted for as 
remuneration and fair value changes relating to contingent 
consideration liabilities and equity options that arose on acquisitions 
recognised in the income statement.

Growth on a constant basis
Growth on a constant basis is a measure used by the group to 
understand the trends of the business and its recovery towards pre-
Covid-19 performance.

2019 to 2023 growth on a constant basis for volume, sales, net 
sales and operating profit before exceptional items is calculated by 
adding up the respective periods’ organic movement in the row titled 
‘Organic movement’ in the tables below, expressed as a percentage 
of the relevant absolute amount in the row titled '2019 adjusted’. The 
most comparable GAAP financial measure is '2019 to 2023 reported 
movement %' in the tables below which is calculated by combining 
the reported movements for the respective periods, expressed as a 
percentage of the 2019 reported amount.

Adjustment in respect of hyperinflation 
The group's experience is that hyperinflationary conditions result in 
price increases that include both normal pricing actions reflecting 
changes in demand, commodity and other input costs or 

considerations to drive commercial competitiveness, as well as 
hyperinflationary elements and that for the calculation of organic 
movements, the distortion from hyperinflationary elements should be 
excluded.

Cumulative inflation over 100% (2% per month compounded) 
over three years is one of the key indicators within IAS 29 to assess 
whether an economy is deemed to be hyperinflationary. As a result, 
the definition of 'Organic movements' includes price growth in 
markets deemed to be hyperinflationary economies, up to a 
maximum of 2% per month while also being on a constant currency 
basis. Corresponding adjustments have been made to all income 
statement related lines in the organic movement calculations. 

In the tables presenting the calculation of organic movements, 
'hyperinflation' is included as a reconciling item between reported 
and organic movements and that also includes the relevant IAS 29 
adjustments.

The impact of movements in exchange rates on reported figures for operating profit was principally in respect of the favourable exchange impact of the strengthening of the US dollar 
and Mexican peso against the sterling, partially offset by the weakening of the Nigerian naira, Ghanaian cedi and the Turkish lira. 

(2)  Acquisitions and disposals that had an effect on volume, sales, net sales, marketing and operating profit in the year ended 30 June 2023, are detailed on page 236.
(3)  Organic operating margin calculated by dividing Operating profit before exceptional items by net sales.
