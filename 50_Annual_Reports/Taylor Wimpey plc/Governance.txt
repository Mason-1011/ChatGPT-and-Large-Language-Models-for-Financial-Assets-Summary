Section 172 (1) statement

How the Board considered 
stakeholders during the year

Our Directors are bound by their duties under 
the Companies Act 2006 (the Act) to promote the 
success of the Company for the benefit of our 
shareholders as a whole, having regard to our 
other key stakeholders. 

We believe that in order to progress our strategy 
and achieve long term sustainable success, the 
Board must consider all stakeholders relevant to a 
decision and satisfy themselves that any decision 
upholds our culture of ‘doing the right thing’. 

Our values, as set out on page 30, are key to 
how we do business and are closely aligned to the 
matters the Directors must consider as part of their 
Section 172 duties. 

The Board recognises that stakeholder engagement 
is essential to understand what matters most to 
our stakeholders and the likely impact of any key 
decisions. We have a long history of engaging with 
all of our stakeholders and the Board continues to 
highly value the feedback that this engagement 
provides. Details of how we engaged with our 
different groups of stakeholders during 2023 and 
how this informed what the Board considers 
matters to them most can be found on pages 100 
to 103.

The Board receives an update from the Executive 
Directors at each Board meeting which details any 
substantial engagement since the last meeting. 

In addition, there were standing agenda items at 
each meeting to ensure that the Board received 
relevant updates on all of our key stakeholders; 
such as the regular reports from Customer Service, 
HR, Investor Relations and the Divisional Chairs. 
The Board had an annual schedule of ‘teach-in’ 
sessions with our key Heads of Function (such as 
Sales and Marketing, Land and Planning, Customer 
Service, Investor Relations, Sustainability and Supply 
Chain) where they received in-depth updates about 
each group of stakeholders. In addition, the Board 
regularly engaged directly with our investors and 
employees, and further information around the 
direct engagement that took place in 2023 can be 
found on pages 101 and 103. 

The Board is aware that in some situations, 
stakeholders’ interests will be conflicted and they 
may have to prioritise interests. The Board, led 
by the Chair, ensures that as part of its decision 
making process, the Directors assess the impact 
of the decision on our stakeholders and the likely 
consequences of any decision in the long term. 
The table to the right shows how the Board 
approaches its decision making. 

On the next page, we have set out examples of 
key decisions made by the Board and provided 
further details about the decision making process.

Setting our culture, values and strategy

The Board sets our strategic direction, culture and values; and these are key 
to how we do business and how we achieve our purpose.

Diverse set of skills, knowledge and experience

The Directors collectively have a diverse set of skills, knowledge, experience 
and stakeholder expertise which assists the Board in making decisions. 
This contributes to their ability to make well informed decisions which 
promote our long term sustainable success for all stakeholders.

As part of a Director’s induction, they receive a detailed briefing on their 
duties as a Director.

Board information

The Board receives comprehensive papers from Management which provide 
details on the likely long term impact of a decision and how stakeholders 
have been considered in the development of the proposal, including any 
relevant engagement.

The Board also has an annual schedule of ‘teach-ins’ where the Heads of 
Functions deliver updates on key activities during the year which feeds into 
the decision making process.

Board discussion and decision

As part of its discussion, the Board provides rigorous evaluation, risk 
management and challenge to ensure a decision promotes long term 
sustainable success. The Board uses the stakeholder engagement 
summarised on pages 100 to 103 to inform their decision making process.

Monitoring

The Board receives regular updates on key decisions and the actions taken 
in respect of them.

This is done through regular reports submitted by Management to each 
Board meeting and verbal updates as necessary.

Your Board is committed 
to high governance standards

We firmly believe that good 
corporate governance is 
essential to enable us to 
deliver our purpose for all of 
our stakeholders and remains 
a top priority for the Board.

The Company is committed to the 
principles of the 2018 UK Corporate

The Company has generally sought to

We are reviewing the recent

and to what extent we can and should 
comply in advance of its formal

This will be reported on more fully

Taylor Wimpey plc Annual Report and Accounts 2023Strategic reportDirectors’ reportFinancial statementsShareholder informationDear Shareholder

I am pleased to present the Corporate Governance 
Report for 2023, which sets out the key areas 
considered by the Board and its Committees 
during the year and in preparation for 2024.

Despite challenging market conditions during 2023, 
the Company maintained its progress and 
underpinned this with a focus on strong 
governance, which I have been proud to lead since 
my appointment as Chair in April 2023.

During 2023 and into 2024, the Board has carefully 
monitored and reviewed progress and performance 
against our strategic cornerstones whilst paying 
close attention to the further development of our 
initiatives in the areas of stakeholder engagement; 
championing the ‘employee voice’ in the Boardroom; 
progressing towards our ESG targets; improving 
diversity and inclusivity throughout the Group as 
well as at senior levels; and structuring the Board 
and its discussions to give additional time 
to consideration of these key areas.

This report seeks to explain how the Board ensures 
that the progress we are making in our operations 
is married to our continuing belief that business 
should be carried on in a responsible and compliant 
manner, which can be summed up as ‘doing the 
right thing’ by all of our stakeholders.

Key to this approach is the culture within which 
we approach our business, to ensure that we have 
effective systems and processes in place to monitor 
how we do business, including actively recognising and 
managing risks arising from our operations and the 
macroeconomic conditions within which we operate, 
and continuing to strive for continuous improvement 
and innovation in our business practices.

That ensures that business decisions are made in 
the right way, as described more fully on page 100 
of this Corporate Governance Report.

Stakeholder engagement

Our Board continues to place the interest of 
stakeholders at the forefront of decision making. 
We believe this is the correct way in which to 
progress our strategy and deliver sustainable, long 
term success. Further details on how we, as a 
Board, have fulfilled our duties under section 172(1) 
of the Companies Act 2006, to consider 
all stakeholders relevant to a decision and satisfy 
ourselves that each decision is in line with our 
business culture, is set out on page 101 and an 
explanation as to how we engaged with 
our different stakeholders during 2023 can be 
found on pages 84 to 88.

Building strong governance

I look forward to 
maintaining our strong 
relationships with both 
shareholders and key 
stakeholders.”

Strategic reportDirectors’ reportFinancial statementsShareholder informationPreparing for planned financial 
governance changes

A significant area of focus during 2023 was on the 
FRC consultation around proposed changes to the 
Code to introduce the principles designed to meet 
the Government’s consultation on ‘Restoring Trust 
in Audit and Corporate Governance’. Details on 
how we have prepared to meet the new 
compliance requirements are set out in the 
Audit Committee Report on page 120.

The Board will continue to ensure that all applicable 
laws and regulations are complied with, and we 
remain confident that the business continues to 
operate in a controlled and well-managed way.

Building strong governance continued

We continued our practice of engaging with our 
shareholders in a proactive manner, holding 119 
meetings with institutional investors, including 10 
visits to our operations, to discuss a variety of key 
themes, including results and performance, current 
trading, market backdrop and outlook, responding 
to market conditions, upcoming changes to 
regulation and ESG matters. We held 10 site visits 
with both analysts and investors including visits to 
our net zero ready prototype homes in Sudbury. 
(Read more about our prototype homes on page 36.) 
We also held a number of management meetings 
for analysts of the 17 investment brokers covering 
the sector on behalf of investors.

Employee voice

When I was appointed Chair in April 2023, my 
previous role as the Board’s Employee Champion 
was passed to Mark Castle. I am delighted with 
the way he has further developed the ongoing 
consultation and communication channels between 
the Board and the Group’s employees ensuring that 
their views are properly explained and championed 
to the Board, and taken into account, when making 
decisions that could affect them.

In addition to these ongoing communication and 
consultation channels, the Non Executive Directors 
visited 11 regional businesses and 18 sites across 
the country and took these opportunities to see our 
culture in action as evidenced by their interactions 
with employees during these visits.

Further information on shareholder and employee 
engagement during the year can be found on 
pages 101 to 103

Focused on ESG

Our ESG initiatives were a constant feature of 
Board discussions during 2023 and the agendas 
of Board and Board Committee meetings were 
reorganised during the year in order to give these a 
more prominent position in Directors’ deliberations 
at meetings.

Progress against our ESG strategy, with 
independently verified science based targets and 
performance reviews, is carefully monitored by 
the Board, which ensures that these remain 
aligned to our purpose of ensuring that we play 
our part in creating long term sustainable value 
for our stakeholders.

During the year, the Board received regular reports 
on the progress of our Net Zero Transition Plan. 
Further information on the Board’s actions during 
2023 to drive this element of our strategy are set 
out on pages 7 and 36.

Further developing equality, diversity 
and inclusion

Equality, diversity and inclusion remain key priorities 
for the Board. The Nomination and Governance 
Committee received an update during the year on 
progress made towards achieving our Equality, 
Diversity and Inclusion aspirations and increasingly 
becoming a more diverse and inclusive employer, 
where everyone is welcome.

Further details on progress made during 2023 and our 
plans for 2024 can be found on page 106

Taylor Wimpey plc Annual Report and Accounts 2023Strategic reportDirectors’ reportFinancial statementsShareholder informationThe Board monitors a number of cultural indicators, 
including information and impressions gained 
during the interaction with executives and other 
employees at all levels of the Company, during 
Board presentations and visits to Company offices 
and operations by the Board and individual Directors.

More details of these indicators and the insight gained 
from them, appear on page 105

Conclusion

Finally, I would like to again take this opportunity 
to thank all of my Board colleagues, the Group 
Management Team and all of our employees 
across the business, for their dedication, loyalty 
and hard work which has underpinned our strong 
performance for 2023 in tough conditions, and our 
prospects for 2024.

Robert Noel
Chair

I believe the Company’s culture remains strong and 
the Board will continue to consider a wide range of 
indicators during 2024 to ensure that this continues 
to be the case.

Annual General Meeting

This year’s Annual General Meeting (AGM) will 
take place in person in the Gerrards Suite at the 
Crowne Plaza Hotel in Gerrards Cross on Tuesday 
23 April 2024 at 10:30am. I hope you will be able 
to attend and the Board looks forward to meeting 
shareholders and to hearing their views; and 
answering any questions that you may have. 
We are pleased to provide an electronic facility for 
shareholders who are unable to attend the AGM 
in person, so they may follow remotely and submit 
questions to the Board on the business of the 
meeting should they wish to do so. More details 
of the AGM and the business to be considered, 
are set out on pages 227 to 238.

Building strong governance continued

Board composition

After a period of transition on the Board during 
2022, this year saw a settled Board focusing 
on driving the strategy and progressing key 
governance initiatives described in this letter and 
in more detail throughout this report.

The only changes to the Board during the year 
were to the roles of individual Directors:

On 27 April 2023 I succeeded Irene Dorner as 
Chair; Humphrey Singer succeeded me as 
Senior Independent Director; and Mark Castle 
took over my former role as the Board’s Employee 
Champion. Irene kindly agreed to remain as a 
Non Executive Director and continues to bring her 
deep commercial experience and strong cultural 
principles to the Board.

Appropriate changes were also made at that time 
to the composition of certain Board Committees, 
which remain in full compliance with the Code.

Culture

The key to maintaining strong governance 
principles across an organisation is having 
a culture of doing the right thing. The Board 
recognises the importance of having a strong 
culture and appropriate values embedded 
throughout the organisation and it is responsible 
for defining and setting the culture from the top 
and leading by example.

there are processes in place to convene additional 
Board meetings when considered necessary.

There was full attendance at all Board meetings, 
except Irene Dorner who was not available for 
two meetings. Prior to each meeting, Irene’s views 
on the meeting agenda items were sought and 
subsequently shared with the other Board 
members during the meeting. Following the 
meeting, Irene was briefed on the business of the 
meeting and any decisions taken.

Matters considered and approved at 
Board meetings during 2023

Board meeting agendas are derived from the 
Board’s annual plan which is approved at the end  
of each year and sets out the topics expected to  
be discussed during the following year. The Chair, 
Chief Executive and Company Secretary meet in 
advance of each Board meeting to discuss and 
agree the agenda for the next meeting, as well as  
to discuss progress made on actions arising from 
the previous meeting. Any additional topics are  
then added to the agenda.

During 2023, the Board considered a number of 
topics regularly, including:

• Health, safety and environment reports

Annual General Meeting (AGM)

Shareholder engagement

The Board actively seeks and encourages 
engagement with investors, including its major 
institutional shareholders and shareholder 
representative bodies. During 2023, the Company 
has continued to engage with shareholders in a 
proactive manner.

The charts below set out the number of meetings 
held with shareholders by the Chair, Executive 
Directors, the GMT and our Investor Relations 
team. These meetings include one-to-one 
meetings, group and conference meetings.

Irene Dorner, prior to stepping down as Chair on 
27 April 2023, and Robert Noel, following his 
appointment as Chair on that date, held a total of 
three meetings with key institutional shareholders 
representing c.5% of our issued share capital.

Key themes discussed at those meetings were our 
results and performance, current trading, market 
backdrop and outlook, responding to market 
conditions, upcoming changes to regulation and 
ESG matters.

Number of shareholder meetings in 2023

Investor relations programme

We operate a structured investor relations 
programme, based around formal announcements 
and publication of the full year and half year results. 
The Board is kept regularly apprised of the investor 
relations programme and receives a detailed report 
at each meeting, including specific consideration of 
investor feedback following key engagements.

Our corporate brokers also attend Board meetings 
as required to give their perspective on institutional 
shareholder sentiment.

Remuneration consultation

During 2023 Jitesh Gadhia, in his capacity as 
Chair of the Remuneration Committee, wrote to our 
major institutional shareholders to explain, and seek 
feedback on the Remuneration Committee’s 
proposals for applying the Remuneration Policy 
adopted by shareholders at the 2023 AGM.

We look forward to engaging with our retail 
shareholders at the AGM, which will again be held 
in person. We are pleased to again provide an 
audiocast facility for shareholders who are unable 
to attend the AGM in person, so they may follow 
proceedings remotely and submit questions to the 
Board on the business of the meeting should they 
wish to do so. Shareholders are also invited to 
submit questions via email in advance of the AGM, 
which will be answered during the meeting itself.

Employee champion

Informal engagement sessions

The Employee Champion is responsible for 
championing the ‘employee voice’ in the 
boardroom and strengthening the link between 
the Board and employees.

The Board’s Employee Champion is Mark Castle, 
who took the position when the previous 
Champion, Robert Noel, was appointed Chair 
in April 2023. Mark regularly engages with the 
workforce to gather their views through a variety 
of formal and informal channels (as set out in the 
diagram opposite). As part of this engagement, 
Mark identifies any areas of concern and feeds 
these back to the Board to consider.

Over 20,000 individual comments were reviewed 
and the key themes and trends were addressed. 
The next page explains five matters raised by 
employees during employee engagement sessions, 
actions taken in response to those matters and 
the outcome.

National Employee Forum and Local 
Employee Forums

The National Employee Forum (NEF) members 
represent all parts of the business. The NEF is 
chaired by a regional managing director and the 
Employee Champion attends each meeting.

Each regional business also has its own Local 
Employee Forum (LEF) and comprises members 
from each function and department 
or a representative for groupings of smaller 
departments. Each LEF is responsible for 
communicating feedback from the NEF to their 
regional business and to feed any areas of concern 
up to the NEF.

The Employee Champion meets with small groups 
of junior to mid-level employees to gather feedback 
directly from employees outside of the NEF in an 
informal setting and without Senior Management 
being present, to further encourage openness.

The Board recognises the importance of engaging 
with the workforce and has therefore adopted two 
of the methods set out in Provision 5 of the Code: 
a designated Non Executive Director and a formal 
workforce advisory panel.

The diagram opposite shows how both these 
methods feed into boardroom discussions.

Operational and strategic oversight

Policies and procedures

The Board sets the strategic direction of the 
Company and agrees the annual budget, whereby 
the necessary resources to achieve sufficient 
progress towards achievement of the agreed 
strategy, are made available.

The execution of our strategy and the day to day 
management of the Company’s operations is led 
by the Chief Executive who is assisted by the GMT. 
This is a vastly experienced team that has operated 
in a variety of market conditions, both with the 
Company and in the industry generally, and its 
members, and their respective roles, responsibilities 
and experience, are set out on page 95.

The Board receives at each meeting a detailed 
update on progress and plans towards the 
achievement of the strategy, and the day to day 
performance and prospects for the Company, 
from the CEO, together with similar reports from 
each GMT member for their respective areas. 
These are supplemented by reports from certain 
key Heads of Function who provide updates on 
key stakeholder groups; performance in the period 
and employee matters.

The Board conducts regular reviews of actual 
results and future projections with comparisons 
against budget and prior year performance.

There is a framework of delegated authorities, 
approved by the Board, within which individual 
responsibilities of senior executives of Group 
companies are identified and can be monitored.

The Board also receives regular reports and 
minutes from the Company’s Treasury Committee 
which is chaired by the Group Finance Director.

Conflicts of interest

Directors are required to notify the Group General 
Counsel and Company Secretary of any potential or 
actual conflicts of interest and these will be reported 
to the Board for consideration and, if appropriate, 
approval. The Nomination and Governance 
Committee, on behalf of the Board, is responsible 
for monitoring the content of the Conflicts of Interest 
Register annually. During 2023, four proposed 
external appointments were considered by the Board, 
Jennie Daly’s appointments as a member of the 
Business Council, and as a member of the AI 
Opportunity Forum, Mark Castle’s appointment as 
Chair of Eleco plc, and Irene Dorner’s appointment 
as a Member of the Council of Chatham House. 
In all cases, it was agreed that there was no 
evidence of a conflict.

Whistleblowing

The Board maintains overall responsibility for the 
Company’s Whistleblowing Policy (the Policy). 
The Policy is well communicated to employees both 
in regional businesses and on site. It provides a 
clear procedure for employees to report concerns 
either to their line manager or through a third party 
whistleblowing hotline (the Hotline).

The Hotline is also available for use by suppliers, 
subcontractors, customers and members of the 
public, for reporting any matters of concern to 
the Company. 

All whistleblowing cases are investigated by the 
Head of Internal Audit, Group HR Director and/or 
the Group General Counsel and Company 
Secretary depending on the nature of the concern, 
and (where appropriate) the Head of HSE.

104

The Board receives half yearly updates which set 
out any whistleblowing issues raised during the 
period and interim updates on significant matters. 
The updates provided are anonymous and 
summarise the result of any investigation.

The Board is satisfied that the Policy, the Hotline, 
and their administration remain effective.

Anti-bribery and anti-corruption

The Company has written policies on its 
zero-tolerance approach to bribery and corruption. 
The risks associated with bribery and corruption 
are mitigated by training for senior managers and 
by issuing an annual reminder, which includes the 
current version of the policies, to all regional 
businesses and key departments. This annual 
exercise requires written confirmation of continuing 
compliance and a completed copy of the relevant 
gifts and hospitality register; and a requirement 
to review training videos on anti-corruption, 
anti-money laundering and competition law.

ESG

ESG is an important part of working for Taylor Wimpey and how we do 
business, and the Board is responsible for overseeing our ESG initiatives. 
During 2023, the Board received regular briefings and updates on progress 
towards the achievement of our Net Zero Policy; our science based targets; 
our Environmental Policy; and the strategic cornerstone of ‘sustainability’ as 
part of our overall Strategy with its associated specific key performance 
indicators.

The Board also receives regular updates on progress against key topics, 
such as diversity and inclusion, the environment and stakeholder matters.

The implementation of ESG initiatives across the Group is led by the CEO 
and the GMT. Social and governance aspects of ESG are considered 
‘business as usual’ and this is evident in our key performance indicators 
and stakeholder interactions.

Taylor Wimpey plc Annual Report and Accounts 2023Strategic reportDirectors’ reportFinancial statementsShareholder informationMonitoring culture

The Board recognises the importance of a healthy company culture and considers the Company’s culture of ‘doing the right thing’ as a key strength of the business. The Board is responsible for 
defining and setting the Company’s culture from the top, and the Board and GMT as a whole are responsible for leading by example. The Board’s number one priority will remain health and safety 
for everyone who works on or visits a Taylor Wimpey site.

support and monitor the Company’s culture, 
including reviewing the Company’s approach 
to diversity and inclusion, supporting the 
work to articulate our employee value 
proposition, and representatives attending 
the National Employee Forum.

After considering the Company’s cultural 
indicators throughout 2023, there have 
been a number of actions taken to further 
support and monitor the Company’s 
culture, including:

•  The Board members undertook a 

•  The Board and GMT continued to 

programme of regional business and site 
visits during 2023, at which they engaged 
with employees at all levels of the 
business or site; seeking their views on 
the Company, its performance, and their 
contribution to its success. These visits 
will continue during 2024.

•  The Board and GMT considered feedback 
from the Employee Survey and oversaw 
action plans designed to address various 
matters raised.

consider employee feedback resulting 
from the various employee engagement 
methods as set out on pages 102 and 
103 and monitored actions taken as 
a result.

These processes continue into 2024, when 
the Board will continue to consider a wide 
range of cultural indicators and will take 
action as considered appropriate 
throughout the year.

identity, ethnicity, age, sexual orientation, 
disability and military background, and include 
the option to ‘prefer not to say’.

Board diversity

Board diversity is supported by the Board Diversity 
Policy which specifically applies to the Board and 
its Committees and supports the Company’s wider 
approach to diversity. This Policy was reviewed 
and approved during 2023 and is available on 
our website.

The Board fully supports the FTSE Women Leaders 
Review target of 40% female representation on 
the Board and the Leadership Team by 2025. 

The definition of Leadership Team includes our 
Group Management Team and their direct reports. 
Whilst we are pleased to report that we have 
exceeded this target in relation to our Board 
membership, we recognise that further progress 
needs to be made in relation to female 
representation in our Leadership Team. 

The Board also fully supports the Parker Review’s 
‘Beyond One by 21’ recommendation and is 
pleased to confirm compliance with this 
recommendation as at 31 December 2023.

The Board is pleased to report compliance with the 
FCA’s diversity disclosure requirements, as set out 
in the table above. At Taylor Wimpey, ‘executive 
management’ is defined as the Group Management 
Team. The figures in the table are stated as at 
31 December 2023.

106

Diversity remains a key consideration during 
recruitment and will continue to be referenced 
in all search and recruitment processes.

Employee diversity

Employee diversity remains a key priority for the 
Board, and across the Company as a whole. 

In 2023, the Board oversaw the progress and 
development of a number of activities in this area, 
including the embedding of the revised Equality, 
Diversity and Inclusion Policy introduced in 2021, 
the development of a number of aspirational 
diversity metrics to be achieved by 2025, and the 
publication of our Diversity and Inclusion Report. 

The Company’s Equality, Diversity and Inclusion 
Policy is based on three key areas of focus:

•  21st century leadership – Ensure that line 

managers understand their role and responsibility 
in developing a more diverse and inclusive culture 
through the provision of relevant training and 
building awareness across the Company.

•  Employer of choice – Ensure that our working 

environment, policies, procedures and 
development and progression opportunities 
support greater diversity and inclusion. 

•  Expanding our reach – Develop broader 

recruitment channels and take positive action to 
expand the diversity of candidates attracted to 
the Company, including designing development 
programmes to attract and support new 
employees. 

Detailed information about the Company’s 
employee diversity policies, practices and progress 
in this area can be found in our Diversity and 
Inclusion Report on our website.

Dear Shareholder

Corporate governance

Our responsibilities as a Committee include 
oversight of the Company’s corporate governance 
practices and we have continued to develop our 
processes to ensure corporate governance best 
practice is complied with at all levels of the 
organisation. More information about our activities 
in this area can be found on page 100.

Embedding good corporate governance throughout 
the Company will remain an important area of focus 
for the Committee throughout 2024.

External Board evaluation

I am pleased to report that the results of our annual 
Board evaluation concluded that the Board 
continues to be effective, with appropriate 
challenge and support at Board meetings. 
The 2023 Board evaluation was externally facilitated 
by Manchester Square Partners. 

Whilst conducting the 2023 Board evaluation, 
we also reviewed the key actions identified in the 
2022 Board evaluation and reviewed progress 
made against these actions during 2023.

More information about the outcomes of the 
2023 external Board evaluation can be found 
on page 111.

As Chair, I am pleased to present the 2023 report 
of the Nomination and Governance Committee 
(the Committee) on behalf of the Board. 

2023 Priorities

The Committee met three times during the year and 
reviewed various matters, including:

• An external evaluation of the Board, its

committees, and individual directors, as well as
the feedback and action plans arising from the
evaluation process.

• Board Succession Planning and Group

Management Team performance, development
and organisation structure.

• The Diversity and Inclusion Report (including the
approval of diversity targets) as well as progress
made towards achieving the Board’s diversity
objectives, including gender, ethnic, and cultural
diversity.

• The corporate governance framework and

practices of the Company, including the review
and approval of the annual corporate governance
disclosures and assessing alignment with best
practices and regulatory requirements.

As a Committee, we have overseen the 
appointments of Humphrey Singer as Senior 
Independent Director, and Mark Castle as the 
Board’s Employee Champion, as well as the 
transition from Irene Dorner to me as Chair. More 
information on the Board changes can be found on 
page 110.

“ We have made 
significant progress 
in advancing our 
strategic priorities 
and enhancing our 
governance 
standards.”

 Robert Noel
Chair of the Nomination 
and Governance Committee

Equality, diversity and inclusion

Our focus on equality, diversity and inclusion 
remains unchanged. It would be easy, in times of 
challenge, to reduce activities and attention to this 
important area of work. 

In 2023, we made progress on our aspirational 
targets, became a Level 2 Disability Confident 
employer, undertook a wide range of actions led by 
our employee affinity groups, and most importantly, 
our employees have told us in our engagement 
survey that they recognise that we are working hard 
to become as diverse as the communities in which 
we operate. 

We will be publishing our second Diversity and 
Inclusion Report with the full details of our 
achievements in this area.

Whilst we are pleased with our progress, 
we recognise that in reality our Company is still 
working towards diversity and we will continue to 
aspire to be reflective of the communities in which 
we operate; to this end we have set diversity 
targets in line with the Parker Review.

More information about our future focus on equality, 
diversity and inclusion can be found on page 106 
and also in our Diversity and Inclusion Report which 
can be found on our website.

Committee purpose and responsibilities

The main objectives of the Committee are to ensure 
that there are formal, rigorous and transparent 
procedures for the appointment and induction of 
new Directors to the Board, its Committees and 
other senior positions in the Company; and to keep 
the Board’s corporate governance arrangements 
under review and to ensure that both the Company 
and the Board operate in a manner consistent with 
corporate governance best practice. 

More information about the Committee’s purpose 
and responsibilities can be found in the 
Committee’s Terms of Reference which are 
available on our website.

Governance

During 2023, the Committee oversaw a number 
of governance matters, including:

•  Approved the 2023 Notice of Annual 

General Meeting

•  Confirmed compliance with the Committee’s 

Terms of Reference

•  Reviewed the corporate governance 

framework and reported to the Board that 
it remains appropriate

•  Recommended to the Board the annual approval 
of the Directors’ Conflicts of Interest Register

•  Approved the 2023 external Board evaluation 

process

•  Approved the Committee’s annual plan for 2024

Each Director is required to seek election or 
re-election, as appropriate, at each year’s Annual 
General Meeting. As part of this election and 
re-election process, the Committee has assessed 
each Non Executive Director’s independence and 
is satisfied that five of the seven Non Executive 
Directors remain independent in nature and there 
were no circumstances identified that are likely to 
impair, or could impair their independence. In 
addition, the Committee is satisfied that the Chair 
was independent in accordance with the Code, 
when he became Chair of the Board.

Irene Dorner, having stepped down from the role 
of Chair of the Board in 2023, is now considered 
a non-independent Non Executive Director. The 
Committee considers the balance of independent 
and non-independent Directors appropriate and will 
keep this under review.

The Directors are required to notify the Company of 
any changes to their external commitments in order 
that these roles can be considered in relation to the 
potential for a conflict of interest to arise. These 
external roles are considered by the Committee and 
during 2023 it has been concluded that no conflicts 
of interest have arisen. In addition, the Committee 
also considers that each Director is able to allocate 
sufficient time to the Company effectively. This not 
only included Board and Committee meeting 
attendance, but also preparation time, site visits 
and other additional time commitments required 
during the year.

Accordingly, at the 2024 Annual General Meeting 
each Director, irrespective of their appointment 
date, will be submitted for re-election. More 
information can be found on page 229.

Board balance and skills

During 2023, following a number of Board changes, 
the Committee considered the structure, size, and 
diversity of the Board, as well as the skills, 
knowledge and experience of each Board member.

The Committee concluded that the balance, as at 
31 December 2023, of the Chair, two Executive 
Directors and six Non Executive Directors remains 
appropriate. This balance will be kept under review 
during 2024. In addition, the skills of each member 
of the Board, as set out on pages 92 to 94, along 
with the balance of Executive and Non Executive 
Directors is considered to be appropriate to provide 
constructive challenge as well as guidance and 
support in order to continue to deliver the 
Company’s strategy.

Taylor Wimpey plc Annual Report and Accounts 2023Strategic reportDirectors’ reportFinancial statementsShareholder informationContingency planning

During 2023, the Committee reviewed the 
Company’s contingency cover to ensure that 
the Company can respond to the unforeseen 
unavailability of any member of the Board, GMT 
or other senior roles without impacting the current 
and long term performance of the Company. 
Following this review, the Committee was confident 
that all key roles have an appropriate contingency 
plan in place.

Nomination and Governance Committee report continued

Board appointments

The Committee ensures that all Board 
appointments are subject to formal, rigorous and 
transparent procedures, are based on merit and 
objective criteria and promote diversity of gender, 
social and ethnic background, and cognitive and 
personal strengths. 

There were no new appointments made to the 
Board during 2023; Humphrey Singer was 
appointed the Senior Independent Director and 
Mark Castle, the Board’s Employee Champion.

More information on the Board changes during 2023 
can be found on pages 99, 102, and 108

Succession planning

The Committee is conscious that the Code does 
not consider a Non Executive Director to be 
independent after they have served on the Board 
for nine years and therefore is mindful of the tenure 
of each Non Executive Director. When reviewing its 
annual agenda plan, the Committee is aware of any 
likely upcoming Board changes as a result of this, 
and is therefore in a position to begin the 
succession and recruitment process at an early 
stage. To this end, the Committee will begin, 
in early 2024, to make arrangements for the 
succession and recruitment of a new Non Executive 
Director as Humphrey Singer finishes a nine year term.

During 2023, the Committee considered the 
succession planning for both the Group 
Management Team and Heads of Functions, 
as well as wider workforce planning for certain 
roles including regional managing directors. The 
Committee has visibility of a range of employees 
who have been identified as potential succession 
candidates in the short, medium and long term. 
The Committee reviews the development 
programmes for these individuals to ensure they 
continue to develop in line with the succession plan.

The Committee is supported in this by the Group 
Talent Management Board and Divisional Talent 
Management Boards which regularly review 
succession plans and related development 
requirements across roles within the Company. 
During 2023, actions taken to support succession 
plans included Senior Management development 
and engagement, the discussion of aspirational 
diversity targets, and early talent capability levelling.

One aspect of a senior individual’s development 
plan is for those below Board level to be given the 
opportunity to attend Board meetings to present 
on specialist topics, project work and divisional 
performance. This process not only provides 
valuable exposure to the Board but it is also 
valuable for the Board and Committee to assess 
the strength and depth of the succession plans in 
place. During 2023, a number of individuals were 
invited to present to the Board on topics including 
customer service, sales and marketing, production, 
supply chain, employee engagement, and land.

Board evaluation

The Board undertakes a formal and rigorous evaluation of the performance of the Board, 
its Committees, the Chair and individual Directors on an annual basis. This process follows 
a three year cycle, with the 2023 Board evaluation being externally facilitated by Manchester 
Square Partners (MSP). MSP also carried out the 2017 and 2020 externally facilitated 
evaluations and it was considered that their insight into the significant evolution of the Board 
since 2017 (which has included two Chair changes, a new Chief Executive, various Non 
Executive Director changes and Group General Counsel and Company Secretary changes) 
would be invaluable. The Committee noted that MSP have no other connection to the 
Company and were chosen for their constructive and direct evaluation style.

The Nomination and Governance 
Committee reviewed and approved 
the proposal to appoint MSP to

evaluation report.

Taylor Wimpey plc Annual Report and Accounts 2023Strategic reportDirectors’ reportFinancial statementsShareholder information 
Nomination and Governance Committee report continued

MSP concluded that the Board functions well and 
governance is strong at Taylor Wimpey. There is a 
good degree of trust, confidence and healthy 
respect between the Directors; with all Directors 
being aligned in respect of the role of the Board 
over the next few years. MSP confirmed that the 

relationship between the Chair and Chief Executive 
is developing well with regular open dialogue. The 
Committees are functioning effectively with praise 
for the work and rigour the respective Committee 
Chairs bring. The Non Executive Directors are 
committed, knowledgeable and well prepared; and 
bring strong diverse perspectives and experiences. 

Some areas for further enhancements were 
identified and the Board developed an action plan 
designed to address the findings of the evaluation, 
which will be actioned during 2024. In addition, 
the Committee reviewed progress made against 
the agreed 2022 Board evaluation actions. Further 
information can be found in the tables below.

development plans

Ensure progress 
against ESG initiatives 
are clear

The Committee received regular updates 
on talent and succession planning at all levels 
of the business, from early entry to the GMT. 
As part of these updates, the Committee 
were provided with overviews of the 
development plans in place to strengthen 
our succession pipeline. 

An ESG balanced scorecard has been 
developed during 2023 which the Board 
reviews at least on a quarterly basis. The 
scorecard captures key areas of importance 
to Taylor Wimpey and increases visibility of 
progress. There is also a standing ESG item 
at each Board meeting which provides 
key ESG updates since the last meeting. 
More information can be found on pages 98 
and 104.

Further enhance discussions 
at Board and Committee 
meetings

All papers submitted to the Board to include 
an executive summary which note any 
particular questions Management would like the 
Non Executive Directors to consider in advance 
of the meetings. A brief biography of all 
presenters to be included in the Board packs.

 Recommendation to the Board

Taylor Wimpey plc Annual Report and Accounts 2023Strategic reportDirectors’ reportFinancial statementsShareholder informationAudit Committee report continued

Dear Shareholder

On behalf of the Board, I am pleased to present 
the 2023 report of the Audit Committee 
(the Committee).

We fulfil the Committee’s responsibilities through 
the activities undertaken throughout the year, 
as detailed on pages 116 to 117.

Committee changes

As foreshadowed in last year’s report, Robert Noel 
stood down from the Committee on 27 April 2023, 
in compliance with the Code, upon his appointment 
as Chair of the Board.

In preparation for that change, we considered the 
Committee’s composition and the balance of its 
experience and expertise, and are confident that 
the remaining three members of the Committee 
are sufficient in number and experience, including 
recent and relevant financial experience, to 
continue the work of the Committee on behalf of 
shareholders, in an effective and compliant manner.

Key areas of focus during 2023

Our key areas of focus during 2023 were 
addressed as set out below:

Cyber security and digitisation of production 
procedures

We oversaw, and received regular updates on, 
plans and progress to maintain and enhance 
the resilience of the Company’s cyber defences, 
through the implementation of a new end point 
protection service using a new XDR (Extended 
detection and response) service from a specialist 
security service provider.

114

We also monitored progress in the digitisation of 
the Company’s production procedures, through 
the delivery of new devices and mobile apps and 
sought and received assurance from Management 
and the Executive Directors that these will deliver 
appropriate controls across the Company’s UK 
business.

Further information on our activities during 2023 
and plans for 2024 in meeting the revised 
requirements of the Code; the wider responsibility 
to ensure that all applicable laws and regulations 
are complied with; and to assure ourselves that the 
business continues to operate in a controlled and 
well-managed way, are set out on page 120.

Key business controls

We sought and received assurances from 
Management, underpinned by the summary 
findings from Internal Audit reports conducted 
during the year, that key business controls, 
including proper segregation of duties and 
appropriate delegation of authority, remained 
effective throughout the reporting period and to the 
date of this report.

More information on our activities during 2023 in 
this area can be found on page 123.

Our interim review of progress and our final review 
prior to signing this report each concluded that all 
of those key areas of focus were satisfactorily 
addressed or progressed during 2023.

More information on the ways in which, during 
2023, we drove further improvements in cyber 
resilience and business controls, and plans for 
further enhancements during 2024, are set out 
on page 121.

Preparing for planned financial governance 
changes

We continued and built upon the work commenced 
during 2022 in preparation for the recently 
announced changes to the Code to reflect the 
outcome of the Government’s consultation on its 
initiative, by BEIS, entitled ‘Restoring Trust in Audit 
and Corporate Governance’.

The primary change is to require an explanation in 
each year’s Annual Report as to how the Board has 
monitored the Company’s risk management and 
internal control framework during the year and 
carried out a review of its effectiveness.

Whilst these changes do not apply until later 
reporting periods, we will be continuing to prepare 
for compliance and will also be considering whether 
it is possible and appropriate to introduce systems 
and processes to enable us to comply with some 
of the provisions during 2024.

Significant items

In addition to the key areas of focus during 2023, the other key area addressed by 
the Committee, as it does every year, were the significant items raised during the 
preparation and audit of the Group’s accounts for 2023. The following significant 
items are those that the Committee has identified and considered in discharging 
its duties and in considering the financial reporting of the Group:

Significant item description

Action taken

Margin recognition and site forecasting

The cost allocation framework used across 
the Group controls the way in which the 
inventory is costed and allocated across 
each development. It also ensures that any 
costs in excess of the original budget are 
recognised appropriately as the site 
progresses.

Cladding fire safety provision

The Company entered into the Developer 
Remediation Contracts with the UK 
Government on 13 March 2023 and the 
Welsh Government on 18 April 2023. These 
were legally binding agreements which 
followed the commitments previously given 
under the Pledge and Pact respectively. 
Under these agreements the Company 
pledged to bring all Taylor Wimpey 
apartment buildings built since 1992 up to 
the standard required by the PAS9980 
guidance.

115

The Committee reviewed reports and 
recommendations from the GMT in relation 
to areas of the business recognising cost 
excesses, and also reviewed the 
work undertaken by PwC which included 
testing of the Group-wide controls to 
monitor cost allocation. The Committee 
carefully considered the judgements 
and assumptions involved, challenging 
Management where appropriate. 

Following these reviews, together with 
enquiries of the GMT and the external 
Auditors, the Committee concluded that 
there continued to be appropriate systems 
and internal controls in place, which 
ensured that consistent principles were 
applied; the treatment and presentation 
on the income statement of the costs 
incurred by the business were appropriate; 
and that the external Auditors agreed with 
the conclusions reached. 

The Committee reviewed and challenged 
Senior Management’s assessment of the 
costs to comply with these obligations. 

The Committee also reviewed updates on 
the progress of the rectification of buildings 
together with utilisation and estimates of the 
remaining provision. The Committee was 
satisfied that the provision represented 
Management’s best estimate of the 
expected remediation costs.

Audit oversight

Continuing compliance

Throughout the year we met the FRC guidance on 
Audit Committees which was incorporated into the 
Code. The aim of the guidance is to further improve 
good governance around the Committee’s 
competence; induction for new members; audit 
rotation; independent assessment of areas of 
judgement; and sufficiency of resourcing; all with 
the aim of ensuring that it is able to perform its 
primary function of protecting shareholders’ 
interests in relation to the Company’s financial 
reporting and internal control.

More information about how we complied with the 
guidance can be found on pages 125 to 128.

Humphrey Singer
Chair of the Audit Committee
27 February 2024

We continue to hold individual meetings with the 
external Auditors and with the Head of Internal 
Audit, independent of the Executive Directors, to 
discuss matters within our remit and any issues 
arising from the external and internal audits. This 
provides each audit activity with direct access in the 
event that they wish to raise any matters without 
the presence of Management.

The audit of the 2023 financial results has been 
improved and enhanced by lessons learned, 
both by the external Auditors and the Company, 
following our detailed annual evaluation of the 
external audit process and the outcome of the 
external audit of the Annual Report and 
Accounts 2022.

Detection and prevention of fraud

The first full year of the new Head of Internal Audit 
has focused particularly on assessing and further 
improving the continued effectiveness of the 
Company’s processes; controls; and reporting 
mechanisms for the detection and prevention of 
fraud in the Company’s business activities. More 
information is set out on page 119.

Key areas of focus during 2024

Alongside fulfilling our statutory and governance 
functions as normal during 2024, we will give 
particular focus to certain key areas which we 
believe are important for the coming year. These 
are set out on page 113.

These areas are key from a Group perspective 
because they will influence our ways of working on a 
day to day basis from an IT service perspective and 
the assurance we have over our control environment.

In carrying out these activities, the Committee relies 
on regular reports from Management, Internal Audit 
and from the external Auditors. In monitoring the 
financial reporting practices, the Committee reviewed 
accounting policies, areas of judgement highlighted 
by Management and the external Auditors, the going 
concern assumptions and compliance with accounting 
standards and the requirements of the Code.

Committee meetings

The Committee met individually and privately with 
the Head of Internal Audit and with representatives 
from the external Auditors during appropriate 
Committee meetings in 2023, in order to provide 
a forum to raise and discuss any matters which 
either may wish to raise in confidence.

The Committee considers guidance as to the 
number of Audit Committee meetings considered 
to be appropriate for FTSE 100 companies such as 
ours, in relation to the Committee’s annual plan for 
each year. We currently believe that three meetings 
per year remains appropriate and sufficient to 
effectively discharge the Committee’s responsibilities. 
There are processes in place for the Committee to 
meet on additional occasions, when necessary, 
as it has done so on occasion in the past.

Committee purpose and responsibilities

The main objective of the Committee is to assist 
the Board in fulfilling its corporate governance 
responsibilities relating to the Group’s financial 
reporting, internal and external auditing, risk, and 
internal control framework, and any other matters 
referred to it by the Board.

The Committee’s Terms of Reference can be found 
on our website and are reviewed each year, when 
assessing performance against each one, to ensure 
that they remain appropriate.

Committee competence

One of the key requirements of the FRC’s guidance 
on Audit Committees is that each Committee 
member should have sufficient knowledge, training 
and expertise to contribute effectively to the 
Committee’s deliberations, and that the Committee 
as a whole should have sufficient recent and 
relevant financial experience as required by the Code.

Humphrey Singer, the Committee Chair, has been 
a member of the Audit Committee since December 
2015 and its Chair since February 2018. He has 
extensive experience of the financial reporting 
requirements of FTSE 100 companies; of financial 
reporting preparation and compliance for public 
companies, and of dealing with internal and 
external auditors, from his current role as Chief 
Financial Officer of Belron Group and from previous 
roles with Marks and Spencer Group plc and 
Dixons Carphone plc. This depth of experience 
has given Humphrey insight into key areas of 
shareholder concern and independent experience 
of robustly challenging and holding Management, 
and the external and internal auditors, to account.

The Committee Chair is assisted on the Committee 
by the knowledge and experience of two other 
Non Executive Directors:

Mark Castle has significant operational experience 
in all aspects of the construction sector from his 
time as Chief Operating Officer of Mace Finance Ltd 
and previously from executive roles at Structuretone 
Inc and Wates Group Ltd. This particularly assists 
the Committee in its assessment of operational risk.

Scilla Grimble has over 17 years’ executive 
experience in corporate finance; is currently the 
Chief Financial Officer at Deliveroo plc; and brings 
significant financial and risk-related experience.

Taylor Wimpey plc Annual Report and Accounts 2023Strategic reportDirectors’ reportFinancial statementsShareholder informationAudit Committee report continued

Prior to stepping down from the Committee, 
in accordance with good governance, upon his 
appointment as Chair of the Board, Robert Noel 
brought considerable experience of the property 
sector and wide commercial experience as Chair of 
Hammerson plc and previously as Chief Executive 
of Land Securities Group PLC.

When Robert Noel stepped down from the 
Committee, its composition was considered in 
relation to its annual plan, areas of focus, and 
expertise, and it was decided that an additional 
appointee was not necessary.

The Committee believes that its members 
collectively have the necessary competence 
relevant for the housebuilding sector and that its 
composition, balance, and expertise can give 
shareholders confidence that the financial reporting, 
internal and external auditing, risk, and control 
processes of the Group are subjected to the 
appropriate level of independent, robust and 
challenging oversight.

As described in the Nomination and Governance 
Committee Report on page 110, there is a formal 
process of induction for new Directors, which 
includes specific reference to supporting 
competence in relevant Committee areas through 
exposure to the appropriate areas of the Group’s 
operations and performance. This same thorough 
induction process, suitably tailored as appropriate 
to the appointee’s experience and expertise, will be 
undertaken by any new Non Executive Directors 
appointed to the Committee.

118

Committee evaluation

The Board Evaluation for 2023, which is described 
more fully on page 111, and which was externally-
facilitated by Manchester Square Partners, included 
an appraisal of the performance of the Audit 
Committee and individually of its Chair and other 
members.

The outcome of the appraisal was that the 
Committee was considered to continue to operate 
effectively; with the necessary level of expertise; 
with no specific actions arising requiring further 
improvement; and is chaired effectively and in a 
way that ensures a good level of debate and 
positive challenge.

External Auditors

Re-appointment

PwC’s audit of the Company’s 2023 accounts and 
reports was its third since appointment as the 
external Auditors at the 2021 AGM. The Audit 
Partner is Sonia Copeland, who has held the role 
since PwC were appointed as external Auditors.

The Committee considers that the relationship with 
PwC is well established and is satisfied with the 
effectiveness of the overall external audit process. 
PwC’s performance has been kept under regular 
review by the Committee and reported to the Board 
as appropriate.

As in previous years, a full evaluation of PwC’s 
performance in relation to the audit of the full year 
results for 2022 was performed. The process 
followed was as set out below:

A questionnaire was distributed to the Board 
and key stakeholders in the audit process to 
evaluate the effectiveness of the external 
audit process.

The Committee considered the nature and 
extent of the non-audit work performed 
by PwC during the year.

The Committee considered whether PwC had 
appropriately challenged Management’s 
estimates and judgements.

In particular the Committee noted during the course 
of the audit that the external Auditors challenged 
Management’s judgements and assertions on the 
following matters:

•  Margin recognition and site forecasting.

•  Cladding fire safety provision.

In relation to each of these judgements the external 
Auditors confirmed that the approach adopted by 
Management in accounting for these in the financial 
statements was appropriate.

Taylor Wimpey plc Annual Report and Accounts 2023Strategic reportDirectors’ reportFinancial statementsShareholder informationAudit Committee report continued

The Committee considered the responses to all 
these areas of assessment, and concluded that the 
audit process continues to be effective; that the 
quality and sufficiency of the resources provided by 
PwC’s engagement team remains appropriate; that 
PwC remains independent; and that there continues 
to be effective and independent reporting lines 
available to the external Auditors direct to the 
Committee and its Chair.

The Committee also assessed Management’s 
proposals for incorporating into the Annual 
Report and Accounts consideration of material 
climate-related matters. More details appear on 
pages 53 to 68.

Based upon its assessment, as set out above, 
the Committee recommended to the Board, which 
in turn is recommending to shareholders in 
Resolution 12 at the 2024 AGM (in the Notice of 
AGM on page 229), that PwC should continue as 
external Auditors to the Company.

The Company will of course keep the matter under 
regular review, taking into account the annual 
performance review to be conducted by the 
Committee in 2024.

The recommendation of PwC was free from 
influence by a third party and no contractual term 
of the kind mentioned in Article 16(6) of the Audit 
Regulation has been imposed on the Company 
whereby there would be a restriction on the choice 
to certain categories or lists of audit firms in the 
Company’s selection of its external auditors.

Appointment of the external Auditors for 
non-audit services

The Committee has a formal policy, reviewed on 
a regular basis, as to whether the Company’s external 
Auditors should be employed to provide services 

119

other than audit services. In line with the Code, 
the Committee has regard to the relevant ethical 
guidance regarding the provision of non-audit 
services by PwC.

A review of the policy has been undertaken and it 
was confirmed that the policy is in accordance with 
the Revised Ethical Standard 2019 (the Standard) 
issued in December 2019 by the Financial 
Reporting Council (FRC), which limits the non-audit 
services which the external Auditors may provide to 
the Company.

In all circumstances where it is proposed to engage 
the external Auditors to perform non-audit work in 
accordance with this policy, this is subject to the 
approval of the Audit Committee after it has 
properly assessed potential threats to the 
independence of the external Auditors and the 
safeguards applied in the Standard.

The Board, acting on guidance from the Committee 
following its review of the continuing effectiveness 
of this policy, is satisfied that it meets the Standard, 
and will be conducive to the maintenance of good 
governance, best practice and auditor 
independence and objectivity.

PwC undertook non-audit services:

•  In the form of assurance work carried out in 
connection with the announcement of the 
Company’s 2023 half year results. This non-audit 
service is of direct benefit to shareholders.

•  By making available access to its subscription 

service providing online technical resources such 
as factual updates and changes to applicable 
law, regulation, and accounting and auditing 
standards, at a notional value of £2,000.

•  By providing a report for the Spanish authorities, 

which was required to come from the subsidiary’s 

external Auditors, to support an application 
for property taxes available for land under 
development.

The Committee recognises and supports the 
importance of the independence of auditors. 
It reviewed each separate proposed non-audit 
procedure; and PwC’s overall performance of 
non-audit services during 2023; and is satisfied that 
it did not, and will not going forward, impair the 
independence of the external Auditors. The value 
of non-audit services work by PwC was £0.1 million 
in 2023 (2022: £0.1 million) which represents 
approximately 9% (2022: 10%) of the audit fee as 
set out in Note 6 to the Accounts on page 184.

Internal Audit

Internal Audit’s primary role is to support the Board 
and the Group Management Team (GMT) to protect 
the assets, reputation and sustainability of the 
Group. The function is led by the Head of Internal 
Audit who directly reports to the Chair of the 
Audit Committee, with a secondary reporting line 
to the Group Finance Director, and has regular 
direct contact with the Chair of the Board, the 
Chief Executive and other senior Management, as 
required. The reporting line to the Chair of the Audit 
Committee protects the function’s independence.

The most recent independent evaluation of Internal 
Audit’s independence and performance was carried 
out during 2021, as described in the Annual Report 
and Accounts 2021, and found that Internal Audit 
continues to operate effectively, with no areas of 
non-conformance with recommended practice as 
set out in the International Professional Practice 
Framework. Continuous improvement initiatives 
agreed at that time, have been implemented, to 
ensure the Internal Audit function continues to meet 
both current best practice and the evolving needs 
of the Group.

Taylor Wimpey plc Annual Report and Accounts 2023Strategic reportDirectors’ reportFinancial statementsShareholder informationeffective; that they meet the requirements of the 
Code; and that their implementation and 
embedding into the Company’s processes is 
progressing satisfactorily.

Further details on how the Company will comply 
with these new measures for reporting periods 
2025 and 2026 will be included in next year’s 
Audit Committee Report.

Risk management and internal control

During 2023, the Board, assisted and advised by 
the Audit Committee, has carried out a robust 
assessment of the Company’s emerging and 
Principal risks.

The Group has an established ongoing process 
of risk management, which is detailed further on 
pages 71 to 77. The Committee monitors the 
Group’s risk management and internal control 
systems, including their effectiveness, on behalf 
of the Board and provides advice to the Board in 
connection with the Board’s own risk review.

Audit Committee report continued

Internal Audit reviews the effectiveness and 
efficiency of the systems of internal control in place 
to safeguard the assets; to quantify, price, transfer, 
avoid or mitigate risks; and to monitor the activities 
of the Group in accomplishing established 
objectives. Internal Audit’s mandate is Group-wide 
and their reviews during 2023 have considered 
financial, operational and compliance controls.

The Internal Audit plan, and the individual audits 
conducted in line with that plan, are driven 
primarily by the Group’s strategy and its key risks. 
Following each review, an Internal Audit report is 
provided to both the Management responsible for 
the area reviewed and the GMT. These reports 
outline Internal Audit’s opinion of the management 
control framework in place together with actions 
proposed or made, as appropriate, where 
improvements are recommended. The Chief 
Executive, the GMT and Senior Management 
consider the reports on a regular basis and are 
responsible for ensuring that improvements are 
made as agreed. A database of audit 
recommendations and improvement initiatives is 
maintained. Follow-up and escalation processes 
ensure that such improvements are implemented 
and fully embedded in a timely manner. Summaries 
of all Internal Audit reviews and other key activity 
and resulting reports are also provided to the 
Audit Committee for review and discussion.

The Group belongs to and participates in 
industry-wide forums and other initiatives aimed 
at combating fraud within the housebuilding and 
construction industry.

The Internal Audit function also reviews proposed 
related-party transactions, including employees’ 
house purchases from the Group, to provide 
assurance that the formal policy and proper 
procedures are followed.

120

Preparation for planned financial 
governance changes

The Committee has overseen preparations to 
comply with the recently-published UK Corporate 
Governance Code 2024, which embodies regulatory 
changes, including the minimum standards for 
Audit Committees, resulting from the BEIS 
consultation into restoring trust in audit and 
corporate governance. The likely general 
requirements have been clear for some time 
previously, and accordingly preparatory work has 
been taking place throughout 2023 and into 2024, 
overseen by the Committee, to ensure the 
Company is ready to comply from the required 
application timescale of 1 January 2025 
(1 January 2026 for certain measures).

These preparations involved establishing a project 
dedicated to preparing for the Corporate Governance 
Reform requirements. The project steering committee 
is chaired by the Group Finance Director and its 
membership includes the Group General Counsel 
and Company Secretary, Group Financial Controller, 
IT Director and Head of Internal Audit.

The initial scope of the project focused on internal 
controls over financial reporting, which confirmed 
that there continue to be strong processes in place, 
including the Operating Framework and a 
comprehensive Finance Manual.

The scope of the project has evolved in response 
to FRC updates and will move into preparing for the 
known requirements. This will be an area of focus 
for the Committee in 2024 as noted on page 113.

These actions have been overseen and monitored 
by the Committee during 2023 and will continue 
to be monitored into 2024, to ensure that they are 

Taylor Wimpey plc Annual Report and Accounts 2023Strategic reportDirectors’ reportFinancial statementsShareholder informationAudit Committee report continued

The Committee’s objectives in relation to risk are:

•  To ensure the Group’s risk profile remains within 
its agreed risk appetite and tolerance levels and 
is adequately monitored and reviewed as 
appropriate to reflect external and internal 
changes;

•  To comply with the revisions to the Code in 

respect of strengthening the reporting on internal 
controls over financial, operational and 
compliance reporting;

•  To continue to develop the Group’s risk 

processes in light of evolving best practice; and

•  To consider emerging risks that could impact 

on the Group’s longer term strategy.

sufficiency of the associated provision, and 
reviewing updates on usage and the balance of 
the provision during the year.

Updates were received on key IT risks, including 
the resilience of the Group’s systems to cyber 
attack and action taken to maintain and improve 
the security of systems and data.

The Board was advised by the Committee in its 
assessment of emerging risks, including potential 
velocity and impact on the Group’s longer term 
strategy, further details of which can be found on 
page 73.

The Committee also oversaw the further 
embedding of improvements in the area of risk. 
These related to:

To achieve these objectives, the Committee 
undertook the following during 2023:

Cyber security

Detailed risk reviews were conducted twice during 
the year, at the Committee’s July (half year) and 
December (full year) meetings and covered both 
the systems used and the reported risks. These 
considered the outputs from a bottom-up and 
top-down review of risk in all areas of the business 
and included taking account of ESG considerations, 
and climate change, over various time horizons. 
These assessments use an established 
methodology and include regularly reviewing the 
effectiveness of the Group’s system of internal 
control in providing a responsible assessment and 
mitigation of risks.

Regular updates were received on the continuing 
review of relevant historical and current 
developments and actions taken by the Group to 
comply with the Government guidance on fire 
safety. This included assessing and advising the 
Board on the continuing appropriateness and 

Recognising the evolving threat landscape, we have 
strategically allocated resources to further 
strengthen our cyber defences and resilience. 
Investments have been made in advanced threat 
detection and incident response capabilities which 
both formed part of the Cyber Security Roadmap 
which set out the programme of activity for the 
coming years. Internal Audit, with external subject 
matter expert support, reviewed the development 
of the roadmap and their conclusion was that it was 
comprehensive and delivery of the roadmap 
initiatives is well managed. We have also focused 
employee training and awareness on the threats in 
this area as we recognise the important role of our 
employees in helping to identify and report potential 
cyber breaches. Training completion is regularly 
checked by Internal Audit and we have seen the 
completion rate improve year on year both from 
Internal Audit’s support and the benefits of our 
awareness programmes.

Production processes

The programme to digitalise our production 
processes made good progress during 2023. Its 
objective is to deliver an improvement in production 
build quality, efficiency and productivity, and site 
staff wellbeing through the better use of technology, 
including simple applications and user-friendly 
devices. Internal Audit attends the programme board 
meetings and updates the committee on progress. 
The Committee also receives updates directly on 
these important initiatives from the IT Director.

Change programme

The Group delivered a change programme at the 
beginning of 2023, the objective of which was to 
right-size the business in response to the changing 
and uncertain market conditions. The Committee 
sought assurance that key business controls, in 
particular segregation of duties and delegation of 
authority remain effective. Internal Audit considered 
this in their workplan and has confirmed that key 
business controls remain effective.

Action to mitigate the effect of each risk is led by 
the Chief Executive in conjunction with the relevant 
member of the GMT.

Risk management and mitigation systems cannot 
eliminate risks but rather seek to manage both the 
likelihood of their occurrence and the extent of their 
impact and can only provide reasonable and not 
absolute assurance against material misstatement 
or loss.

The Principal Risks facing the Company and the 
Group, as assessed by the Board, are set out on 
pages 74 to 77 together with information on the 
mitigations for each risk.

121

Taylor Wimpey plc Annual Report and Accounts 2023Strategic reportDirectors’ reportFinancial statementsShareholder informationAudit Committee report continued

The Committee also oversees the actions being 
taken to monitor IT initiatives which aim to either 
directly protect against and reduce the risk of 
cyber-related attacks and fraud; support and 
enhance the current IT environment including data 
protection; or that are crucial in their contribution 
to key business initiatives aiming to enhance the 
experience of customers, suppliers and/or employees.

At its meeting in February 2024, the Board, having 
conducted its own review and after reviewing more 
detailed assessments from the Audit Committee, 
remained satisfied that the system of internal 
control continued to be effective in identifying, 
assessing, and ranking the various risks facing the 
Group; and in monitoring and reporting progress in 
mitigating their potential impact on the Group.

The Board also approved the statement of the 
Principal Risks and uncertainties set out on pages 
71 to 77 of this Annual Report and Accounts.

IT operating environment

Cyber resilience

A Principal Risk area identified by the Board is the 
potential vulnerability of the Group’s IT systems to 
the various forms of cyber attack and a key area 
of focus for the Committee during 2023 was 
continuing to ensure that the IT operating 
environment remained robust, supporting the 
business needs in a year of planned changes to 
core systems and also that key systems were 
protected against cyber and other threats.

The Committee reviewed details of the proposed 
enhancements to the Group’s cyber resilience and 
assured itself, prior to their introduction, that they 
were appropriate and could reasonably be 
expected to deliver enhanced protection to the 
Group’s key operating systems.

122

The Head of Internal Audit attends the IT Steering 
Committee meetings; and Internal Audit is 
represented on key project teams, including the 
upgrade of the financial consolidation and reporting 
system and the bank payment system.

Internal Audit has taken on the function of Business 
Continuity and will be improving response planning 
to a business impacting level incident in 2024.

Both our Logistics and financial consolidation and 
reporting solutions were upgraded during 2023 
with both hardware and software improvements 
completed.

Other improvements included:

•  Increased resources and improved approach to 

working with projects to ensure security is 
embedded by design.

•  Extending our security controls to cover a wider 

range of IT services.

•  A step improvement in monitoring vulnerabilities 

and remediating them promptly.

•  Introducing a more extensive testing regime for 

security vulnerabilities in legacy systems.

Plans for further enhancements to cyber resilience 
during 2024 include:

Group assurance approach

The overall structure of the Group’s internal controls and assurance processes 
are as set out below:

•  Available online for all employees, 

with controls to ensure compliance 
or appropriate pre-approval of 
any variation

Key processes and controls

Going concern

Viability statement

The Group has prepared forecasts, including 
various sensitivities, and has taken account of 
the Principal Risks and uncertainties identified 
on pages 71 to 77. The Committee reviewed the 
forecasts and the Directors’ expectations based 
thereon; questioned Management as to the source; 
robustness; and efficacy of them; and agreed that 
they were reasonable. In consequence, the 
Committee advised the Board that in its view 
they appropriately supported an assessment 
that the Company remains a going concern. 
Having independently considered these forecasts 
and the advice thereon from the Committee, 
the Directors remain of the view that the Group’s 
financing arrangements and capital structure 
provide both the necessary facilities and covenant 
headroom to enable the Group to conduct its 
business for at least 12 months from the date of 
this report. Accordingly, the consolidated financial 
statements have been prepared on a going 
concern basis.

Read more about our Principal Risks on pages 71 to 77

The viability statement is designed to be a longer 
term view of the sustainability of the Group’s 
strategy and business model and related resourcing, 
in light of projected wider economic and market 
developments. The Committee considered the 
methodology; the outputs; and whether there 
should be any change to the five-year period chosen 
for the statement. The Committee also reviewed the 
Executive Directors’ expectations; the criteria upon 
which they were based; and the sensitivities applied, 
including how these linked to the Principal Risks 
faced by the business; and agreed that they were 
reasonable. The outcome of this assessment was 
that they advised the Board that in their view, the 
Company can give the viability statement 
incorporated into this Annual Report and Accounts, 
and that the five-year period over which it applied, 
continued to be appropriate, taking into account the 
balance sheet strength and confirmation from the 
Executive Directors that this period continues to 
broadly align to the development cycle for new land. 

The statement appears on pages 82 to 83 together 
with details of the processes, assumptions and 
testing which underpin it.

Another key area of focus for the Committee during 
2023 was gaining assurance on required changes 
to key processes and controls that might have been 
affected by known legislative changes impacting 
the industry through 2023 and into 2024, in 
particular the requirements of the New Homes 
Quality Code (NHQC), Parts L and F of the Future 
Homes Standard and expected requirements of the 
FRC’s Corporate Governance reforms.

Key processes to enable the Company to comply 
with the NHQC and the New Homes Ombudsman 
Service, were successfully introduced across the 
business. These included mandatory training for 
employees and subcontractors; updating 
procedures and systems to reflect the NHQC 
requirements; and automation of the processes.

Internal Audit will continue to monitor performance of, 
and compliance with, NHQC mandatory requirements.

Group assurance map

A Group assurance map has been developed to 
provide a summary of the three lines of assurance: 
management, oversight function and Internal Audit; 
to the GMT, the Audit Committee and the Board. 
Assurance is mapped against our recognised key 
risks and is based on a comprehensive and shared 
view as discussed with appointed risk owners 
together with Heads of Function and others who 
have key oversight responsibilities. This then 
enables the GMT, the Audit Committee and the 
Board to identify and confirm their assurance 
needs and any actions required to fulfil those 
needs. The Head of Internal Audit coordinates 
this process and updates the Audit Committee 
at its July and December meetings.

Annual Report and Accounts 2023

Fair, balanced and understandable

The Committee considered whether, in its opinion, 
the Annual Report and Accounts 2023, taken as 
a whole, is fair, balanced and understandable, 
and that it included the information necessary 
for shareholders to assess the Group’s position, 
performance, business model and strategy. 
The process followed in making that assessment 
was as follows:

The Committee monitors the integrity 
of the Group’s reporting process and 
financial management and the work 
of the external Auditors.

The Committee challenges any 
significant financial judgements and 
estimates made by Management and 
the external Auditors’ review of them.

The Committee ensured that there 
is a clear and unified link between 
the Annual Report and Accounts 
and the Company’s other external 
reporting, and between the three 
main sections of the Annual Report 
and Accounts.

The review of the Company’s 
Annual Report and Accounts 2023 
took the form of a detailed 
assessment of the collaborative 
process of drafting them, which 
involves the Company’s Investor 
Relations; Company Secretariat; 
and Finance functions, with 
guidance and input from other 
relevant functions and external 
advisers, all overseen by the 
Executive Directors and 
Group General Counsel and 
Company Secretary.

The Committee considers the 
output from the review process and 
reviews the full year and half year 
financial statements before 
proposing them to the Board for 
consideration and approval.

In particular, the Committee 
considered the following in 
relation to this Annual Report 
and Accounts:

•  Reviewed all material matters, 
including the significant items 
set out on page 115.

•  Reviewed with Management 
the overall presentation of 
Alternative Performance 
Measures (APMs), which the 
Company uses as important 
financial performance indicators 
to assess the underlying 
performance of the Group, 
to ensure the APMs are not 
given undue prominence and 
that any adjustments are 
explained clearly.

•  Considered the Directors’ 

statements as to the amount 
and availability of distributable 
reserves in relation to dividends 
proposed by the Board.

•  Ensured that it correctly reflected 
the Group’s performance in the 
reporting year.

•  Ensured that it presented a 

consistent message throughout.

•  Ensured that it correctly reflected 
the Group’s business model.

•  Ensured that it correctly 

described the Group’s strategy.

•  Considered whether it 

presented the information in 
a clear and concise manner, 
illustrated by appropriate KPIs, 
to facilitate shareholders’ 
access to relevant information.

124

Recommendation to 
the Board

The outcome of the above process, 
together with the views presented by 
the External Auditors PwC, was that the 
Committee recommended to the Board 
that it could give the confirmation on 
page 156, that the Annual Report and 
Accounts 2023, taken as a whole, is fair, 
balanced and understandable, and 
provides the necessary information for 
shareholders to assess the Company’s 
position, performance, business model 
and strategy.

More detail on how the Board and the 
Audit Committee have addressed the 
assessment, control and mitigation of 
risk, and the oversight of the internal and 
external audit functions, appear in this 
Audit Committee report.

Statement of compliance

The Company has complied throughout 
the reporting year with the provisions 
of The Statutory Audit Services for 
Large Companies Market Investigation 
(Mandatory Use of Competitive Tender 
Processes and Audit Committee 
Responsibilities) Order 2014.

Taylor Wimpey plc Annual Report and Accounts 2023Strategic reportDirectors’ reportFinancial statementsShareholder informationCompliance statement

Our compliance statement sets out how the principles of the 2018 UK Corporate Governance Code (the Code) have been applied for the year ended 31 December 2023.

The Company complied with all provisions of the Code throughout the year, having eliminated at the end of 2022 the non-compliance with Provision 38 (executive director pension contributions) 
as reported in last year's Annual Report and Accounts, save for Code Provision 32 (Remuneration Committee composition) in respect of which the non-compliance ended with the appointment 
of two additional independent Non Executive Directors, Mark Castle and Clodagh Moriarty to the Remuneration Committee on 27 April 2023. More information can be found on page 152.

1. Board leadership and Company purpose

Principle

Application

A. A successful company is led by an effective 
and entrepreneurial board, whose role is 
to promote the long term sustainable 
success of the company, generating value 
for shareholders and contributing to 
wider society.

B. The board should establish the company’s 
purpose, values and strategy, and satisfy 
itself that these and its culture are aligned. 
All directors must act with integrity, lead by 
example and promote the desired culture.

C. The board should ensure that the necessary 
resources are in place for the company to 
meet its objectives and measure performance 
against them. The board should also 
establish a framework of prudent and 
effective controls, which enable risk to be 
assessed and managed.

D. In order for the company to meet its 
responsibilities to shareholders and 
stakeholders, the board should ensure 
effective engagement with, and encourage 
participation from, these parties.

E. The board should ensure that workforce 

policies and practices are consistent with the 
company’s values and support its long term 
sustainable success. The workforce should 
be able to raise any matters of concern.

125

The Taylor Wimpey plc Board is collectively responsible for creating the sustainable long term success of the business for the mutual benefit of 
all of our stakeholders. The Board does this by providing strategic and entrepreneurial leadership within a framework of strong governance and 
effective controls.
The Company’s clear and effective governance structure is a key foundation to success. This framework is clearly documented in the Articles of 
Association, Division of Responsibilities, Schedule of Matters Reserved for the Board and Terms of Reference for each Board Committee, which 
can all be found on our website. Our governance structure ensures that the Board and its Committees, the Group Management Team (GMT) 
and Senior Management are able to make decisions effectively for the benefit of all of our stakeholders.

The Board ensures that the Company’s purpose, values, strategy and culture are aligned.
Our purpose is to build great homes and create thriving communities and our values are to be respectful and fair, take responsibility, create a 
better tomorrow and to be proud. The Board recognises the importance of a healthy culture and considers the Company’s culture of ‘doing the 
right thing’ as a key strength of the business.
The Board is responsible for defining and setting the Company’s culture from the top, and the Board and GMT as a whole are responsible for 
leading by example.

Our Chief Executive leads the GMT in the execution of our strategy and the day to day management of the Company’s operations. The GMT is 
a vastly experienced team that has operated in challenging market conditions, with collectively over 150 years of service at Taylor Wimpey and 
even longer in the housebuilding industry.
At each Board meeting, the Board receives updates from each GMT member, along with key Heads of Functions to provide updates on key 
stakeholder groups, performance in the period and employee matters. The Board also receive regular reports and minutes from the Company’s 
Treasury Committee, which is chaired by the Group Finance Director.
There is a framework of delegated authority approved by the Board, within which the individual responsibilities of Senior Management are 
identified and can be monitored.

The Board actively seeks and encourages regular engagement with all of our stakeholders and believes that responding to feedback supports 
the long term sustainability of our business.

The Company has a number of workforce policies and practices which are available on our website.
The Whistleblowing Policy provides a clear procedure for employees to report concerns either to their line manager or through a third party 
whistleblowing hotline if they wish to remain anonymous. All whistleblowing cases are investigated by the Head of Internal Audit, Group HR 
Director, the Head of HSE and /or the Group General Counsel and Company Secretary, depending on the nature of the matter. The Board 
receives half yearly whistleblowing updates which set out any issues raised during the period and interim updates on significant matters. 
The updates provided are anonymous and summarise the result of any investigation.
The Company has policies on its zero tolerance approach to bribery and corruption which are shared across the business annually. Individuals 
are requested to review training videos on anti-corruption; anti money laundering and competition law and are asked to confirm continued 
compliance with the policies.

2. Division of responsibilities

Principle

Application

F.  The chair leads the board and is responsible 
for its overall effectiveness in directing the 
company. They should demonstrate objective 
judgement throughout their tenure and 
promote a culture of openness and debate. 
In addition, the chair facilitates constructive 
board relations and the effective contribution 
of all non executive directors, and ensures 
that directors receive accurate, timely and 
clear information. 

G. The board should include an appropriate 

combination of executive and non executive 
(and, in particular, independent non executive) 
directors, such that no one individual or small 
group of individuals dominates the board’s 
decision making. There should be a clear 
division of responsibilities between the 
leadership of the board and the executive 
leadership of the company’s business.

H. Non executive directors should have sufficient 

time to meet their board responsibilities. 
They should provide constructive challenge, 
strategic guidance, offer specialist advice 
and hold management to account.

I.  The board, supported by the company 
secretary, should ensure that it has the 
policies, processes, information, time and 
resources it needs in order to function 
effectively and efficiently.

The roles and responsibilities of the Chair, Chief Executive, Senior Independent Director and Employee Champion are reviewed annually and 
signed by the relevant parties. The Division of Responsibilities document is available on our website.
To support the effective discharge of the Board’s responsibilities, the Chair and Chief Executive maintain regular dialogue outside of the 
boardroom to ensure an effective and ongoing flow of information.
The Chair is also in contact with the Group Finance Director and Non Executive Directors on a regular basis between meetings.

The Board consists of nine Directors, including the Chair, two Executive Directors, five independent Non Executive Directors and one non 
independent Non Executive Director. The Board considers this balance to remain appropriate and will continue to keep this under review 
during 2024.
The roles of the Chair and the Chief Executive are separate; clearly defined in detail; and reviewed annually.
The Board and individual Directors are supported by the Group General Counsel and Company Secretary, to whom they have access at 
all times.

In between Board meetings, Non Executive Directors have access to Senior Management at all times. Non Executive Directors are encouraged 
to visit regional businesses and sites. In 2023, the Non Executive Directors completed 30 regional business visits and 20 site visits. In 2024, 
each Non Executive Director is requested to visit at least one regional business or site per quarter.

The Directors receive information one week before meetings take place to allow sufficient time for a detailed review of the documentation. 

126

Taylor Wimpey plc Annual Report and Accounts 2023Strategic reportDirectors’ reportFinancial statementsShareholder informationCompliance statement continued

3. Composition, succession and evaluation

Principle

Application

J.  Appointments to the board should be subject 
to formal, rigorous and transparent procedure, 
and an effective succession plan should be 
maintained for board and senior 
management. Both appointments and 
succession plans should be based on merit 
and objective criteria and, within this context, 
should promote diversity of gender, social 
and ethnic backgrounds, cognitive and 
personal strengths. 

K. The board and its committees should have 
a combination of skills, experience and 
knowledge. Consideration should be given to 
the length of service of the board as a whole 
and membership regularly refreshed.

L. Annual evaluation of the board should 

consider its composition, diversity and how 
effectively members work together to achieve 
objectives. Individual evaluation should 
demonstrate whether each director continues 
to contribute effectively. 

All Board appointments are subject to formal, rigorous and transparent procedures, are based on merit and objective criteria and promote 
diversity of gender, social and ethnic background, and cognitive and personal strengths.
The Nomination and Governance Committee considers the succession plans for the Board, GMT, Heads of Functions as well as wider 
workforce planning for certain roles including our regional businesses’ managing directors.

The Board members’ skills, experience and knowledge are considered to be varied and appropriately balanced.
The Nomination and Governance Committee consider the tenure of Non Executive Directors and are conscious that the Code does not 
consider them to be independent after they have served on the Board for nine years.

The Board undertakes a formal and rigorous evaluation of the performance of the Board, its Committees, the Chair and individual Directors on 
an annual basis. At least every three years, this process is externally facilitated, most recently for the 2023 Board evaluation. 

4. Audit, risk and internal control

Principle

Application

M. The board should establish formal and 
transparent policies and procedures 
to ensure the independence and 
effectiveness of internal and external audit 
functions and satisfy itself on the integrity 
of financial and narrative statements.

N. The board should present a fair, balanced 
and understandable assessment of the 
company’s position and prospects.

The Audit Committee evaluated the performance of the external Auditor and concluded that the audit process continues to be effective; that the 
quality and sufficiency of PwC’s engagement team remains appropriate; that PwC remain independent; and that there continue to be effective 
and independent reporting lines available to the external Auditors direct to the Committee and its Chair.
The Head of Internal Audit reports directly to the Chair of the Audit Committee, with a secondary reporting line to the Group Finance Director, 
which protects the function’s independence. The most recent independent evaluation of Internal Audit’s independence and performance was 
carried out during 2021, as described in the Annual Report and Accounts 2021, and found that Internal Audit continues to operate effectively, 
with no areas of non-conformance with recommended practice as set out in the International Professional Practice Framework. Continuous 
improvement initiatives agreed at that time, have been implemented, to ensure the Internal Audit function continues to meet both current best 
practice and the evolving needs of the Group.

The Audit Committee considered whether, in its opinion, the Annual Report and Accounts 2023, taken as a whole is fair, balanced and 
understandable, and that they include the information necessary for shareholders to assess the Group’s position, performance, business model 
and strategy. The Audit Committee completed a review process and recommended to the Board the approval of the Annual Report and 
Accounts 2023.

127

Taylor Wimpey plc Annual Report and Accounts 2023Strategic reportDirectors’ reportFinancial statementsShareholder information 
 
Compliance statement continued

4. Audit, risk and internal control continued

Principle

Application

O. The board should establish procedures to 
manage risk, oversee the internal control 
framework, and determine the nature and 
extent of the Principal risks the company is 
willing to take in order to achieve its long term 
strategic objectives.

The Company has an established ongoing process of risk management and the Audit Committee monitors the risk management and internal 
control systems, including their effectiveness, on behalf of the Board and provides advice to the Board in connection with the Board’s own 
risk review.

5. Remuneration

Principle

Application

P.  Remuneration policies and practices should 

be designed to support strategy and promote 
long term sustainable success. Executive 
remuneration should be aligned to company 
purpose and values, and be clearly linked to 
the successful delivery of the company’s 
long term strategy.

Q. A formal and transparent procedure 
for developing policy on executive 
remuneration and determining director and 
senior management remuneration should be 
established. No director should be involved in 
deciding their own remuneration outcome.

The Remuneration Committee ensures that the remuneration of Executive Directors and Senior Management is aligned to the Company’s 
strategic objectives. It is key that the Company is able to attract and retain leaders who are focused and also appropriately incentivised to deliver 
the Company’s strategic objectives, within a framework that is aligned to the long term interests of the Company’s stakeholders. 

The Remuneration Committee regularly reviews the Remuneration Policy (the Policy) and it is put to a shareholder vote at least every three years. 
The Committee considers that the Policy aligns with market practice, the Code requirements and investor guidelines.
No Director or Senior Management is involved in any decisions about his or her own remuneration.

R. Directors should exercise independent 

judgement and discretion when authorising 
remuneration outcomes, taking account of 
company and individual performance, and 
wider circumstances.

The Remuneration Committee recognises that the exercise of discretion must be undertaken in a careful and considered way as it is an area 
that will rightly come under scrutiny from shareholders and other stakeholders. The Committee confirms that any exercise of discretion would 
be within the available discretions set out in the Remuneration Policy and that the maximum levels available under any relevant plans would 
not be exceeded. There would be full disclosure in the following Directors’ Remuneration Report and major shareholders would be consulted 
if appropriate.

Dear Shareholder

As Chair of the Remuneration Committee 
(the Committee), I am pleased to present our 
2023 Directors’ Remuneration Report on behalf 
of the Board. 

Remuneration Policy

Following our detailed policy review in late 2022 
and early 2023, our current Policy was approved by 
shareholders at the 2023 AGM with over 91% of 
shareholders voting in favour. I would like to thank 
you all for your engagement throughout the Policy 
review process and your continued support.

The Committee considers that the Policy continues 
to remain appropriate and should therefore continue 
to operate in the same manner during 2024.

Executive Director remuneration decisions 
and outcomes

Variable incentive schemes

In 2023, Taylor Wimpey and the wider housebuilding 
sector’s volumes and earnings were impacted by 
the reduction in customers’ affordability as a result 
of increased mortgage rates. Under the 2023 
Executive Incentive Scheme (EIS), Management has 
delivered a good financial performance with profit 
at the top end of our guidance and completions in 
line with guidance and has also delivered good 
progress against our ESG measures in 2023. 
Based on the performance assessment set out on 
page 142, this resulted in an overall outcome of 
91% of maximum. In line with the Policy, one third 
of the 2023 EIS will be deferred into shares for 
three years.

The Performance Share Plan (PSP) awarded in 
2021, measuring performance in the 2021 to 2023 
period, will vest at 40% of maximum. The Company 
did not meet threshold performance for return on 
net operation assets (RONOA), operating profit 
margin and customer service but Taylor Wimpey’s 
total shareholder return (TSR) of +7.7% placed the 
Company in the top quartile of the housebuilding 
peer group over this period. The shares vesting 
will be subject to a two year post-vesting 
holding period.

No discretion was used or deemed to be required 
by the Committee under either the EIS or PSP. 
The Committee noted the delay to the EIS and PSP 
target-setting process in 2023 as a result of the 
market conditions at the time. The later timing of 
the target-setting process enabled more 
appropriate target ranges to be set for the financial 
measures, which were higher than the ranges that 
would have been set around the original business 
plan numbers at the start of the year, with the target 
level of performance set ahead of the budget level. 

Furthermore, at the end of the year the Committee 
assessed the formula-driven outturn and 
determined that the level of payout across the 
EIS measures was appropriate and reflective of 
strong management performance in the face of 
significant headwinds, with a rigorous focus on 
cost discipline and volumes in order to deliver 
profit for the year at the top end of guidance. 
The Committee also considered shareholder and 
broader stakeholder experience over the year. 
In particular, the differentiated dividend policy 
underpinning shareholder returns and the payout 
levels under the broader all employee bonus plans 
which is broadly reflective of the 2023 EIS. 

Accordingly, the Committee did not exercise any 
discretion to adjust any formula driven outturn in 
relation to the EIS. 

The Committee has also determined that the 
PSP Award value on vesting was in line with 
underlying performance and there was no windfall 
gain due to market share price movements.

The Committee did not adjust the EIS or PSP 
performance targets during 2023. Further details 
on both the EIS and PSP outcomes can be found 
on page 142.

Looking ahead to 2024

Salary and pension

The salaries for the Executive Directors will be 
increased by 3% with effect from 1 April 2024. This 
is in line with the Senior Management population, 
and lower than the 5% average increase for the 
wider workforce.

EIS

Executive Directors will continue to be able to earn 
up to 150% of salary under the 2024 EIS. The EIS 
performance measures for 2024 remain unchanged 
from 2023, with 70% of the outcome to be 
determined against financial metrics, and the 
remainder against build quality and customer 
satisfaction assessments.

The measures are set out on page 144 together 
with the strategic rationale. We consider the target 
ranges carefully each year, ensuring an appropriate 
balance between achievability and stretch. Detailed 
retrospective disclosure of the weightings, targets 
and performance against them will be provided next 
year in the usual way.

132

Taylor Wimpey plc Annual Report and Accounts 2023Strategic reportDirectors’ reportFinancial statementsShareholder informationRemuneration Committee report continued

PSP

The PSP will operate in accordance with the Policy 
and it is expected that Executive Directors will be 
granted awards to the value of 200% of salary.

In line with the 2023 Award, the measures for the 
2024 Award will be based on relative TSR versus a 
sector peer group, operating profit margin, RONOA, 
customer service and carbon emissions reductions. 
The measures and targets are set out on page 145 
together with the strategic rationale.

To the extent the awards vest, any shares will be 
subject to a two year holding period.

Chair and Non Executive Director

The Committee reviewed the Chair’s fee and agreed 
an increase of 3%, in line with the increase provided 
to the Executive Directors. The Board, excluding 
the Non Executive Directors who were conflicted, 
also reviewed the fees payable to the Non Executive 
Directors and agreed the same increase of 3% with 
effect from 1 April 2024. Further information on the 
Chair and Non Executive Director fees is set out on 
page 147.

Wider workforce remuneration

We continue to review the remuneration 
arrangements for the wider workforce and take 
these into account when considering remuneration 
arrangements for the Executive Directors and 
Senior Management. We again reviewed the 
performance measures in the various annual bonus 
schemes available across the business and we 
are confident that they drive behaviours that are 
consistent with our purpose, values, culture 
and strategy.

133

The Committee reviewed the approach taken in 
respect of wider workforce remuneration in light 
of the continuing cost of living challenges and 
approved the continuation of the tiered approach 
to the salary review process for 2024, ensuring that 
lower paid employees receive a higher percentage. 
The salary increases approved by the Committee 
range from 3% to 6%, and as previously mentioned, 
the Executive Directors and Senior Management 
will all receive 3%. The average workforce increase 
is 5%. We are confident that the variable incentive 
arrangements available for the wider workforce are 
aligned to Senior Management, including the 
Executive Directors.

For more information on our approach to wider 
workforce remuneration, see pages 149 to 151.

Stakeholder engagement

As part of the Policy review process undertaken 
in 2023, I wrote to 26 institutional shareholders 
representing circa 60% of our issued share capital 
to provide an overview of the proposed minor 
amendments. The feedback received was positive 
and constructive. 

The Employee Champions Robert Noel and 
subsequently Mark Castle (who are also members 
of the Committee) engaged with the workforce via 
the National Employee Forum (NEF) through the year 
and brought this perspective into the Committee 
discussions. The NEF received three updates on 
remuneration during the year; one relating to the 
Policy review process and two relating to wider 
workforce remuneration where the NEF received 
an overview of the 2023 bonus payment and 
2023 salary review process. The Committee were 
pleased with the positive feedback received from 
the NEF members regarding the tiered approach 
taken by the Committee for the 2023 salary review.

Closing remarks

On behalf of the Committee, I would like to thank 
shareholders for their engagement to date and look 
forward to their support for the decisions and 
rationale set forth in this report.

Introduction

The 2023 Remuneration Committee report includes disclosures which 
reflect in full the Regulations (as defined below) on remuneration 
reporting, divided into three sections:

•  The annual statement from the Committee Chair.

•  Remuneration Policy: a summary of the Policy that was approved 

by shareholders at the 2023 AGM, describing the framework within 
which the Company remunerates its Directors. 

•  Annual Report on Remuneration: this sets out how the current 

Policy was applied during 2023 and how the Policy will be operated 
during 2024.

The Policy and these remuneration reports have been prepared in 
accordance with the relevant provisions of the Companies Act 2006 
and on the basis prescribed in the Large and Medium-sized 
Companies and Groups (Accounts and Reports) Regulations 
(Amendment) 2008 (the Regulations). Where required, data has been 
audited by PwC and this is indicated.

Summary of the Remuneration Policy 

This alignment is achieved through a combination of:

The current Directors’ Remuneration Policy (the Policy) was approved by 91.7% of shareholders 
at the 2023 AGM. The Policy is designed to ensure that the remuneration framework will support 
and drive forward the Taylor Wimpey strategy by both challenging and motivating the Executive 
Directors and Senior Management to deliver it, and this will in turn drive value for our shareholders 
whilst having due regard to our other stakeholders. 

A summary of the Policy is set out in this report with the full version, as approved by 
shareholders, available to view on the Company’s website and in the 2022 Annual Report 
and Accounts.

When the Committee designed the Policy and its operation, it has considered the factors in 
Provision 40 of the 2018 UK Corporate Governance Code (the Code). Full details on how clarity, 
simplicity, risk, predictability, proportionality and alignment to culture are addressed can be 
found on page 140.

Policy overview

A key part of the Committee’s role is to ensure that the remuneration of Executive Directors 
and Senior Management is aligned to the Company’s strategic objectives. It is key that the 
Company is able to attract and retain leaders who are focused and also appropriately 
incentivised to deliver the Company’s strategic objectives, within a framework that is aligned 
with the long term interests of the Company’s shareholders.

•  Performance measures for the EIS and PSP aligned with Key Performance Indicators, 

the Company’s strategic objectives and measures of sustainable performance.

•  Deferral into shares of a percentage of the EIS.

•  A two year retention period for vested PSP Awards.

•  Share ownership guidelines which require executives to build up holdings of Taylor Wimpey 

shares, either directly or by retaining vested PSP Awards and deferred EIS amounts.

•  A post-employment shareholding requirement.

•  Robust malus and clawback provisions.

The above requirements ensure that a significant percentage of the overall remuneration 
package of our Executive Directors and Senior Management is subject to performance and 
delivered in shares which must be held long term. With all packages for our Executive Directors 
substantially geared towards meeting challenging targets set under the EIS and PSP, the 
Committee believes that the pay and benefits of its Executive Directors and Senior Management 
adequately balance reward and risk.

In line with best practice, the Committee structures the incentives for Executive Directors and 
Senior Management in a way that ensures they will not raise ESG risks by inadvertently 
motivating irresponsible behaviour. More generally, the Committee under its Terms of Reference 
may, where it considers appropriate, take ESG matters into account when considering the 
overall remuneration structure and as part of its overall discretion.

Salary

Purpose and link to strategy Operation

Maximum

To recruit and reward 
Executive Directors of 
a suitable calibre for the 
role and duties required.

Salaries are normally reviewed annually to ensure that they remain positioned 
appropriately. There is no automatic entitlement to an increase each year.
Salary level and increases take into account the following:
•  The performance, role, and responsibility of each individual Executive Director;
•  The economic climate, general market conditions and the performance of 

the Company;

•  The level of pay awards across the rest of the business; and
•  Salary levels in comparably-sized companies and other major housebuilders.

The maximum annual salary increase will not 
normally exceed the average increase which 
applies across the wider workforce.
However, larger increases may be awarded 
in certain circumstances including but not 
limited to:
•  Increase in scope or responsibilities of the role.
•  To apply salary progression for a newly/
recently appointed Executive Director.

•  Where the Director’s salary has fallen below 

the market positioning.

Performance targets

Company and 
individual 
performance 
are factors 
considered when 
reviewing salaries.

Chair of 
the Board 
and Non 
Executive 
Director 
fees

The Chair and Non 
Executive Directors’ fees 
should be structured in 
line with recognised best 
practice and be sufficient 
to attract and retain high 
calibre non executives.

Fees consist of a single consolidated fee for the Chair, an annual fee for the 
other Non Executive Directors and additional fees for roles such as the Chair 
of the Audit Committee, Chair of the Remuneration Committee, Senior 
Independent Director and Employee Champion.
Set by reference to the responsibilities undertaken by the non executive, taking 
into account that each Non Executive Director is expected to be a member of 
the Nomination and Governance Committee and / or the Audit Committee 
and / or the Remuneration Committee.
Reviewed periodically but generally annually and at least every other year. Takes 
into account levels in comparably-sized companies and other major housebuilders.
Non Executive Directors do not participate in any incentive, share scheme, 
employee benefits or pension arrangements.
Any reasonable expenses incurred in carrying out duties will be fully reimbursed 
including any personal taxation associated with such expenses.

Aggregate annual limit of £1 million imposed 
by the Company’s Articles of Association.

N/A

Other 
benefits, 
including 
benefits- 
in-kind

Provides a competitive 
package of benefits to 
assist with recruitment 
and retention of high 
calibre Executive 
Directors.

Benefits normally include, but are not limited to:
•  Company-provided car or a cash allowance;
•  Healthcare; 
•  Life assurance; and
•  A 5% discount on the price of a new home acquired from the Group. 
Benefits offered to the wider workforce may also be offered to Executive 
Directors.
Other market competitive benefits may also be offered by the Committee 
should it deem it appropriate to secure the appointment of a new Executive 
Director or retain an Executive Director (including legacy benefits) and to ensure 
that the benefits package for existing Executive Directors remains competitive 
in the market.

There is no formal maximum. The level of a 
benefit provided will be aligned to the wider 
workforce but may vary depending on seniority. 
Benefits are provided based on market rates.
For home purchases, the price discount is 
calculated at the plot release price less the 
average discount to third party buyers for that 
house type on that development, less a further 
5% employee discount. No more than one home 
per annum can be acquired at a discount under 
the scheme; and no more than three homes can 
be acquired in a five-year period. The maximum 
discount over a five-year period is £100,000.

EIS awards are normally determined by the Committee after the year end, based 
on annual performance against targets set at the beginning of each year.
One-third (net) of any EIS is payable in shares which are held in trust for three years.
The Committee has the ability to adjust the amount of a bonus if the formulaic 
outcome is not considered reflective of individual or business performance or 
the broader shareholder experience.
A malus and clawback mechanism applies to all participants. The discovery 
period for the event that would give rise to the clawback is three years from the 
date of payment.

The maximum EIS opportunity for Executive 
Directors is 150% of salary. Target is 75% 
of salary.
If an entry level of performance is achieved 
up to 10% of maximum is payable under 
each metric.

Executive Directors can receive PSP Awards, granted annually.
Performance is normally measured over three financial years.
The value of dividends or other distributions will accrue during the performance 
and holding periods and will be received with any shares that vest. Value of 
accrued dividends will normally be accrued and paid in shares.
The Committee has the ability to adjust the awards if the formulaic outcome is 
not considered reflective of individual or business performance or the broader 
shareholder experience.
A malus and clawback mechanism applies to all participants. The discovery 
period for the event that would give rise to the clawback is three years from the 
date of payment.

The maximum award is normally over 
shares with a face value of 200% of salary. 
In exceptional circumstances this can be 
increased up to 300% of salary.
Awards vest at 25% for threshold performance.

Pension benefits are provided through one or more of the following 
arrangements:
•  Personal Choice Plan; or
•  as a cash allowance.

Company contributions to any pension 
scheme, or any amount paid as a cash 
allowance, in respect of current Executive 
Directors or a new Executive Director will be 
in line with the pension contribution rate 
applying to the majority of the workforce, 
currently 10% of salary.

Rewards the achievement 
of stretching financial 
performance targets 
and other objectives 
that support the 
Company’s annual 
and strategic goals.
Compulsory deferral 
in shares further 
aligns the interests 
of Executive Directors 
with shareholders.

Annual grants of 
share-based long term 
incentives assist with 
retention, incentivisation 
and motivation of 
Executive Directors to 
achieve long term 
sustainable returns for 
shareholders. A post-
vesting holding period 
helps align the interests 
of Executive Directors 
with those of the 
Company’s shareholders.

The Company aims to 
provide competitive 
retirement benefits.

Executive Directors are expected to achieve and maintain a holding of the 
Company’s shares at least equal to 200% of salary and until this level is 
achieved, are required to retain no less than 50% of the value of any vested EIS, 
deferred bonus shares or PSP Awards, after tax.
A post-employment shareholding requirement will require Executive Directors to 
hold 200% of salary, or their shareholding level at the time of cessation if their 
200% shareholding requirement has not yet been met, for at least two years. 
This requirement may be reduced by the Committee in exceptional 
circumstances, such as serious ill-health.

Executive Directors: 200% of salary.

Annual Report on Remuneration

This section sets out how the Policy was applied for the year ended 31 December 2023. The 
Annual Report on Remuneration, including the Chair’s annual statement on pages 131 to 133, 
will be put to an advisory shareholder vote at the AGM on 23 April 2024. Details of the 
resolution are set out in the Notice of Meeting on page 231.

During the year, the Policy (as approved by shareholders at the 2023 AGM), operated as 
intended providing a robust link between Company performance and remuneration and the 
Committee has not used discretion or adjusted performance measures and the respective 
targets during the year.

Complying with the UK Corporate Governance Code in 2023

•  A consistent approach to Directors’ remuneration has 
operated over many years and our disclosures in the 
Directors’ Remuneration Reports are set out in a 
transparent manner.

•  There is a proactive and open approach to engaging 

with shareholders and the wider workforce, as 
described on page 133.

•  Executive Director remuneration arrangements have 

been designed to be as simple as possible.

•  The tables on pages 134 and 135 show the different 
elements of Executive Director remuneration and how 
the performance measures are linked to our strategic 
cornerstones, KPIs and stakeholders.

•  Risk is mitigated through careful plan design, including 

long term performance measurement, deferral, 
shareholding requirements (including post cessation 
of employment requirements), discretion and 
clawback mechanisms.

•  The performance measures and targets used for the 

incentive plans do not encourage the Executive 
Directors to take reputational or behavioural risks.

•  The range of likely performance outcomes is 

considered when setting performance target ranges 
and discretion is used where necessary.

Clarity – remuneration 
arrangements should be 
transparent and promote effective 
engagement with shareholders and 
the workforce. 

Simplicity – remuneration 
structures should avoid complexity 
and their rationale and operation 
should be easy to understand.

Risk – remuneration arrangements 
should ensure reputational and 
other risks from excessive rewards, 
and behavioural risks that can arise 
from target-based plans, are 
identified and mitigated.

Predictability – the range of 
possible values of rewards to 
individual Directors and any other 
limits or discretions should be 
identified and explained at the time 
of approving the policy.

140

Proportionality – the link between 
individual awards, the delivery of 
strategy and the long term 
performance of the Company 
should be clear. Outcomes should 
not reward poor performance.

Alignment to culture – 
incentive arrangements should drive 
behaviours consistent 
with Company purpose, values 
and strategy.

•  Incentive plans are determined based on a proportion 
of base salary so there is a sensible balance between 
fixed pay and performance-linked elements.

•  Performance conditions are aligned to the business 

strategy and shareholder experience.

•  There are provisions to override the formula-driven 

outcome of incentive arrangements, as well as deferral 
and clawback mechanisms to ensure that poor 
performance is not rewarded.

•  Our overall reward framework embeds our purpose and 

values. Decisions on executive pay are taken in the 
context of the wider stakeholder experience.

Jennie and Chris also received pension allowances of £68,183 (2022: £67,407) and £43,103 
(2022: £68,600) respectively in lieu of Company pension contributions over the Tapered Annual 
Allowance limit introduced in April 2016. No additional benefit is accrued if an Executive Director 
retires early.

(a)  Jennie Daly – Jennie became Chief Executive on 26 April 2022 and her 2022 EIS payment was pro-rated to time as Group 

Operations Director and Chief Executive.

(b)  Benefits – corresponds to the value of taxable benefits in respect of the year ended 31 December 2023, as set out in the table 

EIS in 2023 (audited)

(c)  Pension – these figures represent pension contributions up to the amount permissible under HMRC rules and cash allowances 

beyond that level.

(d)  EIS – the 2023 EIS outcome was 91% and further details can be found on this page and page 142. The 2022 EIS outcome was 
76%. For both years, one third of the Executive Directors bonus is deferred into shares for three years. These shares will not be 
subject to any further performance or non-performance measures.

(e)  PSP – the outcomes of the 2020 and 2021 PSP Awards included in the 2022 and 2023 columns can be found on page 143. 
Both figures include the value of dividends accrued during the performance period and are payable in shares. There is a compulsory 
two year holding period for any vested PSP shares and the dividend shares will also be subject to this holding period. The 2022 
figure has been restated to reflect the share price on the date the Award vested. The 2023 figure has been calculated using a share 
price of 123.30 pence as this was the average share price for the dealing days in the last three months of the financial year.

Salaries in 2023 (audited)

The Committee awarded Jennie Daly and Chris Carney a 3% increase, with effect from 1 April

At the start of the year, the Committee carefully considered the approach to target setting for 
the 2023 EIS, in light of the sharp and sudden downturn in market conditions during Autumn 
2022, relating to volume and the continuing volatility in build cost inflation.

As noted in last year’s Directors’ Remuneration Report, recognising that the uncertain market 
conditions required an enhanced focus on financial performance, the proportion based on 
financial measures was increased from 60% to 70% of the overall bonus opportunity. It was 
also noted that the finalisation of the precise weightings and targets would be delayed slightly 
until after the publication of the 2022 Annual Report and Accounts.

The Committee finalised the weightings and targets in early April 2023. Within the 70% financial 
element, the balance between operating profit, operating profit margin and cash conversion 
changed slightly from the 2022 EIS, to give a higher proportionate focus on margin and cash 
conversion. The timing of the target-setting process enabled more appropriate target ranges to 
be set for the financial measures, which were higher than the ranges that would have been set 
around the original business plan numbers at the start of the year, with the target level of 
performance set ahead of the budget level.

The outcome of the 2023 EIS is 91% of the maximum and the chart below shows the

The PSP awarded in 2021, measuring performance in the 2021 to 2023 period, will vest at 40% 
of maximum. The Company did not meet threshold performance for RONOA, operating profit 
margin and customer service but Taylor Wimpey’s TSR of +7.7% placed the Company in the 
top quartile of the housebuilding peer group over this period. The Committee determined that 
the outcome was not inflated by windfall gains as the 2021 Award was granted using a share 
price of 174.02 pence.

Vistry Group in November 2022. For the purpose of assessing the TSR performance of Countryside Partnerships, its 
performance has been tracked forward using the performance of Vistry Group (the acquirer) from the date trading in the shares

At the end of the year the Committee assessed the formula-driven outturn and determined that 
the level of payout across the EIS measures was appropriate and reflective of strong 
management performance with a rigorous focus on cost discipline and volumes delivering full 
year profit at the top end of guidance in light of significant market uncertainty. The Committee 
also considered shareholder and broader stakeholder experience over the year. In particular, 
the differentiated dividend policy underpinning shareholder returns and the payout levels under 
the broader all employee bonus plans which is broadly reflective of the 2023 EIS. Accordingly, 
the Committee did not exercise any discretion to adjust any formula driven outturns in relation 
to the EIS.

One third of the Executive Directors’ EIS will be paid in shares and be required to be retained in 
the Company’s Employee Benefit Trust for three years. These shares will not be subject to any 
further performance or non-performance measures.

(a)  The 2021 PSP Award is included in the 2023 single total remuneration figure. The performance against each of the performance measures is noted in the graph on page 142. A share price of 123.30 pence was used to calculate the value of the Award vesting on 28 

February 2024 as this was the average share price for the dealing days in the last three months of the financial year. This figure will be recalculated in the Annual Report and Accounts 2024 to reflect the share price on the date the Award vests. Dividend equivalents 
will be paid in shares.

(b)  The 2020 PSP Award is included in the 2022 single total remuneration figure. The overall performance of the Award can be seen on page 139 of the Annual Report and Accounts 2022. The closing share price on the date the Award vested (116.75 pence) has been 

used to recalculate the Award. Dividend equivalents were paid in shares.

PSP Awards granted during 2023

The tables below set out the PSP Awards granted during the year and the performance measures for the Award. The Committee consider that they provide a good overall balance in assessing 
our longer term performance against the business strategy. The targets were reviewed to reflect current market conditions and business forecasts for the Group.

Recognising the outlook over the performance period for lower profitability across the entire housing sector and continuing economic uncertainty, the Committee set the target ranges for operating 
profit margin and RONOA at lower levels and with a broader range between threshold and maximum than in previous years, to provide the appropriate balance between setting targets that are 
achievable, but at the same time stretching. The target ranges for all measures are, in the view of the Committee, equivalently challenging to the ranges set in prior years. Operating profit margin 
and RONOA will be assessed based on performance in 2025. This was considered preferable to measuring performance based on a three-year average, due to continued unusually high volatility 
in the market in 2023 and which was considered likely to continue into 2024.

Payments for loss of office and payments to former Directors (audited)

2024 EIS

No payments have been made for loss of office during 2023.

Pete Redfern, former Chief Executive, received a 2021 PSP Award of 1,004,687 shares, which 
has been pro-rated to the date he left the business on 8 December 2022. The basis for the 
treatment of this Award, together with other elements of his remuneration, was set out in the 
Annual Report and Accounts 2022 and as set out on page 142 of this report, the Award will 
vest at 40% of maximum based on performance from 1 January 2021 to 31 December 2023. 
Accordingly, Pete will receive 309,665 shares (which includes accrued dividend shares) on 
28 February 2024, which are equivalent in value to £381,817. Pete will be required to retain 
the vested shares for a two year holding period. This is consistent with Pete’s remuneration 
arrangements as disclosed in the Annual Report and Accounts 2022.

Approach to remuneration in 2024

2024 salary review

The Committee has approved a tiered approach to the Group salary review process for 2024, 
ensuring that lower paid employees receive a higher percentage. The salary increases approved 
by the Committee range from 3% to 6%, and the Executive Directors and Senior Management 
will all receive 3%.

Directors will be able to earn up to 150% of salary under the 2024 EIS. The EIS performance 
measures for 2024 also remain in line with 2023, with a 70% weighting on financial performance 
recognising the importance in a challenging market. The measures are set out below together 
with the strategic rationale. We carefully consider the target ranges each year, ensuring an 
appropriate balance between achievability and stretch. Detailed retrospective disclosure of the 
weightings, targets and performance against them will be provided next year in the usual way.

2024 PSP Awards 

The 2024 PSP awards will operate in accordance with the Policy as set out on page 138. In line with normal practice, it is expected that Directors will be granted awards to the value of 200% 
of salary.

The measures and weightings will be in line with the 2023 Awards, which for the first time included an ESG measure based on a reduction to our Scope 1 and 2 targets linked to our zero carbon 
strategy. This provides a balanced approach to assessing long-term performance including financial, shareholder and customer metrics.

(a)  The peer group comprises Barratt Developments, Bellway, Berkeley Homes, Crest Nicholson, Persimmon, Redrow and Vistry Group. Should the proposed acquisition of Redrow PLC by Barratt Developments complete, Redrow would be removed from the peer 

group. It may be replaced by another housebuilder and the basis for measuring TSR performance may change from a peer group approach to a different methodology, including basing the performance assessment on an index of the housebuilding sector.

(b)  An operating profit margin measure will also operate in both the EIS and PSP in 2024. As there continues to be uncertainty in relation to the housing market, we believe that this is a critical measure at both an operational level for the EIS and for the longer term for 
the PSP (where margin will be assessed as an aggregate across the full three-year period). This will ensure that our priority remains delivering our sustained profitability with an unremitting focus on long term decisions with cost and process discipline to drive 
shareholder returns over the medium term.

(c)  This will be based on the single question ‘Would you recommend your builder to a friend?’ from the independently measured NHBC 9-month survey, therefore is measured on a different basis to the 2024 EIS customer service measure. Customer Service continues 
to be an extremely important area of focus for the Company and we are comfortable that this should be incorporated in both the EIS and PSP. The customer service element of the EIS will continue to be based on the one key question in the shorter term NHBC 
8-week survey focusing on the customers’ service before and moving in experience. The customer service element of the PSP will continue to be based on the one key question in the longer term NHBC 9-month survey focusing on the customers’ experience of 
living longer term in one of our developments. In this way we will be capturing different aspects of our customer service performance, measured over different timeframes and measuring different customer experiences and there is no doubling up of reward for the 
same performance.

(d)  This will be based on a reduction in absolute Scope 1 and 2 carbon emissions and the target range takes into account the anticipated higher volumes in 2026.

(a)  All outstanding awards are options. The Directors do not hold any vested but unexercised share options.

(b)  The Executive Directors exercised an EIS deferred share award on 27 March 2023 when the share price was 117.13 pence. These shares were awarded on 25 March 2020 using a share price of 116.30 pence to calculate the number of shares awarded. From 

March 2022, all EIS deferred shares are now beneficially owned from the outset and are included in the table on page 147. The beneficially owned EIS deferred shares are not subject to further performance conditions.

(c)  The Executive Directors exercised their 2020 PSP Award on 2 March 2023 when the share price was 117.7 pence. These shares were awarded on 4 March 2020 using a share price of 204.30 pence to calculate the Award.

(d)  Chris Carney had 9,431 Sharesave options lapse on 31 May 2023. Jennie Daly and Chris each hold 36,057 Sharesave options which were granted on 3 October 2022 at an option price of 83.20 pence, which offered a 20% discount to the share price at the start of 

the invitation window. The face value of these options on the date of grant for Jennie and Chris was £32,603 each. The Sharesave options are not subject to any performance conditions.

The vesting of the PSP is subject to the achievement of performance conditions and for 2023 Awards onwards 25% of maximum is receivable if threshold performance is achieved (2022 Awards 
and prior, 20% of maximum is receivable if threshold performance is achieved). There have been no variations to the terms and conditions or performance criteria for outstanding share awards 
during the financial year. The closing share price on 29 December 2023 was 147.05 pence and the range during the year was 99.70 pence to 147.05 pence.

In line with the Policy, Executive Directors’ shareholding requirement is to hold 200% of their 
base salary. Further details on how this element of the Policy is operated can be found on 
page 139. In addition, a post-employment shareholding guideline requires Executive Directors 
to retain shares worth 200% of their base salary, or their shareholding at the time of cessation if 
their shareholding requirement has not yet been met, for at least two years. Executive Directors 
are required to retain any shares received from shares in the Employee Benefit Trust.

The Chair and the Non Executive Directors are also encouraged to hold shares in the Company 
in order to align their interests with those of shareholders.

(a)  On 27 April 2023, Irene Dorner stood down as Chair; Robert Noel became Chair and stood down as the Senior Independent 
Director and Employee Champion; Humphrey Singer became the Senior Independent Director and Mark Castle became the 
Employee Champion.

(b)  Mark Castle and Clodagh Moriarty both joined the Board on 1 June 2022.

(c)  Jitesh Gadhia became Chair of the Remuneration Committee with effect from 26 April 2022 and therefore received the additional 

Remuneration Committee Chair fee for the remainder of the year.

Chair and Non Executive Director fees

The Committee reviewed the Chair’s fee and agreed an increase of 3%, in line with the increase 
provided to the Executive Directors. The Board, excluding the Non Executive Directors who 
were conflicted, also reviewed the fees payable to the Non Executive Directors and agreed the 
same increase of 3%. The 3% increase will also be applied to the additional fees for the roles of 
Chair of the Audit Committee, Chair of the Remuneration Committee, Senior Independent 
Director and Employee Champion.

Wider workforce remuneration in 2023

The Committee regularly monitors and reviews the Company-wide remuneration arrangements to ensure the Executive Directors’ remuneration is aligned to incentives and rewards across the 
Company. During 2023, the Committee reviewed by employee level, the different elements of pay and benefits across the Company. The Committee considers that all employees receive a reward 
package that is aligned to the Company’s purpose and culture; and is market competitive, transparent and fair. A summary of the remuneration arrangements across the workforce can be found 
below. In addition, when considering the performance measures for variable incentive schemes, the Committee ensures that there is a clear link between the performance measures in the various 
variable incentive schemes.

Wider workforce salary review

Gender pay gap

In recognition of the high levels of inflation that have created the cost of living crisis impacting 
lower paid employees most, the Committee also approved a tiered approach to the salary reviews 
in 2023 and 2024, to ensure that those that are impacted most receive higher levels of support.

(a)  The previous CEO single figures in this table have not been restated to reflect the share price on the date the relevant PSP Award 

vested. We have chosen to do this for transparency purposes so that we are comparing the ratios disclosed in previous reports.

(b)  The three representative employees were determined on 31 December 2023.

Under Option B, using the hourly rate from our 2023 gender pay gap data, three employees 
have been identified as the best equivalents of our lower quartile, median and upper quartile. 
Option B provides a clear methodology involving fewer adjustments to calculate full-time 
equivalent earnings and is likely to produce more robust reporting year on year. The Company 
believes that the median pay ratio for the year ending 31 December 2023 is consistent with the 
pay and reward policies for UK employees taken as a whole.

The Committee has reviewed the results of the calculations and is satisfied that they continue to 
be representative of the respective quartiles. Total pay and benefit figures, not including 
temporary allowances, paid during the financial year ending 31 December 2023, have been 
calculated for the employee at each quartile and for employees either side of the identified 
employees, to ensure that the employees selected are a reasonable representative based on 
their full year’s remuneration.

Due to an increase in the CEO single figure for 2023, all three ratios have increased. The increase 
in the CEO single figure was predominately a result of a higher annual bonus payout (91% outcome 
in 2023 versus 76% in 2022) coupled with the 2022 CEO single figure having been calculated 
on a pro-rated basis taking into account the appointment of Jennie Daly as CEO in April 2022.

150

As part of its review of wider workforce remuneration, the Committee also considers our gender 
pay gap. The nature of our industry means many of the high headcount roles (Sales and 
Production) are heavily male or female weighted which can impact our pay gap results if there 
are changes to these populations.

Our mean pay gap is 6%, which means that the mean pay is 6% higher for males than females. 
The movement compared to last year is largely down to a reduction in the number of 
employees during the year with a larger percentage decrease in male employees. Additionally, 
we have seen more highly paid women leave than men, as well as lower commissions being 
paid reflecting the downturn in our external market which impacts our sales teams which are 
mostly female.

Our median pay gap is 2% higher for males than females. The gap is slightly larger than last 
year and again is impacted by the reduction in headcount.

Further information can be found in our Diversity and Inclusion Report which is available on our website.

of Mark Castle and Clodagh Moriarty to the Committee on 27 April 2023.

(a)  Mark Castle and Clodagh Moriarty were appointed to the Committee on 27 April 2023.

(b)  Irene Dorner stood down from the Committee on 27 April 2023.

Internal attendees consisted of the Chief Executive, Group HR Director, Head of Reward and 
members of the Company Secretariat team. These attendees provided important information 
to the Committee and were not involved in any decisions relating to their own remuneration.

Main activities during 2023

Over the course of the year since the last Annual Report and Accounts, the Committee has:

•  Determined the 2022 EIS and 2020 PSP outcomes.
•  Determined the 2023 salary levels for the Chief Executive and Group Finance Director.
•  Agreed the targets applicable to the 2023 EIS scheme and 2023 PSP Awards.
•  Reviewed base salary levels for Senior Management.
•  Considered wider workforce remuneration arrangements. 
•  Considered how the Policy should be applied in 2024.

Committee’s performance

The Committee reviewed its Terms of Reference in 2023 and evaluated its own performance 
against them. Following this review, the Committee confirmed that the Terms of Reference 
remain appropriate.

As part of the 2023 externally facilitated Board Evaluation it was concluded that the Committee 
was fulfilling its Terms of Reference effectively and the Committee Chair was effective.

152

Advice to the Committee in 2023

The Committee keeps itself fully informed on developments and best practice in the field of 
remuneration and it seeks advice from external advisers when appropriate.

The Committee appoints its own independent remuneration advisers and during the year it 
continued to retain the services of Korn Ferry. Korn Ferry is a member of the Remuneration 
Consultants Group and signatory to its Code of Conduct. During 2023 Korn Ferry also provided 
other ad hoc remuneration services outside the scope of the Committee to the Company. 
Korn Ferry were appointed following a comprehensive tender process. Korn Ferry do not have 
any connection with the Company or any of the individual Directors.

The Committee also receives legal advice from Slaughter and May as and when necessary. 
During 2023 this advice related to the renewal of the Company’s Sharesave Plan and Share 
Incentive Plan. 

The Committee has considered the advice provided by Korn Ferry and Slaughter and May 
during the year, and is comfortable that the advice has been objective and independent.

The fees paid to the Committee’s advisers in 2023 were: Korn Ferry £120,197 (including VAT) 
on a time and materials basis (2022: £139,689); and Slaughter and May £27,000 (including 
VAT) (2022: £nil).

The Company’s Articles were adopted on 22 April 2021. The Articles may only be amended by 
a special resolution of the shareholders in a general meeting.

Appointment and replacement of Directors

The Company’s Articles, the Code and the Companies Act 2006 govern the appointment and 
retirement of Directors. Board membership and biographical details of the Directors are 
provided on pages 92 to 94. However, Directors follow the Code and stand for re-election 
annually, as described on pages 232 to 233.

Qualifying third party indemnity

In accordance with Section 234 of the Companies Act 2006 and following advice from 
Slaughter and May, the Company has granted an indemnity in favour of its Directors and 
officers and those of its Group companies, including the Trustee Directors of its Pension Trustee 
Company, for this financial year and at the date of this report. The indemnity is against the 
financial exposure that they may incur in the course of their professional duties as Directors and 
officers of the Company and/or its subsidiaries/affiliates.

Audit and Auditors

Each Director has at the date of approval of this Annual Report and Accounts, formally 
confirmed that:

•  To the best of their knowledge there is no relevant audit information of which the Company’s 

external Auditors are unaware.

•  They have taken all the steps they ought to have taken to make themselves aware of any 

relevant audit information and to establish that the Company’s external Auditors are aware of 
that information.

This confirmation is given and should be interpreted in accordance with the provisions of 
Section 418 of the Companies Act 2006. Read more on page 156.

Capital structure

Substantial interests

Details of the Company’s issued share capital, together with information on movements in the 
Company’s issued share capital during the year, are shown in Note 23 on page 203.

The Company has two classes of shares:

•  Ordinary Shares of 1 pence, each of which carries the right to one vote at general meetings 

of the Company and other such rights and obligations as are set out in the Company’s 
Articles of Association.

•  Deferred Shares, which carry no voting rights.

The powers of the Company’s Directors in relation to issuing or buying back the Company’s 
shares are limited to those approved at the AGM.

As reported in last year’s Annual Report, the Company retained 25 million of shares bought 
back during 2022, as Treasury Shares. The Treasury Shares are being used to meet obligations 
of the Company in respect of its employee share schemes.

During 2023 the Company re-issued 3,548,829 Treasury Shares for that purpose and to the 
latest practicable date prior to finalising this Annual Report, a further 1,077,173 Treasury Shares 
had been re-issued during 2024.

The Company currently holds 20.373,998 shares in Treasury.

The Company has no current intention of exercising its authority to make market purchases of 
its own shares but will nevertheless be seeking the usual renewal of this authority at the AGM, 
and the Board will continue to keep the position under regular review. 

There are no specific restrictions on the size of a holding, the exercise of voting rights, or the 
transfer of shares, which are governed by the Company’s Articles of Association and prevailing 
legislation. The Directors are not aware of any agreement or agreements between holders of the 
Company’s shares that may result in restrictions on the transfer of securities or voting rights. 

The Employee Share Ownership Trust (ESOT), which holds shares on trust for employees under 
the Company’s various share schemes, generally abstains from voting at shareholder general 
meetings in respect of shares held by it. 

No person has any special rights of control over the Company’s share capital and all issued 
shares are fully paid.

The persons set out in the table below have notified the Company pursuant to Rule 5.1 of the 
Disclosure Guidance and Transparency Rules of their interests in the ordinary share capital of 
the Company. 

As at 27 February 2024, no change in these holdings had been notified nor, according to the 
Registrar of Members, did any other shareholder at that date have a disclosable holding of the 
Company’s issued share capital. 

Directors’ interests in the Company’s shares are shown in the Remuneration Committee report

Subject to shareholder approval at the 2024 AGM, the 2023 final ordinary dividend of 4.79

business on 2 April 2024. More information can be found on pages 231 and 232. The 
Company will be operating a Dividend Re-Investment Plan (DRIP) for shareholders in the United 
Kingdom and more information can be found on page 231.

The right to receive any dividend has been waived in part by the Trustees of the Company’s 
ESOT over that Trust’s combined holding of 466,204 shares, as at 27 February 2024. More

which could potentially lead to prepayment and cancellation by the other party upon a change 
of control of the Company. There are no other significant contracts or agreements which take 
effect, alter or terminate upon a change of control of the Company.

Modern Slavery Act

The Company welcomes the aims and objectives of the Modern Slavery Act 2015 (MSA) and 
continues to take its responsibilities under the MSA with the seriousness it deserves and 
requires. The Company will shortly be publishing its eighth statement under the MSA, which 
will be available on the Company’s website.

Employee share ownership

The Company promotes employee share ownership as widely as possible across the Company. 
The Company has two all-employee share plans, the Save As You Earn share option plan and 
the Share Incentive Plan, which are offered to all UK-based employees once they have worked 
for the Company for three months. The rules of the Company’s two all-employee share plans 
were renewed at the 2023 AGM. More information can be found on page 139.

The Company also offers employees who do not participate in the Executive Incentive Scheme 
(cash bonus scheme) the opportunity to exchange their cash bonus for shares in the Company, 
including a 20% enhancement to the value of their bonus. The scheme has operated since 
2012 and in 2023 resulted in 481,837 shares (2022: 614,176) being acquired by 184 
employees (2022: 218).

Details of how these plans operate appear in the Remuneration Committee report on pages 131 
to 152.

The percentage of our employees who hold shares in the Company, either through the 
all-employee and other share plans, the cash bonus exchange scheme, or any other method 
is 59% (2022: 58%).

Statement of Directors’ responsibilities in respect of the financial statements

The Directors are responsible for preparing the Annual Report and Accounts and the financial 
statements in accordance with applicable law and regulation.

Company law requires the Directors to prepare financial statements for each financial year. 
Under that law the Directors have prepared the Group financial statements in accordance with 
UK-adopted international accounting standards and the Company financial statements in 
accordance with United Kingdom Generally Accepted Accounting Practice (United Kingdom 
Accounting Standards, comprising FRS 101 Reduced Disclosure Framework, and applicable law). 

Under company law, Directors must not approve the financial statements unless they are 
satisfied that they give a true and fair view of the state of affairs of the Group and Company and 
of the profit or loss of the Group for that period. In preparing the financial statements, the 
Directors are required to:

•  Select suitable accounting policies and then apply them consistently.

•  State whether applicable UK-adopted international accounting standards have been followed 
for the Group financial statements and United Kingdom Accounting Standards, comprising 
FRS 101, have been followed for the Company financial statements, subject to any material 
departures disclosed and explained in the financial statements.

•  Make judgements and accounting estimates that are reasonable and prudent.

•  Prepare the financial statements on the going concern basis unless it is inappropriate to 

presume that the Group and Company will continue in business.

Opinion

In our opinion:

•  Taylor Wimpey plc’s Group financial statements and Company financial statements 

(the “financial statements”) give a true and fair view of the state of the Group’s and of the 
Company’s affairs as at 31 December 2023 and of the Group’s profit and the Group’s 
cash flows for the year then ended;

•  the Group financial statements have been properly prepared in accordance with UK-adopted 

international accounting standards as applied in accordance with the provisions of the 
Companies Act 2006;

•  the Company financial statements have been properly prepared in accordance with United 
Kingdom Generally Accepted Accounting Practice (United Kingdom Accounting Standards, 
including FRS 101 “Reduced Disclosure Framework”, and applicable law); and

•  the financial statements have been prepared in accordance with the requirements of the 

Companies Act 2006.

We have audited the financial statements, included within the Annual Report and Accounts 
(the “Annual Report”), which comprise: the Consolidated and Company balance sheets as 
at 31 December 2023; the Consolidated income statement, the Consolidated statement of 
comprehensive income, the Consolidated cash flow statement and the Consolidated and 
Company statements of changes in equity for the year then ended; and the notes to the 
financial statements, which include a description of the significant accounting policies.

Our opinion is consistent with our reporting to the Audit Committee.

Basis for opinion

We conducted our audit in accordance with International Standards on Auditing (UK) (“ISAs (UK)”) 
and applicable law. Our responsibilities under ISAs (UK) are further described in the Auditors’ 
responsibilities for the audit of the financial statements section of our report. We believe that the 
audit evidence we have obtained is sufficient and appropriate to provide a basis for our opinion.

We remained independent of the Group in accordance with the ethical requirements that are 
relevant to our audit of the financial statements in the UK, which includes the FRC’s Ethical 
Standard, as applicable to listed public interest entities, and we have fulfilled our other ethical 
responsibilities in accordance with these requirements.

To the best of our knowledge and belief, we declare that non-audit services prohibited by the 
FRC’s Ethical Standard were not provided.

Other than those disclosed in Note 6, we have provided no non-audit services to the Company 
or its controlled undertakings in the period under audit.

Our audit approach

Context

Taylor Wimpey is a listed housebuilder, predominantly operating in the UK, also with a presence 
in Spain. The Group focuses on the sale of private dwellings, which comprised 88% of total 
revenue in 2023, with the majority of the remaining revenue generated through delivery of 
partnership housing contracts. The Group’s consolidated financial statements are primarily an 
aggregation of 22 UK Business Units, which represented the regional UK house building 
businesses encompassed in Taylor Wimpey UK Limited, consolidated with the Group’s Spanish 
operations, Taylor Wimpey de España S.A.U., the Company and the share of the Group’s 
interests in joint ventures. For the purposes of our audit, we considered Taylor Wimpey UK 
Limited, Taylor Wimpey de España S.A.U., the Company and consolidation adjustments to be 
separate components. We performed process walkthroughs to understand and evaluate the 
key financial processes and controls across the Group and, in accordance with International 
Standard on Review Engagements (UK and Ireland) 2410, performed a review of the half year 
financial information. Following this work, we performed a significant amount of early audit 
procedures in advance of the year end, covering the Business Units and the Group functions. 
The objective of this audit work was:

•  to perform initial testing in relation to the design and operating effectiveness of the controls 

we planned to place reliance on; 

•  to ensure that we had a clear plan as to what work needed to be done when and where at 

year-end; 

•  to perform initial substantive testing, particularly where larger samples were required or where 

there had been one off transactions; and

•  to enable early consideration of the key sources of estimation uncertainty before the year-end.
