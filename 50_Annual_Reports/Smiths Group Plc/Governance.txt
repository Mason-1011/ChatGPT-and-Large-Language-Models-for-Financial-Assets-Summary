LIMITED ASSURANCE
KPMG has provided limited assurance under ISAE (UK) 3000 and 3410 over selected 
FY2022 and FY2023 information marked with ∆. For the full assurance opinions for 
FY2022 and FY2023 please see our corporate website www.smiths.com. This 
information was prepared in line with our reporting criteria which can also be found 
on our website.

GHG INVENTORY
Smiths assesses the GHG emissions associated with all its global operations for all 
four of its operational divisions and all sites. We have developed a GHG Inventory 
Management Plan (IMP) that outlines our methodology to provide systematic and 
appropriate GHG inventory data collection, manipulation and management, to 
produce a relevant, credible and transparent GHG inventory that will provide visibility 
into our near- and long-term goals. The IMP includes methods to estimate direct 
emissions from Smiths operations (Scope 1), indirect emissions from purchased 
energy (Scope 2), and value chain emissions (Scope 3).

The methods prescribed in the IMP conform to the World Resources Institute (WRI) 
and World Business Council for Sustainable Development (WBCSD) GHG Protocol 
and the United States Environmental Protection Agency (USEPA) Center for 
Corporate Climate Leadership Greenhouse Gas Inventory Guidance.

GHG BOUNDARIES
Per the GHG protocol, we have selected the operational control approach to set the 
organisational boundary for our GHG inventory, meaning 100% of GHG emissions 
from assets which the Company manages and over which it has authority to 
implement operational policies will be included. In selecting these organisational 
boundaries, Smiths evaluated equity share, financial control and operational control 
approaches and primarily considered the comprehensiveness of assets that would 
be included in the inventory under each of the three approaches, as well as which 
boundary would best reflect Smiths level of influence over emissions. This includes 
98 locations globally.

As for our operational boundary, which determines the direct (Scope 1) and indirect 
(Scope 2 and 3) emissions associated with operations within Smiths organisational 
boundary, we defined this as operations where we have the full authority to introduce 
and implement operating policies. Operations or activities that are outside of Smiths 
operational control, and therefore excluded from our Scope 1 and Scope 2 inventories 
may become relevant when accounting for Scope 3 emissions.

GHG emissions are reported in metric tons of CO2 equivalents (MT CO2e). Because 
individual GHGs have different impacts on climate change, or global warming 
potentials (GWPs), CO2e is used to express the impact of emissions from each GHG 
on a common scale. Smiths uses the IPCC Fifth Assessment Report (AR5) GWPs.

REWARD AND RECOGNITION
Recognising and rewarding colleagues in a fair, open and meaningful way is an 
important underpin to developing and attracting talent. We are committed to fair pay 
practices, ensuring colleagues are rewarded fairly and equally for the work they do, 
and that they have opportunities to participate in our success.

We have been an accredited Living Wage employer in the UK since 2018. In the UK, 
we operate an all-colleague Sharesave Scheme, which enables colleagues to buy 
Smiths shares at a discounted rate. In FY2023 we have continued with our process to 
align colleague benefits across markets, so they are the same for colleagues in any 
of our four divisions or Group. We completed this work in China, India and Mexico 
during the year.

TASK FORCE ON CLIMATE-RELATED 
FINANCIAL DISCLOSURES 

COMPLIANCE STATEMENT
FCA LISTING RULES
In this report, we set out our climate-related financial disclosures consistent with all of the Task Force on 
Climate-related Financial Disclosures (TCFD) recommendations and recommended disclosures pursuant 
to Listing Rule 9.8.6R (8). This includes all four of the TCFD pillars and the 11 recommended disclosures 
set out in the report entitled 'Implementing the Recommendations of the Task Force on Climate-related 
Financial Disclosures' published in October 2021 by the TCFD. In completing this work, we made use of TCFD 
guidance material including the TCFD technical supplement on the use of scenario analysis, TCFD Guidance 
on Metrics, Targets and Transition Plans, and the TCFD Guidance for All Sectors. We are reporting against 
the TCFD framework in line with FCA Listing Rules. 

In FY2024, we plan to continue our progress in reporting against all four pillars of the recommendations 
and align with the recommendations of the Transition Plan Taskforce (TPT) which is due to be released later 
this year. This will include conducting a quantitative scenario analysis. More detailed information on 
FY2024 priorities in reporting against TCFD is outlined in the TCFD summary in our FY2023 Sustainability 
at Smiths report.

The TCFD provides an internationally recognised framework to provide clear, comprehensive and high-
quality information on the impacts of climate change. Over several years, we have progressed our alignment 
with the TCFD recommendations to embed the management of climate-related risks and opportunities into 
our processes, and to ensure that our business strategy is adapting to the effects of climate change.

Our diverse range of products and geographical spread of assets allows the business to be resilient to 
climate risks, such as cost and availability of resources, in the short term. We are also well prepared for 
market opportunities presenting themselves due to climate change. However, we recognise the potential 
impacts of climate risks on our business in the long term and have continued to implement mitigation 
strategies to ensure that we remain resilient. 

GOVERNANCE
BOARD
The Board has overall responsibility for our approach 
to sustainability matters, including climate change. 
Oversight of this is delegated to sub-committees. 
Climate risk management has been delegated to 
the Audit & Risk Committee and delivery on our 
commitments in relation to climate change to the 
Science, Sustainability & Excellence (SSE) Committee. 
The Board has oversight of our Group-level and 
divisional strategies, receiving performance updates 
from our divisions three times a year. This includes an 
annual strategy presentation, an operations update and 
a half-year progress discussion. Our divisions report to 
the SSE Committee on a rolling annual basis. Read 
more about the work of the SSE Committee on page 
111. Related Board member competencies for climate 
change can be found in the Board biographies on page 
80. Our governance structure is outlined on page 79.

STRATEGIC DECISIONS RELATING TO CLIMATE 
RISKS AND OPPORTUNITIES
As the world transitions to a low-carbon economy, 
the Group has identified a number of climate-related 
opportunities relating to global investment in 
decarbonisation and green re-industrialisation. 
Commercialising these high-value green technologies 
is a strategic priority and is built into our divisional 
strategic plans. The Board also considers climate-
related issues when reviewing strategy and 
performance objectives. Energy and GHG metrics are 
presented and discussed in management reviews. In 
FY2023, the Board approved the setting of operational 
Net Zero transition targets aligned with the SBTi and 
holds responsibility for overseeing performance 
against these. The Board has visibility of implementation 
of our climate transition plan and is regularly updated 
on progress against climate metrics and targets.

Climate-related risks are managed and reported in line 
with wider risk management processes, with the 
outcomes of divisional assessments integrated into 
executive-level strategic planning and priorities. 
Climate-related opportunities such as those relating to 
the decarbonisation/energy transition agenda have 
been communicated to the Executive Committee and 
Board, culminating in a Group-wide strategic response 
for markets and opportunities. 

A number of key climate-related issues were discussed 
by the Executive Committee and the Board in FY2023 
including:

1.  Science-based targets and transition planning for 

Net Zero Scope 1, 2 and 3 emissions

2.  Strategic opportunities arising from the energy 
transition/decarbonisation and green revenue 
tracking dashboards

3.  Alignment of remuneration with environmental 

targets

EXECUTIVE REMUNERATION
Scope 1 & 2 reduction targets continue to make up part 
of our LTIP. From FY2023 onwards, we introduced 
climate-related metrics (energy efficiency) into our AIP 
and (absolute GHG reduction) into our LTIP to more 
closely align decision making and ownership of climate 
goals. Details can be found in the Remuneration & 
People Committee Report on page 98. FY2024 
remuneration metrics continue to incorporate these 
climate-related targets.

AUDIT & RISK COMMITTEE
The Audit & Risk Committee is responsible for 
reviewing the effectiveness of risk management across 
the business (see page 91), including climate risks 
which are integrated into our enterprise risk 
management framework. On a rolling basis, divisions 
attend the Audit & Risk Committee and present the 
outcome of divisional assessments which include 
climate risks and opportunities. Twice a year, the 
Committee reviews the Group's principal risks. Climate 
change has been identified as a Group principal risk 
and is managed and owned by the Audit & Risk 
Committee.

SCIENCE, SUSTAINABILITY AND EXCELLENCE 
COMMITTEE
The SSE Committee is responsible for overseeing the 
delivery of climate-related commitments and 
opportunities, such as the commercialisation of green 
products, mitigating the impacts of climate change, and 
setting and reviewing progress against relevant 
climate-related targets. The Committee met four times 
during the year to assess progress against targets 
including GHG emissions, renewable energy use, 
energy efficiency, water use and waste disposal. On a 
rolling basis, divisions provide a deep-dive on progress 
against their SBT plans, new product development and 
innovation. For more information on the work of the 
SSE Committee see page 111.

EXECUTIVE COMMITTEE
Divisional Presidents form part of the Executive 
Committee and are responsible for our divisions’ 
approach to sustainability, including climate change. 
The Executive Committee reports to the CEO, who 
reports directly to the Board six times a year. 
Discussions at the Executive Committee relate to 
commercial climate activities such as new product 
development and operational climate activity, such as 
energy and GHG reductions. The Chief Sustainability 
Officer works closely with the Group Head of Strategy 
and Communications and Divisional Presidents to 
ensure sustainability is embedded in strategic, 
commercial and operational decision making.

CLIMATE RISKS AND OPPORTUNITIES
We have identified a range of physical and transition 
risks and opportunities that could impact our business. 

The climate transition also gives rise to legal risks, 
such as stricter GHG emission regulations, as well 
as market risks such as from new and emerging 
competitors. Extreme weather events such as floods 
and extreme temperatures pose physical risks, 
including damage to assets, both owned by us and 
within our supply chain, as well as disruption to 
transportation routes. More extreme temperatures 
may also lead to new opportunities in our markets, 
such as remote sensing and cooling systems.

The time horizons considered for identified climate-
related risks and opportunities, found in the table 
below, align to our targets which have been submitted 
to the SBTi. While we recognise that climate-related 
risks will occur over short-, medium- and long-term 
horizons, our assessment determines that climate-
related risks and opportunities are likely to impact the 
business in the medium and long term. We believe that 
we remain resilient to climate risks with the adaptation 
and mitigation strategies that are in place. It was 
determined that the climate risks identified do not have 
a significant impact on the business, although are 
considered as a Group principal risk in aggregation. We 
will continue to assess the materiality of any financial 
impact arising.

Long term

Description

2023–2028
2028–2032
2032–2040

Each of our identified risks and opportunities has been 
assessed by scenario analysis, which is described 
alongside an explanation of their potential impact on the 
business, subsequent actions we are taking to respond, 
and the associated time horizon.

SCENARIO ANALYSIS
We have carried out scenario analysis on our climate 
risks and opportunities for several years and, in 
FY2022, we collaborated with external consultants 
to extend our qualitative scenario analysis to two 
scenarios for both physical and transition risks and 
opportunities. Next year, we plan to develop our 
assessment of financial impacts, integrating 
quantitative analysis where possible. This year, we have 
reviewed the findings of the scenario analysis, finding 
no significant changes to the modelled impact of 
climate risks and opportunities since last year. 

While scenario analysis is hypothetical and does 
not provide a certain forecast, it helps to identify 
how our most material climate-related risks and 
opportunities will likely impact us and our operations 
in the future. This subsequently informs our risk 
management strategies, as well as the metrics and 
targets we use to monitor such issues, enabling us to 
become more resilient to risks and seize opportunities 
in the long term. 

PHYSICAL SCENARIOS
For the physical scenarios, the Intergovernmental 
Panel on Climate Change’s (IPCC) Representative 
Concentration Pathway RCP 4.5 and RCP 8.5 scenarios 
were used. The impacts highlighted a change in annual 
rainfall levels at our sites and seasonal differences in 
temperature. Extreme weather events such as flooding, 
wildfires and drought will become more severe and 
frequent. See page 52 for more information on how we 
are managing these impacts.

For the transition scenarios, the International Energy 
Agency’s (IEA) World Energy Outlook Sustainable 
Development Scenario (SDS) and Stated Policies 
Scenario (STEPS) were used. The STEPS scenario 
provides a benchmark to assess the potential 
achievements of recent developments in energy and 
climate policy and the SDS scenario assumes full 
alignment with the Paris Agreement to hold the rise in 
global average temperature to well below 2°C.

IMPACT ON THE BUSINESSES, STRATEGY AND 
FINANCIAL PLANNING
We submitted our Net Zero transition plan and GHG 
emissions reduction targets to the SBTi in May 2023. 
These outline our operational Net Zero GHG trajectory 
to meet a 1.5°C scenario by achieving Net Zero Scope 1 
& 2 emissions by 2040 and Net Zero Scope 3 emissions 
by 2050. This aligns with the Net Zero by 2050 targets 
set out by the UK and US governments (which are our 
largest areas of operation). We are preparing to comply 
with Transition Plan Taskforce (TPT) guidance next year. 
Our transition plan was developed with consideration of 
the updated TCFD guidance and lays out our 2028, 2032 
and long-term Net Zero milestones and emission 
reduction targets. See Net Zero/climate transition plan 
on page 40.

Divisional-level initiatives and actions to reduce Scope 1 
& 2 emissions are based on energy efficiency, green 
electricity (including implementation of solar 
technologies and fleet electrification), and alternative 
fuels. The majority of our Scope 3 emissions will be 
addressed by in-country grid decarbonisation and via 
targeting significant suppliers with education and 

training to set and meet their own SBT targets. 
The impacts of our transition plan on our customers, 
suppliers and other stakeholders, and on our 
business are integrated into the roadmap. In 
developing our transition plan, we have considered, 
and align with, the Net Zero economy commitments in 
the countries in which we operate, in particular where 
we are headquartered.

The opportunities identified within the climate 
scenario analysis form part of our strategic priority to 
commercialise high-value green technologies to 
increase green product revenues.

RISK MANAGEMENT
We adopt a Group-wide approach to risk management 
which is discussed in detail on pages 66 to 74. The 
Board has overall responsibility for ensuring that a 
robust risk management process is in place and 
delegates responsibility to the Audit & Risk Committee 
to ensure that it is adhered to. Climate risk 
management is considered in line with the existing 
risk management framework. This year, for the first 
time, climate risk was identified as a Group principal 
risk. See page 68 for more information on our Group 
principal risks.

Updates to climate regulation, including the emergence 
of new climate-related regulation is picked up in line 
with our Group-wide regulation monitoring processes.

In previous years, we have considered a wide range of 
risks and opportunities relating to climate change that 
were identified with the support of external technical 
specialists and then evaluated through a series of 
Group and divisional workshops. These include, for 
example, impacts relating to damage to assets from 
weather events, cost and availability of resources, 
regulation related to GHG emissions and increased 
demand for green technologies. The identification 
process includes assessment of the full value chain, 
such as impacts relating to key supply chain assets 
from extreme weather events.

At the Group, divisional and site levels, risks and 
mitigating controls are allocated to relevant owners. 
This year, each of our divisions conducted their annual 
review of climate-related risks in divisional risk 
registers to ensure accuracy of impact assessment and 
adequacy of mitigation actions. The results of these 
reviews are consolidated and managed in our risk 
register as per the enterprise risk management process.

TCFD

CONTINUED

Twice a year, a top-down review of our principal risks 
and opportunities, including climate risks, is conducted 
as part of the wider risk management process. In 
FY2023, we conducted an ESG double materiality 
assessment to understand the ESG topics of most 
importance to our business as outlined on page 33.

We continued our detailed procedures to assess and 
manage climate risks and opportunities via scenario 
analysis. This incorporates analysis of base case 
revenue streams, climate scenario analysis conducted 
over two physical and two transition climate scenarios 
against medium- and long-term time horizons. Risks 
and opportunities have been considered alongside 
established mitigation measures and strategic actions 
during validation workshops held at Group and 
divisional level to determine materiality of impacts 
over time.

The Executive Committee has responsibility for 
designing the enterprise risk management framework 
and ensuring that it is effectively deployed. The Audit & 
Risk Committee is responsible for overseeing the 
effectiveness of our management and implementation 
of internal controls, including those related to climate 
risks. Divisional and functional teams are responsible 
for day-to-day management and reporting of risks, 
including climate risk. They identify new and emerging 
risks, escalate where appropriate, and take action 
to ensure risks are managed appropriately. 
Prioritisation of risks is supported by matrices to 
improve, monitor (controls/ability to respond), monitor 
(risks) and accept/optimise.

METRICS AND TARGETS
We have identified relevant metrics and targets to 
monitor progress in achieving our sustainability goals, 
as well as manage and mitigate identified climate-
related risks and opportunities as detailed on page 
57. Metrics and targets are monitored by the SSE 
Committee and inform decision making to execute 
our strategic priorities.

Sustainability metrics form part of the Smiths annual 
and long-term incentive plans. These include metrics 
on GHG emissions reductions (Scope 1 & 2 emissions 
absolute reduction target) and energy efficiency.

We have committed to Net Zero Scope 1 & 2 emissions 
across our operations by 2040, with Net Zero Scope 3 
emissions reached by 2050 in line with the 1.5°C 
Business Ambition under the UN Race to Zero. As per 
our submission to the SBTi, we have committed to 
interim targets of 50% reduction in Scope 1 & 2 
emissions by 2032 and 50% of suppliers by spend with 
SBTs by 2028. As required by the SBTi, our proposed 
interim reduction target covers more than two-thirds 
of our total Scope 3 GHG inventory. 

Our Scope 1 & 2 emissions have decreased significantly 
this year as we progress conversion of our energy mix 
to renewable electricity, as well as undertake transition 
initiatives such as fleet electrification. Our Scope 3 
emissions have also decreased year-on-year. Further 
details of Scope 1, 2 and 3 emissions can be found on 
page 45 including progress during FY2023. More detail, 
including our methodology for calculation of emissions 
in line with the GHG Protocol, can be found in our 
FY2023 Sustainability at Smiths report.

We continue to monitor completion of annual business 
continuity plan reviews and have surpassed our 
three-year targets on waste and water reduction. We 
will assess whether water targets are renewed at the 
end of the three-year goal period, given the relatively 
low consumption required in our operations.

Information on how metrics and targets are linked 
to our remuneration policy can be found in the 
Remuneration & People Committee Report from page 
98. Progress towards achieving other sustainability 
targets is included in the Sustainability at Smiths 
section from page 32. Our Scope 1, 2 and 3 emissions 
for both FY2022 and FY2023 have undergone an 
external limited assurance process. We anticipate that 
further metrics and targets will be established during 
FY2024 as we move into our next three-year goal 
period. In the coming year we will review our disclosure 
of other cross-industry climate-related metrics.

SMITHS GROUP PLC ANNUAL REPORT FY2023OVERVIEWSTRATEGIC REPORTGOVERNANCEFINANCIAL STATEMENTSDuring the year ended 31 July 2023, the Board  
has acted in accordance with Section 172(1) of the 
Companies Act 2006, with each Director acting in the 
way they consider, in good faith, would be most likely to 
promote the success of the Company for the benefit of 
its members as a whole. In doing so, the Directors had 
regard to the interests of other stakeholders, whilst 
maintaining and overseeing high standards of business 
conduct. Our approach to key stakeholders and 
stakeholder considerations that influenced Board 
discussions, the outcomes of these discussions and the 
Board's principal decisions are outlined in this section, 
along with illustrative examples.

STAKEHOLDERS AND SECTION 172 STATEMENT

STAKEHOLDERS AND  
SECTION 172 STATEMENT

During the year 
ended 31 July 2023, 
the Board has acted 
in accordance with 
Section 172(1) of the 
Companies Act 2006, 
with each Director 
acting in the way 
they consider, in 
good faith, would 
be most likely to 
promote the success 
of the Company for 
the benefit of its 
members as a whole.

Understanding the needs and priorities of 
our key stakeholders and building strong 
and positive relationships is critical to our 
success. Stakeholder engagement takes 
place across the Group, operationally by 
our divisional teams and management, 
at a Group-level, and by the Board. 

In a business as diversified as Smiths, engagement 
with most stakeholder groups is handled locally by 
management, or by specialist Group teams. The Board 
maintains oversight and only engages directly if there 
are issues which truly warrant its involvement or 
where it can add value. This is particularly true of 
engagement with customers and suppliers (the 
majority of whom are unique to a specific division) but 
is also usually the case for governments, regulators 
and our local communities. 

The outcomes of stakeholder engagement, including 
concerns raised, are reported to the Board and Board 
Committees on a regular basis through our usual 
processes that support informed decision-making.  
The reporting was enhanced during the period to 
include greater focus on macro conditions and 
stakeholders. This was partly in response to feedback 
received as part of the FY2022 Board Evaluation 
process (see page 85). Discussion and decision-making 
by the Board takes the views of key stakeholders into 
account, in order to balance their needs, and effectively 
build the sustainable, long-term success of the Group. 
Throughout FY2023 we have matured our approach 
with a focus on critical business priorities that are 
regularly reported, underpinned by relevant data, in a 
global performance dashboard that allows tracking 
against the targets that have been set. Where needed, 
corrective actions were presented and discussed.

OUR APPROACH
Our people are vital to 
the success of Smiths.

We aim to attract 
and retain the very 
best by creating an 
environment for 
colleagues based on 
respect, personal 
growth, recognition and 
development of talent, 
and a sense of belonging 
and purpose. 

Our culture is a powerful 
asset and empowers and 
enables our people to 
deliver our purpose. It is 
supported by our Values 
and our Leadership 
Behaviours which 
influence every decision, 
guide how we behave, 
and help make Smiths a 
place where people are 
happy and proud to work. 

KEY PEOPLE PRIORITIES
 – Health, safety and well-being
 – Purpose and culture
 – Ethical behaviour

 – Reward and recognition
 – Employee retention and engagement
 – Talent development
 – Diversity, equity and inclusion

 – Sustainability
 – Community contribution

BOARD AND MANAGEMENT ENGAGEMENT ACTIVITIES
 – Management engages with colleagues through regular Town Hall 

meetings, Company news updates, and through our online tools where 
colleagues can share their views. See page 14 for more information
 – Non-executive Directors undertake workforce engagement activities, 
including in-person site visits and attendance at colleague meetings, 
forums and events. Regular updates are provided to the Remuneration & 
People Committee. Such activities included:
 – Richard Howes met members of the senior leadership team over a 
period of 12 months as part of his induction programme. He also 
visited John Crane’s Morton Grove site, met key team members and 
learnt about operational aspects of the business

 – Noel Tata attended the Indian Managing Directors' Council and met 

members of the India leadership team. He also toured Mumbai airport 
to see Smiths Detection machinery in operation

 – Sir George Buckley and Pam Cheng met SES Master Black Belts. Sir 
George shared his perspective on excellence, his experience in other 
companies, and what SES means for Smiths. Pam offered her 
experience and expertise in the area of change management

 – Across the year, the Board met with colleagues of varying seniority. This 
included divisional teams and those in corporate functions, allowing for 
informal introductions to Board members

 – Talent Roundtables were held to discuss top talent and identify potential 
Executive Committee successors. Following this process Sir George 
Buckley met c.30 extended leadership team members across Smiths
 – The Company established a Group mentoring scheme to give senior 

leaders an Executive Committee formal mentor to foster the ‘developing 
self and others’ Smiths Leadership Behaviour

 – Management identified a need to increase female senior leaders’ 
visibility in order to amplify role modelling across the Group and 
demonstrate female representation in senior positions

 – The Board and Remuneration & People Committee receive regular 
updates and deep-dives from the Chief People Officer on employee 
engagement, reward, talent, and diversity and inclusion. It also monitors 
KPI metrics relating to those areas

 – The Audit & Risk Committee is provided with updates on ‘Speak Out’, our 
confidential reporting hotline, and other reports and statistics relating to 
the Group’s ethical policies and performance

 – Bill Seeger attended the China Ethics Committee and Global HSE team 

 – The Board receives health and safety reports at every Board meeting 

meeting

 – Mark Seligman met with senior leaders from across the Finance 
function including Finance and Finance Excellence, Tax, Investor 
Relations, Internal Audit and Divisional CFOs

and regular updates on the Group’s pension arrangements

 – DE&I continued to be an area of focus to help create a more diverse and 

inclusive Smiths and we are targeting improved gender balance

OUTCOMES OF ENGAGEMENT IN FY2023
 – The Board approved the refined people strategy with a focus on the 
Leadership Behaviours and developing and retaining talent. This 
included: a focus on early years careers including apprenticeships and 
graduate opportunities; and a global leadership training programme 
aligned with the Leadership Behaviours and the talent process

 – Implementation of a quarterly colleague webinar featuring a female 
Executive Committee member and a female Non-executive Director, 
which has included Dame Ann Dowling and Pam Cheng in FY2023, with 
Karin Hoeing to lead in FY2024. Initiatives such as these are important as 
we continue to foster a more diverse and inclusive environment

 – Mentees of the mentoring scheme have taken on expanded roles and 
responsibilities, resulting in cross-functional and cross-divisional 
internal career changes. All of the mentees of the Executive Committee 
have now become mentors for the next leadership tier. This is cascading 
the mentoring culture at Smiths

 – Engagement measured by our annual My Say engagement survey, which 
had a very high response rate of 84% of our employees, improved by one 
point since last year and is now just one point below the industry 
benchmark. It was encouraging to see that four out of our five businesses 
(including the corporate centre) tracked improvement in engagement, 
while one remained flat year-on-year. My Say results can be found on 
page 14

 – The Board considered and declined the request from the Trustee of the 
Smiths Industries Pension Scheme (SIPS) to recommend paying the 
2023 stated aim discretionary increase. This decision was taken with the 
security of all SIPS members benefits in mind. The Company continues 
to work with the SIPS Trustee to progress towards the long-term target 
of full buyout funding

GOING CONCERN AND VIABILITY STATEMENT

CONTINUED

Consideration was then given to the magnitude of the 
gross risks and their potential impact, directly or 
indirectly, on the Group’s future performance and 
liquidity. The assessment included stress testing of the 
Group’s financial capacity to absorb the impact of such 
adverse events, either individually or in combination, 
and what mitigating actions the Group could take to 
respond to them in order to protect its business.

The Directors also considered the Group’s ability to 
raise additional liquidity. In performing this 
assessment, the Directors have taken comfort from the 
diversity of the Group’s businesses across different 
markets, industries, geographies, products and 

customers. In order to ensure consistency, the base 
case used for the three-year viability assessment has 
also been reconciled against divisional impairment 
review models.

The Group holds a tradeable commodity through its 
investment in 10% of the equity in ICU Medical, Inc. The 
base case assumes that the Group could contemplate a 
possible reduction in this investment, the cash inflows 
from which would remove any need to utilise the RCF 
over the period. The downside scenarios do not include 
any cash inflows from the sale of this investment.

The downside results below show the impact on 
EBITDA, net debt and headroom under each scenario. 
The headroom includes the currently unutilised RCF of 
US$800m (£656m). This renewal removed the only 
interest covenant to which the Group was subject. 

Based on the robust assessment, the Directors confirm 
that given the current strong cash position, under all 
scenarios they have a reasonable expectation the Group 
will remain viable for the period being assessed and 
will continue to operate and meet its liabilities as they 
fall due. The Directors have no reason to doubt that the 
Group will continue in business beyond the period 
under assessment.

SCENARIO 3
Following a product cyber attack, a terrorism-related 
incident occurs at a US airport. As a consequence, the 
US Government revokes Smiths Detection’s licence. 
Sales of Detection’s products to the US military and all 
other governmental contracts have been banned and 
due to the reputational damage, the impact of the ban 
will spread to other Group divisions.

SCENARIO 4
Smiths Detection is found guilty of bribing government 
officials in Asian countries in order to land significant 
contracts. This damages the Group’s reputation and 
leads to worldwide regulators imposing significant 
sanctions on the Group.

SCENARIO 5
A major fire at the John Crane plant in Czech Republic 
renders the facility unusable, causing severe 
disruption to production.

discharged its responsibilities during 
the year.

Board succession planning continued to be a key focus 
this year with my retirement as Chairman of the Board 
at the conclusion of this year’s Annual General Meeting 
(AGM). I would like to thank everyone for their 
significant contribution and commitment to Smiths 
since I joined the Board in 2013. I joined the Board with 
a resolve to help grow Smiths which was spurred not 
only by an enduring affection for a great company, but 
also from the desire to give something back to Britain 
after a long career. From reflecting over my time as 
Chairman, I am proud to see we have reached many 
significant milestones, and have continued to focus on 
greater innovation, sustainability, people and financial 
agility to help better support the Smiths Value Engine 
that connects our purpose, our strengths and our 
priorities of Growth, Execution and People. 

Further changes to the Board this year included the 
appointment of Steve Williams as my successor as 
Chair of the Board, subject to his election as Director at 
this years’ AGM. Steve has over 40 years of global 
business experience and brings with him a clear focus 
on environment, social and governance (ESG) matters. 
Richard Howes also joined us in September 2022 and 
will take over as Chair of the Audit & Risk Committee 
later in the year. I would like to welcome Steve and I 
wish him, the Company, and our people every future 
success after my retirement. The Board will continue to 
comprise of six males and four females, two Directors 
from historically under-represented ethnic groups and 
seven with a birthplace or background outside the UK. 
For a Group such as Smiths, with a diverse workforce 
and a wide geographic spread, that diversity is crucial, 
but it is equally important that the Directors are 
capable and suitably experienced individuals. The 
biographies of our Directors can be found on pages 80 
and 81. 

We continue to monitor the ongoing regulatory reforms 
in relation to audit and governance, and welcome the 
FCA’s proposed changes to transform and streamline 
the Listing Rules. The Listing Rules changes represent 
a continuation of the efforts to reduce barriers to listed 
companies in the UK, helping businesses to remain 
competitive in today’s market. Smiths continues to 
prioritise governance at the core of its business. I would 
like to acknowledge the work undertaken by Smiths to 
maintain an effective governance framework, including 
oversight by the Audit & Risk Committee on the internal 
controls enhancement programme.

It is evident that the expectations on governance have 
increased in recent years and ensuring a strong 
governance framework that supports the Group’s 
long-term strategic goals is critical if we are to support 
the business and enhance the interests of all our 
stakeholders for the future. The Board continually 
keeps its governance arrangements under review and I 
would like to thank the Committee Chairs for ensuring 
governance has been constructive and effective.

Finally, I would like to thank the Smiths workforce and 
my fellow Directors for their work on shareholders’ 
behalf this year. It has been a privilege to serve as 
Chairman, and I look forward to watching this special 
company continue to flourish in the future.

I hope you find the following report interesting, 
and, along with my fellow Committee Chairs, I would 
be happy to discuss any of the content at our 
upcoming AGM.

DIVISION OF RESPONSIBILITIES

HOW THE BOARD
OPERATES

The following role specifications set 
out the clear division of responsibility 
between executive and non-executive 
Directors, which supports the integrity 
of the Board’s operations.

There is a schedule of matters which are considered 
significant to Smiths and have therefore been reserved 
for decisions by the Board. This is due to their strategic, 
financial, or reputational implications or consequences. 
The formal schedule, which is integrated into our 
governance framework, can be found on our website. 

The Chief Executive Officer is responsible for preparing 
and recommending the strategy and for the day-to-day 
management of the Company. Executive management 
implement the Group’s strategy and provide the Chief 
Executive Officer, and the Board as a whole, with the 
information they need to make decisions that will 
determine the long-term success of the Group. 

At each scheduled Board meeting the Chief Executive 
Officer and the Chief Financial Officer present separate 
reports, detailing business performance and progress 
against strategy. These are supplemented by regular 
performance updates from the Chief Executive Officer 
to the Directors between meetings. When appropriate, 
invitations to Board meetings are extended to Divisional 
Presidents, heads of functions and subject matter 
experts, supporting visibility of talent and executive 
succession planning. External advisers are invited to 
attend as necessary. Director attendance at Board and 
Committee meetings in FY2023 is set out on page 84. 

To ensure the continued effectiveness of the Board, the 
Chairman meets the Non-executive Directors without 
the Executive Directors present after each Board

DIVISION OF RESPONSIBILITIES

CONTINUED

TIME COMMITMENT
All Directors must allocate sufficient time to their work 
in order to discharge their responsibilities effectively. 
An expected time commitment of 25 days per annum is 
set out in the Non-executive Director letter of 
appointment. However, Committee Chairs, the Senior 
Independent Director and the Chairman commit more 
time as required. In the normal course of business, 
Directors are expected to familiarise themselves with 
business priorities and challenges, prepare for and 
attend Board and Committee meetings, attend the 
AGM, engage with stakeholders and participate in the 
Board evaluation process. Executive Directors are not 
permitted to take on the chairmanship or more than 
one non-executive directorship in a FTSE 100 company, 
or any other significant appointment. Any appointment 
to other directorships is reviewed in advance by the 
Board for conflicts and time commitment 
considerations. 

DIRECTOR ATTENDANCE

In FY2023 the Board concluded that the Chairman and 
the Non-executive Directors devoted sufficient time to 
fulfil their commitments to Smiths. This included 
considering the Directors' positions held at other 
organisations. Particular consideration was given to 
Noel Tata’s other commitments as he holds a number 
of Board-level positions outside the Group all of which 
are at Tata Group companies, as shown in his biography 
on page 81. The Board reaffirmed that Noel’s other 
commitments do not prevent him from committing 
sufficient time to his work as a Director, as evidenced by 
his attendance and effective participation at all Board 
and Committee meetings and ad hoc Board update 
calls. As a current executive with contacts in higher-
growth countries which are a strategic focus for 
Smiths, he brings valuable and distinct experience to 
our Board discussions. 

ADVICE AND INSURANCE
Our Directors are able to seek independent 
professional advice at the expense of Smiths to enable 
them to fulfil their obligations as members of the 
Board. In addition, the Directors and Officers of Smiths 
and its subsidiaries have the benefit of a Directors’ and 
Officers’ liability insurance policy. During FY2023, and 
at the date of this report, qualifying third-party 
indemnity provisions (as defined by section 234 of the 
Act) have remained in force for the Directors of the 
Company and certain other employees in respect of 
their directorships of some subsidiary companies in 
relation to certain losses and liabilities which they may 
incur (or may have incurred) to third parties in the 
course of their professional duties for the Company, or 
a subsidiary.

EVALUATION, COMPOSITION AND SUCCESSION

BOARD
EVALUATION

Each year an evaluation of the Board and 
its Committees is conducted to monitor 
their effectiveness and to help identify any 
improvement opportunities. It is externally 
facilitated every three years. This year the 
evaluation was carried out internally.

The annual evaluation of the performance of the 
Non-executive Directors and the Chief Executive Officer 
is led by the Chairman. The Senior Independent 
Director and the Chief Executive Officer lead the 
evaluations for the Chairman and the Chief Financial 
Officer respectively.

The evaluation of the Non-executive Directors includes 
individual meetings with the Chairman. Feedback is 
given to the Chief Executive Officer by the Chairman 
after each Board meeting and on an ad hoc basis 
throughout the year. All Directors are invited to 
complete an effectiveness questionnaire, which for 
FY2023 included a comprehensive review of various 
aspects including strategy, risk and committee 
effectiveness amongst other topics. 

Independent Audit Ltd, who has supported the 
evaluation process since FY2019, but has no other 
connection to the Company, assisted with the 
interpretation of the results of the questionnaires 
issued to the Board.

The findings of the evaluation are used to inform future 
Board agenda planning and develop specific actions for 
improvement. The actions to be taken following the 
FY2023 evaluation have been grouped in four themes: 
strategic decision-making; succession planning; Board 
communication; and stakeholder engagement.  
A summary is set out below. Overall, the Board agreed 
that significant progress had been made since the 
internal evaluation last year. The Board seeks to 
continuously improve the effectiveness of the Board 
and its Committees and the actions identified in the 
FY2023 effectiveness review support this. It is the 
present intention that the FY2024 evaluation will be 
externally facilitated. The last externally facilitated 
Board evaluation was in FY2021.

NOMINATION & GOVERNANCE 
COMMITTEE REPORT

CHAIRMAN’S STATEMENT
I am pleased to present the Committee’s 
report for FY2023. The Committee has 
delegated responsibility from the Board to 
review the structure, size and composition 
of the Board and its Committees, in 
addition to assessing its effectiveness, 
performance, and independence. The 
Committee is dedicated to maintaining 
a diverse and inclusive range of 
appointments, with a wide variety of 
skills, expertise and experience. This 
ensures that the Board as a whole, and its 
Committees, can effectively navigate the 
complexities of our industry and contribute 
to the long-term success of our company.

COMMITTEE 
PERFORMANCE 
EVALUATION
In FY2023, the 
performance of the 
Committee was 
considered as part of the 
internal Board evaluation 
process. Overall, it was 
confirmed that the 
Committee continues to 
operate effectively.

COMMITTEE MEMBERSHIP AND 
MEETINGS
The members of the Committee, their biographies and 
attendance at meetings during the year can be found on 
pages 80, 81 and 84. 

The Chief Executive Officer is normally invited to attend 
Committee meetings. Other members of senior 
management are invited to attend as necessary.

GOVERNANCE
The Committee is responsible for keeping the Board’s 
governance framework under review. During the year 
enhancements to the framework were approved. The 
Committee also reviewed the Board skills and 
experience matrix and its own Terms of Reference.

Looking ahead, the Nomination & Governance 
Committee remains committed to assessing the 
effectiveness of the Board and taking necessary steps 
to ensure that the Company maintains an appropriate 
balance of skills, experience, knowledge and diversity. 
The Committee will also continue to monitor emerging 
governance trends, regulatory changes, and industry 
developments, allowing it to adapt and respond 
effectively in a way that is appropriate for Smiths 
strategic objectives and governance framework.

This is my final report as Chairman of the Committee, 
having joined the Board in August 2013. In last year’s 
report I highlighted that a key focus in 2023 would be 
Board succession. As such, following a comprehensive 
selection process, without my involvement and led by 
Bill Seeger as Senior Independent Director, Steve 
Williams will be appointed as Chair of the Board from 
November 2023. This is subject to his election at the 
2023 AGM. His role as Chair Designate commenced at 
the start of September 2023. Board succession will 
continue to be a focus during FY2024 as Bill Seeger 
retires from the Board in May 2024.

We were also pleased to welcome Richard Howes to 
the Board as a Non-executive Director in September 
2022. In the FY2022 Annual Report we disclosed the 
details of the rigorous search process that was 
undertaken when recommending his appointment. 

During the year we oversaw the development of senior 
management succession plans and the talent pipeline. 
We endorsed the appointments of Ted Wan and James 
Down to the Executive Committee. Ted leads our China 
business and the opportunities that presents. James is 
the General Counsel of the Group. Pleasingly, both were 
internal promotions.

More information about our activities can be found on 
the following pages.

I would like to thank both past and present members of 
the Committee for their hard work and contributions 
throughout my tenure.

SIR GEORGE W. BUCKLEY 
Chairman of the Nomination &  
Governance Committee

SMITHS GROUP PLC ANNUAL REPORT FY2023OVERVIEWSTRATEGIC REPORTGOVERNANCEFINANCIAL STATEMENTS88

NOMINATION & GOVERNANCE COMMITTEE REPORT

CONTINUED

SELECTION AND APPOINTMENT OF A NEW CHAIR

As part of the Committee's succession planning, 
Bill Seeger, as the Senior Independent Director, 
oversaw the search process and appointment of 
Steve Williams as successor to Sir George 
Buckley. The search process was facilitated by 
Russell Reynolds, an independent executive 
search consultant which has no connection to the 
Company, other than in assisting and facilitating in 
the search for senior management. Russell 
Reynolds was selected after a comprehensive 
review of search firms. Russell Reynolds is a 
signatory to the Enhanced Code of Conduct for 
Executive Search Firms. The Committee held 
several unscheduled meetings to focus on the 
appointment to ensure a comprehensive selection 
process.

IDENTIFY
Initially, the Committee developed a candidate 
profile and then a small working group comprising 
Karin Hoeing, Mark Seligman and Paul Keel was 
established to support Bill Seeger. The agreed 
profile included key attributes required for the 
role such as previous experience, cultural fit, 
management of complex stakeholder 
relationships, and driving growth. The details of 
the role profile and requirements of the role were 
shared with Russell Reynolds. Russell Reynolds 
then identified an extensive and diverse list of 
potential candidates who were appraised by the 
working group against the agreed brief. This 
created a longlist which was reviewed by the 
Committee to produce a shortlist which complied 
with the Board's Diversity Policy. 

INTERVIEW
The shortlisted candidates were interviewed 
by the working group, who together determined 
the preferred list of candidates for consideration 
by the Committee. As well as meeting the 
candidates, the working group discussed timings 

of the appointment and handover of the role.  
The preferred candidates then met with all 
Non-executive Directors, after which the Board 
met to discuss feedback.

SELECT
Prior to the final selection and appointment, the 
Senior Independent Director obtained references 
from key stakeholders. The Committee was 
unanimous in its selection and recommended to 
the Board that Steve Williams be appointed as 
Chair, given his breadth of experience and fit to 
the attributes in the agreed brief. 

CONSIDERATIONS
Steve Williams' external roles were considered 
prior to his appointment and the Board agreed 
that there was no conflict which might impact his 
role at Smiths. The Board also considered his 
other commitments from a time perspective. The 
Board considered that he would have sufficient 
time to fulfil his responsibilities to the Company.

APPOINT
Steve Williams' appointment as a Non-executive 
Director and Chair Designate took effect on 
1 September 2023. Subject to his election by 
shareholders, he will be appointed as Chair of the 
Board at the conclusion of the 2023 AGM when  
Sir George Buckley steps down.

INDUCTION
A comprehensive induction programme developed 
specifically for Steve Williams, taking into account 
his previous experience, knowledge, and skills is 
underway. This involves briefings on the role and 
responsibilities of being a UK listed Company 
Director, meeting with senior leaders in the 
business, corporate advisers, investors and other 
stakeholders, as well as visits to the Group's 
operations. 

INDUCTION
To ensure that they are able to effectively contribute to 
discussions and decision-making, all of our Directors 
participate in an induction programme on joining the 
Board. Each induction programme is tailored to provide 
the individual Director with the necessary knowledge 
and understanding of the Group, its markets and its 
material stakeholders based on their personal 
experience and background. 

On joining the Board, Richard Howes was given a 
tailored induction programme to develop the necessary 
knowledge and understanding of the Group and his 
role. It included visiting Group operations in the US and 
Europe and meeting with key senior leaders across the 
business. Information on Steve Williams' induction can 
be found in the adjacent box.

INFORMATION AND TRAINING
The Board recognises the importance of ongoing 
training and our Directors are given the opportunity to 
update their skills and experience on a regular basis. 
Any individual development needs are discussed with 
the Directors at the annual performance evaluation. In 
order for the Directors to remain aware of business 
priorities and external developments, the Board is 
provided with formal reports and updates from the 
divisions, functional leaders and external advisers on a 
regular basis. This year the Board was given an update 
from external speakers on the macroeconomic 
environment including the impact of high inflation, 
financial crises, geopolitical events and energy 
transition. 

In order to operate effectively our Directors must 
receive accurate, timely and high-quality information. 
The Company Secretary and his team assist the 
Chairman and Chief Executive Officer in ensuring 
effective information flows and that the Board is 
provided with all relevant information to enable the 
Directors to discharge their responsibilities.

DIVERSITY
The Board supports the principles of gender and ethnic diversity and pays close attention to the international 
nature of its makeup. Members of the Board and senior management will collectively possess diversity of gender, 
national birthplace, social and ethnic backgrounds, cognitive and personal strengths, along with a combination 
of skills, experience and knowledge. This is important for the effective operation of the Board and oversight of 
the Group. 

The Committee is responsible for recommending appointments to the Board following its regular assessment  
of the Board and its Committees’ composition, whilst also considering the Group’s strategic objectives. The 
Committee makes recommendations based on the merit of individual candidates, having due regard for the 
benefits of diversity in the broadest sense, including gender and ethnicity and also the need to ensure the effective 
functioning of the Board at all times, especially as membership of the Board is refreshed.

In order to help achieve these aspirations, the Committee only partners with firms accredited under the Enhanced 
Code of Conduct for Executive Search Firms. The use of Executive search firms helps to ensure non-UK nationals, 
women and candidates from historically under-represented ethnic groups are represented on the shortlist for all 
Board positions. 

As at 31 July 2023, the Board met all of its own diversity targets, as well as the targets set out in the Financial 
Conduct Authority’s Listing Rule 9.8.6R(9)(a). Steve Williams was appointed to the Board on 1 September 2023.  
As Sir George Buckley will step down from the Board at the conclusion of the AGM in November 2023, the Board is 
satisfied that its gender and ethnicity targets will not be impacted on a long-term basis. Numerical diversity data, 
in the format required by Listing Rule 9.8.6R(10), is outlined below as at 31 July 2023. The Board and executive 
management were asked to disclose which characteristic they identified with.

INDEPENDENCE AND OBJECTIVITY
The Board keeps the independence of the Non-
executive Directors under continuous review. In July 
2023, the Committee reviewed the guidance contained 
in the Code and assessed the performance and 
independence of each of the Non-executive Directors.

Bill Seeger was appointed as a Director in May 2014  
and as such he has served on the Board for more  
than nine years. A particularly rigorous review of Bill’s 
performance and independence was undertaken.  
The Board concluded that he contributed to 
constructive challenge and debate at meetings and  
that he continues to demonstrate the qualities of 
objectivity and independence. 

Having served on the Board for more than six years, 
Mark Seligman’s continued objectivity and 
independence was also subject to rigorous review. 

The Committee concluded that each of the Non-
executive Directors that were assessed contributed 
effectively to the operation of the Board and that they 
should all be considered as independent and objective.

CONFLICTS OF INTEREST 
All Directors must avoid situations where they have a 
direct or indirect interest that conflicts, or may possibly 
conflict, with the best interests of Smiths. The Board 
has the authority to authorise conflicts and potential 
conflicts in accordance with our Articles of Association 
and the Companies Act 2006 (Act), and Board approval 
must be granted before a Director accepts a new 
external appointment, whether it amounts to a conflict 
or not. The Company Secretary maintains a Register  
of Conflicts which is reviewed by the Directors at least 
twice a year, and the Board retains the power to vary  
or terminate any authorisation previously provided.

DIRECTOR ELECTION AND  
RE-ELECTION
Each year Smiths Directors are subject to election or 
re-election by shareholders at the AGM. The Chairman, 
on behalf of the Board, has confirmed that each 
Non-executive Director standing for re-election at this 
year’s AGM continues to be an effective member of the 
Board and has demonstrated the commitment 
required. The rules regarding the appointment and 
replacement of Directors are determined by our 
Articles of Association and the Act. The Articles of 
Association can be found on our website and can only 
be amended by a special resolution of shareholders.

Sir George Buckley reached the nine-year  
anniversary since his appointment on 1 August 2022. 
Notwithstanding his tenure, following the appointment 
of Paul Keel, the Committee agreed and the Board 
supported that Sir George Buckley should be invited at 
the 2022 AGM to seek re-election and to remain as 
Chairman to oversee a period of significant strategic 
change for the Group. Following the appointment of 
Steve Williams on 1 September 2023 and after a short 
handover period, Sir George Buckley will retire from the 
Company at the conclusion of the 2023 AGM and as 
such will not be standing for re-election.

On behalf of the Board, the Senior Independent Director 
has confirmed that he supports Steve Williams’ election 
to the Board at the 2023 AGM.

The Board determined that notwithstanding that  
Bill Seeger reached his nine-year anniversary since 
appointment on 12 May 2023, he should nonetheless be 
invited to seek re-election by shareholders at the 2023 
AGM. As the serving Senior Independent Director, his 
re-election will facilitate continuity and support the 
Chair transition process for a period of approximately 
six months. Bill Seeger will retire from the Board in 
May 2024.

AUDIT & RISK COMMITTEE
REPORT

GHG emissions inventories. The completion of 
International Standard on Assurance Engagement 
(ISAE) Limited Assurance on our FY2022 and FY2023 
emissions inventories and energy efficiency metric has 
been an important achievement.

In accordance with the International Standards for the 
Professional Practice of Internal Auditing, this year the 
Committee undertook an External Quality Assessment 
(EQA) of the Internal Audit function by an independent 
third party, PwC. We were pleased with the results of 
the EQA. Our Internal Audit function's performance 
against the Standards is strong, which is a testament to 
their focus on quality and continuous improvement.

Looking ahead to FY2024, the Committee will remain 
focused on the Group’s internal controls programme 
and we will continue to oversee the development of 
plans to meet the Government’s audit and governance 
reform proposals. As I hand over the Chairmanship to 
Richard Howes, I would like to thank my colleagues on 
the Committee for their contribution during the year. 
I look forward to continuing our work in FY2024.

MARK SELIGMAN 
Chairman of the Audit & Risk Committee

CHAIRMAN’S STATEMENT
I am pleased to present the Committee’s 
report for FY2023 which is my last one 
as Chairman of the Committee. The 
Committee continues to fulfil an important 
oversight role, monitoring the integrity of 
the Group’s financial reporting and the 
effectiveness of its system of internal 
control and risk management framework. 
Details of our work can be found on pages 
92 to 97. 

A key focus for the Committee this year has been 
the development and maturity of the Group’s control 
environments. At each meeting we were provided 
with updates from the Finance Excellence function, 
particularly in relation to our internal controls 
enhancement programme. We were pleased to hear 
positive feedback from EY, who are supporting us on 
the programme. The work we have undertaken this 
year puts us in a strong position for readiness for the 
FRC proposed changes to the UK Corporate 
Governance Code.

This year we challenged the business to embed the 
level of controls we have in our financial information, 
into our non-financial information, specifically in 
respect of GHG emissions and energy data. Additional 
assurance layers were therefore established for the 
Group’s GHG and energy efficiency metrics. The Smiths 
finance teams have implemented control procedures to 
provide a second line of defence in the review and 
validation of our site and divisional Scope 1 & 2 energy 
use data, with KPMG engaged to provide a third line of 
defence in the limited assurance of our Scope 1, 2, & 3

COMMITTEE MEMBERSHIP  
AND MEETINGS
All members of the Committee are independent 
Non-executive Directors and collectively have recent 
and relevant financial, accounting and sector 
experience. Committee member biographies and 
attendance at meetings during the year can be found 
on pages 80, 81 and 84. The Board considers that 
Mark Seligman and Richard Howes have the recent 
and relevant financial experience required to chair 
the Committee. 

At the invitation of the Chairman of the Committee, 
and in order to maintain effective communications, 
the Board Chairman, Chief Executive Officer, Chief 
Financial Officer and an audit partner of KPMG 
attended all meetings. Other regular attendees 
included the Group Financial Controller, the Director 
of Internal Audit, Senior Vice President and General 
Counsel, Ethics and Compliance and Deputy Secretary. 
Divisional Presidents, the Vice President Finance 
Excellence and senior management were also invited 
to attend as appropriate. At the conclusion of each 
meeting, KPMG and the Director of Internal Audit 
were each given the opportunity to discuss matters 
with the Committee without executive management 
being present.

The heads of Internal Audit and Ethics and Compliance, 
together with KPMG, have direct access to the 
Committee should they wish to raise any concerns 
outside formal Committee meetings. 

The Committee works to a structured programme of 
activities and meetings to coincide with key events 
around our financial calendar and, on behalf of the 
Board, to provide oversight of the Group’s risk 
management and internal control process. The 
Chairman of the Committee reports formally to the 
Board on the Committee’s activities after each meeting.

pages 85 and 86, the Board has again confirmed the 
effectiveness of this Committee in its role of supporting 
the Board in compliance with its duties.

COMMITTEE ACTIVITIES
FINANCIAL AND NARRATIVE REPORTING
The Committee reviewed the full and half yearly results 
announcements, the Annual Report and the Viability 
and Going Concern Statement before recommending 
them to the Board for approval. 

The Group has internal control and risk management 
arrangements in place to support the financial 
reporting process which provide reasonable assurance 
that the financial statements are prepared in 
accordance with applicable standards. These 
arrangements included seeking divisional confirmation 
that the reported information gives a true and fair view 
of the results for the period and ensuring that record 
keeping allows an accurate and fair reflection of 
transactions. More information on risk management 
and internal controls can be found on page 96.

An important responsibility of the Committee is to 
review and agree the most significant management 
accounting estimates and judgements which impact the 
financial statements. The key areas of judgement in the 
year are set out overleaf. After receiving reports on the 
significant estimates and areas of judgement and after 
discussion with KPMG, the Committee agreed that the 
judgements made were appropriate and correctly 
reflected and presented in the Annual Report. 

Fair, balanced and understandable
The Committee applied the same due diligence 
approach adopted in previous years in order to assess 
whether the Annual Report is fair, balanced and 
understandable, one of the key Code requirements. 
This included being updated on the internal verification 
process carried out to support the Committee’s 
assessment of the disclosures made in the Annual 
Report. The Committee also reviewed various 
materials on risk management and internal controls, 
going concern and the assessment of the Group’s 
long-term viability. In doing so it considered the:

 – Accuracy, integrity and consistency of the messages 

conveyed in the Annual Report;

 – Appropriateness of the level of detail in the narrative 

reporting;

 – Correlation between judgements, estimation of 
uncertainties and issues, and the associated 
disclosures; and

 – Explanations of the differences between statutory 

and headline reported results.

Taking the above into account, together with the views 
expressed by KPMG, the Committee recommended, 
and in turn the Board confirmed, that the 2023 Annual 
Report, taken as a whole, is fair, balanced and 
understandable and provides the necessary 
information for shareholders to assess the Company’s 
position, performance, business model and strategy.

SIGNIFICANT FINANCIAL REPORTING MATTERS
The key areas of judgement for FY2023 are as follows:

AREAS OF FOCUS

ACTIONS TAKEN

IMPAIRMENT – INTANGIBLE ASSETS (INCLUDING GOODWILL) 

The Group holds a significant amount of 
goodwill, especially in relation to the Smiths 
Detection cash generating unit (CGU).

Smiths Detection was the Group’s only CGU where the impairment headroom was limited for FY2023 and where a plausible downside 
scenario or a reasonable change in key assumptions could cause the carrying value of the CGU to be close to its recoverable value. During 
FY2023, strong demand drove historical levels of growth in revenue and increased profits. In FY2023 Smiths Detection continued to navigate 
issues with the supply of key components. As orders and revenues have grown, it has been necessary for Smith Detection to build inventory 
to compensate for the supply chain variability. This has reduced cash conversion but increased the carrying value of the CGU. 

The Committee challenged the level of intangible assets and the assumptions used to justify their carrying values, including the applicable 
discount rate used for impairment testing purposes. It also reviewed and agreed additional disclosures in the sensitivity of the impairment 
model and movements in the key judgements. See note 11 of the financial statements.

REVENUE RECOGNITION

Smiths Detection and Smiths Interconnect have 
multi-year contractual arrangements for the 
sale of goods and services. Estimates are 
required at the balance sheet date when 
determining the stage of completion of 
contracts for revenue recognition.

TAXATION

The Committee reviewed management’s revenue recognition judgements. The timing of revenue recognition involves judgements as to when 
control of an asset passes to the customer or, particularly with Smiths Detection and Smiths Interconnect, as to the stage of completion of 
contract activity and whether the separate performance obligations have been fulfilled. The Committee reviewed and concurred with 
management’s conclusions on the timing of revenue recognition, significant judgements for complex programmes and contract accounting. 
See note 1 of the financial statements.

The Group has extensive international 
operations, and in the normal course of 
business the Directors make judgements and 
estimates in relation to potential tax exposures.

Management assesses the assets and liabilities recognised in income and deferred tax, as well as the treatment of losses in the UK. 
Particular focus was given to the recognition of UK deferred tax assets, deferred tax assets relating to the John Crane, Inc. asbestos 
provision, and the Titeflex Corporation CSST provision. The Committee was updated on the ongoing tax audits and the uncertainty associated 
with the outcome of tax audits that are likely to conclude in the next 12 to 24 months. The Committee noted that the final outcome may vary 
significantly from the amounts currently provided for tax risks. See note 6 of the financial statements.

VAT ERROR ON CHAIN EXPORT TRANSACTIONS

During FY2023 a historic VAT classification 
error was identified, which has resulted in 
certain European intercompany chain export 
transactions being treated as VAT exempt when 
they should have been initially classified as 
subject to VAT with subsequent refund at the 
time of export. 

In correcting this error the Group has 
recognised £2m of irrecoverable VAT and £7m 
of interest on the late payment of VAT.

The Committee was updated on the status of the investigation into this VAT classification error and the wider Group review of VAT 
classification. The Group-wide investigation identified similar classification issues in other European entities, against which provisions have 
been made.

The Committee challenged management on the treatment and agreed that the classification errors had been appropriately treated as 
non-headline. The errors uncovered relate to up to six years of past VAT practice and involve the payment and recovery of European VAT, 
spanning FY2023 and FY2024. This would have materially impacted the Group’s headline cash conversion metric during those years.

AUDIT, RISK AND INTERNAL CONTROL

CONTINUED

AREAS OF FOCUS

ACTIONS TAKEN

PROVISIONS FOR LIABILITIES AND CHARGES

The Group holds significant material provisions 
for John Crane, Inc. asbestos litigation and the 
Titeflex Corporation CSST product claims.

The Committee considered the appropriateness of the level of the provisions held against John Crane, Inc. asbestos litigation and the Titeflex 
Corporation CSST claims. In particular, the Committee considered the treatment of potential liabilities, the changes to the assumptions 
made in calculating the provisions, sensitivities to changes in assumptions and advice received from the Group’s specialist external advisers. 

The Committee agreed the ten-year time period for John Crane, Inc. asbestos litigation remained appropriate. In the case of the John Crane, 
Inc. asbestos litigation, the Committee also agreed with the judgement. However,  whilst large numbers of claims are made against John 
Crane, Inc. and other defendants every year, due to both known and as yet unknown developments in the US legal system and other events 
that will impact the asbestos legal environment, a sufficiently reliable estimate cannot be made to cover the full period over which it is 
expected that costs will be incurred. In both these cases, it was determined that the assumptions fairly reflect the position. See note 23 of the 
financial statements.

POST-RETIREMENT BENEFITS

The Group has material pension plan assets 
and liabilities and there is a high degree of 
estimation uncertainty.

The Committee considered the impact of the extreme spike in gilt yields following the 23 September 2022 'mini-budget' on Smiths Industries 
Pension Scheme’s (SIPS) Liability Driven Investments (LDIs). The gilt yield spike resulted in a sudden increase in the collateral required to be 
posted to LDI funds. SIPS maintained sufficient collateral during the spike in gilt yields, and its hedging remained intact. However, the SIPS 
Trustee acted in accordance with advice and took steps to disinvest a proportion of assets from the corporate bond/credit fund to bolster the 
LDI collateral readily available.

The Committee reviewed and agreed the methods, assumptions and benchmarks used by the actuaries to calculate the position of the UK 
and US schemes at 31 July 2023. These continue to show a net accounting surplus position which was reduced by £114m in FY2023. 

The Committee agreed with the treatment and corresponding disclosures on these matters. See note 8 of the financial statements.

PRESENTATION OF HEADLINE PROFITS AND ORGANIC GROWTH

The Group presents headline profits and 
organic growth measures which require 
adjustment to IFRS required data. This is a 
material judgement and requires a consistent 
application of the Group’s accounting policy on 
this topic.

The Committee considered the policy, presentation and judgements in relation to the Group’s performance, in particular the separation of 
headline and non-headline items. This included the consideration of which items related to the Group’s ongoing trading activity or those 
which should be recorded as non-headline. 

The Committee recognised that, as announced in the FY2022 Annual Report, the Group’s restructuring project to better serve our 
customers, maximise growth opportunities and improve efficiency has been treated as non-headline due to the project being material and 
part of a pre-approved programme. The Committee also reviewed the appropriate level of disclosure for the restructuring charge 
recognised in FY2023.

In addition, the Committee also considered those judgements in connection with items to be reflected or adjusted in organic performance. 
See note 3 of the financial statements.

INVENTORY MANAGEMENT AND PROVISIONING

The Group’s inventory position has increased 
over the past reporting periods due in part to 
investment to mitigate post-COVID-19 supply 
chain inefficiencies. 

The increasing level of working capital held by 
the business increases the risk that the controls 
and processes may no longer be appropriate to 
adequately address inherent risks.

The Committee considered the results and conclusions from inventory management and provisioning review with each division. The reviews 
challenged the divisions' inventory management and provisioning policies, procedures and practices.

The Committee noted that Detection contributed significantly to the Group’s increased inventory and had the largest inventory balance in 
the Group. However, it recognised that 80% of Detection’s inventory was either a finished good directly related to a sales order or an 
aftermarket spare.

AUDIT, RISK AND INTERNAL CONTROL

CONTINUED

EXTERNAL AUDIT
The Committee places great importance on the quality, 
effectiveness and independence of the external audit 
process. Following a tender process KPMG was 
appointed as the Company’s external auditor at the  
2019 AGM. Michael Maloney, the KPMG audit partner 
responsible for the Company’s audit since 2019 retired 
following the completion of the FY2022 audit. Mike 
Barradell was appointed as the lead engagement 
partner for FY2023. His tenure will be limited to five 
years in line with audit standards and due to KPMG 
partner rotation policies. 

The Committee confirms that the Company has 
complied with the provisions of the Statutory Audit 
Services Order 2014 relating to the UK audit market for 
large companies throughout the year under review and 
as at the date of this report.

SCOPE OF THE EXTERNAL AUDIT PLAN  
AND FEE PROPOSAL
The Committee reviewed and approved KPMG’s 
proposed audit plan and fee for the FY2023 audit.  
The Committee continued to monitor KPMG’s execution 
of the audit plan during the year. 

INDEPENDENCE AND OBJECTIVITY
The Committee is responsible for the implementation 
and monitoring of the Group’s policies on external audit, 
which are designed to maintain the objectivity and 
safeguard the independence of the external auditor. 
These policies are reviewed annually. They cover the 
engagement of the external auditor for non-audit 
services and the appointment by the Group of former 
employees of the external auditor. 

In addition to monitoring compliance with Group 
policies, the Committee’s review of KPMG’s 
independence included examining written confirmation 
from KPMG that they remained independent and 
objective within the context of applicable professional 
standards and considering the performance of the audit 
engagement partner. 

NON-AUDIT SERVICES
Notwithstanding developing practice being adopted by 
audit firms not to provide non-audit services to audit 
clients, the Committee recognises that certain 
permissible non-audit services can be completed more 
efficiently by, and be purchased more cost-effectively 
from, the incumbent auditor due to the audit firm’s 
existing knowledge of the Group and its systems. Under 
the policy approved by the Committee, it has delegated 
its responsibility for authorising the purchase of 
non-audit services from the external auditor to the 
Chairman of the Committee and/or the Chief Financial 
Officer within specific limits.

Details of the fees paid to KPMG for the year ended 31 
July 2023 can be found in note 2 of the financial 
statements. Non-audit fees as a percentage of audit 
fees totalled 6% (FY2022: 10%). Non-audit fees in 
FY2023 principally comprised audit-related assurance 
services for the interim report and the limited 
assurance of the Group’s Scope 1-3 Greenhouse Gas 
emissions metrics. 

The Group would not expect in the ordinary course of 
business for non-audit fees to exceed 20% of the 
average of the previous three years’ total Group audit 
fees unless exceptional circumstances existed. The 
Committee confirms that the non-audit work 
performed by KPMG during the year, was properly 
assessed and authorised in accordance with the 
Group’s policy.

In early 2023, KPMG identified that KPMG network 
firms in Argentina, China, Egypt, Hong Kong and Qatar 
had provided financial statement preparation 
assistance services and/or foreign language translation 
services over the period 2020 to 2023 to Smiths entities 
in those regions. The services, which have since been 
terminated, were administrative in nature and did not 
involve any management decision-making or 
bookkeeping. None of the impacted entities are 
material or significant components of the Group audit. 
In addition, there was no self-review threat in relation to 
the work performed by KPMG’s group audit team, and 

no direct or indirect effect on Smiths Group plc 
consolidated financial statements. KPMG sent a letter 
to the Audit & Risk Committee explaining the cause, 
analysis of implications and actions taken. The Audit & 
Risk Committee reviewed the letter and following 
discussions, have concurred with KPMG’s professional 
judgement, that based on the assessment of the 
breach, KPMG’s integrity, objectivity, impartiality of 
judgement, and professional scepticism were not 
impaired with respect to the impacted periods. Apart 
from this matter, KPMG has not performed any 
non-audit services during the year ended 31 July 2023 
or subsequently which are prohibited by the FRC 
Ethical Standard. 

EFFECTIVENESS OF THE EXTERNAL AUDIT
The Committee continually assessed the effectiveness 
of the external auditor during the year, including its 
independence, objectivity, appropriate mindset and 
professional scepticism. The Committee considered: 

 – The conclusion of the FY2022 audit process;
 – The audit review of FY2023 interim results;
 – Early-stage delivery of the FY2023 audit;
 – The review of audit plans;
 – Content, insight and value of KPMG’s reports;
 – Robustness and perceptiveness of KPMG in 

handling of key accounting and audit judgements; 

 – Management’s responses to any audit findings;
 – Discussions with management (both with and 

without the external auditor present) and with the 
external auditor (both with and without 
management present); and 

 – The findings of the various FRC’s Audit Quality 

Inspection Reports with regard to KPMG and the 
implications and learnings for the Smiths audit.

The Committee ensured that it was satisfied that the 
Committee’s and management’s feedback from 
previous effectiveness reviews had been adequately 
addressed. It also considered other statutory reporting, 
audit planning and scope deliverables, and that KPMG 
had continued to devote sufficient time and resources 
to understand and assess the business, its key risks 
and controls.

AUDIT, RISK AND INTERNAL CONTROL

CONTINUED

After taking into account the factors above and its 
general interaction with KPMG throughout the period, 
the Committee was satisfied that the audit was 
effective. The Committee therefore agreed that it was 
appropriate to recommend to the Board that the 
reappointment of KPMG as the Company’s auditor for 
a further year be proposed to shareholders at the 2023 
AGM. A further review of the FY2023 audit will be 
conducted ahead of the FY2024 interim results.

RISK MANAGEMENT AND INTERNAL 
CONTROL
The Board is responsible for ensuring that sound risk 
management and internal control systems are in place. 
The Executive Committee is responsible for designing 
the risk management and internal control systems and 
ensuring they are effectively deployed throughout the 
Group. The risk management and internal control 
processes identify, assess, manage and monitor risks 
that have the potential to affect the achievement of our 
strategy. The Executive Committee and risk owners 
review our principal risks throughout the year. They 
assess the effectiveness of existing controls and the 
resulting residual risks and identify any additional 
necessary actions. We have a sound risk management 
and internal control systems in place. However, they 
can provide only reasonable, not absolute, assurance 
against material loss to the Group or material 
misstatement in the financial statements. More detail 
can be found on pages 66 to 74.

EFFECTIVENESS OF THE GROUP’S RISK 
MANAGEMENT AND INTERNAL CONTROLS
In FY2023, the Committee, on behalf of the Board and 
with the assistance of the Internal Audit function, 
monitored, reviewed and assessed the effectiveness of 
the Group’s risk management and internal control 
systems in the context of the Group’s strategy, business 
model and risk appetite. 

The Committee receives risk deep-dive reports from 
the divisions and principal risk owners throughout the 
year. The divisional reports take place on a rotational 
basis to enable the Committee to cover all principal 
risks over time. The deep-dives are intended to inform 
the Committee’s assessment of the effectiveness of 
risk management and internal control systems. This 
year the divisions also provided reviews on business 
continuity, in particular supply chain, and other key 
risks as applicable to their business, for example, 
procurement, market trajectory and disruption, quality 
and ESG. It also received updates on cyber, and ethics 
and compliance risks. The deep-dives on cyber covered 
Smiths cyber security framework, employee 
communication and training programmes to increase 
cyber awareness, and planned investment to improve 
resilience. The Committee relies on other inputs to 
assess if the risk management and internal controls 
system is effective. For example, the following items 
relating to our principal risks were discussed at the 
Board, Finance Committee, and SSE Committee 
meetings during FY2023: organic growth and financial 
performance; tax, treasury, liquidity, pensions and 
insurance; technology; health and safety; acquisitions; 
litigation; our people strategy; and ESG.

Consideration of the divisional risk registers alongside 
the principal risk deep-dives and other thematic risk 
areas enables the Committee and full Board to 
understand the culture, risks and opportunities, and 
assurance processes throughout the business and the 
potential impact on the Group. No significant failings or 
weaknesses were identified. 

The Committee was also provided with updates in 
relation to the Finance Excellence Programme 
particularly in relation to projects to improve and 
standardise finance activity across the Group and 
ongoing activity to improve the financial control 
framework. The current year activity puts Smiths  
in a strong position for readiness for the FRC  
proposed changes regarding internal controls over 
financial reporting.

PRINCIPAL RISKS UPDATE
The Committee carried out a robust assessment of the 
principal risks facing the Group, including those that 
would threaten its business model, future performance, 
solvency and liquidity. We replaced our ESG principal 
risk with climate risk on our risk register. Climate risk 
covers the energy transition opportunity and risks as 
well as climate-related regulatory risks. Due to the 
increasing proliferation of cyber attacks, the Committee 
approved increasing the probability of Smiths cyber 
security risk from probable to likely and the residual 
impact from low to moderate. Other risks remain 
relatively stable. Economic and geopolitical risks remain 
elevated, although the risk of regional or global 
recession is subsiding. Actions we have taken to mitigate 
supply chain challenges remain evident in our inventory 
levels and the divisions are working to reduce inventory 
to appropriate levels while also supporting growth.

A description of the principal risks facing the Group and 
how these were reviewed to assess the Group’s viability 
can be found on pages 68, 75 and 76.

INTERNAL AUDIT
Internal Audit is independent of the business and so has 
no responsibility for operational business management. 
This ensures the integrity and objectivity of its annual 
Audit Plan, which is approved by the Committee. The 
authority of the Internal Audit function is derived from 
the Committee. The Director of Internal Audit is 
accountable to the Board through the Committee 
Chairman, although administratively the Director of 
Internal Audit reports to the Chief Financial Officer. 

In order to carry out the responsibilities, as set out in a 
charter approved by the Committee, the Internal Audit 
function has:

 – full and unrestricted access to all records, property 

and personnel;

 – independent access to the Committee Chairman 

and members of the Committee;

 – the right to request meetings with the Committee; 

and

 – the authority and obligation to report significant 
findings or other concerns to the Committee.

SMITHS GROUP PLC ANNUAL REPORT FY2023OVERVIEWSTRATEGIC REPORTGOVERNANCEFINANCIAL STATEMENTS97

AUDIT, RISK AND INTERNAL CONTROL

CONTINUED

During the period, the Committee received progress 
reports on the execution of the FY2023 Internal Audit 
Plan and discussed any high-priority control 
enhancement opportunities and action plans to address 
these. The Committee also approved the FY2024 
Internal Audit Plan, including the proposed audit scope, 
approach, coverage and budget including the allocation 
of resources.

The Committee oversees the performance of the 
Internal Audit function through the Director of Internal 
Audit’s attendance at Committee meetings, review of 
work presented throughout the course of the year, and 
a review of agreed KPIs which are reported to the 
Committee at each Committee meeting. This year, in 
accordance with the International Standards for the 
Professional Practice of Internal Auditing, the 
Committee undertook an EQA of the Internal Audit 
function by an independent third party. The results of 
the EQA conducted by PwC recognise that Internal 
Audit’s performance against standards is strong, with 
minor improvements suggested. This is a testament to 
the function's focus on quality and continuous 
improvement. The improvement opportunity identified 
related to redefining the function’s future, considering 
the increasing emphasis on internal controls and the 
changing risk environment. These will be addressed 
through the Internal Audit FY2024 Plan. 

ETHICS AND COMPLIANCE
During the year, the Committee reviewed the Ethics 
and Compliance annual work programme and provided 
oversight of investigations into allegations of non-
compliance with the Code of Business Ethics. This 
included matters raised through the Group’s ethics 
reporting procedures including the Group’s Speak Out 
hotline which allows for anonymous reporting. Smiths 
Speak Out hotline comprises a number of different 
channels (including call centres operated by an 
independent third party across the Group’s global 
operations) for employees and other stakeholders to 
report concerns.

During the year there were no matters raised that 
required the Committee’s direct intervention or 
investigations which resulted in a material loss to the 
Group or a detrimental impact on our customers or 
suppliers. The Committee receives regular reports 
on the total number and nature of cases by region, the 
ratio of anonymous vs attributed ethics reports, and the 
ratio of substantiated vs unsubstantiated cases. The 
anonymous vs attributed metric is used to monitor 
trust in the Group’s reporting system. Accordingly, the 
Committee considered that the Group’s processes and 
arrangements for employees to report concerns, 
including anonymously and without retaliation, about 
any improprieties and the arrangements for any 
subsequent investigation as necessary, were both 
appropriate and effective.

During the year, the Committee provided oversight of a 
number of areas targeted by the Ethics and Compliance 
work programme. More information on the Group’s 
approach to behaving ethically and legally can be found 
on page 39 and in the Sustainability at Smiths report 
found on our website.

ASSESSMENT OF INTERNAL  
CONTROL AND RISK MANAGEMENT 
ARRANGEMENTS
The Committee was satisfied that the Group’s 
processes governing financial reporting and controls, 
its culture, ethical standards and its relationships with 
stakeholders continued to be effective.

The Committee was also satisfied with the 
appropriateness and adequacy of the Group’s risk 
management arrangements, internal control 
framework and three lines of defence model.

REMUNERATION & PEOPLE COMMITTEE REPORT

REMUNERATION & PEOPLE 
COMMITTEE REPORT

BILL SEEGER 
Chairman of the 
Remuneration & People 
Committee

Our objectives are to create clear 
alignment between remuneration and 
sustainable, long-term stakeholder 
interests. We take account of shareholder 
views and ensure that performance 
supports the delivery of business strategy 
through targeting KPIs.

CHAIRMAN’S STATEMENT
I am pleased to present the Remuneration Report for 
the year to 31 July 2023. 

The Directors’ Remuneration Policy was approved 
at the AGM on 17 November 2021. The Directors’ 
Remuneration Report for FY2023 will be put to an 
advisory shareholder vote at the AGM on 16 November 
2023. I look forward to your continued support at the 
upcoming annual meeting.

BROADER CONTEXT FOR FY2023
We have continued to show resilience in the face of 
wider economic challenges and maintain our 
commitment to growth, execution and empowering our 
people. In terms of our people priorities, we have 
further improved our world class safety record, 
developed our internal talent pool with a significant 
increase in internal hires and launched a charitable 
foundation. The Smiths Foundation has an initial £10m 
commitment which will be used towards STEM-related 
non-profit organisations. 

FY2023 has seen the successful introduction of 
leadership behaviours at Smiths. The Smiths 
Leadership Behaviours serve as a foundation to unlock 
the full potential of our company. They describe the 
behaviours needed for the organisation to be dynamic, 
inclusive and focused on delivering results that create 
value. They apply to everyone at Smiths and are 
relevant to every role. The Smiths Leadership 
Behaviours provide a basis for which our people can be 
assessed not only on what they do, but how they do it. 

We introduced a GHG emissions reduction metric into 
our LTIP two years ago and more recently reinforced 
our commitment to our focused sustainability goals 
with the introduction of an energy efficiency metric for 
all divisions in the annual bonus. Setting the right 

metrics is undertaken in collaboration with the Science, 
Sustainability and Excellence (SSE) Committee. Further 
detail on our commitment to having relevant and robust 
sustainability metrics in our incentive plans is available 
on page 12 of the Sustainability at Smiths Report. 

INCENTIVE OUTTURNS FOR THE YEAR
The Committee considered outcomes under the 
FY2023 annual bonus and the FY2021 LTIP awards in 
the context of the performance of the business and 
wider stakeholder experience. FY2023 was a year of 
record organic revenue and EPS growth. We have 
posted nine consecutive quarters of growth and 
year-on-year improvement on all five of our medium-
term financial targets. We are well positioned for 
growth within our medium-term targets next year, 
supported by a healthy order intake. 

As a result, it was considered appropriate to award  
an AIP bonus of 70.0% of maximum opportunity for 
FY2023, representing an achievement between target 
and maximum against the financial and non-financial 
metrics. One-third of the bonus earned will be deferred 
into shares for the Executive Directors. 

The FY2021 LTIP award vested at 75.6% of maximum, 
reflecting performance over a three-year period 
aligned to the sustainable growth of the business over 
that period of time. 

The Committee did not exercise any discretion in 
respect of the incentive outcomes. 

IMPLEMENTATION FOR FY2024
The base salaries of the Executive Directors have been 
increased by 5.0% effective from 1 October 2023. In 
2022, management elected to focus a greater 
proportion of the salary increase budget on employees 
who were more significantly affected by inflationary 
pressures. This resulted in a below-market salary 

SMITHS GROUP PLC ANNUAL REPORT FY2023OVERVIEWSTRATEGIC REPORTGOVERNANCEFINANCIAL STATEMENTS99

REMUNERATION & PEOPLE COMMITTEE REPORT

CONTINUED

increase of 2.5% for Paul Keel. Clare Scherrer did not 
receive a salary increase in October 2022. For 2023, the 
salary increase budget is aligned across all employees 
in the wider UK workforce and the increases of 5% for 
both Paul Keel and Clare Scherrer reflect this. 

There are minimal changes to either the Annual 
Incentive Plan (AIP) or Long-Term Incentive Plan (LTIP) 
for the FY2024 awards. New Product 
Commercialisation (NPC) remains an important 
strategic driver of growth. For the FY2024 AIP, the 
weighting on the NPC metric has been incorporated 
into the broader Revenue metric. Payment of the 
Revenue outcome will be subject to meeting minimum 
NPC criteria. There are no changes to the LTIP metrics, 
weightings or ranges for the FY2024 awards which will 
be made in October 2023. The metrics in both the short-
term and long-term incentive plans are aligned to the 
delivery of our strategy. 

CONSIDERATION OF THE WIDER WORKFORCE
Our colleagues are our greatest asset. The 
Remuneration & People Committee is responsible for 
the Group’s overall remuneration strategy and 
monitors pay and employment conditions across our 
workforce. During the year, the Committee received an 
update from HR leaders in a number of business areas, 
to understand how pay policies are implemented 
across the Group and highlighting a range of new 
initiatives. This included an extensive review of the 
benefits offered to our colleagues, and the introduction 
of a global parental leave policy. 

The Board as a whole continues to pursue opportunities 
for Non-executive Directors to meet with employees 
under an organised programme of in-person site visits 
to get a deeper understanding of the culture within 
Smiths. Non-executive Directors attend employee 
forums and events engaging directly with our People. 
Updates are provided to the Remuneration & People 
Committee and further details on these activities are 
provided on page 59. 

REMUNERATION POLICY REVIEW
As part of the three-yearly cycle, the Remuneration 
Policy will be formally reviewed during FY2024 
to ensure that it remains clearly aligned to sustainable, 
long-term stakeholder interests and market 
best practice. 

During this review we will consult with key 
shareholders to explain any proposed changes and 
take their views into account. The new Policy will be 
presented to shareholders for approval at the 
2024 AGM. 

COMMITTEE MEMBERSHIP AND MEETINGS
The membership of the Committee and their meeting 
attendance during the year is set out on pages 80, 81 
and 84 of this report. I had served on a remuneration 
committee for at least 12 months prior to my 
appointment as Chairman of the Committee.

Sir George Buckley is absent when his own 
remuneration as Chairman of the Board is under 
consideration.

The Chief Executive attends meetings of the Committee 
by invitation but he is not involved in the determination 
of his own remuneration, or present during 
consideration of any changes to it.

COMMITTEE PERFORMANCE EVALUATION
The annual evaluation of the Committee was conducted 
as part of the internally facilitated evaluation process of 
the Board and its Committees. The findings relating to 
the Committee were discussed with me. More 
information can be found on page 85. Overall, the 
Committee is viewed as effective and performing well 
and is rigorous in discharging its responsibilities. 

There were four scheduled Committee meetings held 
during the year and one special meeting.

OTHER ACTIVITIES OF THE COMMITTEE IN FY2023
In addition to those highlighted elsewhere in this 
statement, the Committee has also undertaken the 
following activities in FY2023:

 – Reviewed business plans and performance to 

assess their potential impact on existing and future 
incentive arrangements;

 – Reviewed remuneration of the wider workforce and 
related policies to ensure internal alignment of 
reward;

 – Approved FY2024 salary increases for the Executive 
Committee considering available budget, individual 
performance rating, position in salary range and the 
increases provided across the wider workforce;
 – Reviewed the Committee’s performance and Terms 

of Reference; and

 – Approved the Remuneration Report for inclusion in 

the Annual Report.

LOOKING FORWARD
It has been my pleasure to serve Smiths and its 
stakeholders as a Non-executive Director since May 
2014. This is my fifth and final year as Chairman of the 
Remuneration & People Committee and I am confident 
the Committee is in safe hands as I pass responsibility 
to Karin Hoeing. Karin is an experienced Non-executive 
Director and has been a member of the Remuneration 
& People Committee since April 2020. I wish Karin 
every success in this role.

SHAREHOLDING REQUIREMENTS

Executive Directors should build a 
minimum shareholding equivalent to 
the annual fixed number of shares 
awarded under the LTIP within five 
years and are required to hold shares 
equivalent to their full in-employment 
shareholding guideline, or actual 
holding if lower, for two years 
post-employment.

ALIGNMENT WITH THE UK CORPORATE GOVERNANCE CODE 
The table below details how the Committee addresses the factors set out within Provision 40 of the Code:

CLARITY

SIMPLICITY

 – The Committee welcomes transparency and regular engagement with shareholders with regard to executive remuneration. During 2023, 
as there have been no changes to Remuneration Policy, the Committee Chairman has not been required to consult with shareholders on 
remuneration matters. The Committee intends to consult with shareholders as part of the upcoming Remuneration Policy review in 2024.

 – Participants in incentive plans receive annual communications to confirm award levels and performance measures. Supporting guidance 
documents and instructional videos are available online. The Remuneration Policy for Executive Directors underpins that of the wider 
workforce and the 2021 Policy review further simplified the arrangements

RISK

 – The Committee considers the effective management of risk throughout the delivery of incentive plans, applying reasonable discretion to 

override formulaic outcomes if necessary

 – The Committee considers that the structure of incentive arrangements does not encourage unnecessary risk taking
 – For Executive Directors, one-third of the annual bonus payment is deferred into shares with an additional three years until vesting
 – Robust malus and claw back provisions are in place for incentive plans and are clearly communicated

PREDICTABILITY

 – Our Policy clearly outlines the maximum award levels and vesting outcomes applicable to annual bonus and LTIP. As stated above under 

‘Risk’, the Committee has the ability to apply discretion to formulaic outcomes and clear malus and claw back provisions exist

PROPORTIONALITY

 – There is a link between strategic business objectives and performance outcome, as outlined on page 101
 – Our Policy for our incentive plans outlines threshold, target and maximum opportunity levels, with actual outcomes dependent on 

performance achieved against predetermined measures

 – Through the design of the Policy and the discretion of the Committee, poor performance is not rewarded

ALIGNMENT TO 
CULTURE

 – Smiths Group Values of passion, integrity, respect, ownership and customer focus underpin the design and operation of the incentive 

programmes. The business strategy is supported by these Values which are widely communicated across the Company. The addition of the 
Smiths Leadership Behaviours, of which ‘Living Smiths Values’ is one, describe the behaviours needed for the organisation to be dynamic, 
inclusive and focused on delivering results that create value

SMITHS GROUP PLC ANNUAL REPORT FY2023REMUNERATIONCONTINUEDOVERVIEWSTRATEGIC REPORTGOVERNANCEFINANCIAL STATEMENTS103

CONSIDERATION OF WIDER WORKFORCE
The Committee considers all stakeholder groups when setting executive pay, including our people. The Committee is briefed on pay arrangements across the business 
and receives reports on people priorities within each of the divisions. In addition, a summary of remuneration related issues raised by employees through the employee 
engagement survey is presented to the Committee. As part of a comprehensive schedule of Non-executive Director engagement with the workforce, in 2023 all Board 
members, including the Committee Chairman attended events across our regional markets to discuss culture, people priorities, employee remuneration and benefit 
arrangements across the Group. Details of the engagement programme and in-person site visits are summarised on page 59. The overall responsibility for workforce 
engagement rests with the Senior Independent Director while each Non-executive Director has responsibility for workforce engagement in a specific geographical region 
and business area.

Clare Scherrer

SALARY
Clare Scherrer was appointed to the Board as Chief Financial Officer on 29 April 2022 
with an annual base salary of £553,750. The values in the single figure table above in 
respect of FY2022 reflect the remuneration paid from 29 April 2022. 

BENEFITS
Benefits for Executive Directors include life assurance, disability insurance, private 
healthcare insurance, car related benefits, tax return preparation and relocation 
benefits (CEO only). The benefit value for Paul Keel has been restated for FY2022 to 
include UK tax of £177,597 settled by the company in October 2022 on a grossed up 
basis for housing, car and relocation payments. This is in accordance with the CEO 
service contract. The benefit figure for FY2023 includes an estimated UK tax payment 
of £116,197, calculated on the same basis. 

PENSION

Executives may choose either to participate in the Company’s defined contribution 
pension plan or to receive a pension allowance in lieu thereof. Paul Keel and Clare 
Scherrer received an allowance in lieu of pension contribution equivalent to 12% of 
salary during the year. This is aligned to the rate available to the wider UK workforce.

FY2023 ANNUAL BONUS OUTCOME
The maximum annual bonus opportunities for FY2023 were 200% of salary for 
Paul Keel and 165% of salary for Clare Scherrer. 

For FY2023, financial metrics made up 90% of the annual bonus, with the final  
10% based on performance against energy efficiency objectives. The table below 
summarises the financial targets and the Company’s actual performance (restated

The Group EPS growth after tax performance has been calculated to exclude the 
impact of the share buy-back scheme in order to ensure the targets were not 
materially easier to achieve than when originally set.

No discretion was exercised by the Remuneration & People Committee in respect  
of the formulaic outcomes under the LTIP. No awards were due to vest to Clare 
Scherrer under this award. The value included in the single figure table has been 
calculated using an estimated share price, based on the share price over the last 
quarter of the financial year of £16.51. The share price appreciation attributable to the 
FY2021 LTIP for Paul Keel was 19.29% (£284,729). 

An additional holding period of two years will apply to the shares vesting.

SHARE OWNERSHIP REQUIREMENT FOR EXECUTIVE DIRECTORS
Executive Directors are required to build a minimum shareholding equivalent to the 
annual fixed number of shares awarded under the LTIP within five years. Executive 
Directors are required to retain at least 50% of any net vested share awards (after 
sales to meet tax liabilities) until those guidelines are achieved. Shares under 
deferred bonus awards and LTIP awards which have vested but are subject to a 
further holding period (net of assumed income tax) count towards the requirement. 
Awards that are still subject to performance conditions do not count towards 
the requirement. 

Executive Directors will be required to hold shares equivalent to their full in-
employment shareholding guideline, or actual holding if lower, for two years 
post-employment, in line with best practice guidance. To enforce this requirement, 
vested shares are held in a nominee account provided by Smiths share plan 
administrator. This policy applies to Andy Reynolds Smith, who stepped down from 
the Group during FY2021, and John Shipsey who stepped down from the Group 
during FY2022. Mr Reynolds Smith was required to hold a number of shares in the 
Company with a value at least equal to £2,109,450 at 31 July 2021 until at least 31 July 
2023, while Mr Shipsey is required to hold 54,959 shares in the Company until at least 
31 July 2024.

SHARE SCHEME DILUTION LIMITS
The Company complies with the guidelines laid down by the Investment Association. 
These restrict the issue of new shares under all the Company’s share schemes in 
any ten-year period to 10% of the issued ordinary share capital and under the 
Company’s discretionary schemes to 5% in any ten-year period. As at 31 July 2023 
the headroom available under these limits was 7.93% and 3.67% respectively.

FOOTNOTES
1  Shares owned outright 

(including vested shares 
in holding period), and 
the net of income tax 
value of shares arising 
from bonus deferral are 
taken into account for the 
shareholding requirement. 
Executive Directors have 
five years from the date 
of appointment to meet 
the required personal 
shareholding; Paul Keel 
has until 25 May 2026 and 
Clare Scherrer has until 
29 April 2027 to meet the 
requirement.

The pay data for employees in the UK workforce has been calculated using Option B, 
based on the data used for gender pay reporting, due to the availability of data at the 
time the Annual Report was published. The gender pay reporting basis comprises 
salary and benefits as at 15 April 2023 and incentive payments payable in respect of 
FY2023. The Committee considers that this provides an outcome that is representative 
of the employees at these pay levels. It is assumed that the value of employee 
benefits is 7.0% of base salary as an average across the workforce. 

The workforce remuneration figures are those paid to UK employees whose pay is at 
the 25th, median and 75th percentile of pay for the Group’s UK employees. Figures 
are shown on both the prescribed basis using total pay and also salary only which 
provides a useful ongoing comparison as it is a less volatile basis. The CEO pay ratio 
for salary has seen a slight decrease at the 25th percentile and median and remained 
static at the 75th percentile. There is a significant increase in all ratios with regard to 

FY2022 to FY2023

EXECUTIVE DIRECTORS’ SERVICE CONTRACTS
The Company’s policy is that Executive Directors are normally employed on 
terms which include a one-year rolling period of notice from the Company and six 
months’ notice from the individual. The contract includes provision for the payment 
of a predetermined sum in the event of termination of employment in certain 
circumstances (but excluding circumstances where the Company is entitled to 
dismiss without compensation). In addition to payment of basic salary, pension 
allowance and benefits in respect of the unexpired portion of the one-year notice 
period and for good leavers only, the predetermined sum would include annual 
bonus and share awards only in respect of the period they have served, payable 
following the end of the relevant performance period and subject to the normal 
performance conditions. 

SMITHS GROUP PLC ANNUAL REPORT FY2023REMUNERATIONCONTINUEDOVERVIEWSTRATEGIC REPORTGOVERNANCEFINANCIAL STATEMENTSPaul Keel is employed under a service contract with the Company dated and effective 
from 25 May 2021. He became an Executive Director with effect from 25 May 2021. 

Clare Scherrer is employed under a service contract with the Company dated 
13 April 2022 and effective 29 April 2022. She became an Executive Director with 
effect from 29 April 2022.

The service contracts for both Executive Directors may be terminated by 12 months’ 
notice given by the Company or six months’ notice given by the Director. The Company 
may elect to terminate the contract by making a payment in lieu of notice equal to the 
Director’s base salary and benefits (including pension allowance) in respect of any 
unserved period of notice. The service contracts contain specific provisions enabling 
a reduction in any phased payments in lieu of notice, in the event that the Director 
finds alternative employment during the notice period. The service contracts are 
available for viewing at the Company’s Registered Office.

CHANGE OF CONTROL PROVISIONS
In the event of a change of control, LTIP awards will vest to the extent that each of the 
performance conditions is met based on the Committee’s assessment of performance 
over the performance period to the date of change of control. For internal 
performance measures, the Committee may exercise its judgement in determining 
the outcome based on its assessment of whether or not the performance conditions 
would have been met to a greater or lesser extent at the end of the full performance 
period. Awards will also normally be pro-rated to reflect the time that has elapsed 
between the grant of the award and the date of change of control. The Committee 
retains discretion to vary these provisions on a case by-case basis.

NON-EXECUTIVE DIRECTOR FEES
Non-executive Director fees paid during FY2023 and payable during FY2024 are 
shown below. It was determined that the fee increase for the outgoing Chairman 
and the Non-executive Directors should mirror that awarded to senior employees 
and that of the wider UK workforce. The fee increases of 5.0% will be effective from 
1 October 2023.

ADVISERS TO THE COMMITTEE
During the year, the Committee received material assistance and advice from 
the Chief Executive Officer, the Chief People Officer, the Global Reward Director, 
Deloitte LLP and Freshfields Bruckhaus Deringer LLP. The Committee’s appointed 
independent remuneration adviser is Deloitte LLP. The Company Secretary is 
secretary to the Committee. 

The Company paid a total fee of £89,450 to Deloitte LLP in relation to remuneration 
advice to the Committee during the year. Fees were determined on the basis of time 
and expenses.

During FY2023, Deloitte LLP provided the Committee with information on market, 
compliance support for this year’s Directors’ Remuneration Report and the provision 
of other advice relating to remuneration governance and market practice. Deloitte 
LLP is a founding member of the Remuneration Consultants Group and a signatory to 
its Code of Conduct. Deloitte LLP provided additional tax advisory services including 
global corporation tax compliance and employee mobility advice, as well as company 
secretarial, internal audit co-source, transaction and consultancy services. The 
Committee is satisfied that the advice provided by Deloitte LLP is objective and 
independent and that it does not have connections with the Group that may impair 
its independence.

I would like to thank colleagues across Smiths who 
are driving sustainability, innovation, more efficient 
processes and the commercialisation of new products. 
The Committee has observed a real step change in 
enthusiasm for SSE matters over recent years. I would 
also like to thank my colleagues on the Committee for 
their contributions during the year and I look forward 
to continuing our work in FY2024.

DAME ANN DOWLING 
Chair of the Science, Sustainability  
& Excellence Committee

SCIENCE, SUSTAINABILITY & 
EXCELLENCE COMMITTEE REPORT

The Committee received deep-dive presentations from 
our divisions on a rolling basis throughout the year. 
The deep-dives from Smiths Interconnect and Smiths 
Detection covered science in the form of innovation 
and new product development (NPD). From March, the 
deep-dives were expanded for John Crane and Flex-Tek 
to include presentations on their divisional roadmaps to 
deliver our SBT trajectory. We also received updates on 
SES projects. These deep-dives are important to the 
Committee as they enable us to review the culture, 
opportunities and risks in relation to SSE across the 
Group. They also bring to life the innovative and exciting 
work taking place in the divisions which, in turn, 
ensures the long-term sustainability of Smiths 
business model. 

Over the next year, I look forward to the Committee’s 
continued oversight of our SSE agenda, including 
further deep-dives from the divisions and Group 
experts, together with regular progress updates on 
the development and commercialisation of our new 
products and on our journey to Net Zero. I am 
particularly excited by the opportunities presented 
when these combine, with the innovation and new 
products we have in the pipeline supporting us and our 
customers in meeting ESG commitments and the wider 
green agenda. We believe this is a continuing and 
significant commercial opportunity for Smiths. 

CHAIR’S STATEMENT
I am pleased to present our Committee 
Report for FY2023. Science, Sustainability 
and Excellence (SSE) are critical elements 
of support for the execution of our strategy. 
We had a full agenda this year on SSE 
topics and have made good progress. 

We submitted our proposed Science-Based Targets 
(SBTs) and related plans for Scopes 1, 2 and 3 to the 
SBTi in May 2023, demonstrating our absolute 
commitment to achieving our Net Zero goals. 
Completion of ISAE Limited Assurance on our FY2022 
and FY2023 emissions inventories and energy efficiency 
metric was also an important step forward. This work 
was performed by our auditors KPMG and was a 
valuable exercise to test our processes and controls 
for monitoring the accuracy of these critical 
underpinning data. 

Our ESG double materiality assessment was finalised 
with support from PwC, with the assessment 
confirming that our ESG strategy and framework are fit 
for purpose and capture well the most material issues 
for our stakeholders. 

Linking our environmental targets in the form of energy 
efficiency to remuneration for a larger group of Smiths 
colleagues has generated enthusiasm across the 
Company, focusing the business on the necessary 
cultural change and building critical foundations to 
achieve our Net Zero goals. As such, we were pleased 
to recommend further targets to the Remuneration & 
People Committee for FY2024. More information can be 
found on page 98.

SCIENCE, SUSTAINABILITY & EXCELLENCE COMMITTEE REPORT

CONTINUED

COMMITTEE MEMBERSHIP AND 
MEETINGS
There were four scheduled meetings during the year. 
The members of the Committee, their biographies, and 
attendance at meetings during the year can be found on 
pages 80, 81 and 84. The Chief Executive Officer, Chief 
Sustainability Officer and Group SES Director attended 
every meeting. Other senior leaders were invited to 
attend as necessary.

COMMITTEE PERFORMANCE 
EVALUATION
Through the annual Board evaluation process, 
described on pages 85 and 86, the Board confirmed the 
effectiveness of the Committee in its role supporting 
the Board in compliance with its remit.

COMMITTEE ACTIVITIES
The main topics considered at Committee meetings 
were:

SCIENCE
All divisions updated the Committee on their NPD 
processes and pipelines and how science, technology, 
sustainability and a deep understanding of customer 
needs and aspirations are influencing their next 
generations of products. These divisional deep-dives 
brought to life NPD in each division and enabled the 
Committee to test future developments to ensure they 
are sufficiently aspirational and aligned with Smiths 
strategic aims. The Committee is highly engaged in 
this area, regularly tracking the development and 
commercialisation of new and emerging technologies 
and products. We are excited by the differentiated 
product opportunities in the pipeline, particularly 
those designed to support our customers to 
decarbonise and deliver efficient and sustainable 
infrastructure and processes. 

SUSTAINABILITY
The Committee continued to monitor progress against 
Smiths sustainability metrics including GHG emissions, 
renewable electricity, energy efficiency, water use and 
waste disposal. The Committee was updated on the 
work of the Energy Governance Committee (now known 
as the Net Zero Delivery Committee), a cross-divisional 
working group set up to coordinate a diverse mix of 
projects to meet our Net Zero targets. These projects 
include energy efficiency projects, onsite renewable 
projects, procurement of green electricity, moving to 
green fleets and alternative energy solutions.

During the divisional deep-dives, the Committee heard 
how the divisions have been driving environmental 
change in their businesses. As part of these updates, 
John Crane and Flex-Tek’s roadmaps to achieve their 
SBT trajectories were reviewed by the Committee who 
provided challenge and guidance. 

The Committee recommended to the Audit & Risk 
Committee the approval of the ISAE Limited Assurance 
of FY2022 and FY2023 energy efficiency and GHG data. 
Internal controls and rigour relating to sustainability 
data have progressed during the year and the Limited 
Assurance review by KPMG was an important exercise 
which highlighted where control efforts should be 
focused in the future. The Limited Assurance review 
also supported the Committee's confirmation to the 
Remuneration & People Committee of the attainment 
of the FY2023 energy efficiency targets and its 
recommendation for the new FY2024 targets to be 
included in remuneration. 

An ESG double materiality assessment was undertaken 
during the year, with oversight from the Committee. 
While this was an important exercise, it brought no 
surprises but, rather, confirmed that our current 
prioritisation of ESG-related topics is indeed on those 
of highest importance to our multiple stakeholders. 
The results highlighted five key ESG topics where 
Smiths must place the most focus. These are: 1) 
improving safety, health and well-being; 2) delivering 
Net Zero GHG; 3) commercialising high-value green 
technologies; 4) behaving ethically and legally; and        

5) supply chain management. As well as confirming the 
material ESG topics for Smiths, the assessment also 
supported our choice of key development areas for 
FY2024. The Committee is pleased with the outcome of 
the assessment and that so many colleagues engaged 
with the process through an internal survey. For more 
information on the ESG double materiality assessment, 
see page 32.

We were pleased to approve the FY2023 Sustainability 
at Smiths report which provides stakeholders with an 
enhanced understanding of the Group’s approach to, 
and measurement of, ESG progress. The report can be 
found on our website.

EXCELLENCE
The Group SES Director attended each Committee 
meeting to report on SES. The Committee was updated 
on the embedding of phase two of SES which leverages 
our Group focus on continuous improvement towards 
greater results-orientated process improvements. 

The Committee heard how the appointment of Master 
Black Belts and Black Belts, as well as projects that 
align with business priorities and deliver results, have 
helped drive support for SES through the business. High 
demand in the business for SES training has also shown 
the Committee that the value of SES is understood. 
Deep-dives from each division demonstrated how SES 
is becoming truly embedded in the business and in 
Smiths culture. 

Our divisions also highlighted how they have been 
working in partnership with our suppliers on SES 
projects in the areas of supply and customer 
satisfaction to ensure continuity of supply for 
key customers. 

Finally, the Committee was updated on the Internal 
Audit review of SES. The team assessed various 
SES projects and metrics to ensure that the 
communicated benefits were accurate. This was 
a valuable assurance exercise.

OF THE ANNUAL REPORT AND THE FINANCIAL STATEMENTS

STATEMENT OF DIRECTORS’ RESPONSIBILITIES 
IN RESPECT OF THE ANNUAL REPORT AND THE 
FINANCIAL STATEMENTS

115

The Directors are responsible for preparing the Annual 
Report, including a Strategic Report, Directors’ Report, 
Directors’ Remuneration Report and Corporate 
Governance Statement, and the Group and Parent 
Company financial statements in accordance with 
applicable law and regulations. 

Company law requires the Directors to prepare Group 
and Parent Company financial statements for each 
financial year. Under that law the Directors have elected 
to prepare the Group financial statements in 
accordance with UK-adopted international accounting 
standards in conformity with the requirements of the 
Act and applicable law and have elected to prepare the 
Parent Company financial statements in accordance 
with UK accounting standards and applicable law (UK 
Generally Accepted Accounting Practice), including  
FRS 101 ‘Reduced Disclosure Framework.’

Under company law the Directors must not approve the 
financial statements unless they are satisfied that they 
give a true and fair view of the state of affairs of the 
Group and the Parent Company and of their profit or 
loss for that period. In preparing each of the Group and 
Parent Company financial statements, the Directors 
are required to:

 – Select suitable accounting policies and then apply 

them consistently;

 – Make judgements and estimates that are 

reasonable, relevant, reliable and prudent;

 – For the Group financial statements, state whether 
applicable UK-adopted international accounting 
standards have been followed;

 – For the Parent Company financial statements, state 
whether applicable United Kingdom Accounting 
Standards have been followed subject to any 
material departures disclosed and explained in the 
Parent Company financial statements;

 – Assess the Group and Parent Company’s ability to 

continue as a going concern, disclosing, as 
applicable, matters related to going concern; and
 – Use the going concern basis of accounting unless 
they either intend to liquidate the Group or the 
Parent Company or to cease operations, or have no 
realistic alternative but to do so.

The Directors are responsible for keeping adequate 
accounting records that are sufficient to show and 
explain the Parent Company’s transactions and disclose 
with reasonable accuracy at any time the financial 
position of the Parent Company and enable them to 
ensure that its financial statements comply with the Act 
and, as regards the Group financial statements, Article 4 
of the IAS Regulation. The Directors are also 
responsible for such internal control as they determine 
is necessary to enable the preparation of financial 
statements that are free from material misstatement, 
whether due to fraud or error and have a general 
responsibility for taking such steps as are reasonably 
open to them to safeguard the assets of the Group and 
to prevent and detect fraud and other irregularities. 

The Directors are responsible for the maintenance  
and integrity of the corporate governance and financial 
information included on the Company’s website. 
Legislation in the United Kingdom governing the 
preparation and dissemination of the financial 
statements may differ from legislation in other 
jurisdictions.

In accordance with Disclosure Guidance and 
Transparency Rule 4.1.14R, the financial statements will 
form part of the annual financial report prepared using 
the single electronic reporting format under the 
Transparency Directive European Single Electronic 
Format (ESEF) Regulation. The auditor’s report on 
these financial statements provides no assurance over 
the ESEF format.

DIRECTORS’ RESPONSIBILITY 
STATEMENT
Each of the Directors (who are listed on pages 80 and 
81) confirms that to the best of his or her knowledge:

 – The financial statements, which have been prepared 
in accordance with the applicable set of accounting 
standards, give a true and fair view of the assets, 
liabilities, financial position and profit or loss of the 
Company and the undertakings included in the 
consolidation taken as a whole;

 – The Strategic Report and Directors’ Report, 

together the management report, includes a fair 
review of the development and performance of the 
business and the position of the Company and the 
undertakings included in the consolidation taken as 
a whole, together with a description of the principal 
risks and uncertainties that they face; and

 – As at the date of this Annual Report and financial 

statements, there is no relevant audit information of 
which the Company’s auditor is unaware. Each 
Director has taken all the steps he or she should 
have taken as a Director in order to make himself or 
herself aware of any relevant audit information and 
to establish that the Company’s auditor is aware of 
that information.

We consider the Annual Report and financial 
statements, taken as a whole, is fair, balanced and 
understandable and provides the information necessary 
for shareholders to assess the Group’s position and 
performance, business model and strategy.

Signed on behalf of the Board of Directors:
