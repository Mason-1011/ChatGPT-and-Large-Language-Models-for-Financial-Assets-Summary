MARKETS AND 
MEGATRENDS

We track the evolution of key secular themes and trends and their impact on our 
markets and our business.

OUR MARKETS
We operate in four global markets:

MEGATRENDS
Powerful megatrends that are aligned with our purpose propel long-term growth in these markets. Smiths is 
uniquely positioned to access this growth.

REVENUE BY  
GLOBAL MARKET

GENERAL INDUSTRIAL
Customers put their trust in our products and 
services to support a wide range of general 
industrial applications in sectors including 
petrochemicals, mining, pulp & paper, water 
treatment, semiconductor testing, heating 
elements, automotive and rail transportation.

SAFETY & SECURITY 
Our threat detection equipment helps keep people 
and assets safe. Demand in the security market is 
driven by persistent and evolving terror threats, 
changing security regulations, and increased global 
air travel and trade.

ENERGY 
John Crane’s mechanical seals and systems 
support energy operations worldwide including 
downstream and midstream oil & gas, power 
generation and low-/no-carbon energy solutions. 
Growth is driven by increased global demand for 
energy, decarbonisation, productivity, and enhanced 
environmental and safety requirements.

AEROSPACE 
Aerospace growth is driven by increasing 
passenger and freight traffic and the development 
of new fuel-efficient aircraft. Satellite launches and 
emerging activities like deep space exploration are 
driving demand for high-reliability solutions in the 
space market. 

DECARBONISATION AND GREEN  
RE-INDUSTRIALISATION
The need to mitigate climate change and 
deliver secure and affordable power is driving 
a fundamental revolution in energy use, 
energy sources and energy delivery to cut 
emissions across all sectors.

Macroeconomic policies and private-sector 
commitments are accelerating the pace of 
change to disrupt established energy markets 
and lock in the triple benefits of green 
re-industrialisation (affordability, security 
and sustainability).

Investment to deliver the Paris commitment 
on global warming is projected to exceed 
US$100 trillion by 2050; 3-4 times the rate 
of annual historical investment.

Efficiency and circular economy solutions
 – Energy savings through efficiency and reducing waste is the 

most cost-effective solution to cut GHG emissions

Widespread green electrification
 – Green electricity is the most efficient and best vector for 
decarbonisation and can now be produced at lower cost 
than fossil fuels

 – Electrification is a significant and growing feature across 

multiple industrial and domestic markets

Low-/no-carbon fuels in hard-to-electrify sectors
 – Activities that are not amenable to electrification will need 

to be fuelled by zero-carbon fuels

Carbon capture
 – Carbon capture activities will accelerate as a means to 
further abate carbon emissions from heavy industrial 
sectors and enable the production of zero-carbon fuels

EVER-RISING SECURITY NEEDS
Persistent and evolving threats are driving security needs in a range of sectors to keep people and assets safe.
 – Passenger air travel growing 6.1% per annum, freight growing 4.1%
 – Consumer, business and government demands for safety are continually increasing
 – Regulatory requirements amplify demand

INSATIABLE DEMAND FOR DATA
 – Demand for data is continuously increasing as the world becomes more connected and computing expands. 
Faster data transmission, greater bandwidth and faster processing power are required across many sectors

 – Global data consumption continues to double every 4 years
 – Transmission data rates continue to double every 3.5 years
 – More than 2,100 satellite launches in 2022, vs 134 ten years ago

CHAIRMAN’S STATEMENT

CHAIRMAN’S  
STATEMENT

SIR GEORGE  
W. BUCKLEY
Chairman

Dear shareholders,

This is the final Chairman’s shareholder 
letter I’ll write to you since I retire at the 
upcoming shareholders’ meeting. You’ll 
have a new Chair, Steve Williams, at the 
close of voting. 

You will likely know I write these letters 
myself, not our corporate staff. I’ve 
always thought a personal letter from the 
Chairman is important, and I generally use 
these letters as teaching pieces. This letter 
will reflect on past achievements and 
postulate a few things for the future.

Over the last 20 years, Smiths Group plc experienced 
only very moderate organic growth. My mission as 
Board leader was to try to change that pattern. But, as 
the Chairman, you are constrained by good governance 
because directors are generally required to be ‘nose 
in, finger out’. While the Board constantly monitors 
performance, intervention only comes when the 
Board senses a significant deviation from performance 
and investor expectations. Until then, we are mostly 
advisers, guides, and inspirers, but sometimes 
cajolers and even pleaders. I’ve seen the Chair as 
a position where we can help develop the senior 
management team to learn new skills and approaches 
to persistent historical problems. All great leaders are 
great teachers. 

During my tenure with Smiths, we have seen the 
disposal of the medical business, the COVID-19 
pandemic, tremendous supply chain shortages, 
rampant inflation, the Russia-Ukraine war, tensions in 
both the Middle and Far East, and a growing trade war 
between the United States and China. 

There are always challenges and worries in any period 
of history, but this one has had several spectacular 
problems. We haven’t seen a global pandemic since the 
so-called ‘Spanish flu’ (Influenza type A, subtype H1N1) 
between 1918 and 1919. But we got one in COVID-19. 
I have written much previous commentary on supply 
chain dynamics, forecasting the end of COVID-19 and 
anticipating President Xi’s change of heart regarding 
COVID-19. I recently spoke to the UK Parliament about 
rebuilding Britain’s manufacturing and technological 
capabilities. We cannot solve poverty and social 
deprivation in Middlesbrough or South Wales simply 
by having more bankers in London. 

Two primary causative agents were at work in 
producing this larger set of challenges. During the 
pandemic, it created temporary peaks in demand for 
certain types of services, local logistics and delivery 
services, plus huge demand for electronics and things 
related to safe environments where, except for factory 
workers, we all largely worked from home. Other 
things suffered: airline travel, transportation, 
restaurants and conventional retail shopping.

After the end of the pandemic, supply chain shortages 
were generated by a simultaneous start-up of all the 
world’s economies. The illusory overshoot in 
companies’ sales demand curves also led to panic 
buying, component shortages and huge price inflation. 
The outcome of panic buying was excess and 
sometimes high-priced inventory, high-priced shipping 
containers, and energy and food shortages because of 
the Russia-Ukraine war. The illusory overshoot in 
demand was the thing that could’ve been avoided most 
easily, including its contribution to inflation.

Regarding inflation, I have often used the phrase that 
the solution to high prices is high prices. Manufacturers 
re-engineer their products, substitute new materials, 
find ways to reduce waste, and find new suppliers. 
A significant piece of the inflation in the UK was due to 
energy. To illustrate this point, I pay nine cents per 
kilowatt hour in my home in Florida for my electrical 
energy. I pay 59 pence per kilowatt hour of energy in the 
UK, about eight times as much as in the United States. 
Therefore, any energy-intensive process manufacturing 
was crushed and cannot compete long term in the UK. 
We understand the obvious smelting and steelmaking 
processes, but a surprising component of this problem 
is manufacturing cars, where the paint process is 
hugely energy intensive. One way around this might be 
using body films instead of paint.

Adaptability and 
proactive measures the 
Company took ensured 
minimal disruptions to 
our global operations 
during COVID-19. 
Over the last two 
years, the Company 
has also returned to 
encouraging levels of 
organic growth.

PERFORMANCE HIGHLIGHTS
Adaptability and proactive measures the Company 
took ensured minimal disruptions to our global 
operations during COVID-19. Over the last two years, 
the Company has also returned to encouraging 
levels of organic growth. Some comparisons benefit 
from easier year-over-year comparisons, but the 
results reported in the last two years still significantly 
bettered expectations.

Smiths businesses cover many industries, but among 
the largest are energy, construction and transportation 
– primarily aviation and airport-related businesses. 
But we also have a business in defence and vast 
opportunities to move into other areas of urban safety 
and food safety, for example. We have technologies 
currently applied to detecting military chemical warfare 
contaminants that can be applied in commercial 
property applications and the home. And sealing 
technologies developed by John Crane will have a 
significant role to play in the decarbonisation of existing 
industries, including oil & gas, and the growth of new 
low- and zero-carbon energy infrastructure like 
hydrogen, supported by carbon capture. 

One of the most exciting developments is in Smiths 
Detection, where X-ray diffraction can help identify 
specific materials based on their molecular spacing, 
not just material density, which is what traditional X-ray 
methods use. This will make Smiths the world’s most 
advanced hold baggage and carry-on baggage 
screening company.

Investors naturally worry about our end markets 
under pressure. Two of our end markets experienced 
significant contractions during the year. The first is 
electronics, particularly those related to semiconductor 
testing. The second is construction. 

Contraction in our Smiths Interconnect business 
partially relates to silicon wafer volume and certain 
types of chipsets passing through semiconductor 
manufacturing. During the pandemic, those industries 
saw huge increases in demand for electronic products. 
Those electronic end markets contracted a few 
percentage points as the pandemic eased. However, 
demand in the upstream supply chain saw temporary 
contractions year-over-year of around 40% in many 
cases. That, in turn, reflects in the demand seen 
by businesses like Smiths Interconnect. These 
contractions are perfectly normal in electronics 
and tend to be relatively short-lived. 

In any environment experiencing demand contraction, 
management has two primary responsibilities. The 
first estimates how deep the contraction will go, and 
the second is to estimate how long it will last. In any 
make-to-stock business, demand in the channel, both 
in expansion and contraction, is always many multiples 
of what happens in the end market. Typically, the higher 
the demand overshoot/undershoot, the shorter it lasts, 
as companies in the supply chain work to clear the 
excess inventory quickly. Regular readers will 
remember my forecasts of high energy costs and the 
consequence of panic buying during the illusory 
demand increase as the global economy restarted 
post-COVID-19. This is exactly what we’re seeing.

Part of our Flex-Tek business participates in the 
important US construction industry. It’s a make-to-
stock business and supplies products through large 
retailers and distributors in the United States. A similar 
phenomenon of channel demand contractions to those 
in the electronics industry happens in construction. 
End market conditions change, and the channel adjusts 
quickly to new circumstances. It does this in both 
directions: increasing or decreasing demand. So, 
there’s reason to expect that, as the calendar year 2024 
unfolds, we will see improving demand conditions in 
the construction segment of Flex-Tek. The aviation 
segment of Flex-Tek remains robust as the demand for 
new airplanes increases rapidly.

At the end of the Smiths financial year, the US inflation 
rate was 3.2% compared to 6.8% in the UK. July’s 
inflation rate was down to 0.2%, so it is clearly headed 
in the right direction. The demand for goods and 
services is up 0.3% and 0.5%, respectively. This data 
can all be found at www.bls.gov. The US Federal 
Reserve Bank has an inflation target of 2% and is still 
cautious, but perhaps unnecessarily. US housing 
starts have begun to increase again. It’s reasonable 
to expect that the upward trend in housing starts will 
continue and will accelerate once the Federal Reserve 
either pauses or ultimately reduces interest rates. In 
conclusion, the pressure on our construction-oriented 
business will ease. 

One of the most important data sets investors can 
examine is the US Bureau of Economic Analysis on its 
site, www.bea.gov. The Bureau publishes overall GDP 
numbers in a sequence of three estimates, but one of 
the most important Table 2 entries is the heading 
“Change in private inventories”. In the first quarter of 
calendar year 2023, the change in private inventories 
was a full negative 214 basis points of GDP, indicating 
that the economy was, as expected, reducing 
inventories on a large-scale basis. The contribution to 
US GDP of change in private inventories in the second 
quarter is a positive 14 basis points, suggesting an 
easing in the inventory bleed-off. The US economy 
overall is running a little over 2% growth. While that 
may not be spectacular, it’s stable in the economic 
context we find ourselves in. 

The only real negative I see is that, in my view, the 
Federal Funds Rate is still too high and likely to produce 
an overshoot in cooling demand unless the Federal 
Reserve Bank eases monetary policy soon.

CHAIRMAN’S STATEMENT

CONTINUED

INNOVATION AND R&D
 We remain committed to the belief that the best tool 
for new value creation is higher than market organic 
growth. The best unlock code to achieve this objective 
is innovation. As I have said in previous letters, the 
core of every company is dying, so the contribution 
to growth for innovation has to exceed the core 
attrition rate caused by cannibalisation, end-of-life 
technology, competitive attack, and changing 
customer preferences. 

As we embark on a new year, we focus on innovation, 
growth, and increasing value to our shareholders. 
We identified key strategic priorities guiding our 
efforts in 2022 and beyond. We will continue to invest 
in research and development, driving innovation across 
our product lines and positioning Smiths as a leader in 
cutting-edge technologies.

In an early Chairman’s letter, I said I believed the 
great crystal ball of the future for engineering 
companies is mathematics, electronics and materials 
science. The mathematics here covers every piece of 
engineering calculation and forecasting, including 
artificial intelligence, deep cognitive learning, and 
mathematical taxonomy. Electronics here include 
sensors, controllers, software, and the like. Materials 
science includes aspects of physics and chemistry, 
including X-ray diffraction, special surface coatings, 
nanomaterials, 3D printing, and graphene.

OUR PEOPLE AND 
CULTURE

Our culture inspires and empowers our 
people to deliver our strategy. The four 
key elements of our cultural framework 
support the Smiths business model 
and drive positive outcomes for all 
our stakeholders. The framework is 
underpinned by governance processes set 
and monitored by the Smiths Board, which 
has ultimate responsibility for ensuring 
that our culture remains healthy and 
drives the long-term success of the Group.

1.

OUR VALUES
Our Values are the things that are important to us as an 
organisation. They make us reliable, trustworthy and 
valued partners for each other, our customers and 
suppliers, and they make Smiths a place where we are 
happy and proud to work. We live them every day, in 
each action and decision that we take.

2.

SMITHS LEADERSHIP BEHAVIOURS
The Smiths Leadership Behaviours take our Values 
to the next level. Grouped under growth, execution 
and people, they describe the behaviours needed 
to be displayed by all colleagues for the organisation 
to be dynamic, inclusive and focused on delivering 
results that create value and enable our growth 
strategy. Leadership is a mindset at Smiths. 
Everyone can be a leader.

3.

SMITHS CODE OF BUSINESS ETHICS
The Smiths Code is the foundational document that 
outlines the standards of behaviour to which we all 
commit at Smiths. It is a practical guide to what ‘doing 
the right thing’ looks like when conducting business 
and forging relationships legally, ethically and with 
integrity. The Code is supplemented by a suite of 
policies and procedures relating to specific ethics, 
compliance and people matters.

4.

SMITHS EXCELLENCE SYSTEM
SES is central to how we solve problems and deliver 
improved results at Smiths. The SES structure, 
leadership, committed resources, tools and training 
ensure that we explicitly prioritise and resource 
projects according to impact and importance, and 
execute with greater pace, urgency and consistency 
in support of our Smiths Value Engine priorities.

SETS VISION TO INSPIRE
Collaborates to uncover future growth opportunities for 
Smiths. Shares this in a way that inspires and energises 
colleagues to take action. 

INNOVATES FOR IMPACT

on commitments and empowers others to own 
their outcomes. 

DELIVERS RESULTS AT PACE
Takes an agile, focused and resilient approach that 
delivers excellent outcomes to meet customer/
stakeholder expectations. 

LEADS INCLUSIVELY AND EMPOWERS
Champions inclusion at every opportunity. Creates the 
environment where others can contribute and thrive,

MONITORING AND MEASURING THE 
HEALTH OF OUR CULTURE 
ENGAGING WITH OUR COLLEAGUES
Our global communications activities are designed to 
engage colleagues around the world with our purpose, 
culture and strategy. Key communications materials 
are translated into our ten core languages.

MY SAY EMPLOYEE ENGAGEMENT SURVEY
We have been tracking engagement on a range of 
important cultural measures since 2017. We use the 
results of the survey in a transparent and meticulous 
way to surface issues and more precisely understand 
what we are doing well and where we need to do 
better, both at a high level and at grassroots level in 
individual teams.

Our Smiths Now app is a platform for colleagues to 
receive news from around the business and share their 
views and stories and is always active with grassroots 
content. There is also a global fortnightly e-newsletter, 
Signal, which amplifies key company news to the global 
business and our global virtual Town Halls have an 
online translation feature. Our intranet web portal acts 
as an online hub holding links to support, training and 
resources for many areas including SES, safety, ethics 
and compliance, and diversity and inclusion.

We undertook a large range of engagement activities in 
FY2023 including:

 – My Say employee engagement survey (see right)
 – Site visits by members of the Executive Committee 

and the Smiths Board

 – Global Town Halls in September and March
 – Global leadership summits for our extended and 
senior leadership teams (c.400 colleagues) in 
November, June and February

 – Live broadcasts of ‘fireside chats’ featuring female 

members of the Executive Committee and the 
Smiths Board

 – One-to-one meetings of the Chairman and senior 

leaders

 – Live broadcasts and communications around our 

results announcements, our Capital Markets event 
in November 2022, and other key CEO and CFO 
external activities

We undertook our latest survey in May 2023, 
with updated questions to align the survey more 
closely with our cultural focus areas, testing the 
following categories:

 – Overall happiness working at Smiths (our employee 
engagement eSat KPI) and excitement about our 
future 

 – Awareness and understanding of the Smiths 

Leadership Behaviours and people living our Values

 – Commitment to safety and the environment
 – Empowerment, continuous improvement, 

leadership, collaboration and understanding of 
individual priorities

 – Career, recognition, feedback and opportunities to 

learn and grow

 – Work/life balance, feeling cared about at work, 

equal opportunities

 – Diverse perspectives valued, and ability to express 

thoughts and ideas/speak out

Strengths:
 – Smiths is committed to providing a safe workplace
 – I understand how my work contributes to company 

success

 – Smiths is committed to having a positive impact on 

the environment

 – We continually improve the way the work gets done
 – People frequently express their thoughts and ideas
 – I am able to find the balance I desire between my 

work life and personal life 

Opportunities:
 – Everyone has an equal opportunity to succeed
 – I feel satisfied with the recognition I receive for 

my work

 – I have good career opportunities at Smiths

Results from the survey and recommendations are 
reported to, and discussed by, the Executive Committee 
and the Smiths Board before being incorporated into 
strategic planning to prioritise action in lower scoring 
categories. Actions include continuing our efforts to 
strengthen and upskill our leaders; using the 
Leadership Behaviours as a driver for people to share 
their opinions and ideas; building stronger diversity and 
inclusion programmes; and continuing to improve our 
talent development processes to make career plans 
and prospects more visible. Each division and function 
have also identified improvement opportunities to work 
on in the coming year.

SPEAKING OUT
Engaging and communicating on ethical matters is 
vitally important, as is colleague trust in our 
procedures. Colleagues and business partners are 
expected to be vigilant and report any activity or 
behaviour – whether in our business or those of our 
partners – that they consider may be in breach of our 
ethics codes and policies or inconsistent with our 
Values. This can be done through their line manager, 
HR representative or the Legal team, or by using our 
confidential Speak Out reporting hotline, which is 
accessible 24 hours a day, seven days a week to 
colleagues and third parties. Reports to the hotline can 
be made anonymously. This is communicated regularly 
to ensure that awareness remains high. 

We also use colleague feedback to build understanding 
of how we are doing on ethical matters, and to target 
our activities effectively. Our grassroots Ethics 
Ambassador network reviews plans and helps us to 
bring ethics to life, and to the widest possible audience, 
and our global Ethics Pulse survey delivers rich data on 
colleague perceptions across Smiths. This data is 
reported to the Audit & Risk Committee along with 
Speak Out data.

BUILDING SMITHS CULTURE IN FY2023
We recognise that a healthy culture requires continuous care and attention to support our ambitions. Some of the ways we nurtured our culture in FY2023 are given below.

SMITHS DAY

Our annual Smiths Day global celebration of Smiths culture took place in June 2023. Smiths Day celebrates our Values and the rich 
connections and relationships we have as colleagues. This year’s theme ‘contributing to our communities’ encouraged every Smiths site to 
look outwards and to undertake a locally based activity as a way of giving back to their immediate communities.

EMBEDDING THE 
SMITHS LEADERSHIP 
BEHAVIOURS

After their launch at the end of FY2022, embedding the Smiths Leadership Behaviours has been an important focus in FY2023. The 
Behaviours are intended to become foundational to the colleague experience and are central to development, talent assessment, and 
progression and reward. Our Accelerate people leadership programme, launched in FY2023, is based around the Leadership Behaviours.

LAUNCH OF 
SUSTAINABILITY AT 
SMITHS FRAMEWORK

The Sustainability at Smiths ESG framework was formally launched to colleagues at the beginning of FY2023 with messages from our 
senior ESG leaders. Sustainability is at the heart of our purpose and the framework helps us to translate our purpose into practical action 
to create sustainability value.

ESG DOUBLE 
MATERIALITY 
ASSESSMENT

Our ESG double materiality assessment undertaken in FY2023 provided a robust analysis of the importance of culture and other ESG topics 
at Smiths. Safety, ethical behaviour and diversity were all highlighted as either highest-impact topics or critical enablers in the findings. 
Read more on page 33.

This year’s Smiths Day 
theme ‘contributing 
to our communities’ 
encouraged every 
Smiths site to look 
outwards and to 
undertake a locally-
based activity as 
way of giving back 
to their immediate 
communities. 

LAUNCH OF SMITHS 
GROUP FOUNDATION

The Smiths Group Foundation, a charitable giving foundation with a committed initial fund of £10m, was launched on Smiths Day to provide 
grants to charitable organisations that align with our purpose. At the same time, we launched global colleague volunteering principles 
which will enable every Smiths colleague to take one day paid volunteering leave each year from FY2024, and formal budgeting 
opportunities for charitable giving in our divisions, China and Group to support organisations falling outside of the scope of the Foundation.

CELEBRATION AND 
RECOGNITION EVENTS

Group and team events and communications recognised and celebrated: World Day for Health and Safety at Work; Earth Day; Global 
Recycling Day; International Women in Engineering Day; International Women’s Day; Black History Month; and Pride month. 

NEW CODE OF 
BUSINESS ETHICS

Our new Code of Business Ethics was launched by CEO Paul Keel in July 2023. The new Code is organised under our Values, is shorter 
and easier to read, and more practical to apply with links to all our policies. The new Code will be embedded through a programme of 
activity in FY2024.

SPEAK OUT 
AWARENESS

Speak Out awareness activities have been ongoing throughout FY2023.

SMITHS EXCELLENCE 
AWARDS

Our annual Smiths Excellence Awards recognise achievement across a range of disciplines and are enthusiastically supported by Smiths 
colleagues. The Smiths Leadership Behaviours were reflected in this year’s award categories to emphasise their importance and impact. 
This year we had more than 500 submissions to the Awards.

Growth in energy revenue.

Fellow shareholders,

Smiths had another strong year of 
progress in fiscal 2023 as we further 
accelerated our growth, sharpened 
our execution, and developed and 
empowered our talented people. Since 
our financials and strategic progress 
are covered in good detail in the following 
report, I will devote the lion’s share of this 
year’s message to longer-term trends 
underway in the markets we serve. In 
particular, I will comment on a curious 
disconnect I observe between the macro 
and the micro.

Most of the macro commentary at present leans 
towards the cautious, and there is fair reason for this. 
Inflation, while climbing less steeply, remains at historic 
highs. Committed to tamping this down, central banks 
have raised rates at the briskest pace since the 1980s. 
The expected result is softening demand, as has been 
visible in most forecasts of late. Similarly concerning, 
economics and geopolitics are often inversely related, 
so just as forecasts cool, tensions around the world 
continue to warm. Speaking of warm, environmental 
concerns, percolating for years, are reaching a boiling 
point. Further still, more than a few would argue that 
things may still get worse before they get better. The 
macro, in short, is pretty cloudy.

The micro, however, provides grounds for optimism, 
especially in our industrial technology corner of the 
world. FY2023 was a record year for Smiths – record 
topline and EPS growth. We commit to five medium-
term financial targets (growth, EPS, ROCE, margins, 
cash conversion) and all five improved year-over-year. 
Promisingly, we are not alone in this regard. Over 
half of our 15 closest peers have delivered double-
digit growth across the same period. Still more 
encouraging, this was not driven by a one-time bounce 
from COVID lows (although we do benefit from still-
unmet demand in several end markets) or inflationary 
tailwinds that will eventually weaken (roughly half our 
FY2023 growth came from volume). The trends we 
see in our business are longer-lived, with growth now 
extending over nine consecutive quarters. The micro, in 
short, looks pretty good. 

So, how do we reconcile the apparent disconnect of 
economic forecasts trending down but performance 
trending up? A few important factors help connect 
the dots.

INNOVATION
First, innovation is economically insensitive. In the 
period between the ‘Panics’ of 1873 and 1893, Bell 
invented the telephone and Edison patented the 
lightbulb. During the Great Depression, Carlson 
introduced the photocopier and Edwin brought us FM 
radio. Stagflation and a raft of skyjackings in the 1970s 
led to the introduction of X-ray scanning in airports. 
Wikipedia, Skype, YouTube and Facebook were all 
formed shortly after the Nasdaq crash of 2001, and 
Uber and Airbnb were both launched during the global 
financial crisis of 2008–09. Necessity helps, but 
capabilities and capital are the true mothers of 
invention. Knowing that innovative companies extend 
their lead when storm clouds form, we increased our 
R&D investment by 14% in FY2022 and another 6% this 
year. Returns on our investments are good. Fully three 
points of our FY2023 growth came from new products 
introduced just this year alone. 

MARKET SELECTION
A second factor bridging the gap is market selection. All 
markets have cycles, but the most attractive ones cycle 
upward, in a northeast direction. Energy and aerospace 
are good examples. Energy demand has a 5- to 10-year 
cycle, with global growth peaking in 1984, 1988, 1996, 
2004, 2010 and 2021. Growth in energy demand may 
soften in any given year, but it rarely turns negative. In 
fact, global energy demand has only contracted three 
times in the past 50 years (the early ‘80s recession, the 
global financial crisis and COVID) leading to a near-
quadrupling of underlying demand across this time. 
Over 20% of Smiths revenue comes from energy 
markets, where we grew 20% in FY2023. Consistent 
with other upward-cycling markets, continued energy 
growth will be driven by secular long-term forces such 
as decarbonisation. Our world will invest around

FY2024 will mark 
Smiths Group’s 110th 
consecutive year 
of being listed on 
the London Stock 
Exchange, and our 
173rd of continuous 
operation. While a lot 
has changed across 
this time, our purpose 
of improving our world 
through smarter 
engineering has 
remained a steadfast 
guide.

US$100 trillion over the next 30 years to evolve from 
mostly fossil-based to low- and no-carbon energy 
sources. Global investment in energy will be about 
US$2.8 trillion in 2023, and investment in clean 
technologies such as low-emission fuels, carbon 
capture and heat pumps will represent more than 60% 
of the total. Clean energy investment is up 24% in just 
two years and participants in this market are seeing 
surging demand. Our pipeline of hydrogen and carbon 
capture opportunities, for example, more than doubled 
over the past 12 months. 

Aviation markets behave similarly. While the cycle is a 
bit shorter, closer to five years, the trajectory is also 
steadily positive over time. Airline passenger volume 
has only dipped twice in the past three decades (9/11 
and COVID), with volume up threefold across the period. 
As with energy markets, we are in the early days of an 
upcycle following airport closures around the globe in 
2020–21. Powerful long-term forces are also at work 
here, such as the world’s ever-rising need for better 
security and faster screening times. You would have 
experienced an example of this if you weren’t required 
to remove your laptop the last time you went through 
an airport checkpoint. This safer and more efficient 
experience is made possible by technologies like 
computed tomography, automated tray returns and 
machine learning. Smiths is at the forefront of each, 
and propelled by this, our aviation detection business 
grew 9% in FY2023.

Not all of our end markets grew last year. As our 
Chairman notes in his letter, semiconductors are 
an example. Smiths has some exposure here – less 
than 3% of Group sales. On the one hand, the 
semiconductor market shares several similarities with 
energy and aviation. It’s large (>US$500bn). It’s global. 
It consistently grows over time (+10 times in 40 years). 
And it is cyclical. However, unlike energy and aviation, 
which are both cycling up, the global semiconductor 
market is coming off a record peak in 2022. Smiths 
makes test equipment used to measure chip 
performance and durability. As expected, this business 
contracted for us in FY2023, particularly during the 
second half. We expect these challenges to continue 

through the first part of FY2024, but we remain 
confident in the coming upcycle that we have seen 
so many times before. So much so, in fact, that we 
acquired a synergistic testing business in Q2, 
positioning us to extend our leadership position 
once recovery begins.

Further to our Chairman’s letter, North American 
construction is another example of a market that 
contracted last year. Smiths also has exposure here – 
around 15% of Group sales. In this case, despite a 
market downturn, our business grew 9% in FY2023, 
marking our 14th straight year of expansion. The two 
effects mentioned earlier – innovation and market 
selection – have helped our business consistently grow 
even as the market naturally cycles. With respect to 
innovation, we have a technology platform that 
addresses specific customer needs by applying 
different resin layers to metallic tubing systems. We 
introduced a new product in this family at the start of 
the fiscal year and it is beginning to scale. In terms of 
market selection, our penetration is highest in parts 
of the US where population growth is strongest, such 
as the southeast, south central and the midwest. In 
support of this, we opened a new manufacturing facility 
in Texas in FY2023 and completed a synergistic 
acquisition in Ohio at the start of FY2024. Consistent 
with macro forecasts, we expect the US construction 
downcycle to continue for a few more quarters. 
Consistent with past performance, however, we expect 
our business to post another year of growth in FY2024. 

PORTFOLIO BALANCE
The many benefits of portfolio balance are a third factor 
enabling industrial technology companies to shine, 
even against a cloudy macro. Balance takes many 
forms. The highest-performing industrials typically 
serve multiple end markets (we serve four major ones). 
They often balance one-time equipment sales with 
recurring aftermarket service revenues (our business 
is roughly half and half). They earn more price than 
they absorb, especially important in high inflation 
environments (our delta was +£40m in FY2023). And 
they are well balanced geographically. Worldwide reach 
is a prerequisite for serving global customers, and 

upswings in one part of the world offset downturns in 
others. Smiths has people and resources in more 
than 50 countries and, aside from the US, no country 
accounts for more than 5% of revenues. Our business 
outpaced GDP growth in all major regions of the world 
in FY2023. 

LOOKING FORWARD
Looking forward to FY2024, the macro and micro 
should converge. After a period of serial downgrades, 
macro forecasts have recently started to improve. 
The most recent data published by the OECD, IMF, and 
World Bank all expect global GDP growth in 2024 to be 
modestly above 2023. Specific to Smiths, we’ve guided 
to 4-6% organic revenue growth, in line with the 
medium-term financial commitments we made at our 
November 2021 Capital Markets Day. 

FY2024 will mark Smiths Group’s 110th consecutive 
year of being listed on the London Stock Exchange, 
and our 173rd of continuous operation. While a lot has 
changed across this time, our purpose of improving our 
world through smarter engineering has remained a 
steadfast guide. I applaud my 15,000 colleagues around 
the world who live this purpose each and every day. 
I thank Sir George Buckley for his many contributions 
to Smiths over the last ten years and welcome Steve 
Williams, who takes over as Chair at our Annual 
General Meeting in November. 

In closing, we’re encouraged by our progress and proud 
of our accomplishments in FY2023. Energised by this 
momentum, we are even more excited by all we see 
ahead for Smiths.

Thank you for your trust and support,

REVIEW OF 
THE YEAR

£3,037m

Revenue

 +11.6%
Organic growth.

Smiths delivered record organic revenue 
growth of +11.6%, ahead of guidance. We 
generated £501m of operating profit, up 
+20.0% on FY2022 as we continue to make 
progress on our strategy. 

GROWTH 
Accelerating growth is the primary driver of unlocking 
enhanced value creation for the Group. We grew in 
every quarter of FY2023 and raised our guidance three 
times during the year, delivering record organic 
revenue growth of +11.6%. We have now delivered nine 
consecutive quarters of organic revenue growth.

Strong growth continued in the second half for our two 
largest businesses; with both John Crane and Smiths 
Detection delivering double digit growth throughout the 
year. Flex-Tek continued to grow into the second half, 
with growth moderating to +3.6% reflecting the 
anticipated softness in the US construction market. 
Smiths Interconnect declined (8.4)% in the second half, 
as anticipated, impacted by a weakening semiconductor 
test market as well as delays in some large defence 
and aerospace programmes. 

Revenue grew +18.3% on a reported basis, to £3,037m 
(FY2022: £2,566m). This included +£146m of favourable 
foreign exchange translation, and +£8m from the 
acquisition of Plastronics in January 2023. 

Strong execution to access end market opportunity  
is the first of the four actionable levers for accelerating 
growth. 

Our business operates across four major global end 
markets: General Industrial, Safety & Security, Energy, 
and Aerospace. Our strong market positions, coupled 

with the balanced market exposure we have across 
our businesses, are distinctive long-term advantages 
for Smiths. 

Smiths organic revenue in our largest end market, 
General Industrial, grew +7.8% in FY2023, supported 
by strong demand for John Crane’s industrial products 
in chemical processing, water treatment and life 
sciences. Slower H2 growth of +1.0% reflects a strong 
prior year performance, and a softening in demand 
for Flex-Tek’s heating, ventilation and air conditioning 
(“HVAC”) products and Smiths Interconnect 
semiconductor test solutions. Organic revenue growth 
in Safety & Security was +11.9%, accelerating in the 
second half due to Smiths Detection’s strong delivery 
against its orderbook, partially offset by a decline in 
Smiths Interconnect from the timing of defence 
programmes. The +19.5% growth in Energy reflected 
strong demand in John Crane. Growth in Aerospace of 
+10.5% continued throughout the year driven by aircraft 
build demand benefiting Flex-Tek; and helping to offset 
the impact of delays in aerospace programmes in 
Smiths Interconnect. 

Our second lever for faster growth is improved new 
product development and commercialisation. During 
FY2023, +310bps of growth was delivered from high 
impact new products including John Crane’s next-
generation diamond coating product offering for 
high-speed and high-heat applications, Smiths 
Detection’s next-generation CTiX scanners installed 
with threat recognition software, and Flex-Tek’s ducting 
in the energy efficient Rheia air management systems.

revenues coming from products launched in the last 
five years, was 31% (FY2022: 31%), supported by our 
successful new product commercialisation. 

As an industrial technology leader, continuing to invest 
in R&D ensures we capitalise on the wealth of 
opportunities in our pipeline, with increasing demand 
for our sustainability-related products. During FY2023, 
we invested £113m in R&D (FY2022: £107m), of which 
£73m (FY2022: £80m) was an income statement 
charge, £21m was capitalised (FY2022: £12m) and £19m 
(FY2022: £15m) was funded by customers. 

To support new product launches, and the strong 
demand for our existing solutions, we increased capex 
+14.1% in FY2023 to £81m (FY2022: £71m). This 
represents 1.6x depreciation and amortisation 
(FY2022: 1.5x). 

Our third growth lever is building out priority 
adjacencies. Each of our four businesses are 
executing strategies to expand beyond their existing 
core markets and ensure we capitalise on the long-
term megatrends of energy transition and sustainability, 
increasing security needs and enhanced connectivity. 
Examples in FY2023 include Flex-Tek’s high 
temperature heating solution for the world’s first 
green steel production facility; and Smiths Detection’s 
+34.9% revenue growth in the other security systems 
segment, supported by key wins in ports and borders 
and parcel delivery markets. 

Our fourth growth lever is using disciplined M&A to 
augment our organic growth focus. In January 2023, 
Smiths Interconnect acquired Plastronics, a leading 
supplier of burn-in test sockets and patented spring 
probe contacts, extending our reach into an attractive 
market adjacency. We will benefit from Plastronics’ 
attractive position in artificial intelligence, data centres 
and automotive end markets, and expanding 
Plastronics’ sales globally by leveraging Smiths 
Interconnect’s strong presence in Asia. 

Following the year end, in August 2023 we acquired 
Heating & Cooling Products (“HCP”) in our Flex-Tek 
business. This further expands the Group’s presence in 

the North American HVAC market, enabling Smiths to 
serve more customers with an even broader product 
range. Acquired for $82m (approximately £65m), at less 
than 7x estimated 2023 EBITDA, this acquisition further 
demonstrates our disciplined and targeted approach 
to M&A. 

EXECUTION 
Stronger execution is our second key priority.

In FY2023, headline operating profit grew +12.7% 
(+£57m) on an organic basis, and +20.0% (+£84m) on  
a reported basis to £501m (FY2022: £417m). Headline 
operating profit benefited from strong profit growth  
in John Crane and Smiths Detection, and a solid 
contribution in Flex-Tek, partially offset by a decline  
in Smiths Interconnect.

Headline operating profit margin was 16.5%, up +20bps 
on a reported basis supported by volume growth, 
pricing more than offsetting inflation and the benefits of 
SES and savings actions, all of which offset the impact 
of product mix and investment in growth. By division, 
strong operating leverage in John Crane reflected 
improved execution and supply chain conditions. Smiths 
Detection also improved its margin despite higher 
Original Equipment (“OE”) sales mix. Flex-Tek and 
Smiths Interconnect contracted from their record prior 
year highs, with Flex-Tek continuing to invest in new 
product development and commercialisation, and 
Smiths Interconnect seeing lower volumes.

Headline EPS grew +39.6%, driven by headline 
operating profit growth which contributed over a third 
of the growth, the share buyback programme which 

contributed a third, with the remainder of the growth 
coming from FX and a reduction in both the effective 
headline tax rate and interest expense. The headline tax 
charge for FY2023 of £121m (FY2022: £104m) 
represents an effective rate of 26.0% (FY2022: 27.6%).

ROCE increased +150bps to 15.7% (FY2022: 14.2%) 
reflecting the higher profitability of the Group. 
For further detail, please refer to note 29 of the 
financial statements.

Headline operating cash conversion for FY2023 was 
86% (FY2022: 80%), with stronger conversion in the 
second half supported by improvement in working 
capital. This was delivered through targeted and 
disciplined working capital management helped by 
focused SES projects. Headline operating cash-flow4 
was £433m (FY2022: £332m). In FY2023, free cash-
flow4 generation was £178m (FY2022: £130m) or 35% 
of headline operating profit (FY2022: 31%).

During FY2023 we continued to make good progress 
on SES. There are currently 71 Black Belt projects 
completed or underway, being driven by our 6 Master 
Black Belt and 31 Black Belt employees across the 
Group. Projects completed in the year contributed 
£14m of profit, ahead of our plan of £12m. For FY2024, 
we expect a contribution of £20m from SES as our 
hopper of new projects continues to scale. 

We implemented some targeted savings projects 
across the Group through FY2023. These projects were 
focused on simplification and improving efficiency. 
Costs amounting to £36m in respect of these projects 
have been charged to non-headline in the year, with no 
further charges anticipated. In line with our previous 
communications, £11m of benefit was realised in 
FY2023 from these projects, with the annualised 
benefits expected to be £25m.

CHIEF EXECUTIVE OFFICER’S REVIEW

PEOPLE
Inspiring and empowering our people is our third key 
priority and our people plan is focused around four key 
areas of safety, leadership development, diversity, 
equity and inclusion, and engagement. 

The first area, safety, is at the forefront of everything we 
do. Our Recordable Incident Rate (“RIR”) for FY2023 
improved to 0.41 (FY2022:0.56), and we delivered a 
record low lost time injury rate of 0.14. This 
improvement in safety has been achieved through 
continuous reinforcement of our safety culture with 
over 13,000 Safety Leadership Tours and Safety 
Observations undertaken in the year. Of particular 
focus was our Royal Metal site, acquired in 2021, which 
delivered an 80% reduction in the number of incidents 
through changes to manufacturing, new risk 
management processes and leveraging technology to 
make safety easier. 

Our biggest people initiative this year was the continued 
rollout of our Smiths Leadership Behaviours to define 
our expectations for an inclusive and high-performance 
culture. We continued the rollout of these seven 
behaviours to fully embed them throughout the 
organisation. We completed 94 workshops, attended by 
over 1,600 leaders and the behaviours are now used in 
our annual performance assessment process.

Alongside Smiths Leadership Behaviours, talent 
development is a key priority within our People plan. 
We are focused on growing and promoting talent from 
within and in FY2023, 70% of open roles for manager 
level and above were filled internally, versus 39% in the 
past. To support our talent development, we have 
relaunched the Accelerate Leadership Development 
programme having trained our first 300 leaders in 
FY2023, introduced mentoring programmes with the 
Executive Committee for our high potential leaders and 
continued to develop our Early Careers Programme, 
which includes several engineering apprenticeship 
programmes. 

Promoting diversity, equity and inclusion is another key 
part of our people strategy. We are specifically focused 
on increasing gender diversity at all levels of the 
organisation and we have ramped up our initiatives this 
year, including introducing women’s support networks 
and flexible working arrangements. As at 31 July 2023, 
25% of our senior leaders, 25% of our Executive 
Committee and 40% of our Board of directors are 
women. With the help of the multiple initiatives 
throughout the organisation, we expect to continue to 
drive improvement in these metrics.

Overall, through our focus on inspiring and 
empowering our people we have seen a year-on-year 
improvement in our voluntary attrition, down 310bps to 
12% for our global employees and down 410bps for our 
engineering employees

OUR ESG APPROACH
Environment, Social and Governance (ESG) 
performance is at the very centre of our purpose, and 
fundamental to each of our three key priorities.

Growth
ESG at Smiths is approached with a growth mindset. 
Our R&D is focused on commercialising high-value 
green technology. Our progress is evident through John 
Crane’s growing presence in hydrogen and carbon 
capture markets with over 70 active projects and in 
Flex-Tek supporting the development of the world’s first

green steel production facility. Our proven ability to 
serve these customers positions us well today and in 
the future as the world increasingly relies upon smart 
engineering to achieve Net Zero.

We are executing well against our ESG strategy, with 
significant progress against our sustainability metrics, 
which are now fully incorporated into both our annual 
and long-term incentives. In the year, we launched our 
first Sustainability report, submitted our Science Based 
Targets for review and validated our framework 
through completion of our first-ever ESG double 
materiality assessment in accordance with applicable 
guidance under the Corporate Sustainability Reporting 
Directive (“CSRD”). We also extended the scope of the 
limited assurance work carried out by KPMG to follow 
the more rigorous ISAE3000/3410 standard for FY2022 
and FY2023 data. 

People
Engagement with our communities has long been a 
strength of Smiths. This year we have gone one step 
further with the launch of our new charitable 
foundation, “The Smiths Group Foundation”. The 
foundation committed an initial £10m of funding linked 
to engineering-related good causes. The mission of the 
foundation is central to Smiths purpose of “Improving 
our world through smarter engineering.” We also 
launched our global volunteering policy, amplifying the 
multitude of grass-roots efforts already in place across 
the organisation.

OUTLOOK
In FY2024, we expect organic revenue growth within 
our medium-term target range of 4-6%, with growth 
weighted towards the second half of the year. Our 
strong orderbooks in John Crane and Smiths Detection, 
along with our new product pipeline, give us confidence 
in delivering this growth despite a record comparator, 
moderating pricing environment, and the challenging 
market conditions facing parts of Flex-Tek and Smiths 
Interconnect. We also expect continued margin 
expansion in FY2024, as we continue to scale the 
Smiths Excellence System and reinvest to support 
future sustainable growth. 

ESG performance 
is at the very centre 
of our purpose, and 
fundamental to each 
of our three key 
priorities.

REVIEW

CAPITAL ALLOCATION
With our strong technology, market positions, and 
financial frameworks, our highest capital priority 
continues to be organic growth. Accretive M&A, either 
to strengthen core positions or to accelerate 
penetration of priority adjacencies comes second. 
Third, we have a strong track record of returning capital 
to shareholders, as evidenced by the £350m returned in 
FY2023, on top of the £661m returned in FY2022. 

ORGANIC INVESTMENT
In FY2023 we invested £81m in capex projects, 
including £21m in capitalised R&D on programmes 
such as next-generation hold and cabin baggage 
screening and further advancements in our 
defence portfolio. A further £73m in R&D was 
charged to the income statement, supporting new 
product development.

STRONG AND FLEXIBLE BALANCE SHEET TO SUPPORT GROWTH STRATEGY 

M&A
In January 2023, Smiths Interconnect acquired 
Plastronics, a leading supplier of burn-in test sockets 
and patented spring probe contacts. In August 2023, 
following the year end close, Flex-Tek acquired HCP, 
a manufacturer of HVAC solutions in North America.

These acquisitions support our strategy to make 
complementary inorganic investments to accelerate 
our presence in adjacent markets or expand our 
product offering. We have an active acquisition pipeline 
and disciplined M&A approach across the Group. 

SHAREHOLDER RETURNS 
During the year we continued to repurchase shares 
under the £742m share buyback programme initiated in 
November 2021, in connection with our commitment to 
return the majority of cash proceeds from the disposal 
of Smiths Medical to shareholders. We have now 
completed the share buyback programme. 

In line with our progressive dividend policy and plan to 
rebuild dividend cover after the sale of Smiths Medical, 
the Board is recommending a final dividend of 28.7p, 
bringing the total dividend for the year to 41.6p, a 
year-on-year increase of +5.1% (FY2022: 39.6p).

CHIEF FINANCIAL OFFICER’S REVIEW

CONTINUED

The final dividend will be paid on 24 November 2023 to 
shareholders on the register at close of business on 20 
October 2023. Our dividend policy aims to increase 
dividends in line with growth in earnings and cash-flow, 
with the objective of maintaining minimum dividend 
cover of around 2 times. The policy enables us to retain 
sufficient cash-flow to finance investment in growth 
and meet our financial obligations. In setting the level of 
dividend payments, the Board considers prevailing 
economic conditions and future investment plans

The Company offers a Dividend Reinvestment Plan 
(“DRIP”) enabling shareholders to use their cash 
dividend to buy further shares in the Company – see 
our website for details. To participate in the DRIP, 
shareholders must submit their election notice to be 
received by 3 November 2023 (“the Election Date”). 
Elections received after the Election Date will apply to 
dividends paid after 24 November 2023. Purchases 
under the DRIP are made on, or as soon as practicable 
after, the dividend payment date and at prevailing 
market prices. 

NET DEBT
Net debt4 at 31 July 2023 was £387m (FY2022: £150m), 
an increase of £237m as we paid £143m in dividends 
and returned £207m to shareholders via our share 
buyback during the year. Net debt to headline EBITDA4 
was 0.7x (FY2022: 0.3x). 

As at 31 July 2023, borrowings were £654m (FY2022: 
£1,166m) comprising a €650m bond which matures in 
February 2027 and £117m of lease liabilities. The £512m 
reduction in borrowings is due to repayment of a 
€600m bond in April 2023. There are no financial 
covenants associated with these borrowings. Cash 
and cash equivalents as at 31 July 2023 were £285m 
(FY2022: £1,056m).

In May 2023, we refinanced our $800m (c.£620m at 
the period-end exchange rate) revolving credit facility 
(“RCF”) which was due to mature in November 2024. 

The new RCF is for the same amount, with the same 
lenders, on substantially the same terms and matures 
in May 2028. There are no financial covenants attached 
to the new facility and it remains undrawn. Taking cash 
and the RCF together, total liquidity was over £0.9bn at 
the end of the period.

TOTAL GROUP PROFIT AFTER TAX AND EPS
Statutory profit after tax for the total Group decreased 
by 77.6% to £232m (FY2022: £1,035m) as the prior year 
included the profit on sale and results of Smiths 
Medical of £1,022m. Statutory basic EPS was 65.5p 
(FY2022: 267.1p). 

ICU MEDICAL STAKE
Since the sale of Smiths Medical in January 2022 the 
Group holds a financial asset reflecting our investment 
in 10% of the equity in ICU Medical, Inc (“ICU”). See note 
14 of the financial statements for further detail.

STATUTORY CASH-FLOW
Statutory net cash inflow from operating activities for 
the total Group was £293m (FY2022: £279m). See note 
28 of the financial statements for a reconciliation of 
headline operating cash-flow to statutory cash-flow. 

STATUTORY RESULTS 
INCOME STATEMENT
The £98m difference between headline operating 
profit of £501m and statutory operating profit of 
£403m is non-headline items as defined in note 3 of 
the financial statements. The largest constituents 
relate to the amortisation of acquired intangible assets 
of £52m, costs from savings projects of £36m, 
acquisition related costs of £7m, £9m in costs for 
asbestos litigation in John Crane, Inc and a provision 
reduction of £7m for subrogation claims in Titeflex 
Corporation. Statutory operating profit of £403m was 
£286m higher than last year (FY2022: £117m), reflecting 
higher headline operating profit and lower non-
headline charges.

Statutory finance costs were £43m (FY2022: £14m), 
mainly due to a prior year non-headline £22m foreign 
exchange gain on an intercompany loan with 
Smiths Medical.

Non-headline taxation items of £13m relate to 
amortisation of acquisition-related intangible assets, 
legacy pension scheme arrangements, litigation 
provisions and non-headline finance items. The 
statutory effective tax rate was 37% (FY2022: 87%). 
Please refer to notes 3 and 6 of the financial statements 
for further details. 

PENSIONS
Included within free cash-flow was £5m of pension 
contributions (FY2022: £9m). These contributions relate 
to unfunded, overseas schemes and healthcare 
arrangements. 

It is not anticipated that any further contributions will be 
made to the TI Group Pension Scheme (“TIGPS”), the 
liabilities of which have now been insured via a series of 
buy-in annuities. Smiths and the TIGPS Trustee are 
working toward final buy-out of the scheme in order to 
deliver certainty for the Scheme’s 21,000 members and 
remove future risk for Smiths. 

The other major pension scheme, Smiths Industries 
Pension Scheme (“SIPS”) is estimated to be in surplus 
on the Technical Provisions funding basis, and no 
cash contributions are currently being made. The 
Group and the SIPS Trustee continue to work together 
to progress towards the long-term funding target of full 
buy-out funding. 

The two main UK pension schemes and the US pension 
plan are well hedged against changes in interest and 
inflation rates. Over 90% of their assets are invested in 
third-party annuities, government bonds, investment 
grade credit or cash, with no remaining equity 
investments. As at 31 July 2023, over 60% of the UK 
liabilities had been de-risked through the purchase of 
annuities from third party insurers.

relating to this product, some in the form of purported 
class actions. Titeflex Corporation believes that its 
products are a safe and effective means of delivering 
gas when installed in accordance with the 
manufacturer’s instructions and local and national 
codes. However, some claims have been settled on an 
individual basis without admission of liability. The 
continuing progress of claims and the pattern of 
settlement, together with recent market-place activity, 
provide sufficient evidence to recognise a liability in 
the accounts. 

At 31 July 2023, a provision of £41m (FY2022: £52m) has 
been made for the costs which the Group expects to 
incur in respect of these claims. For the Group’s 
litigation provisions, because of the significant 
uncertainty associated with the future level of claims 
and of the costs arising out of the related litigation, 
there is no guarantee that the assumptions used to 
estimate the provision will result in an accurate 
prediction of the actual costs that may be incurred.

FOREIGN EXCHANGE
The results of overseas operations are translated into 
sterling at average exchange rates. Net assets are 
translated at period-end rates. The Group is exposed to 
foreign exchange movements, mainly the US Dollar and 
the Euro. The principal exchange rates, expressed in 
terms of the value of Sterling, are shown in the

LITIGATION
Smiths Group faces different types of litigation in 
different jurisdictions. Please see below an update 
on the two significant litigation provisions. For more 
information, refer to note 23 of the Financial Statements.

John Crane, Inc. litigation 
John Crane, Inc. (JCI) a subsidiary of the Group, 
continues to actively monitor the conduct and effect of 
its current and expected asbestos litigation, including 
the effective presentation of its ‘safe product’ defence, 
and intends to resist asbestos cases based on this 
defence. Approximately 310,000 claims against JCI have 
been dismissed before trial over the last 40 years. JCI is 
currently a defendant in cases involving approximately 
20,000 claims. Despite these large numbers of claims, 
since the inception of asbestos litigation against JCI it 
has had 154 cases and has had to pay awards 
amounting to approximately $190m.

At 31 July 2023, the aggregate provision for JCI 
asbestos litigation, including for adverse judgements 
and defence costs, amounted to £204m (FY2022: 
£229m) expressed at the then current exchange rate. 
In deciding upon the amount of the provision, JCI has 
relied on independent expert advice from a specialist. 

Titeflex Corporation litigation 
Titeflex Corporation, a subsidiary of the Group in the 
Flex-Tek division, has received a number of claims in 
recent years from insurance companies seeking 
recompense on a subrogated basis for the effects of 
damages allegedly caused by its flexible gas piping 
products being energised by lightning strikes. It has 
also received a number of product liability claims

Reported revenue grew 
to record levels at over 
£1bn for the first time.

John Crane delivered record organic revenue growth of 
+15.2% for the year, accelerating to +15.8% in H2 
executing well against strong demand, with orders up 
+15%. Organic revenue grew across all segments and 
geographies. Aftermarket organic revenue grew 
+18.4% to make up 71% of sales (FY2022: 69%) and OE 
grew +8.1%. 

Reported revenue grew to record levels at over 
£1bn for the first time, which was up +19.8% reflecting 
the organic growth and a favourable foreign 
exchange impact. 

In Energy, organic revenue grew +19.5% benefiting from 
an increased focus on energy security and higher 
demand for energy efficiency and emissions reduction 
solutions. John Crane is well positioned to support 
customers with their decarbonisation goals as they 
look to become more efficient and reduce leakage 
within existing facilities or invest in new infrastructure 
for low carbon alternatives. Notable contract wins in 
the year included one of the world’s largest offshore 
Carbon Capture and Storage (“CCS”) facilities in 
Malaysia and compressor seals for use in an innovative 
energy storage solution for a customer in Europe. John 
Crane’s leadership in this area was recognised by the 
UK government through a £925k grant awarded for its 
innovative high temperature sealing solution, which is 
designed to improve customer efficiency through 
reduced emissions. 

The Industrial segment grew +9.2% organically, driven 
by strong demand across chemical processing, water 
treatment and life sciences. Efficiency in industrial 
processes is as important as it is to John Crane’s 
Energy customers, evidenced by multiple wins across 
all markets.

Headline operating profit of £244m grew a record 
+25.2% on an organic basis, resulting in +170bps of 
margin expansion. This was driven by the increased 
volumes and improving plant efficiency, pricing 
offsetting inflation and benefits from SES and savings 
projects, while continuing to invest in growth to service 
the strong demand.

On a reported basis, headline operating profit was up 
+29.7%, including a favourable foreign exchange 
impact. The difference between statutory and headline 
operating profit includes the net cost in relation to the 
provision for John Crane, Inc. asbestos litigation and 
charges from savings projects.

ROCE was 23.8%, up 440bps, reflecting the record 
headline operating profit growth.

R&D
Cash R&D expenditure was 1.7% of sales (FY2022: 
2.5%). John Crane’s continued investment in R&D is 
primarily focused on reducing product lead times 
and enhancing the efficiency, performance and 
sustainability of high duty seals and hydrogen 
compressors.

John Crane plays a significant role in its customers’ 
sustainability journeys through reducing leaks, 
including for demanding hydrocarbon pipelines. John 
Crane’s recently launched Safematic Upstream 
Pumping System product nearly eliminates cooling 
water requirements, delivering significant energy and 
emissions reductions in liquid sealing.

CHIEF FINANCIAL OFFICER’S REVIEW

CONTINUED

Smiths Detection returned firmly to growth in FY2023 
with organic revenue growth of +16.4% executing well 
against the multi-year orderbook. Growth was 
delivered across all segments with particularly strong 
growth in lower margin OE, up +23.9% organically. 
Aftermarket revenue grew +10.2% organically, making 
up 51% of sales (FY2022: 54%). Orders grew +6% in the 
year, supporting revenue growth in FY2024, which due 
to the expected timing of order delivery will be weighted 
towards the second half. Reported revenue was up 
+22.6% reflecting the organic growth and a favourable 
foreign exchange impact. 

In Aviation, organic revenue grew +8.9% with continued 
strong demand for Smith Detection’s latest range of 3D 
CT machines for cabin baggage, CTIX, with over 1,000 
now sold, supported by regulatory requirements in 
many countries mandating upgrades. Smiths Detection 
continues to achieve a good win rate in Aviation with key 
contract wins in all regions of the world across the year 
including provision of CTIX machines to Birmingham 
and Edinburgh airports in the UK and JAL Airline in 
Japan, and full-sized lane configurations to the US 
Transportation Security Administration. 

Other Security Systems (“OSS”) grew +34.9% driven by 
high growth in all three sub-segments of urban 
security, ports and borders and defence, demonstrating 
good progress in these attractive market adjacencies. 
Order intake in defence was very strong for both 
current and future chemical and biological detection 
requirements, including for the US DoD on their next 
generation programme. Smiths Detection has also 
been contracted to provide security screening at COP28 
in November this year. 

Headline operating profit was up +15.4% on an 
organic basis for the year, supported by the strong 
organic revenue growth, SES benefits and targeted 
actions on cost. On a reported basis, headline operating 
profit was up +23.1% including favourable foreign 
exchange translation.

Headline operating profit margin of 11.2% was up 10bps 
on a reported basis as the benefits of SES and cost 
actions offset the mix impact of lower margin OE. 
These OE deliveries will secure longer-term, high 
margin aftermarket revenue, which together with a 
building SES impact, will support future 
margin expansion.

The difference between statutory and headline 
operating profit primarily reflects amortisation 
of acquired intangibles and charges from 
savings projects.

ROCE increased by +60bps to 7.7%, driven by the 
headline operating profit growth.

R&D
Cash R&D increased +9.8% representing 8.4% of sales 
(FY2022: 9.3%). This includes an increase in customer 
funded projects to £18m (FY2022: £14m).

Smiths Detection continued to invest in next-generation 
detection devices, new algorithms to improve the 
detection of dangerous goods, and digital solutions to 
strengthen the aftermarket proposition. During the 
year Smiths Detection launched a new high volume air 
cargo screening technology, and an extension of their 
automated detection algorithm.

In Industrial, organic 
revenue was up +9.0% 
in the year reflecting 
strong demand for our 
products, primarily in 
HVAC applications.

Organic revenue grew +10.1% in the year, with growth in 
H2 of +3.6%. Revenue on a reported basis grew +18.6%, 
supported by a favourable foreign exchange translation. 

In Industrial, organic revenue was up +9.0% in the year 
reflecting strong demand for Flex-Tek’s products, 
primarily in HVAC applications. These products include 
energy efficiency solutions such as the Rheia air 
distribution system and the partnership with Midrex to 
deliver heating solutions that enable the production of 
commercial “green steel”. As expected, demand slowed 
in the second half reflecting a softer US HVAC market. 
In Aerospace, organic revenue grew +15.6% in the year, 
with growth in the second half accelerating to +16.4% 
supported by an increasing number of aircraft builds. 

Headline operating profit grew +3.4% on an organic 
basis, driven by the revenue growth which was partly 
offset by higher costs including starting up a new 
facility in Houston to expand capacity. This increase in 
costs, together with continued investments in new 
product development and a product mix impact, 
contributed to a 19.4% headline operating margin, (120)
bps lower than the record prior year comparator.

The difference between statutory and headline 
operating profit is due to amortisation of acquired 
intangible assets and the provision for Titeflex 
Corporation subrogation claims. 

ROCE increased +50bps to 26.1% reflecting the 
continued profit growth in FY2023.

In August 2023, Flex-Tek acquired HCP expanding its 
presence in the North American HVAC market, 
broadening its product range and customer base.

R&D
Cash R&D expenditure grew in-line with sales 
remaining at 0.4% of sales (FY2022: 0.4%). R&D is 
focused on developing new products for the 
construction market, and an expanded product offering 
in aerospace.

Smith Interconnect’s organic revenue declined 
(2.8)% for the year following the strong +13.9% growth 
last year, with +3.3% growth in H1 more than offset 
by the (8.4)% decline in H2. Reported revenue grew 
+6.5% in the year including a favourable foreign 
exchange impact and an £8m contribution from the 
acquisition of Plastronics.

The performance in the year reflected a weakening in 
the semiconductor market and delayed timing on large 
aerospace and defence related programmes, partly 
offset by strong demand for industrial connector 
products such as a new medical cable assembly 
product. Contraction into FY2024 is expected with 
FY2023 orders down 17%, continued weakness in the 
semiconductor market and a slowing in connectors.

During the first half, Smiths Interconnect acquired 
Plastronics to strengthen the product portfolio and 
leverage Plastronics’ attractive positions in artificial 
intelligence, data centres and automotive end markets.

Headline operating profit declined (11.9)% on an organic 
basis, resulting in a (200)bps reduction in operating 
profit margin to 16.0%. This decline was driven by the 
lower volumes and continued investment in R&D. 
Headline operating profit was down (4.6)% on a 
reported basis, reflecting the organic decline, partly 
offset by a favourable foreign exchange impact. 

The difference between statutory and headline 
operating profit reflects the amortisation of acquired 
intangibles, acquisition costs and charges from 
savings projects.

ROCE reduced (300)bps to 13.3% driven by the lower 
operating profit. 

R&D
Cash R&D expenditure increased to 6.3% of sales 
(FY2022: 5.6%). R&D is focused on bringing to market 
new products that improve connectivity and product 
integrity in demanding operating environments. 
Product launches include the next-generation of radio 
frequency components and transceivers.

SUSTAINABILIT Y AT SMITHS

SUSTAINABILITY 
AT SMITHS

Strong ESG performance is essential to deliver on our 
purpose and create value for each of our stakeholders. 
We organise our ESG commitments and objectives 
using our Sustainability at Smiths framework that we 
first introduced in FY2022.

In FY2023, we tested and further refined the framework 
by completing an ESG double materiality assessment 
(DMA) in accordance with requirements and best 
practices developed under the EU’s Corporate 
Sustainability Reporting Directive (CSRD). As 
summarised from page 33 the ESG DMA validated the 
framework and helped to identify our best opportunities 
for value creation through our ESG performance.

During the year we submitted our Net Zero trajectory 
and targets to the Science-Based Targets initiative 
(SBTi). Our Net Zero/climate transition plan is published 
in this report. See page 40. 

Read more about sustainability in our Sustainability at 
Smiths report.

GOVERNANCE AND OVERSIGHT
The Smiths Board of Directors and Executive 
Committee have ultimate responsibility for Smiths ESG 
performance and associated governance and oversight. 
Our collaboration model enables us to bring together 
the skills and knowledge of our Board, our Executive 
team and our business leaders to harness the 
knowledge and skills of the whole Group to drive and 
deliver innovation, effective execution and best practice. 

See our ESG governance and delivery model on  
page 49.

METRICS AND REPORTING
ESG metrics and targets are incorporated into Smiths 
overall business performance dashboard and are 
reviewed annually to ensure they remain aligned with 
business priorities. The metrics cascade down through 
business and functional operating units as relevant and 
realistic building block targets that aggregate to deliver 
performance at the overall Group level. Metrics are 
reported to, and discussed by, the Executive Committee 
and the Board and its Committees. We report 
externally metrics relating to our material ESG areas 
and those required by reporting regulations.

EXTERNAL FRAMEWORKS
We also look outside the Company to benchmark and 
evaluate progress and make sure that we are learning 
from our peers, sector leaders and subject-matter 
specialists. The measures used by third-party ratings 
agencies and framework developers help us to identify 
opportunities for improvement and additional 
disclosure that helps our external stakeholders 
understand and accurately assess our priorities and 
progress. While these external frameworks do not 
dictate our path, they are very helpful to inform our 
reporting, planning and prioritisation.

See ESG metrics, targets and performance on page 44.

REWARD INCENTIVES
For FY2022, we began incorporating ESG performance 
alongside traditional financial metrics to determine the 
long-term incentive plan (LTIP) pay of our senior 
executives. For FY2023, we again assigned 15% of the 
LTIP award to reducing GHG emissions, now aligned to 
the pace of reductions required to deliver our Science-
Based Targets (SBTs). In addition, we added an energy 
efficiency metric as a component of our Annual 
Incentive Plan (AIP) that potentially benefits 
approximately 6,000 colleagues. 

We are fully supportive of emerging sustainability 
reporting obligations and will take an approach guided 
by value creation and what matters to our stakeholders. 
We are preparing the business and internal 
workstreams for this enhanced reporting.

We currently report climate disclosures aligned with 
the Task Force on Climate-related Financial 
Disclosures (TCFD). See page 47.

We participate annually in the CDP global 
environmental reporting initiative and during the year 
completed our latest carbon and water submissions to 
CDP for FY2022. 

In FY2024, we are continuing the same approach, 
setting: 

 – LTIP targets for absolute GHG reductions aligned to 

the pace required to deliver SBTs; and 

 – AIP targets for energy efficiency tailored to reward 
operational improvements that support sustainable 
and high-value delivery of our SBTs. 

New product revenue targets (including named 
sustainability-focused products) were also included in 
the AIP in FY2023.

VALIDATING OUR SUSTAINABILITY AT SMITHS FRAMEWORK  
AND APPROACH

In FY2023 we completed an ESG double materiality 
assessment (DMA) which validated our existing 
prioritisation of ESG-related topics. It also provided a 
robust analysis of critical enablers and emerging 
matters of interest and importance to our multiple 
stakeholders and emerging regulatory requirements.

We conducted the DMA over five months with support 
from a specialist team from PwC. The findings and 
proposed next steps were discussed by the Smiths 
Executive Committee and presented to the Science, 
Sustainability & Excellence (SSE) Committee of the 
Board in July 2023. We agreed next steps and these are 

being integrated into short- and medium-term strategic 
planning and resourcing decisions. They are also being 
integrated into our ESG reporting and internal 
communication and education on ESG matters to 
increase impact and realise more value from our 
performance.

DMA APPROACH 

1. DEFINE LIST 
OF TOPICS

Selection of 23 ESG 
topics based on:

 – Smiths existing ESG 
framework elements

 – Latest market 
practices/peer 
benchmarking

 – Existing and future

3. SYNTHESISE RESULTS

Internal stakeholder engagement 
including workshops, one-to-one 
interviews and a Group-wide 
colleague survey.

External stakeholder research on 
expectations and priorities covering 
customers, key shareholders, 
potential investors, key suppliers, 
peers and seven upcoming ESG 
regulations1.

Disclosures (TCFD); Taskforce on Nature-
related Financial Disclosures (TNFD); 
Corporate Sustainability Due Diligence 
Directive (CSDDD); UK and EU REACH; 
Carbon Border Adjustment Mechanism 
(CBAM).

Customers, investors and Smiths internal views were prioritised through 
weighting to synthesise results.

our performance and valued by our stakeholders.  
Of the 23 assessed topics, 21 mapped to the diamonds 
in the framework.

23 ESG TOPICS 
CHOSEN FOR 
ASSESSMENT

34

SUSTAINABILIT Y AT SMITHS

CONTINUED

ASSESSMENT
We chose 23 ESG topics for assessment based on the 
diamonds of Smiths existing ESG framework, latest 
market practices as taken from a peer benchmarking 
exercise, and an analysis of existing and future 
regulatory standards and frameworks.

We assessed each topic on two dimensions:

 – Impact materiality – an ESG topic is material when 
it pertains to Smiths material (actual or potential, 
positive or negative) impacts on people or the 
environment over the short, medium, or long term.
 – Financial materiality – an ESG topic is material if it 

triggers, or may trigger, material financial effects on 
Smiths by generating risks or opportunities that 
have or are likely to have a material influence on 
cash-flows, development, performance, position, 
cost of capital or access to finance in the short, 
medium, or long term.

GROUP MATERIALITY PICTURE
The Group ESG double materiality picture is shown on 
page 35. It distributes the 23 topics into three distinct 
categories:

Highest-impact topics: Five key strategic and 
disclosure focus ESG topics where Smiths must place 
the most focus (four of which formed part of our 
existing ESG framework)

Critical enablers and foundational elements: Eight 
topics which we characterise as the key success 
factors for enabling progress on our ESG priorities

Base expectations and emerging issues: ESG topics to 
maintain and monitor performance

As expected, we observed some differences in the 
divisional materiality pictures driven by market sector, 
nature of operations, customers, geographies and 
regulatory environments. For example, the John Crane 
and Flex-Tek value propositions are highly aligned with 
the commercialising high-value green technology topic; 
Smiths Detection is further on its path to delivering Net 
Zero, and managing risk and maintaining strong and 
effective controls is an important focus due to operating 
in highly regulated markets; Smiths Interconnect is 
positioned in markets such as medical technology and 
space exploration so products can be ascribed a social 
value; and the evolving Government policy agenda in 
China makes reinforcing data privacy and cyber 
security an important topic for Smiths China.

Our stakeholders also place different emphasis 
on topics:

Customers: many share our Net Zero goals and we can 
meet their needs both with our technologies and by 
decarbonising our operations (their Scope 3 emissions).

Investors: are attracted to high-value green 
technologies that deliver long-term growth. Investors 
also have high expectations of Net Zero delivery.

Regulators: new regulations are coming down the 
track across the spectrum of ESG topics.

Peers: like Smiths, peers are moving ahead with 
SBTi-aligned Net Zero goals and green product 
offerings.

Suppliers: maintain their traditional focus on 
compliance and controls; now expanding to Net Zero 
GHG (our Scope 3 emissions).

DELIVERING NET ZERO GHG

Our unique engineering capabilities and pioneering spirit position Smiths strongly to support customers on their 
journeys to decarbonise and deliver next generation efficient and sustainable infrastructure and processes. 
Commercialising differentiated products and services with sustainability impact has and will continue to enable 
Smiths to make a significant and positive contribution to global environmental goals. 

In FY2022 Smiths committed to ambitious Net Zero targets that align us with the UN’s critical global climate 
objectives and the ambition to limit global warming to 1.5°C. With the support of the Smiths Board and Executive 
Committee, we are planning for success with a Net Zero/climate transition plan which describes how, through 
consistent and prioritised focus across all aspects of our business over the next 25 years, we will deliver Net Zero 
emissions from our operations (Scope 1 & 2) by 2040 and our value chain (Scope 3) by 2050.

RESPECTING NATURAL 
RESOURCES

Natural resources are finite, and we believe that all businesses have a responsibility to use them respectfully and 
safely – responsibly sourcing, minimising consumption and preventing pollution. Our longstanding commitment to 
both non-GHG resource targets and product efficiency and stewardship are valued by our employees as the right 
thing to do, and by our customers as they seek to manage their own environmental footprints. 

SUPPLY CHAIN

A deeper understanding and ability to effect change in our multiple supply chains is becoming increasingly critical as 
we seek to manage risk and make progress on all aspects of ESG. 

IMPROVING SAFETY, 
HEALTH AND WELL-BEING

Our commitment to our people starts with keeping us all safe and healthy. Looking after our people in the workplace 
is an essential foundation and our number one focus. 

DEVELOPING AND 
ATTRACTING TALENT

Driving to zero injuries and improved health is a shared commitment to one another, and it requires sharp focus and 
practical action. We strive to continuously improve by reducing risk across Smiths operations. This means 
systematic analysis of data, proactively designing and investing for safety, and strengthening our global and local 
safety cultures to deliver in our varied operating environments. 

Our colleagues can do remarkable things. Their passion and expertise have driven our business forward for more 
than 170 years. It is critical that we have the talent we need to meet the demands of the future. Our organisational 
commitment is to ensure that all our colleagues have opportunities to develop their knowledge and skills, reach their 
full potential, and build a career at Smiths. Creating an environment and infrastructure that achieves this is also the 
key to attracting the right talent to Smiths, whether young people at the beginning of their working lives, or 
experienced specialists should there be a gap to fill.

Our team of colleagues represents dozens of nations, speaking a multiplicity of languages, and embodying many

inclusive and supportive work environment where every member of the Smiths team feels that they belong and can 
be the best version of themselves. We know that when colleagues feel included, valued and encouraged to make a 
meaningful contribution, Smiths will thrive as we continue to attract and retain the diverse talent that we need.

We aim to improve our world by contributing positively to our communities and society in general. Smiths products 
and services support critical global industries where we are creating social and environmental value by making the 
world safer and improving environmental performance. Our operations around the world play a beneficial role in 
local economies through job creation and skills development; procurement and generating tax revenues; and 
operating safely, environmentally responsibly and ethically. We also engage directly through fundraising, charitable 
giving and education initiatives. Healthy and prosperous communities and supportive relationships with them inspire 
and promote a sense of pride and ownership in our people. 

Behaving ethically and with integrity is a fundamental part of our culture. We also operate in some highly regulated 
markets and sectors which require strict adherence to local and international industry regulations. We have expert 
teams in place to manage these matters and we use data and other intelligence objectively to identify relative 
performance gaps and emerging risk, and continually target improvements in our procedures.

Good quality, ethical and effective decision making builds sustainable businesses and enables them to create long-
term value for all stakeholders. 

Continual assessment and management of risks, and assurance through internal controls, is an integral part of 
day-to-day operations at Smiths.

ELECTRICITY PREFERENCE 
HIERARCHY
We require electricity to run our business and, as part 
of the transition planning work, determined an 
electricity preference hierarchy to ensure we are 
making appropriate and consistent decisions across 
the Group as we move to 100% renewable electricity. 
This hierarchy has informed preparation of our 
divisional Scope 1 & 2 transition plans. 

PREFERENCE HIERARCHY:
1.   Energy efficiency measures

2.   Renewable electricity self-supply for high-demand 
sites with adequate space, access to renewable 
resources, cost-effective delivery, and where 
regulation allows

3.   Power Purchase Agreements (PPAs) – contracts to 
buy electricity for a set period of time from a specific 
energy system installed, owned and operated by a 
third party

4.   Green electricity tariffs offered by local utilities 
sourcing/generating renewable electricity

5.   Energy Attribution Certificates (EACs) – unbundled 
renewable certificates purchased separately from 
electricity. Reserved as a solution for challenging 
situations where no other option is available or viable

LIMITED ASSURANCE
KPMG has provided limited assurance under ISAE (UK) 3000 and 3410 over selected 
FY2022 and FY2023 information marked with ∆. For the full assurance opinions for 
FY2022 and FY2023 please see our corporate website www.smiths.com. This 
information was prepared in line with our reporting criteria which can also be found 
on our website.

GHG INVENTORY
Smiths assesses the GHG emissions associated with all its global operations for all 
four of its operational divisions and all sites. We have developed a GHG Inventory 
Management Plan (IMP) that outlines our methodology to provide systematic and 
appropriate GHG inventory data collection, manipulation and management, to 
produce a relevant, credible and transparent GHG inventory that will provide visibility 
into our near- and long-term goals. The IMP includes methods to estimate direct 
emissions from Smiths operations (Scope 1), indirect emissions from purchased 
energy (Scope 2), and value chain emissions (Scope 3).

The methods prescribed in the IMP conform to the World Resources Institute (WRI) 
and World Business Council for Sustainable Development (WBCSD) GHG Protocol 
and the United States Environmental Protection Agency (USEPA) Center for 
Corporate Climate Leadership Greenhouse Gas Inventory Guidance.

GHG BOUNDARIES
Per the GHG protocol, we have selected the operational control approach to set the 
organisational boundary for our GHG inventory, meaning 100% of GHG emissions 
from assets which the Company manages and over which it has authority to 
implement operational policies will be included. In selecting these organisational 
boundaries, Smiths evaluated equity share, financial control and operational control 
approaches and primarily considered the comprehensiveness of assets that would 
be included in the inventory under each of the three approaches, as well as which 
boundary would best reflect Smiths level of influence over emissions. This includes 
98 locations globally.

As for our operational boundary, which determines the direct (Scope 1) and indirect 
(Scope 2 and 3) emissions associated with operations within Smiths organisational 
boundary, we defined this as operations where we have the full authority to introduce 
and implement operating policies. Operations or activities that are outside of Smiths 
operational control, and therefore excluded from our Scope 1 and Scope 2 inventories 
may become relevant when accounting for Scope 3 emissions.

GHG emissions are reported in metric tons of CO2 equivalents (MT CO2e). Because 
individual GHGs have different impacts on climate change, or global warming 
potentials (GWPs), CO2e is used to express the impact of emissions from each GHG 
on a common scale. Smiths uses the IPCC Fifth Assessment Report (AR5) GWPs.

REWARD AND RECOGNITION
Recognising and rewarding colleagues in a fair, open and meaningful way is an 
important underpin to developing and attracting talent. We are committed to fair pay 
practices, ensuring colleagues are rewarded fairly and equally for the work they do, 
and that they have opportunities to participate in our success.

We have been an accredited Living Wage employer in the UK since 2018. In the UK, 
we operate an all-colleague Sharesave Scheme, which enables colleagues to buy 
Smiths shares at a discounted rate. In FY2023 we have continued with our process to 
align colleague benefits across markets, so they are the same for colleagues in any 
of our four divisions or Group. We completed this work in China, India and Mexico 
during the year.

TASK FORCE ON CLIMATE-RELATED 
FINANCIAL DISCLOSURES 

COMPLIANCE STATEMENT
FCA LISTING RULES
In this report, we set out our climate-related financial disclosures consistent with all of the Task Force on 
Climate-related Financial Disclosures (TCFD) recommendations and recommended disclosures pursuant 
to Listing Rule 9.8.6R (8). This includes all four of the TCFD pillars and the 11 recommended disclosures 
set out in the report entitled 'Implementing the Recommendations of the Task Force on Climate-related 
Financial Disclosures' published in October 2021 by the TCFD. In completing this work, we made use of TCFD 
guidance material including the TCFD technical supplement on the use of scenario analysis, TCFD Guidance 
on Metrics, Targets and Transition Plans, and the TCFD Guidance for All Sectors. We are reporting against 
the TCFD framework in line with FCA Listing Rules. 

In FY2024, we plan to continue our progress in reporting against all four pillars of the recommendations 
and align with the recommendations of the Transition Plan Taskforce (TPT) which is due to be released later 
this year. This will include conducting a quantitative scenario analysis. More detailed information on 
FY2024 priorities in reporting against TCFD is outlined in the TCFD summary in our FY2023 Sustainability 
at Smiths report.

The TCFD provides an internationally recognised framework to provide clear, comprehensive and high-
quality information on the impacts of climate change. Over several years, we have progressed our alignment 
with the TCFD recommendations to embed the management of climate-related risks and opportunities into 
our processes, and to ensure that our business strategy is adapting to the effects of climate change.

Our diverse range of products and geographical spread of assets allows the business to be resilient to 
climate risks, such as cost and availability of resources, in the short term. We are also well prepared for 
market opportunities presenting themselves due to climate change. However, we recognise the potential 
impacts of climate risks on our business in the long term and have continued to implement mitigation 
strategies to ensure that we remain resilient. 

GOVERNANCE
BOARD
The Board has overall responsibility for our approach 
to sustainability matters, including climate change. 
Oversight of this is delegated to sub-committees. 
Climate risk management has been delegated to 
the Audit & Risk Committee and delivery on our 
commitments in relation to climate change to the 
Science, Sustainability & Excellence (SSE) Committee. 
The Board has oversight of our Group-level and 
divisional strategies, receiving performance updates 
from our divisions three times a year. This includes an 
annual strategy presentation, an operations update and 
a half-year progress discussion. Our divisions report to 
the SSE Committee on a rolling annual basis. Read 
more about the work of the SSE Committee on page 
111. Related Board member competencies for climate 
change can be found in the Board biographies on page 
80. Our governance structure is outlined on page 79.

STRATEGIC DECISIONS RELATING TO CLIMATE 
RISKS AND OPPORTUNITIES
As the world transitions to a low-carbon economy, 
the Group has identified a number of climate-related 
opportunities relating to global investment in 
decarbonisation and green re-industrialisation. 
Commercialising these high-value green technologies 
is a strategic priority and is built into our divisional 
strategic plans. The Board also considers climate-
related issues when reviewing strategy and 
performance objectives. Energy and GHG metrics are 
presented and discussed in management reviews. In 
FY2023, the Board approved the setting of operational 
Net Zero transition targets aligned with the SBTi and 
holds responsibility for overseeing performance 
against these. The Board has visibility of implementation 
of our climate transition plan and is regularly updated 
on progress against climate metrics and targets. 

SMITHS GROUP PLC ANNUAL REPORT FY2023OVERVIEWSTRATEGIC REPORTGOVERNANCEFINANCIAL STATEMENTSThe SSE Committee is responsible for

Climate-related risks are managed and reported in line 
with wider risk management processes, with the 
outcomes of divisional assessments integrated into 
executive-level strategic planning and priorities. 
Climate-related opportunities such as those relating to 
the decarbonisation/energy transition agenda have 
been communicated to the Executive Committee and 
Board, culminating in a Group-wide strategic response 
for markets and opportunities. 

A number of key climate-related issues were discussed 
by the Executive Committee and the Board in FY2023 
including:

1.  Science-based targets and transition planning for 

Net Zero Scope 1, 2 and 3 emissions

2.  Strategic opportunities arising from the energy 
transition/decarbonisation and green revenue 
tracking dashboards

3.  Alignment of remuneration with environmental 

targets

EXECUTIVE REMUNERATION
Scope 1 & 2 reduction targets continue to make up part 
of our LTIP. From FY2023 onwards, we introduced 
climate-related metrics (energy efficiency) into our AIP 
and (absolute GHG reduction) into our LTIP to more 
closely align decision making and ownership of climate 
goals. Details can be found in the Remuneration & 
People Committee Report on page 98. FY2024 
remuneration metrics continue to incorporate these 
climate-related targets.

AUDIT & RISK COMMITTEE
The Audit & Risk Committee is responsible for 
reviewing the effectiveness of risk management across 
the business (see page 91), including climate risks 
which are integrated into our enterprise risk 
management framework. On a rolling basis, divisions 
attend the Audit & Risk Committee and present the 
outcome of divisional assessments which include 
climate risks and opportunities. Twice a year, the 
Committee reviews the Group's principal risks. Climate 
change has been identified as a Group principal risk 
and is managed and owned by the Audit & Risk 
Committee.

SCIENCE, SUSTAINABILITY AND EXCELLENCE 
COMMITTEE
The SSE Committee is responsible for overseeing the 
delivery of climate-related commitments and 
opportunities, such as the commercialisation of green 
products, mitigating the impacts of climate change, and 
setting and reviewing progress against relevant 
climate-related targets. The Committee met four times 
during the year to assess progress against targets 
including GHG emissions, renewable energy use, 
energy efficiency, water use and waste disposal. On a 
rolling basis, divisions provide a deep-dive on progress 
against their SBT plans, new product development and 
innovation. For more information on the work of the 
SSE Committee see page 111.

EXECUTIVE COMMITTEE
Divisional Presidents form part of the Executive 
Committee and are responsible for our divisions’ 
approach to sustainability, including climate change. 
The Executive Committee reports to the CEO, who 
reports directly to the Board six times a year. 
Discussions at the Executive Committee relate to 
commercial climate activities such as new product 
development and operational climate activity, such as 
energy and GHG reductions. The Chief Sustainability 
Officer works closely with the Group Head of Strategy 
and Communications and Divisional Presidents to 
ensure sustainability is embedded in strategic, 
commercial and operational decision making.

CLIMATE RISKS AND OPPORTUNITIES
We have identified a range of physical and transition 
risks and opportunities that could impact our business. 

The climate transition also gives rise to legal risks, 
such as stricter GHG emission regulations, as well 
as market risks such as from new and emerging 
competitors. Extreme weather events such as floods 
and extreme temperatures pose physical risks, 
including damage to assets, both owned by us and 
within our supply chain, as well as disruption to 
transportation routes. More extreme temperatures 
may also lead to new opportunities in our markets, 
such as remote sensing and cooling systems.

The time horizons considered for identified climate-
related risks and opportunities, found in the table 
below, align to our targets which have been submitted 
to the SBTi. While we recognise that climate-related 
risks will occur over short-, medium- and long-term 
horizons, our assessment determines that climate-
related risks and opportunities are likely to impact the 
business in the medium and long term. We believe that 
we remain resilient to climate risks with the adaptation 
and mitigation strategies that are in place. It was 
determined that the climate risks identified do not have 
a significant impact on the business, although are 
considered as a Group principal risk in aggregation. We 
will continue to assess the materiality of any financial 
impact arising.

Description

2023–2028
2028–2032
2032–2040

Each of our identified risks and opportunities has been 
assessed by scenario analysis, which is described 
alongside an explanation of their potential impact on the 
business, subsequent actions we are taking to respond, 
and the associated time horizon.

SCENARIO ANALYSIS
We have carried out scenario analysis on our climate 
risks and opportunities for several years and, in 
FY2022, we collaborated with external consultants 
to extend our qualitative scenario analysis to two 
scenarios for both physical and transition risks and 
opportunities. Next year, we plan to develop our 
assessment of financial impacts, integrating 
quantitative analysis where possible. This year, we have 
reviewed the findings of the scenario analysis, finding 
no significant changes to the modelled impact of 
climate risks and opportunities since last year. 

While scenario analysis is hypothetical and does 
not provide a certain forecast, it helps to identify 
how our most material climate-related risks and 
opportunities will likely impact us and our operations 
in the future. This subsequently informs our risk 
management strategies, as well as the metrics and 
targets we use to monitor such issues, enabling us to 
become more resilient to risks and seize opportunities 
in the long term. 

PHYSICAL SCENARIOS
For the physical scenarios, the Intergovernmental 
Panel on Climate Change’s (IPCC) Representative 
Concentration Pathway RCP 4.5 and RCP 8.5 scenarios 
were used. The impacts highlighted a change in annual 
rainfall levels at our sites and seasonal differences in 
temperature. Extreme weather events such as flooding, 
wildfires and drought will become more severe and 
frequent. See page 52 for more information on how we 
are managing these impacts.

For the transition scenarios, the International Energy 
Agency’s (IEA) World Energy Outlook Sustainable 
Development Scenario (SDS) and Stated Policies 
Scenario (STEPS) were used. The STEPS scenario 
provides a benchmark to assess the potential 
achievements of recent developments in energy and 
climate policy and the SDS scenario assumes full 
alignment with the Paris Agreement to hold the rise in 
global average temperature to well below 2°C.

A number of John Crane sites have been 
identified as vulnerable, so mitigation 
measures are being put in place such as: 
relocations; alert systems; guidance 
from insurance providers when sites 
come up for insurance policy renewal; 
and local, specific mitigation measures 
such as independent generators.

IMPACT ON THE BUSINESSES, STRATEGY AND 
FINANCIAL PLANNING
We submitted our Net Zero transition plan and GHG 
emissions reduction targets to the SBTi in May 2023. 
These outline our operational Net Zero GHG trajectory 
to meet a 1.5°C scenario by achieving Net Zero Scope 1 
& 2 emissions by 2040 and Net Zero Scope 3 emissions 
by 2050. This aligns with the Net Zero by 2050 targets 
set out by the UK and US governments (which are our 
largest areas of operation). We are preparing to comply 
with Transition Plan Taskforce (TPT) guidance next year. 
Our transition plan was developed with consideration of 
the updated TCFD guidance and lays out our 2028, 2032 
and long-term Net Zero milestones and emission 
reduction targets. See Net Zero/climate transition plan 
on page 40.

Divisional-level initiatives and actions to reduce Scope 1 
& 2 emissions are based on energy efficiency, green 
electricity (including implementation of solar 
technologies and fleet electrification), and alternative 
fuels. The majority of our Scope 3 emissions will be 
addressed by in-country grid decarbonisation and via 
targeting significant suppliers with education and 

training to set and meet their own SBT targets. 
The impacts of our transition plan on our customers, 
suppliers and other stakeholders, and on our 
business are integrated into the roadmap. In 
developing our transition plan, we have considered, 
and align with, the Net Zero economy commitments in 
the countries in which we operate, in particular where 
we are headquartered.

The opportunities identified within the climate 
scenario analysis form part of our strategic priority to 
commercialise high-value green technologies to 
increase green product revenues.

RISK MANAGEMENT
We adopt a Group-wide approach to risk management 
which is discussed in detail on pages 66 to 74. The 
Board has overall responsibility for ensuring that a 
robust risk management process is in place and 
delegates responsibility to the Audit & Risk Committee 
to ensure that it is adhered to. Climate risk 
management is considered in line with the existing 
risk management framework. This year, for the first 
time, climate risk was identified as a Group principal 
risk. See page 68 for more information on our Group 
principal risks.

Updates to climate regulation, including the emergence 
of new climate-related regulation is picked up in line 
with our Group-wide regulation monitoring processes.

In previous years, we have considered a wide range of 
risks and opportunities relating to climate change that 
were identified with the support of external technical 
specialists and then evaluated through a series of 
Group and divisional workshops. These include, for 
example, impacts relating to damage to assets from 
weather events, cost and availability of resources, 
regulation related to GHG emissions and increased 
demand for green technologies. The identification 
process includes assessment of the full value chain, 
such as impacts relating to key supply chain assets 
from extreme weather events.

At the Group, divisional and site levels, risks and 
mitigating controls are allocated to relevant owners. 
This year, each of our divisions conducted their annual 
review of climate-related risks in divisional risk 
registers to ensure accuracy of impact assessment and 
adequacy of mitigation actions. The results of these 
reviews are consolidated and managed in our risk 
register as per the enterprise risk management process. 

SMITHS GROUP PLC ANNUAL REPORT FY2023OVERVIEWSTRATEGIC REPORTGOVERNANCEFINANCIAL STATEMENTS56

TCFD

CONTINUED

Twice a year, a top-down review of our principal risks 
and opportunities, including climate risks, is conducted 
as part of the wider risk management process. In 
FY2023, we conducted an ESG double materiality 
assessment to understand the ESG topics of most 
importance to our business as outlined on page 33.

We continued our detailed procedures to assess and 
manage climate risks and opportunities via scenario 
analysis. This incorporates analysis of base case 
revenue streams, climate scenario analysis conducted 
over two physical and two transition climate scenarios 
against medium- and long-term time horizons. Risks 
and opportunities have been considered alongside 
established mitigation measures and strategic actions 
during validation workshops held at Group and 
divisional level to determine materiality of impacts 
over time.

The Executive Committee has responsibility for 
designing the enterprise risk management framework 
and ensuring that it is effectively deployed. The Audit & 
Risk Committee is responsible for overseeing the 
effectiveness of our management and implementation 
of internal controls, including those related to climate 
risks. Divisional and functional teams are responsible 
for day-to-day management and reporting of risks, 
including climate risk. They identify new and emerging 
risks, escalate where appropriate, and take action 
to ensure risks are managed appropriately. 
Prioritisation of risks is supported by matrices to 
improve, monitor (controls/ability to respond), monitor 
(risks) and accept/optimise.

METRICS AND TARGETS
We have identified relevant metrics and targets to 
monitor progress in achieving our sustainability goals, 
as well as manage and mitigate identified climate-
related risks and opportunities as detailed on page 
57. Metrics and targets are monitored by the SSE 
Committee and inform decision making to execute 
our strategic priorities.

Sustainability metrics form part of the Smiths annual 
and long-term incentive plans. These include metrics 
on GHG emissions reductions (Scope 1 & 2 emissions 
absolute reduction target) and energy efficiency.

We have committed to Net Zero Scope 1 & 2 emissions 
across our operations by 2040, with Net Zero Scope 3 
emissions reached by 2050 in line with the 1.5°C 
Business Ambition under the UN Race to Zero. As per 
our submission to the SBTi, we have committed to 
interim targets of 50% reduction in Scope 1 & 2 
emissions by 2032 and 50% of suppliers by spend with 
SBTs by 2028. As required by the SBTi, our proposed 
interim reduction target covers more than two-thirds 
of our total Scope 3 GHG inventory. 

Our Scope 1 & 2 emissions have decreased significantly 
this year as we progress conversion of our energy mix 
to renewable electricity, as well as undertake transition 
initiatives such as fleet electrification. Our Scope 3 
emissions have also decreased year-on-year. Further 
details of Scope 1, 2 and 3 emissions can be found on 
page 45 including progress during FY2023. More detail, 
including our methodology for calculation of emissions 
in line with the GHG Protocol, can be found in our 
FY2023 Sustainability at Smiths report.

We continue to monitor completion of annual business 
continuity plan reviews and have surpassed our 
three-year targets on waste and water reduction. We 
will assess whether water targets are renewed at the 
end of the three-year goal period, given the relatively 
low consumption required in our operations.

Information on how metrics and targets are linked 
to our remuneration policy can be found in the 
Remuneration & People Committee Report from page 
98. Progress towards achieving other sustainability 
targets is included in the Sustainability at Smiths 
section from page 32. Our Scope 1, 2 and 3 emissions 
for both FY2022 and FY2023 have undergone an 
external limited assurance process. We anticipate that 
further metrics and targets will be established during 
FY2024 as we move into our next three-year goal 
period. In the coming year we will review our disclosure 
of other cross-industry climate-related metrics.

place across the Group, operationally by 
our divisional teams and management, 
at a Group-level, and by the Board. 

In a business as diversified as Smiths, engagement 
with most stakeholder groups is handled locally by 
management, or by specialist Group teams. The Board 
maintains oversight and only engages directly if there 
are issues which truly warrant its involvement or 
where it can add value. This is particularly true of 
engagement with customers and suppliers (the 
majority of whom are unique to a specific division) but 
is also usually the case for governments, regulators 
and our local communities. 

The outcomes of stakeholder engagement, including 
concerns raised, are reported to the Board and Board 
Committees on a regular basis through our usual 
processes that support informed decision-making.  
The reporting was enhanced during the period to 
include greater focus on macro conditions and 
stakeholders. This was partly in response to feedback 
received as part of the FY2022 Board Evaluation 
process (see page 85). Discussion and decision-making 
by the Board takes the views of key stakeholders into 
account, in order to balance their needs, and effectively 
build the sustainable, long-term success of the Group. 
Throughout FY2023 we have matured our approach 
with a focus on critical business priorities that are 
regularly reported, underpinned by relevant data, in a 
global performance dashboard that allows tracking 
against the targets that have been set. Where needed, 
corrective actions were presented and discussed.

Our culture is a powerful 
asset and empowers and 
enables our people to 
deliver our purpose. It is 
supported by our Values 
and our Leadership 
Behaviours which 
influence every decision, 
guide how we behave, 
and help make Smiths a 
place where people are 
happy and proud to work.

including in-person site visits and attendance at colleague meetings, 
forums and events. Regular updates are provided to the Remuneration &

learnt about operational aspects of the business

 – Noel Tata attended the Indian Managing Directors' Council and met 

members of the India leadership team. He also toured Mumbai airport 
to see Smiths Detection machinery in operation

George shared his perspective on excellence, his experience in other 
companies, and what SES means for Smiths. Pam offered her 
experience and expertise in the area of change management

included divisional teams and those in corporate functions, allowing for 
informal introductions to Board members

Executive Committee successors. Following this process Sir George 
Buckley met c.30 extended leadership team members across Smiths

leaders an Executive Committee formal mentor to foster the ‘developing 
self and others’ Smiths Leadership Behaviour

visibility in order to amplify role modelling across the Group and

updates and deep-dives from the Chief People Officer on employee 
engagement, reward, talent, and diversity and inclusion. It also monitors

Karin Hoeing to lead in FY2024. Initiatives such as these are important as 
we continue to foster a more diverse and inclusive environment

 – Mentees of the mentoring scheme have taken on expanded roles and 
responsibilities, resulting in cross-functional and cross-divisional 
internal career changes. All of the mentees of the Executive Committee 
have now become mentors for the next leadership tier. This is cascading 
the mentoring culture at Smiths

 – Engagement measured by our annual My Say engagement survey, which 
had a very high response rate of 84% of our employees, improved by one 
point since last year and is now just one point below the industry 
benchmark. It was encouraging to see that four out of our five businesses 
(including the corporate centre) tracked improvement in engagement, 
while one remained flat year-on-year. My Say results can be found on 
page 14

CUSTOMERS

OUR APPROACH
Meeting customer needs 
and exceeding their 
expectations with 
products, quality and 
service, and the way we 
conduct business and pay

Customer Relationship Management tools across our business to 
deliver timely and high-quality responses to our customers. We aim to

continuous improvement in execution to enhance the overall customer 
experience

OUTCOMES OF ENGAGEMENT IN FY2023
 – The Board heard the challenges of key customers in the security and 
energy sectors. This led to a deeper understanding of the solutions 
required by our customers and highlighted the importance of our 
continued focus on commercialising high-value green technologies to 
align with our customers' decarbonisation journeys

initiated SES projects with suppliers to help them reduce lead times and 
improve forecasting on key component shipments. These activities all 
help maintain quality customer relationships

appropriately focused on customer needs and that customer risks are 
being managed appropriately. However, the Board agreed it would

HUMAN RIGHTS AND ANTI-BRIBERY 
AND ANTI-CORRUPTION
We consider violations of human rights to be appalling 
crimes. Conduct that exploits workers or denies them 
the rights and benefits to which they are legally entitled 
is wholly inconsistent with our Values and policies 
and is not tolerated. We recognise the important 
responsibility we have, and we support the vision of a 
world where everyone can access decent work and 
enjoy their universal human rights. We have not 
identified any serious human rights issues in our 
operations or in those of our suppliers in FY2023.

Our Human Rights Policy is guided by the international 
human rights principles encompassed in the Universal 
Declaration of Human Rights, the International 
Labour Organization’s Declaration on Fundamental 
Principles and Rights at Work, and the United Nations 
Guiding Principles on Business and Human Rights. 
We adhere to national laws and regulations in each 
market in which we operate and, should we encounter 
conflict between internationally recognised human 
rights and national laws, we will seek ways to honour 
the principles of international human rights. All persons 
working for, or on behalf of, Smiths are required to 
adhere to our Policy and approach.

Bribery and corruption matters are covered by our 
Code of Business Ethics. We also have specific policies 
and procedures relating to activities that create bribery 
and corruption risks, and an umbrella Anti-bribery 
and corruption policy that provides a single view of 
our approach. These policies cover a broad range of 
matters including the giving and receiving of gifts, 
meals and hospitality; invitations to government 
officials; our approach to facilitation payments; and 
controls around the appointment of distributors and 
agents, customs brokers and freight forwarders. Our 
ethics dashboard enables us to interrogate our register 
of gifts, meals and entertainment in an effective and 
useful way. We also have a specific China Anti-bribery 
and corruption policy.

We are committed to upholding high ethical standards 
wherever we operate around the world, and we require 
our suppliers and other business partners to do the 
same. The policies that support our approach are:

 – Code of Business Ethics
 – Anti-bribery and anti-corruption policy 
 – The Smiths Modern Slavery and Human Trafficking 
Statement (found on our website www.smiths.com)

 – Human Rights Policy (found on our website  

www.smiths.com)

You can read more about the Group's whistleblowing 
hotline Speak Out in the Audit & Risk Committee Report 
on page 97

POLICY DUE DILIGENCE AND 
OUTCOMES
Smiths operates a confidential Speak Out reporting 
hotline to report behaviour and activities that breach 
our Values, our policies, or the law. This is critical to 
assessing the effectiveness of our policies. All reports 
to the Speak Out hotline are investigated, and metrics 
associated with reporting monitored. Reports can be 
made anonymously. Our ethics training operates in 
two tiers – online modules delivered in all our core 
languages, and group training activities covering 
specific subjects. Additionally, we run regional ethics 
workshops for leaders across Smiths to embed a 
deeper understanding of our ethics and compliance 
critical drivers. 

During FY2023 we continued to review the effectiveness 
of our policies, including:

 – Revising and relaunching our Code of Business Ethics
 – Reviewing our ethics dashboard which enables 
us to view key information, track progress and 
analyse data

 – Ethics Pulse surveys to check organisational 
engagement on ethical matters and Speak Out
 – Undertaking targeted risk assessments to ensure 
that our Human Rights Policy was being followed

 – Continuing to monitor and review procurement-
related modern slavery and human rights risks 
and controls

RISK MANAGEMENT

RISK
MANAGEMENT

We operate across a number of markets 
and geographies. We are prepared to 
accept certain levels of risk to realise our 
ambitions, and our purpose to improve our 
world through smarter engineering.

We understand the risks we face and take 
a proactive approach to risk management 
in order to maximise opportunities, drive 
better commercial decision-making, and 
protect our people and our businesses.

RISK GOVERNANCE
The Board and its Committees set the culture and 
approve the strategy of the Group. The Board ensures 
appropriate oversight and monitoring through a 
number of mechanisms, including strategy reviews, 
Committee meetings, management reports and 
focused reviews of selected risk areas.

On behalf of the Board, the Audit & Risk Committee 
is responsible for reviewing and assessing the 
effectiveness of the Group’s risk management and 
internal control systems. The review process covers 
the Group’s principal risks, as well as financial, 
operational and compliance controls. 

The Executive Committee is responsible for designing 
the Enterprise Risk Management (ERM) framework 
and ensuring that it is effectively deployed throughout 
the Group. The Executive Committee also ensures 
that risk owners and decision makers understand the 
Board’s risk appetite, and ensures that risks, including 
climate risk, are adequately managed, and conducts 
an annual assessment of strategic risk. Each principal 
risk is owned by a member or members of the 
Executive Committee.

RISK MANAGEMENT

CONTINUED

Running a business involves the continual assessment 
and management of risks – it is an integral part of 
day-to-day operations. Our ERM process supports 
open communication on risk between the Board and 
Audit & Risk Committee, the Executive Committee, our 
divisions, functions and sites. It enables us to manage 
and monitor the risks which could threaten successful 
execution of our strategy and ensures our strategic, 
financial, compliance and operational risks are 
appropriately considered by the Executive Committee 
and by the Board.

Our divisional and functional teams are responsible for 
the day-to-day management and reporting of risks, 
including climate risk. They identify new and emerging 
risks, escalate where appropriate, and take action to 
ensure risks are managed as required. Our divisions 
also conduct annual assessments of the risks they 
face. In FY2023 these were updated to ensure that the 
latest views were presented and considered.

Internal audit provides independent and objective 
assurance to both the Audit & Risk and Executive 
Committees on the adequacy and effectiveness of our 
risk management and internal control processes. It 
facilitates the ERM process and provides site-based 
controls and assurance reviews of key programmes, 
processes and systems.

The Audit & Risk Committee, on behalf of the Board, 
reviews the effectiveness of the risk management 
process, considering principal risks and uncertainties 
and actions taken by management to manage 
those risks. 

During FY2023 the Executive Committee agreed the 
ERM timetable and the risks selected for deep-dive 
discussions at Executive and Audit & Risk Committee 
meetings. These were: supply chain; cyber; and 
Flex-Tek commercial risks. The Group’s list of principal 
risks was also discussed and recalibrated by the 
Executive Committee. 

The following items relating to our principal risks 
were also discussed at Board, Finance Committee, 
and SSE Committee meetings during FY2023: organic 
growth and financial performance; tax, treasury, 
liquidity, pensions and insurance; technology; health 
and safety; acquisitions; litigation; our people strategy; 
and ESG matters.

There is a requirement for risk owners to demonstrate 
how they provide assurance that controls are working 
effectively. Examples are provided in the tables of 
principal risks from page 69.

In addition, a further 31 risk workshops were facilitated 
at operational sites during the year to support the 
bottom-up view of risk that has fed into divisional and 
functional risk assessments.

The Directors consider the risk management process 
to be effective.

EMERGING RISKS 
Emerging risks and horizon scanning are integrated 
into the ERM process. Functions in the business often 
take the lead in identifying and promoting risk 
awareness and mitigation activities.

Climate change has moved from an emerging risk to 
a Group principal risk. During FY2022 we undertook 
a scenario analysis, including climate risk and 
opportunities workshops for Group and the divisions. 
Outcomes from this work are described in the Task 
Force on Climate-related Financial Disclosures (TCFD) 
section on page 47.

PRINCIPAL RISKS AND UNCERTAINTIES

PRINCIPAL RISKS  
AND UNCERTAINTIES

We maintain a register of principal risks and uncertainties 
covering the strategic, financial, operational and compliance 
risks faced by the Group.

RISK PROCESS
We review each risk and rate a number of factors: 
gross impact, applying the hypothetical assumption 
there are no mitigating controls in place; residual 
impact and likelihood, taking into account existing 
mitigating controls; the reputational impact of a risk; 
and velocity, which reflects the expected time we would 
have to react should a risk materialise. These, in turn, 
drive mitigation priorities. A trend metric shows the net 
position of the risk year-on-year. We report on the 
connectivity between risks to help understand the 
potential for one risk to have an impact on another. 
This is presented against each risk in the form of a ‘risk 
relationship’ chart indicating the linkage between each 
principal risk and others on the list. This has been used 
as an input to the Viability Statement assessment and 
will be used more widely in future risk scenario 
planning and mitigation work.

CHANGES TO PRINCIPAL RISKS
Our principal risks continue to evolve in response 
to our changing risk environment. This year, based on 
our current assessment of their materiality, we have 
replaced our environment, social and governance (ESG) 
risk with a broader climate-related risk, capturing both 
the opportunity and risk of energy transition and 
climate-related regulatory risks. We have also 
increased the likelihood and residual impact of our 
cyber risk. 

While we continue to monitor and manage a wide range 
of risks, the tables that follow summarise those risks 
considered to have the greatest potential impact if they 
were to materialise.

8.  PRODUCT QUALITY – Failure of product causes serious harm to people/property 

Failure of one of our products, including failure due 
to non-compliance with product regulation, may 
result in financial loss and reputational damage. In 
the ordinary course of business, we could be subject 
to material product liability claims and lawsuits, 
including potential class actions from customers or 
third parties. 

HOW THIS COULD IMPACT OUR STRATEGY OR 
BUSINESS MODEL
 – If we were to suffer reputational damage, it could 

lead to a loss of customers/future business
 – If our products were to cause material harm to 
people or property and/or business interruption 
for customers due to quality issues, design 
defects, manufacturing failures or component 
failures, we could suffer reputational damage, 
loss of business and higher costs beyond 
anticipated warranty claims. These may include 
contractual claims for penalties, indemnities and 

damages, and also product liability claims arising 
from end-users and other affected third parties 
(potentially large classes)

EXAMPLES OF HOW WE MANAGE THIS RISK
 – Divisional quality risk assessments that address 
product failures, product performance, product 
safety, product compliance, regulatory 
compliance, and market authorisation

related risks such as aviation grounding. 
Insurance and legal teams collaborate to ensure 
that contracts (and supplier flow-downs) cover 
insurance issues, and that claims are notified
 – Contracting and litigation managed under the 
oversight of the Group General Counsel with 
regular reporting to the Executive Committee and 
Board

EXAMPLES OF HOW WE KNOW THE CONTROLS 
ARE WORKING EFFECTIVELY
 – Regular quality reporting (e.g., defective parts per 
million (DPPM) and cost of poor quality (COPQ)) 
and actions to drive improvement in key metrics 

 – Group and divisional governance frameworks 

(including Delegation of Authority) ensure a close 
working relationship between legal and 
commercial teams (including quality) to manage 
risks

9.  CYBER SECURITY – Impact of enterprise or product cyber event

Cyber attacks attempting to compromise the 
confidentiality, integrity and availability of IT systems 
and the data held on them are a continuing risk. We 
operate in markets and product areas which are 
known to be of interest to cyber criminals. 
Digitalisation and increased interconnectivity of our 
products intensifies the risk.

HOW THIS COULD IMPACT OUR STRATEGY OR 
BUSINESS MODEL
 – If a cyber attack compromised confidentiality, 
integrity or availability of our assets, it could 
adversely affect our ability to deliver to customers 
and, ultimately, our financial performance and 
reputation

 – If we had a cyber security breach, we could be 
exposed to significant losses, particularly 
concerning our security products. These could 
include not only customer losses but also those of 
a potentially large class of third parties

EXAMPLES OF HOW WE MANAGE THIS RISK
 – Board oversight of the defence in depth approach 

to mitigating cyber risk

 – Proactive focus on information and cyber security 

risks supported by a robust governance

10.  LEGAL AND COMPLIANCE – Significant ethical breach or failing to meet contractual obligations

We have more than 15,000 colleagues in more than 
50 countries. Individuals may not all behave in 
accordance with the Group’s Values and in 
accordance with ethical and legal requirements. We 
operate within increasingly complex legal regimes, 
often in highly regulated markets and with 
governments, customers and suppliers requiring 
strict adherence to laws. We may fail to deliver 
contracted products and services or fail in our 
contractual execution due to delays or breaches by 
our suppliers or other counterparties. 

HOW THIS COULD IMPACT OUR STRATEGY OR 
BUSINESS MODEL
 – An ethics or compliance breach could cause harm 

to our reputation, financial performance, 
customer relationships and our ability to attract 
and retain talent

 – Failure to comply with trade compliance 

requirements (import and export) could lead to 
significant fines and/or delays to procurement or 
supplies 

 – Failure to meet strict conditions within 

government contracts, particularly in the US, 
could prevent us from bidding for contracts or 
have other serious financial and reputational 
consequences

 – Breach of contract resulting in significant 

expenses due to disputes and claims, loss of 
customers, damage to our reputation with other 
customers/prospective customers, and loss of 
revenue and profit due to higher costs, liquidated 
damages or other penalties

 – Contracts, particularly those with governments, 
may include terms that provide for unlimited 
liabilities, including for loss of profits, IP 
indemnities, perpetual warranties or allowing the 
counterparty to cancel, modify or terminate 
unilaterally and seek alternative sources of supply 
at our expense

EXAMPLES OF HOW WE MANAGE THIS RISK
 – Our ethics and compliance team run a proactive 
programmatic approach, areas of which are at 
different stages of maturity including: 
 – Managing an independent Speak Out reporting 

line and investigations process with 
communications encouraging the reporting of 
ethics violations (includes ability to report 
anonymously and a non-retaliation policy)
 – Anti-bribery and anti-corruption training is 
mandated for all employees online; and 
in-person training with a process for monitoring 
and reporting compliance

 – Policies and processes to mitigate risks are in 
place, including policies and procedures to 
mitigate distributor and agent-related risks, 
including due diligence, contractual controls 
and internal approvals

 – Anti-trust training programmes
 – Modern Slavery and Transparency Statement 
and procedures to reduce the risk of modern 
slavery within the Group and our supply chain

 – Network of trade compliance officers across the 

Group who monitor upcoming changes in 
regulation and oversee import and export 
activities

metrics (Executive Committee and Audit & Risk 
Committee oversight)

 – Divisional legal teams embedded in the business, 

working cross-functionally throughout the 
contract lifecycle, contract risk tool rolled out in 
three divisions and used to assess mitigation of 
risk through contract negotiations

GOING CONCERN AND  
VIABILITY STATEMENT

The Group’s business activities, together with the 
factors likely to affect its future development, 
performance and position are set out in the Strategic 
Report on pages 8 to 77. The financial position of the 
Company, its cash-flows, liquidity position and 
borrowing facilities are described on pages 21 to 23. In 
addition, the notes to the financial statements include 
the Company’s objectives, policies and processes for 
managing its capital; its financial risk management 
objectives; details of its financial instruments and 
hedging activities; and its exposures to credit risk and 
liquidity risk.

The Group has undertaken a detailed going concern 
review with a severe but plausible downside scenario 
taking into account everything that has been learnt 
since March 2020.

At 31 July 2023 the net debt of the Group was £387m, a 
£237m increase from 31 July 2022. At the end of July, 
the Group had available cash and short-term deposits 
of £285m. These liquid resources are immediately 
available with 96% invested with the Group’s global 
banking partners. The Group’s debt profile shows an 
average maturity of 3.6 years (from 2.5 years at 31 July 
2022). There are no scheduled repayments of debt due 
until February 2027.

The Group maintains a core US$800m committed 
Revolving Credit Facility (RCF) from these banks which 
was renewed in May 2023 and matures in May 2028. 

The RCF remained undrawn at 31 July 2023 and has no 
financial covenants attached.

The Directors, having made appropriate enquiries, have 
a reasonable expectation that the Company and the 
Group have adequate resources to continue in 
operation for a period of at least 12 months from the 
date of this Report. Thus, they continue to adopt the 
going concern basis of accounting in preparing the 
financial statements of the Company and the Group.

In accordance with the requirements of the 2018 UK 
Corporate Governance Code, the Directors have 
assessed the longer-term prospects of the Group, 
taking into account its current position and a range of 
internal and external factors, including the principal 
risks detailed on pages 68 to 74 (the ‘viability 
assessment’).

The Directors have determined that a three-year period 
to 31 July 2026 is an appropriate timeframe for the 
viability assessment. The selected period is considered 
to be appropriate as, based on the historical 
performance of the Group, a three-year outlook 
represents an optimum balance of long-term 
projection and acceptable forecasting accuracy. The 
three-year viability assessment timeframe also takes 
into account considerations such as the maturity of the 
Group’s borrowing facilities and the cyclicality of the 
performance of the Group’s underlying markets. In 
making this viability assessment, the Directors have 
considered the current financial position and prospects 

of the Group, including the current year business 
performance, the detailed operating plan for 2024 and 
forecasts for 2025 and 2026. Against these financial 
projections, the Directors took into account the 
principal risks (as outlined on pages 68 to 74) to develop 
a set of plausible scenarios (as set out overleaf) with 
potentially high-impact outcomes.

In addition to the scenario-specific assumptions 
(detailed overleaf) the principal assumptions for this 
three-year viability assessment are as follows:

 – FX rates for £ at US$1.22 and €1.18 and are 

modelled to remain at this level in the forecast 
period;

 – Interest payments have been updated to reflect 
latest forecast interest rate increases with no 
further refinancing with overdrafts and the Group’s 
RCF drawn to maintain our minimum cash 
requirements; 

 – Dividend payments are made in line with a 7% 
increase in dividend per share. Even under the 
downside scenarios it has been assumed that 
dividend increases are maintained, representing a 
potential mitigating action that could be taken; 
 – The share buyback of £742m is completed in Q1 of 

FY2024 in all scenarios; and

 – The RCF was renewed in May FY2023 and will be 
accessible throughout the period as there are no 
financial covenants attached.

GOING CONCERN AND VIABILITY STATEMENT

CONTINUED

Consideration was then given to the magnitude of the 
gross risks and their potential impact, directly or 
indirectly, on the Group’s future performance and 
liquidity. The assessment included stress testing of the 
Group’s financial capacity to absorb the impact of such 
adverse events, either individually or in combination, 
and what mitigating actions the Group could take to 
respond to them in order to protect its business.

The Directors also considered the Group’s ability to 
raise additional liquidity. In performing this 
assessment, the Directors have taken comfort from the 
diversity of the Group’s businesses across different 
markets, industries, geographies, products and 

customers. In order to ensure consistency, the base 
case used for the three-year viability assessment has 
also been reconciled against divisional impairment 
review models.

The Group holds a tradeable commodity through its 
investment in 10% of the equity in ICU Medical, Inc. The 
base case assumes that the Group could contemplate a 
possible reduction in this investment, the cash inflows 
from which would remove any need to utilise the RCF 
over the period. The downside scenarios do not include 
any cash inflows from the sale of this investment.

The downside results below show the impact on 
EBITDA, net debt and headroom under each scenario. 
The headroom includes the currently unutilised RCF of 
US$800m (£656m). This renewal removed the only 
interest covenant to which the Group was subject. 

Based on the robust assessment, the Directors confirm 
that given the current strong cash position, under all 
scenarios they have a reasonable expectation the Group 
will remain viable for the period being assessed and 
will continue to operate and meet its liabilities as they 
fall due. The Directors have no reason to doubt that the 
Group will continue in business beyond the period 
under assessment.

SCENARIO 3
Following a product cyber attack, a terrorism-related 
incident occurs at a US airport. As a consequence, the 
US Government revokes Smiths Detection’s licence. 
Sales of Detection’s products to the US military and all

CHAIRMAN’S INTRODUCTION

CHAIRMAN’S
INTRODUCTION

CHAIRMAN’S GOVERNANCE 
STATEMENT
I am pleased to introduce our Corporate 
Governance Report, in which we 
describe our governance arrangements, 
the operation of the Board and its 
Committees, and how the Board 
discharged its responsibilities during 
the year.

Board succession planning continued to be a key focus 
this year with my retirement as Chairman of the Board 
at the conclusion of this year’s Annual General Meeting 
(AGM). I would like to thank everyone for their 
significant contribution and commitment to Smiths 
since I joined the Board in 2013. I joined the Board with 
a resolve to help grow Smiths which was spurred not 
only by an enduring affection for a great company, but 
also from the desire to give something back to Britain 
after a long career. From reflecting over my time as 
Chairman, I am proud to see we have reached many 
significant milestones, and have continued to focus on 
greater innovation, sustainability, people and financial 
agility to help better support the Smiths Value Engine 
that connects our purpose, our strengths and our 
priorities of Growth, Execution and People. 

Further changes to the Board this year included the 
appointment of Steve Williams as my successor as 
Chair of the Board, subject to his election as Director at 
this years’ AGM. Steve has over 40 years of global 
business experience and brings with him a clear focus 
on environment, social and governance (ESG) matters. 
Richard Howes also joined us in September 2022 and 
will take over as Chair of the Audit & Risk Committee 
later in the year. I would like to welcome Steve and I 
wish him, the Company, and our people every future 
success after my retirement. The Board will continue to 
comprise of six males and four females, two Directors 
from historically under-represented ethnic groups and 
seven with a birthplace or background outside the UK. 
For a Group such as Smiths, with a diverse workforce 
and a wide geographic spread, that diversity is crucial, 
but it is equally important that the Directors are 
capable and suitably experienced individuals. The 
biographies of our Directors can be found on pages 80 
and 81. 

We continue to monitor the ongoing regulatory reforms 
in relation to audit and governance, and welcome the 
FCA’s proposed changes to transform and streamline 
the Listing Rules. The Listing Rules changes represent 
a continuation of the efforts to reduce barriers to listed 
companies in the UK, helping businesses to remain 
competitive in today’s market. Smiths continues to 
prioritise governance at the core of its business. I would 
like to acknowledge the work undertaken by Smiths to 
maintain an effective governance framework, including 
oversight by the Audit & Risk Committee on the internal 
controls enhancement programme.

It is evident that the expectations on governance have 
increased in recent years and ensuring a strong 
governance framework that supports the Group’s 
long-term strategic goals is critical if we are to support 
the business and enhance the interests of all our 
stakeholders for the future. The Board continually 
keeps its governance arrangements under review and I 
would like to thank the Committee Chairs for ensuring 
governance has been constructive and effective.

Finally, I would like to thank the Smiths workforce and 
my fellow Directors for their work on shareholders’ 
behalf this year. It has been a privilege to serve as 
Chairman, and I look forward to watching this special 
company continue to flourish in the future.

I hope you find the following report interesting, 
and, along with my fellow Committee Chairs, I would 
be happy to discuss any of the content at our 
upcoming AGM.

DIVISION OF RESPONSIBILITIES

HOW THE BOARD
OPERATES

The following role specifications set 
out the clear division of responsibility 
between executive and non-executive 
Directors, which supports the integrity 
of the Board’s operations.

There is a schedule of matters which are considered 
significant to Smiths and have therefore been reserved 
for decisions by the Board. This is due to their strategic, 
financial, or reputational implications or consequences. 
The formal schedule, which is integrated into our 
governance framework, can be found on our website. 

The Chief Executive Officer is responsible for preparing 
and recommending the strategy and for the day-to-day 
management of the Company. Executive management 
implement the Group’s strategy and provide the Chief 
Executive Officer, and the Board as a whole, with the 
information they need to make decisions that will 
determine the long-term success of the Group. 

At each scheduled Board meeting the Chief Executive 
Officer and the Chief Financial Officer present separate 
reports, detailing business performance and progress 
against strategy. These are supplemented by regular 
performance updates from the Chief Executive Officer 
to the Directors between meetings. When appropriate, 
invitations to Board meetings are extended to Divisional 
Presidents, heads of functions and subject matter 
experts, supporting visibility of talent and executive 
succession planning. External advisers are invited to 
attend as necessary. Director attendance at Board and 
Committee meetings in FY2023 is set out on page 84. 

To ensure the continued effectiveness of the Board, the 
Chairman meets the Non-executive Directors without 
the Executive Directors present after each Board

DIVISION OF RESPONSIBILITIES

CONTINUED

TIME COMMITMENT
All Directors must allocate sufficient time to their work 
in order to discharge their responsibilities effectively. 
An expected time commitment of 25 days per annum is 
set out in the Non-executive Director letter of 
appointment. However, Committee Chairs, the Senior 
Independent Director and the Chairman commit more 
time as required. In the normal course of business, 
Directors are expected to familiarise themselves with 
business priorities and challenges, prepare for and 
attend Board and Committee meetings, attend the 
AGM, engage with stakeholders and participate in the 
Board evaluation process. Executive Directors are not 
permitted to take on the chairmanship or more than 
one non-executive directorship in a FTSE 100 company, 
or any other significant appointment. Any appointment 
to other directorships is reviewed in advance by the 
Board for conflicts and time commitment 
considerations. 

DIRECTOR ATTENDANCE

In FY2023 the Board concluded that the Chairman and 
the Non-executive Directors devoted sufficient time to 
fulfil their commitments to Smiths. This included 
considering the Directors' positions held at other 
organisations. Particular consideration was given to 
Noel Tata’s other commitments as he holds a number 
of Board-level positions outside the Group all of which 
are at Tata Group companies, as shown in his biography 
on page 81. The Board reaffirmed that Noel’s other 
commitments do not prevent him from committing 
sufficient time to his work as a Director, as evidenced by 
his attendance and effective participation at all Board 
and Committee meetings and ad hoc Board update 
calls. As a current executive with contacts in higher-
growth countries which are a strategic focus for 
Smiths, he brings valuable and distinct experience to 
our Board discussions. 

ADVICE AND INSURANCE
Our Directors are able to seek independent 
professional advice at the expense of Smiths to enable 
them to fulfil their obligations as members of the 
Board. In addition, the Directors and Officers of Smiths 
and its subsidiaries have the benefit of a Directors’ and 
Officers’ liability insurance policy. During FY2023, and 
at the date of this report, qualifying third-party 
indemnity provisions (as defined by section 234 of the 
Act) have remained in force for the Directors of the 
Company and certain other employees in respect of 
their directorships of some subsidiary companies in 
relation to certain losses and liabilities which they may 
incur (or may have incurred) to third parties in the 
course of their professional duties for the Company, or 
a subsidiary.

EVALUATION, COMPOSITION AND SUCCESSION

BOARD
EVALUATION

Each year an evaluation of the Board and 
its Committees is conducted to monitor 
their effectiveness and to help identify any 
improvement opportunities. It is externally 
facilitated every three years. This year the 
evaluation was carried out internally.

The annual evaluation of the performance of the 
Non-executive Directors and the Chief Executive Officer 
is led by the Chairman. The Senior Independent 
Director and the Chief Executive Officer lead the 
evaluations for the Chairman and the Chief Financial 
Officer respectively.

The evaluation of the Non-executive Directors includes 
individual meetings with the Chairman. Feedback is 
given to the Chief Executive Officer by the Chairman 
after each Board meeting and on an ad hoc basis 
throughout the year. All Directors are invited to 
complete an effectiveness questionnaire, which for 
FY2023 included a comprehensive review of various 
aspects including strategy, risk and committee 
effectiveness amongst other topics. 

Independent Audit Ltd, who has supported the 
evaluation process since FY2019, but has no other 
connection to the Company, assisted with the 
interpretation of the results of the questionnaires 
issued to the Board.

The findings of the evaluation are used to inform future 
Board agenda planning and develop specific actions for 
improvement. The actions to be taken following the 
FY2023 evaluation have been grouped in four themes: 
strategic decision-making; succession planning; Board 
communication; and stakeholder engagement.  
A summary is set out below. Overall, the Board agreed 
that significant progress had been made since the 
internal evaluation last year. The Board seeks to 
continuously improve the effectiveness of the Board 
and its Committees and the actions identified in the 
FY2023 effectiveness review support this. It is the 
present intention that the FY2024 evaluation will be 
externally facilitated. The last externally facilitated 
Board evaluation was in FY2021.

NOMINATION & GOVERNANCE 
COMMITTEE REPORT

CHAIRMAN’S STATEMENT
I am pleased to present the Committee’s 
report for FY2023. The Committee has 
delegated responsibility from the Board to 
review the structure, size and composition 
of the Board and its Committees, in 
addition to assessing its effectiveness, 
performance, and independence. The 
Committee is dedicated to maintaining 
a diverse and inclusive range of 
appointments, with a wide variety of 
skills, expertise and experience. This 
ensures that the Board as a whole, and its 
Committees, can effectively navigate the 
complexities of our industry and contribute 
to the long-term success of our company.

COMMITTEE 
PERFORMANCE 
EVALUATION
In FY2023, the 
performance of the 
Committee was 
considered as part of the 
internal Board evaluation 
process. Overall, it was 
confirmed that the 
Committee continues to 
operate effectively.

COMMITTEE MEMBERSHIP AND 
MEETINGS
The members of the Committee, their biographies and 
attendance at meetings during the year can be found on 
pages 80, 81 and 84. 

The Chief Executive Officer is normally invited to attend 
Committee meetings. Other members of senior 
management are invited to attend as necessary.

GOVERNANCE
The Committee is responsible for keeping the Board’s 
governance framework under review. During the year 
enhancements to the framework were approved. The 
Committee also reviewed the Board skills and 
experience matrix and its own Terms of Reference.

Looking ahead, the Nomination & Governance 
Committee remains committed to assessing the 
effectiveness of the Board and taking necessary steps 
to ensure that the Company maintains an appropriate 
balance of skills, experience, knowledge and diversity. 
The Committee will also continue to monitor emerging 
governance trends, regulatory changes, and industry 
developments, allowing it to adapt and respond 
effectively in a way that is appropriate for Smiths 
strategic objectives and governance framework.

This is my final report as Chairman of the Committee, 
having joined the Board in August 2013. In last year’s 
report I highlighted that a key focus in 2023 would be 
Board succession. As such, following a comprehensive 
selection process, without my involvement and led by 
Bill Seeger as Senior Independent Director, Steve 
Williams will be appointed as Chair of the Board from 
November 2023. This is subject to his election at the 
2023 AGM. His role as Chair Designate commenced at 
the start of September 2023. Board succession will 
continue to be a focus during FY2024 as Bill Seeger 
retires from the Board in May 2024.

We were also pleased to welcome Richard Howes to 
the Board as a Non-executive Director in September 
2022. In the FY2022 Annual Report we disclosed the 
details of the rigorous search process that was 
undertaken when recommending his appointment. 

During the year we oversaw the development of senior 
management succession plans and the talent pipeline. 
We endorsed the appointments of Ted Wan and James 
Down to the Executive Committee. Ted leads our China 
business and the opportunities that presents. James is 
the General Counsel of the Group. Pleasingly, both were 
internal promotions.

More information about our activities can be found on 
the following pages.

I would like to thank both past and present members of 
the Committee for their hard work and contributions 
throughout my tenure.

Chairman of the Nomination &  
Governance Committee

NOMINATION & GOVERNANCE COMMITTEE REPORT

CONTINUED

SELECTION AND APPOINTMENT OF A NEW CHAIR

As part of the Committee's succession planning, 
Bill Seeger, as the Senior Independent Director, 
oversaw the search process and appointment of 
Steve Williams as successor to Sir George 
Buckley. The search process was facilitated by 
Russell Reynolds, an independent executive 
search consultant which has no connection to the 
Company, other than in assisting and facilitating in 
the search for senior management. Russell 
Reynolds was selected after a comprehensive 
review of search firms. Russell Reynolds is a 
signatory to the Enhanced Code of Conduct for 
Executive Search Firms. The Committee held 
several unscheduled meetings to focus on the 
appointment to ensure a comprehensive selection 
process.

IDENTIFY
Initially, the Committee developed a candidate 
profile and then a small working group comprising 
Karin Hoeing, Mark Seligman and Paul Keel was 
established to support Bill Seeger. The agreed 
profile included key attributes required for the 
role such as previous experience, cultural fit, 
management of complex stakeholder 
relationships, and driving growth. The details of 
the role profile and requirements of the role were 
shared with Russell Reynolds. Russell Reynolds 
then identified an extensive and diverse list of 
potential candidates who were appraised by the 
working group against the agreed brief. This 
created a longlist which was reviewed by the 
Committee to produce a shortlist which complied 
with the Board's Diversity Policy. 

INTERVIEW
The shortlisted candidates were interviewed 
by the working group, who together determined 
the preferred list of candidates for consideration 
by the Committee. As well as meeting the 
candidates, the working group discussed timings 

of the appointment and handover of the role.  
The preferred candidates then met with all 
Non-executive Directors, after which the Board 
met to discuss feedback.

SELECT
Prior to the final selection and appointment, the 
Senior Independent Director obtained references 
from key stakeholders. The Committee was 
unanimous in its selection and recommended to 
the Board that Steve Williams be appointed as 
Chair, given his breadth of experience and fit to 
the attributes in the agreed brief. 

CONSIDERATIONS
Steve Williams' external roles were considered 
prior to his appointment and the Board agreed 
that there was no conflict which might impact his 
role at Smiths. The Board also considered his 
other commitments from a time perspective. The 
Board considered that he would have sufficient 
time to fulfil his responsibilities to the Company.

APPOINT
Steve Williams' appointment as a Non-executive 
Director and Chair Designate took effect on 
1 September 2023. Subject to his election by 
shareholders, he will be appointed as Chair of the 
Board at the conclusion of the 2023 AGM when  
Sir George Buckley steps down.

INDUCTION
A comprehensive induction programme developed 
specifically for Steve Williams, taking into account 
his previous experience, knowledge, and skills is 
underway. This involves briefings on the role and 
responsibilities of being a UK listed Company 
Director, meeting with senior leaders in the 
business, corporate advisers, investors and other 
stakeholders, as well as visits to the Group's 
operations. 

INDUCTION
To ensure that they are able to effectively contribute to 
discussions and decision-making, all of our Directors 
participate in an induction programme on joining the 
Board. Each induction programme is tailored to provide 
the individual Director with the necessary knowledge 
and understanding of the Group, its markets and its 
material stakeholders based on their personal 
experience and background. 

On joining the Board, Richard Howes was given a 
tailored induction programme to develop the necessary 
knowledge and understanding of the Group and his 
role. It included visiting Group operations in the US and 
Europe and meeting with key senior leaders across the 
business. Information on Steve Williams' induction can 
be found in the adjacent box.

INFORMATION AND TRAINING
The Board recognises the importance of ongoing 
training and our Directors are given the opportunity to 
update their skills and experience on a regular basis. 
Any individual development needs are discussed with 
the Directors at the annual performance evaluation. In 
order for the Directors to remain aware of business 
priorities and external developments, the Board is 
provided with formal reports and updates from the 
divisions, functional leaders and external advisers on a 
regular basis. This year the Board was given an update 
from external speakers on the macroeconomic 
environment including the impact of high inflation, 
financial crises, geopolitical events and energy 
transition. 

In order to operate effectively our Directors must 
receive accurate, timely and high-quality information. 
The Company Secretary and his team assist the 
Chairman and Chief Executive Officer in ensuring 
effective information flows and that the Board is 
provided with all relevant information to enable the 
Directors to discharge their responsibilities.

DIVERSITY
The Board supports the principles of gender and ethnic diversity and pays close attention to the international 
nature of its makeup. Members of the Board and senior management will collectively possess diversity of gender, 
national birthplace, social and ethnic backgrounds, cognitive and personal strengths, along with a combination 
of skills, experience and knowledge. This is important for the effective operation of the Board and oversight of 
the Group. 

The Committee is responsible for recommending appointments to the Board following its regular assessment  
of the Board and its Committees’ composition, whilst also considering the Group’s strategic objectives. The 
Committee makes recommendations based on the merit of individual candidates, having due regard for the 
benefits of diversity in the broadest sense, including gender and ethnicity and also the need to ensure the effective 
functioning of the Board at all times, especially as membership of the Board is refreshed.

In order to help achieve these aspirations, the Committee only partners with firms accredited under the Enhanced 
Code of Conduct for Executive Search Firms. The use of Executive search firms helps to ensure non-UK nationals, 
women and candidates from historically under-represented ethnic groups are represented on the shortlist for all 
Board positions. 

As at 31 July 2023, the Board met all of its own diversity targets, as well as the targets set out in the Financial 
Conduct Authority’s Listing Rule 9.8.6R(9)(a). Steve Williams was appointed to the Board on 1 September 2023.  
As Sir George Buckley will step down from the Board at the conclusion of the AGM in November 2023, the Board is 
satisfied that its gender and ethnicity targets will not be impacted on a long-term basis. Numerical diversity data, 
in the format required by Listing Rule 9.8.6R(10), is outlined below as at 31 July 2023. The Board and executive 
management were asked to disclose which characteristic they identified with.

NOMINATION & GOVERNANCE COMMITTEE REPORT

CONTINUED

INDEPENDENCE AND OBJECTIVITY
The Board keeps the independence of the Non-
executive Directors under continuous review. In July 
2023, the Committee reviewed the guidance contained 
in the Code and assessed the performance and 
independence of each of the Non-executive Directors.

Bill Seeger was appointed as a Director in May 2014  
and as such he has served on the Board for more  
than nine years. A particularly rigorous review of Bill’s 
performance and independence was undertaken.  
The Board concluded that he contributed to 
constructive challenge and debate at meetings and  
that he continues to demonstrate the qualities of 
objectivity and independence. 

Having served on the Board for more than six years, 
Mark Seligman’s continued objectivity and 
independence was also subject to rigorous review. 

The Committee concluded that each of the Non-
executive Directors that were assessed contributed 
effectively to the operation of the Board and that they 
should all be considered as independent and objective.

CONFLICTS OF INTEREST 
All Directors must avoid situations where they have a 
direct or indirect interest that conflicts, or may possibly 
conflict, with the best interests of Smiths. The Board 
has the authority to authorise conflicts and potential 
conflicts in accordance with our Articles of Association 
and the Companies Act 2006 (Act), and Board approval 
must be granted before a Director accepts a new 
external appointment, whether it amounts to a conflict 
or not. The Company Secretary maintains a Register  
of Conflicts which is reviewed by the Directors at least 
twice a year, and the Board retains the power to vary  
or terminate any authorisation previously provided.

DIRECTOR ELECTION AND  
RE-ELECTION
Each year Smiths Directors are subject to election or 
re-election by shareholders at the AGM. The Chairman, 
on behalf of the Board, has confirmed that each 
Non-executive Director standing for re-election at this 
year’s AGM continues to be an effective member of the 
Board and has demonstrated the commitment 
required. The rules regarding the appointment and 
replacement of Directors are determined by our 
Articles of Association and the Act. The Articles of 
Association can be found on our website and can only 
be amended by a special resolution of shareholders.

Sir George Buckley reached the nine-year  
anniversary since his appointment on 1 August 2022. 
Notwithstanding his tenure, following the appointment 
of Paul Keel, the Committee agreed and the Board 
supported that Sir George Buckley should be invited at 
the 2022 AGM to seek re-election and to remain as 
Chairman to oversee a period of significant strategic 
change for the Group. Following the appointment of 
Steve Williams on 1 September 2023 and after a short 
handover period, Sir George Buckley will retire from the 
Company at the conclusion of the 2023 AGM and as 
such will not be standing for re-election.

On behalf of the Board, the Senior Independent Director 
has confirmed that he supports Steve Williams’ election 
to the Board at the 2023 AGM.

The Board determined that notwithstanding that  
Bill Seeger reached his nine-year anniversary since 
appointment on 12 May 2023, he should nonetheless be 
invited to seek re-election by shareholders at the 2023 
AGM. As the serving Senior Independent Director, his 
re-election will facilitate continuity and support the 
Chair transition process for a period of approximately 
six months. Bill Seeger will retire from the Board in 
May 2024.

AUDIT & RISK COMMITTEE
REPORT

GHG emissions inventories. The completion of 
International Standard on Assurance Engagement 
(ISAE) Limited Assurance on our FY2022 and FY2023 
emissions inventories and energy efficiency metric has 
been an important achievement.

In accordance with the International Standards for the 
Professional Practice of Internal Auditing, this year the 
Committee undertook an External Quality Assessment 
(EQA) of the Internal Audit function by an independent 
third party, PwC. We were pleased with the results of 
the EQA. Our Internal Audit function's performance 
against the Standards is strong, which is a testament to 
their focus on quality and continuous improvement.

Looking ahead to FY2024, the Committee will remain 
focused on the Group’s internal controls programme 
and we will continue to oversee the development of 
plans to meet the Government’s audit and governance 
reform proposals. As I hand over the Chairmanship to 
Richard Howes, I would like to thank my colleagues on 
the Committee for their contribution during the year. 
I look forward to continuing our work in FY2024.

MARK SELIGMAN 
Chairman of the Audit & Risk Committee

CHAIRMAN’S STATEMENT
I am pleased to present the Committee’s 
report for FY2023 which is my last one 
as Chairman of the Committee. The 
Committee continues to fulfil an important 
oversight role, monitoring the integrity of 
the Group’s financial reporting and the 
effectiveness of its system of internal 
control and risk management framework. 
Details of our work can be found on pages 
92 to 97. 

A key focus for the Committee this year has been 
the development and maturity of the Group’s control 
environments. At each meeting we were provided 
with updates from the Finance Excellence function, 
particularly in relation to our internal controls 
enhancement programme. We were pleased to hear 
positive feedback from EY, who are supporting us on 
the programme. The work we have undertaken this 
year puts us in a strong position for readiness for the 
FRC proposed changes to the UK Corporate 
Governance Code.

This year we challenged the business to embed the 
level of controls we have in our financial information, 
into our non-financial information, specifically in 
respect of GHG emissions and energy data. Additional 
assurance layers were therefore established for the 
Group’s GHG and energy efficiency metrics. The Smiths 
finance teams have implemented control procedures to 
provide a second line of defence in the review and 
validation of our site and divisional Scope 1 & 2 energy 
use data, with KPMG engaged to provide a third line of 
defence in the limited assurance of our Scope 1, 2, & 3

AUDIT, RISK AND INTERNAL CONTROL

COMMITTEE MEMBERSHIP  
AND MEETINGS
All members of the Committee are independent 
Non-executive Directors and collectively have recent 
and relevant financial, accounting and sector 
experience. Committee member biographies and 
attendance at meetings during the year can be found 
on pages 80, 81 and 84. The Board considers that 
Mark Seligman and Richard Howes have the recent 
and relevant financial experience required to chair 
the Committee. 

At the invitation of the Chairman of the Committee, 
and in order to maintain effective communications, 
the Board Chairman, Chief Executive Officer, Chief 
Financial Officer and an audit partner of KPMG 
attended all meetings. Other regular attendees 
included the Group Financial Controller, the Director 
of Internal Audit, Senior Vice President and General 
Counsel, Ethics and Compliance and Deputy Secretary. 
Divisional Presidents, the Vice President Finance 
Excellence and senior management were also invited 
to attend as appropriate. At the conclusion of each 
meeting, KPMG and the Director of Internal Audit 
were each given the opportunity to discuss matters 
with the Committee without executive management 
being present.

The heads of Internal Audit and Ethics and Compliance, 
together with KPMG, have direct access to the 
Committee should they wish to raise any concerns 
outside formal Committee meetings. 

The Committee works to a structured programme of 
activities and meetings to coincide with key events 
around our financial calendar and, on behalf of the 
Board, to provide oversight of the Group’s risk 
management and internal control process. The 
Chairman of the Committee reports formally to the 
Board on the Committee’s activities after each meeting.

COMMITTEE PERFORMANCE 
EVALUATION
Through the annual Board evaluation process, see 
pages 85 and 86, the Board has again confirmed the 
effectiveness of this Committee in its role of supporting 
the Board in compliance with its duties.

COMMITTEE ACTIVITIES
FINANCIAL AND NARRATIVE REPORTING
The Committee reviewed the full and half yearly results 
announcements, the Annual Report and the Viability 
and Going Concern Statement before recommending 
them to the Board for approval. 

The Group has internal control and risk management 
arrangements in place to support the financial 
reporting process which provide reasonable assurance 
that the financial statements are prepared in 
accordance with applicable standards. These 
arrangements included seeking divisional confirmation 
that the reported information gives a true and fair view 
of the results for the period and ensuring that record 
keeping allows an accurate and fair reflection of 
transactions. More information on risk management 
and internal controls can be found on page 96.

An important responsibility of the Committee is to 
review and agree the most significant management 
accounting estimates and judgements which impact the 
financial statements. The key areas of judgement in the 
year are set out overleaf. After receiving reports on the 
significant estimates and areas of judgement and after 
discussion with KPMG, the Committee agreed that the 
judgements made were appropriate and correctly 
reflected and presented in the Annual Report. 

Fair, balanced and understandable
The Committee applied the same due diligence 
approach adopted in previous years in order to assess 
whether the Annual Report is fair, balanced and 
understandable, one of the key Code requirements. 
This included being updated on the internal verification 
process carried out to support the Committee’s 
assessment of the disclosures made in the Annual 
Report. The Committee also reviewed various 
materials on risk management and internal controls, 
going concern and the assessment of the Group’s 
long-term viability. In doing so it considered the:

 – Accuracy, integrity and consistency of the messages 

conveyed in the Annual Report;

 – Appropriateness of the level of detail in the narrative 

reporting;

 – Correlation between judgements, estimation of 
uncertainties and issues, and the associated 
disclosures; and

 – Explanations of the differences between statutory 

and headline reported results.

Taking the above into account, together with the views 
expressed by KPMG, the Committee recommended, 
and in turn the Board confirmed, that the 2023 Annual 
Report, taken as a whole, is fair, balanced and 
understandable and provides the necessary 
information for shareholders to assess the Company’s 
position, performance, business model and strategy.

SIGNIFICANT FINANCIAL REPORTING MATTERS
The key areas of judgement for FY2023 are as follows:

AREAS OF FOCUS

ACTIONS TAKEN

IMPAIRMENT – INTANGIBLE ASSETS (INCLUDING GOODWILL) 

The Group holds a significant amount of 
goodwill, especially in relation to the Smiths 
Detection cash generating unit (CGU).

Smiths Detection was the Group’s only CGU where the impairment headroom was limited for FY2023 and where a plausible downside 
scenario or a reasonable change in key assumptions could cause the carrying value of the CGU to be close to its recoverable value. During 
FY2023, strong demand drove historical levels of growth in revenue and increased profits. In FY2023 Smiths Detection continued to navigate 
issues with the supply of key components. As orders and revenues have grown, it has been necessary for Smith Detection to build inventory 
to compensate for the supply chain variability. This has reduced cash conversion but increased the carrying value of the CGU. 

The Committee challenged the level of intangible assets and the assumptions used to justify their carrying values, including the applicable 
discount rate used for impairment testing purposes. It also reviewed and agreed additional disclosures in the sensitivity of the impairment 
model and movements in the key judgements. See note 11 of the financial statements.

REVENUE RECOGNITION

Smiths Detection and Smiths Interconnect have 
multi-year contractual arrangements for the 
sale of goods and services. Estimates are 
required at the balance sheet date when 
determining the stage of completion of 
contracts for revenue recognition.

TAXATION

The Committee reviewed management’s revenue recognition judgements. The timing of revenue recognition involves judgements as to when 
control of an asset passes to the customer or, particularly with Smiths Detection and Smiths Interconnect, as to the stage of completion of 
contract activity and whether the separate performance obligations have been fulfilled. The Committee reviewed and concurred with 
management’s conclusions on the timing of revenue recognition, significant judgements for complex programmes and contract accounting. 
See note 1 of the financial statements.

The Group has extensive international 
operations, and in the normal course of 
business the Directors make judgements and 
estimates in relation to potential tax exposures.

Management assesses the assets and liabilities recognised in income and deferred tax, as well as the treatment of losses in the UK. 
Particular focus was given to the recognition of UK deferred tax assets, deferred tax assets relating to the John Crane, Inc. asbestos 
provision, and the Titeflex Corporation CSST provision. The Committee was updated on the ongoing tax audits and the uncertainty associated 
with the outcome of tax audits that are likely to conclude in the next 12 to 24 months. The Committee noted that the final outcome may vary 
significantly from the amounts currently provided for tax risks. See note 6 of the financial statements.

VAT ERROR ON CHAIN EXPORT TRANSACTIONS

During FY2023 a historic VAT classification 
error was identified, which has resulted in 
certain European intercompany chain export 
transactions being treated as VAT exempt when 
they should have been initially classified as 
subject to VAT with subsequent refund at the 
time of export. 

In correcting this error the Group has 
recognised £2m of irrecoverable VAT and £7m 
of interest on the late payment of VAT.

The Committee was updated on the status of the investigation into this VAT classification error and the wider Group review of VAT 
classification. The Group-wide investigation identified similar classification issues in other European entities, against which provisions have 
been made.

The Committee challenged management on the treatment and agreed that the classification errors had been appropriately treated as 
non-headline. The errors uncovered relate to up to six years of past VAT practice and involve the payment and recovery of European VAT, 
spanning FY2023 and FY2024. This would have materially impacted the Group’s headline cash conversion metric during those years.

SMITHS GROUP PLC ANNUAL REPORT FY2023OVERVIEWSTRATEGIC REPORTGOVERNANCEFINANCIAL STATEMENTS94

AUDIT, RISK AND INTERNAL CONTROL

CONTINUED

AREAS OF FOCUS

ACTIONS TAKEN

PROVISIONS FOR LIABILITIES AND CHARGES

The Group holds significant material provisions 
for John Crane, Inc. asbestos litigation and the 
Titeflex Corporation CSST product claims.

The Committee considered the appropriateness of the level of the provisions held against John Crane, Inc. asbestos litigation and the Titeflex 
Corporation CSST claims. In particular, the Committee considered the treatment of potential liabilities, the changes to the assumptions 
made in calculating the provisions, sensitivities to changes in assumptions and advice received from the Group’s specialist external advisers. 

The Committee agreed the ten-year time period for John Crane, Inc. asbestos litigation remained appropriate. In the case of the John Crane, 
Inc. asbestos litigation, the Committee also agreed with the judgement. However,  whilst large numbers of claims are made against John 
Crane, Inc. and other defendants every year, due to both known and as yet unknown developments in the US legal system and other events 
that will impact the asbestos legal environment, a sufficiently reliable estimate cannot be made to cover the full period over which it is 
expected that costs will be incurred. In both these cases, it was determined that the assumptions fairly reflect the position. See note 23 of the 
financial statements.

POST-RETIREMENT BENEFITS

The Group has material pension plan assets 
and liabilities and there is a high degree of 
estimation uncertainty.

The Committee considered the impact of the extreme spike in gilt yields following the 23 September 2022 'mini-budget' on Smiths Industries 
Pension Scheme’s (SIPS) Liability Driven Investments (LDIs). The gilt yield spike resulted in a sudden increase in the collateral required to be 
posted to LDI funds. SIPS maintained sufficient collateral during the spike in gilt yields, and its hedging remained intact. However, the SIPS 
Trustee acted in accordance with advice and took steps to disinvest a proportion of assets from the corporate bond/credit fund to bolster the 
LDI collateral readily available.

The Committee reviewed and agreed the methods, assumptions and benchmarks used by the actuaries to calculate the position of the UK 
and US schemes at 31 July 2023. These continue to show a net accounting surplus position which was reduced by £114m in FY2023. 

The Committee agreed with the treatment and corresponding disclosures on these matters. See note 8 of the financial statements.

PRESENTATION OF HEADLINE PROFITS AND ORGANIC GROWTH

The Group presents headline profits and 
organic growth measures which require 
adjustment to IFRS required data. This is a 
material judgement and requires a consistent 
application of the Group’s accounting policy on 
this topic.

The Committee considered the policy, presentation and judgements in relation to the Group’s performance, in particular the separation of 
headline and non-headline items. This included the consideration of which items related to the Group’s ongoing trading activity or those 
which should be recorded as non-headline. 

The Committee recognised that, as announced in the FY2022 Annual Report, the Group’s restructuring project to better serve our 
customers, maximise growth opportunities and improve efficiency has been treated as non-headline due to the project being material and 
part of a pre-approved programme. The Committee also reviewed the appropriate level of disclosure for the restructuring charge 
recognised in FY2023.

In addition, the Committee also considered those judgements in connection with items to be reflected or adjusted in organic performance. 
See note 3 of the financial statements.

INVENTORY MANAGEMENT AND PROVISIONING

The Group’s inventory position has increased 
over the past reporting periods due in part to 
investment to mitigate post-COVID-19 supply 
chain inefficiencies. 

The increasing level of working capital held by 
the business increases the risk that the controls 
and processes may no longer be appropriate to 
adequately address inherent risks.

The Committee considered the results and conclusions from inventory management and provisioning review with each division. The reviews 
challenged the divisions' inventory management and provisioning policies, procedures and practices.

The Committee noted that Detection contributed significantly to the Group’s increased inventory and had the largest inventory balance in 
the Group. However, it recognised that 80% of Detection’s inventory was either a finished good directly related to a sales order or an 
aftermarket spare.

AUDIT, RISK AND INTERNAL CONTROL

CONTINUED

EXTERNAL AUDIT
The Committee places great importance on the quality, 
effectiveness and independence of the external audit 
process. Following a tender process KPMG was 
appointed as the Company’s external auditor at the  
2019 AGM. Michael Maloney, the KPMG audit partner 
responsible for the Company’s audit since 2019 retired 
following the completion of the FY2022 audit. Mike 
Barradell was appointed as the lead engagement 
partner for FY2023. His tenure will be limited to five 
years in line with audit standards and due to KPMG 
partner rotation policies. 

The Committee confirms that the Company has 
complied with the provisions of the Statutory Audit 
Services Order 2014 relating to the UK audit market for 
large companies throughout the year under review and 
as at the date of this report.

SCOPE OF THE EXTERNAL AUDIT PLAN  
AND FEE PROPOSAL
The Committee reviewed and approved KPMG’s 
proposed audit plan and fee for the FY2023 audit.  
The Committee continued to monitor KPMG’s execution 
of the audit plan during the year. 

INDEPENDENCE AND OBJECTIVITY
The Committee is responsible for the implementation 
and monitoring of the Group’s policies on external audit, 
which are designed to maintain the objectivity and 
safeguard the independence of the external auditor. 
These policies are reviewed annually. They cover the 
engagement of the external auditor for non-audit 
services and the appointment by the Group of former 
employees of the external auditor. 

In addition to monitoring compliance with Group 
policies, the Committee’s review of KPMG’s 
independence included examining written confirmation 
from KPMG that they remained independent and 
objective within the context of applicable professional 
standards and considering the performance of the audit 
engagement partner. 

NON-AUDIT SERVICES
Notwithstanding developing practice being adopted by 
audit firms not to provide non-audit services to audit 
clients, the Committee recognises that certain 
permissible non-audit services can be completed more 
efficiently by, and be purchased more cost-effectively 
from, the incumbent auditor due to the audit firm’s 
existing knowledge of the Group and its systems. Under 
the policy approved by the Committee, it has delegated 
its responsibility for authorising the purchase of 
non-audit services from the external auditor to the 
Chairman of the Committee and/or the Chief Financial 
Officer within specific limits.

Details of the fees paid to KPMG for the year ended 31 
July 2023 can be found in note 2 of the financial 
statements. Non-audit fees as a percentage of audit 
fees totalled 6% (FY2022: 10%). Non-audit fees in 
FY2023 principally comprised audit-related assurance 
services for the interim report and the limited 
assurance of the Group’s Scope 1-3 Greenhouse Gas 
emissions metrics. 

The Group would not expect in the ordinary course of 
business for non-audit fees to exceed 20% of the 
average of the previous three years’ total Group audit 
fees unless exceptional circumstances existed. The 
Committee confirms that the non-audit work 
performed by KPMG during the year, was properly 
assessed and authorised in accordance with the 
Group’s policy.

In early 2023, KPMG identified that KPMG network 
firms in Argentina, China, Egypt, Hong Kong and Qatar 
had provided financial statement preparation 
assistance services and/or foreign language translation 
services over the period 2020 to 2023 to Smiths entities 
in those regions. The services, which have since been 
terminated, were administrative in nature and did not 
involve any management decision-making or 
bookkeeping. None of the impacted entities are 
material or significant components of the Group audit. 
In addition, there was no self-review threat in relation to 
the work performed by KPMG’s group audit team, and 

no direct or indirect effect on Smiths Group plc 
consolidated financial statements. KPMG sent a letter 
to the Audit & Risk Committee explaining the cause, 
analysis of implications and actions taken. The Audit & 
Risk Committee reviewed the letter and following 
discussions, have concurred with KPMG’s professional 
judgement, that based on the assessment of the 
breach, KPMG’s integrity, objectivity, impartiality of 
judgement, and professional scepticism were not 
impaired with respect to the impacted periods. Apart 
from this matter, KPMG has not performed any 
non-audit services during the year ended 31 July 2023 
or subsequently which are prohibited by the FRC 
Ethical Standard. 

EFFECTIVENESS OF THE EXTERNAL AUDIT
The Committee continually assessed the effectiveness 
of the external auditor during the year, including its 
independence, objectivity, appropriate mindset and 
professional scepticism. The Committee considered: 

 – The conclusion of the FY2022 audit process;
 – The audit review of FY2023 interim results;
 – Early-stage delivery of the FY2023 audit;
 – The review of audit plans;
 – Content, insight and value of KPMG’s reports;
 – Robustness and perceptiveness of KPMG in 

handling of key accounting and audit judgements; 

 – Management’s responses to any audit findings;
 – Discussions with management (both with and 

without the external auditor present) and with the 
external auditor (both with and without 
management present); and 

 – The findings of the various FRC’s Audit Quality 

Inspection Reports with regard to KPMG and the 
implications and learnings for the Smiths audit.

The Committee ensured that it was satisfied that the 
Committee’s and management’s feedback from 
previous effectiveness reviews had been adequately 
addressed. It also considered other statutory reporting, 
audit planning and scope deliverables, and that KPMG 
had continued to devote sufficient time and resources 
to understand and assess the business, its key risks 
and controls.

SMITHS GROUP PLC ANNUAL REPORT FY2023OVERVIEWSTRATEGIC REPORTGOVERNANCEFINANCIAL STATEMENTS96

AUDIT, RISK AND INTERNAL CONTROL

CONTINUED

After taking into account the factors above and its 
general interaction with KPMG throughout the period, 
the Committee was satisfied that the audit was 
effective. The Committee therefore agreed that it was 
appropriate to recommend to the Board that the 
reappointment of KPMG as the Company’s auditor for 
a further year be proposed to shareholders at the 2023 
AGM. A further review of the FY2023 audit will be 
conducted ahead of the FY2024 interim results.

RISK MANAGEMENT AND INTERNAL 
CONTROL
The Board is responsible for ensuring that sound risk 
management and internal control systems are in place. 
The Executive Committee is responsible for designing 
the risk management and internal control systems and 
ensuring they are effectively deployed throughout the 
Group. The risk management and internal control 
processes identify, assess, manage and monitor risks 
that have the potential to affect the achievement of our 
strategy. The Executive Committee and risk owners 
review our principal risks throughout the year. They 
assess the effectiveness of existing controls and the 
resulting residual risks and identify any additional 
necessary actions. We have a sound risk management 
and internal control systems in place. However, they 
can provide only reasonable, not absolute, assurance 
against material loss to the Group or material 
misstatement in the financial statements. More detail 
can be found on pages 66 to 74.

EFFECTIVENESS OF THE GROUP’S RISK 
MANAGEMENT AND INTERNAL CONTROLS
In FY2023, the Committee, on behalf of the Board and 
with the assistance of the Internal Audit function, 
monitored, reviewed and assessed the effectiveness of 
the Group’s risk management and internal control 
systems in the context of the Group’s strategy, business 
model and risk appetite. 

The Committee receives risk deep-dive reports from 
the divisions and principal risk owners throughout the 
year. The divisional reports take place on a rotational 
basis to enable the Committee to cover all principal 
risks over time. The deep-dives are intended to inform 
the Committee’s assessment of the effectiveness of 
risk management and internal control systems. This 
year the divisions also provided reviews on business 
continuity, in particular supply chain, and other key 
risks as applicable to their business, for example, 
procurement, market trajectory and disruption, quality 
and ESG. It also received updates on cyber, and ethics 
and compliance risks. The deep-dives on cyber covered 
Smiths cyber security framework, employee 
communication and training programmes to increase 
cyber awareness, and planned investment to improve 
resilience. The Committee relies on other inputs to 
assess if the risk management and internal controls 
system is effective. For example, the following items 
relating to our principal risks were discussed at the 
Board, Finance Committee, and SSE Committee 
meetings during FY2023: organic growth and financial 
performance; tax, treasury, liquidity, pensions and 
insurance; technology; health and safety; acquisitions; 
litigation; our people strategy; and ESG.

Consideration of the divisional risk registers alongside 
the principal risk deep-dives and other thematic risk 
areas enables the Committee and full Board to 
understand the culture, risks and opportunities, and 
assurance processes throughout the business and the 
potential impact on the Group. No significant failings or 
weaknesses were identified. 

The Committee was also provided with updates in 
relation to the Finance Excellence Programme 
particularly in relation to projects to improve and 
standardise finance activity across the Group and 
ongoing activity to improve the financial control 
framework. The current year activity puts Smiths  
in a strong position for readiness for the FRC  
proposed changes regarding internal controls over 
financial reporting.

PRINCIPAL RISKS UPDATE
The Committee carried out a robust assessment of the 
principal risks facing the Group, including those that 
would threaten its business model, future performance, 
solvency and liquidity. We replaced our ESG principal 
risk with climate risk on our risk register. Climate risk 
covers the energy transition opportunity and risks as 
well as climate-related regulatory risks. Due to the 
increasing proliferation of cyber attacks, the Committee 
approved increasing the probability of Smiths cyber 
security risk from probable to likely and the residual 
impact from low to moderate. Other risks remain 
relatively stable. Economic and geopolitical risks remain 
elevated, although the risk of regional or global 
recession is subsiding. Actions we have taken to mitigate 
supply chain challenges remain evident in our inventory 
levels and the divisions are working to reduce inventory 
to appropriate levels while also supporting growth.

A description of the principal risks facing the Group and 
how these were reviewed to assess the Group’s viability 
can be found on pages 68, 75 and 76.

INTERNAL AUDIT
Internal Audit is independent of the business and so has 
no responsibility for operational business management. 
This ensures the integrity and objectivity of its annual 
Audit Plan, which is approved by the Committee. The 
authority of the Internal Audit function is derived from 
the Committee. The Director of Internal Audit is 
accountable to the Board through the Committee 
Chairman, although administratively the Director of 
Internal Audit reports to the Chief Financial Officer. 

In order to carry out the responsibilities, as set out in a 
charter approved by the Committee, the Internal Audit 
function has:

 – full and unrestricted access to all records, property 

and personnel;

 – independent access to the Committee Chairman 

and members of the Committee;

 – the right to request meetings with the Committee; 

and

 – the authority and obligation to report significant 
findings or other concerns to the Committee.

SMITHS GROUP PLC ANNUAL REPORT FY2023OVERVIEWSTRATEGIC REPORTGOVERNANCEFINANCIAL STATEMENTS97

AUDIT, RISK AND INTERNAL CONTROL

CONTINUED

During the period, the Committee received progress 
reports on the execution of the FY2023 Internal Audit 
Plan and discussed any high-priority control 
enhancement opportunities and action plans to address 
these. The Committee also approved the FY2024 
Internal Audit Plan, including the proposed audit scope, 
approach, coverage and budget including the allocation 
of resources.

The Committee oversees the performance of the 
Internal Audit function through the Director of Internal 
Audit’s attendance at Committee meetings, review of 
work presented throughout the course of the year, and 
a review of agreed KPIs which are reported to the 
Committee at each Committee meeting. This year, in 
accordance with the International Standards for the 
Professional Practice of Internal Auditing, the 
Committee undertook an EQA of the Internal Audit 
function by an independent third party. The results of 
the EQA conducted by PwC recognise that Internal 
Audit’s performance against standards is strong, with 
minor improvements suggested. This is a testament to 
the function's focus on quality and continuous 
improvement. The improvement opportunity identified 
related to redefining the function’s future, considering 
the increasing emphasis on internal controls and the 
changing risk environment. These will be addressed 
through the Internal Audit FY2024 Plan. 

ETHICS AND COMPLIANCE
During the year, the Committee reviewed the Ethics 
and Compliance annual work programme and provided 
oversight of investigations into allegations of non-
compliance with the Code of Business Ethics. This 
included matters raised through the Group’s ethics 
reporting procedures including the Group’s Speak Out 
hotline which allows for anonymous reporting. Smiths 
Speak Out hotline comprises a number of different 
channels (including call centres operated by an 
independent third party across the Group’s global 
operations) for employees and other stakeholders to 
report concerns.

During the year there were no matters raised that 
required the Committee’s direct intervention or 
investigations which resulted in a material loss to the 
Group or a detrimental impact on our customers or 
suppliers. The Committee receives regular reports 
on the total number and nature of cases by region, the 
ratio of anonymous vs attributed ethics reports, and the 
ratio of substantiated vs unsubstantiated cases. The 
anonymous vs attributed metric is used to monitor 
trust in the Group’s reporting system. Accordingly, the 
Committee considered that the Group’s processes and 
arrangements for employees to report concerns, 
including anonymously and without retaliation, about 
any improprieties and the arrangements for any 
subsequent investigation as necessary, were both 
appropriate and effective.

During the year, the Committee provided oversight of a 
number of areas targeted by the Ethics and Compliance 
work programme. More information on the Group’s 
approach to behaving ethically and legally can be found 
on page 39 and in the Sustainability at Smiths report 
found on our website.

ASSESSMENT OF INTERNAL  
CONTROL AND RISK MANAGEMENT 
ARRANGEMENTS
The Committee was satisfied that the Group’s 
processes governing financial reporting and controls, 
its culture, ethical standards and its relationships with 
stakeholders continued to be effective.

The Committee was also satisfied with the 
appropriateness and adequacy of the Group’s risk 
management arrangements, internal control 
framework and three lines of defence model.

REMUNERATION & PEOPLE COMMITTEE REPORT

REMUNERATION & PEOPLE 
COMMITTEE REPORT

BILL SEEGER 
Chairman of the 
Remuneration & People 
Committee

Our objectives are to create clear 
alignment between remuneration and 
sustainable, long-term stakeholder 
interests. We take account of shareholder 
views and ensure that performance 
supports the delivery of business strategy 
through targeting KPIs.

CHAIRMAN’S STATEMENT
I am pleased to present the Remuneration Report for 
the year to 31 July 2023. 

The Directors’ Remuneration Policy was approved 
at the AGM on 17 November 2021. The Directors’ 
Remuneration Report for FY2023 will be put to an 
advisory shareholder vote at the AGM on 16 November 
2023. I look forward to your continued support at the 
upcoming annual meeting.

BROADER CONTEXT FOR FY2023
We have continued to show resilience in the face of 
wider economic challenges and maintain our 
commitment to growth, execution and empowering our 
people. In terms of our people priorities, we have 
further improved our world class safety record, 
developed our internal talent pool with a significant 
increase in internal hires and launched a charitable 
foundation. The Smiths Foundation has an initial £10m 
commitment which will be used towards STEM-related 
non-profit organisations. 

FY2023 has seen the successful introduction of 
leadership behaviours at Smiths. The Smiths 
Leadership Behaviours serve as a foundation to unlock 
the full potential of our company. They describe the 
behaviours needed for the organisation to be dynamic, 
inclusive and focused on delivering results that create 
value. They apply to everyone at Smiths and are 
relevant to every role. The Smiths Leadership 
Behaviours provide a basis for which our people can be 
assessed not only on what they do, but how they do it. 

We introduced a GHG emissions reduction metric into 
our LTIP two years ago and more recently reinforced 
our commitment to our focused sustainability goals 
with the introduction of an energy efficiency metric for 
all divisions in the annual bonus. Setting the right 

metrics is undertaken in collaboration with the Science, 
Sustainability and Excellence (SSE) Committee. Further 
detail on our commitment to having relevant and robust 
sustainability metrics in our incentive plans is available 
on page 12 of the Sustainability at Smiths Report. 

INCENTIVE OUTTURNS FOR THE YEAR
The Committee considered outcomes under the 
FY2023 annual bonus and the FY2021 LTIP awards in 
the context of the performance of the business and 
wider stakeholder experience. FY2023 was a year of 
record organic revenue and EPS growth. We have 
posted nine consecutive quarters of growth and 
year-on-year improvement on all five of our medium-
term financial targets. We are well positioned for 
growth within our medium-term targets next year, 
supported by a healthy order intake. 

As a result, it was considered appropriate to award  
an AIP bonus of 70.0% of maximum opportunity for 
FY2023, representing an achievement between target 
and maximum against the financial and non-financial 
metrics. One-third of the bonus earned will be deferred 
into shares for the Executive Directors. 

The FY2021 LTIP award vested at 75.6% of maximum, 
reflecting performance over a three-year period 
aligned to the sustainable growth of the business over 
that period of time. 

The Committee did not exercise any discretion in 
respect of the incentive outcomes. 

IMPLEMENTATION FOR FY2024
The base salaries of the Executive Directors have been 
increased by 5.0% effective from 1 October 2023. In 
2022, management elected to focus a greater 
proportion of the salary increase budget on employees 
who were more significantly affected by inflationary 
pressures. This resulted in a below-market salary 

SMITHS GROUP PLC ANNUAL REPORT FY2023OVERVIEWSTRATEGIC REPORTGOVERNANCEFINANCIAL STATEMENTS99

REMUNERATION & PEOPLE COMMITTEE REPORT

CONTINUED

increase of 2.5% for Paul Keel. Clare Scherrer did not 
receive a salary increase in October 2022. For 2023, the 
salary increase budget is aligned across all employees 
in the wider UK workforce and the increases of 5% for 
both Paul Keel and Clare Scherrer reflect this. 

There are minimal changes to either the Annual 
Incentive Plan (AIP) or Long-Term Incentive Plan (LTIP) 
for the FY2024 awards. New Product 
Commercialisation (NPC) remains an important 
strategic driver of growth. For the FY2024 AIP, the 
weighting on the NPC metric has been incorporated 
into the broader Revenue metric. Payment of the 
Revenue outcome will be subject to meeting minimum 
NPC criteria. There are no changes to the LTIP metrics, 
weightings or ranges for the FY2024 awards which will 
be made in October 2023. The metrics in both the short-
term and long-term incentive plans are aligned to the 
delivery of our strategy. 

CONSIDERATION OF THE WIDER WORKFORCE
Our colleagues are our greatest asset. The 
Remuneration & People Committee is responsible for 
the Group’s overall remuneration strategy and 
monitors pay and employment conditions across our 
workforce. During the year, the Committee received an 
update from HR leaders in a number of business areas, 
to understand how pay policies are implemented 
across the Group and highlighting a range of new 
initiatives. This included an extensive review of the 
benefits offered to our colleagues, and the introduction 
of a global parental leave policy. 

The Board as a whole continues to pursue opportunities 
for Non-executive Directors to meet with employees 
under an organised programme of in-person site visits 
to get a deeper understanding of the culture within 
Smiths. Non-executive Directors attend employee 
forums and events engaging directly with our People. 
Updates are provided to the Remuneration & People 
Committee and further details on these activities are 
provided on page 59. 

REMUNERATION POLICY REVIEW
As part of the three-yearly cycle, the Remuneration 
Policy will be formally reviewed during FY2024 
to ensure that it remains clearly aligned to sustainable, 
long-term stakeholder interests and market 
best practice. 

During this review we will consult with key 
shareholders to explain any proposed changes and 
take their views into account. The new Policy will be 
presented to shareholders for approval at the 
2024 AGM. 

COMMITTEE MEMBERSHIP AND MEETINGS
The membership of the Committee and their meeting 
attendance during the year is set out on pages 80, 81 
and 84 of this report. I had served on a remuneration 
committee for at least 12 months prior to my 
appointment as Chairman of the Committee.

Sir George Buckley is absent when his own 
remuneration as Chairman of the Board is under 
consideration.

The Chief Executive attends meetings of the Committee 
by invitation but he is not involved in the determination 
of his own remuneration, or present during 
consideration of any changes to it.

COMMITTEE PERFORMANCE EVALUATION
The annual evaluation of the Committee was conducted 
as part of the internally facilitated evaluation process of 
the Board and its Committees. The findings relating to 
the Committee were discussed with me. More 
information can be found on page 85. Overall, the 
Committee is viewed as effective and performing well 
and is rigorous in discharging its responsibilities. 

There were four scheduled Committee meetings held 
during the year and one special meeting.

OTHER ACTIVITIES OF THE COMMITTEE IN FY2023
In addition to those highlighted elsewhere in this 
statement, the Committee has also undertaken the 
following activities in FY2023:

 – Reviewed business plans and performance to 

assess their potential impact on existing and future 
incentive arrangements;

 – Reviewed remuneration of the wider workforce and 
related policies to ensure internal alignment of 
reward;

 – Approved FY2024 salary increases for the Executive 
Committee considering available budget, individual 
performance rating, position in salary range and the 
increases provided across the wider workforce;
 – Reviewed the Committee’s performance and Terms 

of Reference; and

 – Approved the Remuneration Report for inclusion in 

the Annual Report.

LOOKING FORWARD
It has been my pleasure to serve Smiths and its 
stakeholders as a Non-executive Director since May 
2014. This is my fifth and final year as Chairman of the 
Remuneration & People Committee and I am confident 
the Committee is in safe hands as I pass responsibility 
to Karin Hoeing. Karin is an experienced Non-executive 
Director and has been a member of the Remuneration 
& People Committee since April 2020. I wish Karin 
every success in this role.

ALIGNMENT WITH THE UK CORPORATE GOVERNANCE CODE 
The table below details how the Committee addresses the factors set out within Provision 40 of the Code:

CLARITY

SIMPLICITY

 – The Committee welcomes transparency and regular engagement with shareholders with regard to executive remuneration. During 2023, 
as there have been no changes to Remuneration Policy, the Committee Chairman has not been required to consult with shareholders on 
remuneration matters. The Committee intends to consult with shareholders as part of the upcoming Remuneration Policy review in 2024.

 – Participants in incentive plans receive annual communications to confirm award levels and performance measures. Supporting guidance 
documents and instructional videos are available online. The Remuneration Policy for Executive Directors underpins that of the wider 
workforce and the 2021 Policy review further simplified the arrangements

RISK

 – The Committee considers the effective management of risk throughout the delivery of incentive plans, applying reasonable discretion to 

override formulaic outcomes if necessary

 – The Committee considers that the structure of incentive arrangements does not encourage unnecessary risk taking
 – For Executive Directors, one-third of the annual bonus payment is deferred into shares with an additional three years until vesting
 – Robust malus and claw back provisions are in place for incentive plans and are clearly communicated

PREDICTABILITY

 – Our Policy clearly outlines the maximum award levels and vesting outcomes applicable to annual bonus and LTIP. As stated above under 

‘Risk’, the Committee has the ability to apply discretion to formulaic outcomes and clear malus and claw back provisions exist

PROPORTIONALITY

 – There is a link between strategic business objectives and performance outcome, as outlined on page 101
 – Our Policy for our incentive plans outlines threshold, target and maximum opportunity levels, with actual outcomes dependent on 

performance achieved against predetermined measures

 – Through the design of the Policy and the discretion of the Committee, poor performance is not rewarded

ALIGNMENT TO 
CULTURE

 – Smiths Group Values of passion, integrity, respect, ownership and customer focus underpin the design and operation of the incentive 

programmes. The business strategy is supported by these Values which are widely communicated across the Company. The addition of the 
Smiths Leadership Behaviours, of which ‘Living Smiths Values’ is one, describe the behaviours needed for the organisation to be dynamic, 
inclusive and focused on delivering results that create value

SMITHS GROUP PLC ANNUAL REPORT FY2023REMUNERATIONCONTINUEDOVERVIEWSTRATEGIC REPORTGOVERNANCEFINANCIAL STATEMENTS103

CONSIDERATION OF WIDER WORKFORCE
The Committee considers all stakeholder groups when setting executive pay, including our people. The Committee is briefed on pay arrangements across the business 
and receives reports on people priorities within each of the divisions. In addition, a summary of remuneration related issues raised by employees through the employee 
engagement survey is presented to the Committee. As part of a comprehensive schedule of Non-executive Director engagement with the workforce, in 2023 all Board 
members, including the Committee Chairman attended events across our regional markets to discuss culture, people priorities, employee remuneration and benefit 
arrangements across the Group. Details of the engagement programme and in-person site visits are summarised on page 59. The overall responsibility for workforce 
engagement rests with the Senior Independent Director while each Non-executive Director has responsibility for workforce engagement in a specific geographical region 
and business area.

Paul Keel
Clare Scherrer

SALARY
Clare Scherrer was appointed to the Board as Chief Financial Officer on 29 April 2022 
with an annual base salary of £553,750. The values in the single figure table above in 
respect of FY2022 reflect the remuneration paid from 29 April 2022. 

BENEFITS
Benefits for Executive Directors include life assurance, disability insurance, private 
healthcare insurance, car related benefits, tax return preparation and relocation 
benefits (CEO only). The benefit value for Paul Keel has been restated for FY2022 to 
include UK tax of £177,597 settled by the company in October 2022 on a grossed up 
basis for housing, car and relocation payments. This is in accordance with the CEO 
service contract. The benefit figure for FY2023 includes an estimated UK tax payment 
of £116,197, calculated on the same basis. 

PENSION

Executives may choose either to participate in the Company’s defined contribution 
pension plan or to receive a pension allowance in lieu thereof. Paul Keel and Clare 
Scherrer received an allowance in lieu of pension contribution equivalent to 12% of 
salary during the year. This is aligned to the rate available to the wider UK workforce.

FY2023 ANNUAL BONUS OUTCOME
The maximum annual bonus opportunities for FY2023 were 200% of salary for 
Paul Keel and 165% of salary for Clare Scherrer. 

For FY2023, financial metrics made up 90% of the annual bonus, with the final  
10% based on performance against energy efficiency objectives. The table below 
summarises the financial targets and the Company’s actual performance (restated 
at budget exchange rates) against these for the FY2023 annual bonus.

The Group EPS growth after tax performance has been calculated to exclude the 
impact of the share buy-back scheme in order to ensure the targets were not 
materially easier to achieve than when originally set.

No discretion was exercised by the Remuneration & People Committee in respect  
of the formulaic outcomes under the LTIP. No awards were due to vest to Clare 
Scherrer under this award. The value included in the single figure table has been 
calculated using an estimated share price, based on the share price over the last 
quarter of the financial year of £16.51. The share price appreciation attributable to the 
FY2021 LTIP for Paul Keel was 19.29% (£284,729). 

An additional holding period of two years will apply to the shares vesting.

SHARE OWNERSHIP REQUIREMENT FOR EXECUTIVE DIRECTORS
Executive Directors are required to build a minimum shareholding equivalent to the 
annual fixed number of shares awarded under the LTIP within five years. Executive 
Directors are required to retain at least 50% of any net vested share awards (after 
sales to meet tax liabilities) until those guidelines are achieved. Shares under 
deferred bonus awards and LTIP awards which have vested but are subject to a 
further holding period (net of assumed income tax) count towards the requirement. 
Awards that are still subject to performance conditions do not count towards 
the requirement. 

Executive Directors will be required to hold shares equivalent to their full in-
employment shareholding guideline, or actual holding if lower, for two years 
post-employment, in line with best practice guidance. To enforce this requirement, 
vested shares are held in a nominee account provided by Smiths share plan 
administrator. This policy applies to Andy Reynolds Smith, who stepped down from 
the Group during FY2021, and John Shipsey who stepped down from the Group 
during FY2022. Mr Reynolds Smith was required to hold a number of shares in the 
Company with a value at least equal to £2,109,450 at 31 July 2021 until at least 31 July 
2023, while Mr Shipsey is required to hold 54,959 shares in the Company until at least 
31 July 2024.

SHARE SCHEME DILUTION LIMITS
The Company complies with the guidelines laid down by the Investment Association. 
These restrict the issue of new shares under all the Company’s share schemes in 
any ten-year period to 10% of the issued ordinary share capital and under the 
Company’s discretionary schemes to 5% in any ten-year period. As at 31 July 2023 
the headroom available under these limits was 7.93% and 3.67% respectively.

FOOTNOTES
1  Shares owned outright 

(including vested shares 
in holding period), and 
the net of income tax 
value of shares arising 
from bonus deferral are 
taken into account for the 
shareholding requirement. 
Executive Directors have 
five years from the date 
of appointment to meet 
the required personal 
shareholding; Paul Keel 
has until 25 May 2026 and 
Clare Scherrer has until 
29 April 2027 to meet the 
requirement.

The pay data for employees in the UK workforce has been calculated using Option B, 
based on the data used for gender pay reporting, due to the availability of data at the 
time the Annual Report was published. The gender pay reporting basis comprises 
salary and benefits as at 15 April 2023 and incentive payments payable in respect of 
FY2023. The Committee considers that this provides an outcome that is representative 
of the employees at these pay levels. It is assumed that the value of employee 
benefits is 7.0% of base salary as an average across the workforce. 

The workforce remuneration figures are those paid to UK employees whose pay is at 
the 25th, median and 75th percentile of pay for the Group’s UK employees. Figures 
are shown on both the prescribed basis using total pay and also salary only which 
provides a useful ongoing comparison as it is a less volatile basis. The CEO pay ratio 
for salary has seen a slight decrease at the 25th percentile and median and remained 
static at the 75th percentile. There is a significant increase in all ratios with regard to 

FY2022 to FY2023

EXECUTIVE DIRECTORS’ SERVICE CONTRACTS
The Company’s policy is that Executive Directors are normally employed on 
terms which include a one-year rolling period of notice from the Company and six 
months’ notice from the individual. The contract includes provision for the payment 
of a predetermined sum in the event of termination of employment in certain 
circumstances (but excluding circumstances where the Company is entitled to 
dismiss without compensation). In addition to payment of basic salary, pension 
allowance and benefits in respect of the unexpired portion of the one-year notice 
period and for good leavers only, the predetermined sum would include annual 
bonus and share awards only in respect of the period they have served, payable 
following the end of the relevant performance period and subject to the normal 
performance conditions. 

SMITHS GROUP PLC ANNUAL REPORT FY2023REMUNERATIONCONTINUEDOVERVIEWSTRATEGIC REPORTGOVERNANCEFINANCIAL STATEMENTSPaul Keel is employed under a service contract with the Company dated and effective 
from 25 May 2021. He became an Executive Director with effect from 25 May 2021. 

Clare Scherrer is employed under a service contract with the Company dated 
13 April 2022 and effective 29 April 2022. She became an Executive Director with 
effect from 29 April 2022.

The service contracts for both Executive Directors may be terminated by 12 months’ 
notice given by the Company or six months’ notice given by the Director. The Company 
may elect to terminate the contract by making a payment in lieu of notice equal to the 
Director’s base salary and benefits (including pension allowance) in respect of any 
unserved period of notice. The service contracts contain specific provisions enabling 
a reduction in any phased payments in lieu of notice, in the event that the Director 
finds alternative employment during the notice period. The service contracts are 
available for viewing at the Company’s Registered Office.

CHANGE OF CONTROL PROVISIONS
In the event of a change of control, LTIP awards will vest to the extent that each of the 
performance conditions is met based on the Committee’s assessment of performance 
over the performance period to the date of change of control. For internal 
performance measures, the Committee may exercise its judgement in determining 
the outcome based on its assessment of whether or not the performance conditions 
would have been met to a greater or lesser extent at the end of the full performance 
period. Awards will also normally be pro-rated to reflect the time that has elapsed 
between the grant of the award and the date of change of control. The Committee 
retains discretion to vary these provisions on a case by-case basis.

NON-EXECUTIVE DIRECTOR FEES
Non-executive Director fees paid during FY2023 and payable during FY2024 are 
shown below. It was determined that the fee increase for the outgoing Chairman 
and the Non-executive Directors should mirror that awarded to senior employees 
and that of the wider UK workforce. The fee increases of 5.0% will be effective from 
1 October 2023.

ADVISERS TO THE COMMITTEE
During the year, the Committee received material assistance and advice from 
the Chief Executive Officer, the Chief People Officer, the Global Reward Director, 
Deloitte LLP and Freshfields Bruckhaus Deringer LLP. The Committee’s appointed 
independent remuneration adviser is Deloitte LLP. The Company Secretary is 
secretary to the Committee. 

The Company paid a total fee of £89,450 to Deloitte LLP in relation to remuneration 
advice to the Committee during the year. Fees were determined on the basis of time 
and expenses.

During FY2023, Deloitte LLP provided the Committee with information on market, 
compliance support for this year’s Directors’ Remuneration Report and the provision 
of other advice relating to remuneration governance and market practice. Deloitte 
LLP is a founding member of the Remuneration Consultants Group and a signatory to 
its Code of Conduct. Deloitte LLP provided additional tax advisory services including 
global corporation tax compliance and employee mobility advice, as well as company 
secretarial, internal audit co-source, transaction and consultancy services. The 
Committee is satisfied that the advice provided by Deloitte LLP is objective and 
independent and that it does not have connections with the Group that may impair 
its independence. 

SUMMARY OF REMUNERATION POLICY 
Full details of the Remuneration Policy for Executive Directors, which was approved 
by shareholders at the AGM on 17 November 2021, are set out on the Company’s 
website and in the 2021 Annual Report and Accounts on pages 112 to 119.

I would like to thank colleagues across Smiths who 
are driving sustainability, innovation, more efficient 
processes and the commercialisation of new products. 
The Committee has observed a real step change in 
enthusiasm for SSE matters over recent years. I would 
also like to thank my colleagues on the Committee for 
their contributions during the year and I look forward 
to continuing our work in FY2024.

DAME ANN DOWLING 
Chair of the Science, Sustainability  
& Excellence Committee

SCIENCE, SUSTAINABILITY & 
EXCELLENCE COMMITTEE REPORT

The Committee received deep-dive presentations from 
our divisions on a rolling basis throughout the year. 
The deep-dives from Smiths Interconnect and Smiths 
Detection covered science in the form of innovation 
and new product development (NPD). From March, the 
deep-dives were expanded for John Crane and Flex-Tek 
to include presentations on their divisional roadmaps to 
deliver our SBT trajectory. We also received updates on 
SES projects. These deep-dives are important to the 
Committee as they enable us to review the culture, 
opportunities and risks in relation to SSE across the 
Group. They also bring to life the innovative and exciting 
work taking place in the divisions which, in turn, 
ensures the long-term sustainability of Smiths 
business model. 

Over the next year, I look forward to the Committee’s 
continued oversight of our SSE agenda, including 
further deep-dives from the divisions and Group 
experts, together with regular progress updates on 
the development and commercialisation of our new 
products and on our journey to Net Zero. I am 
particularly excited by the opportunities presented 
when these combine, with the innovation and new 
products we have in the pipeline supporting us and our 
customers in meeting ESG commitments and the wider 
green agenda. We believe this is a continuing and 
significant commercial opportunity for Smiths. 

CHAIR’S STATEMENT
I am pleased to present our Committee 
Report for FY2023. Science, Sustainability 
and Excellence (SSE) are critical elements 
of support for the execution of our strategy. 
We had a full agenda this year on SSE 
topics and have made good progress. 

We submitted our proposed Science-Based Targets 
(SBTs) and related plans for Scopes 1, 2 and 3 to the 
SBTi in May 2023, demonstrating our absolute 
commitment to achieving our Net Zero goals. 
Completion of ISAE Limited Assurance on our FY2022 
and FY2023 emissions inventories and energy efficiency 
metric was also an important step forward. This work 
was performed by our auditors KPMG and was a 
valuable exercise to test our processes and controls 
for monitoring the accuracy of these critical 
underpinning data. 

Our ESG double materiality assessment was finalised 
with support from PwC, with the assessment 
confirming that our ESG strategy and framework are fit 
for purpose and capture well the most material issues 
for our stakeholders. 

Linking our environmental targets in the form of energy 
efficiency to remuneration for a larger group of Smiths 
colleagues has generated enthusiasm across the 
Company, focusing the business on the necessary 
cultural change and building critical foundations to 
achieve our Net Zero goals. As such, we were pleased 
to recommend further targets to the Remuneration & 
People Committee for FY2024. More information can be 
found on page 98.

SCIENCE, SUSTAINABILITY & EXCELLENCE COMMITTEE REPORT

CONTINUED

COMMITTEE MEMBERSHIP AND 
MEETINGS
There were four scheduled meetings during the year. 
The members of the Committee, their biographies, and 
attendance at meetings during the year can be found on 
pages 80, 81 and 84. The Chief Executive Officer, Chief 
Sustainability Officer and Group SES Director attended 
every meeting. Other senior leaders were invited to 
attend as necessary.

COMMITTEE PERFORMANCE 
EVALUATION
Through the annual Board evaluation process, 
described on pages 85 and 86, the Board confirmed the 
effectiveness of the Committee in its role supporting 
the Board in compliance with its remit.

COMMITTEE ACTIVITIES
The main topics considered at Committee meetings 
were:

SCIENCE
All divisions updated the Committee on their NPD 
processes and pipelines and how science, technology, 
sustainability and a deep understanding of customer 
needs and aspirations are influencing their next 
generations of products. These divisional deep-dives 
brought to life NPD in each division and enabled the 
Committee to test future developments to ensure they 
are sufficiently aspirational and aligned with Smiths 
strategic aims. The Committee is highly engaged in 
this area, regularly tracking the development and 
commercialisation of new and emerging technologies 
and products. We are excited by the differentiated 
product opportunities in the pipeline, particularly 
those designed to support our customers to 
decarbonise and deliver efficient and sustainable 
infrastructure and processes. 

SUSTAINABILITY
The Committee continued to monitor progress against 
Smiths sustainability metrics including GHG emissions, 
renewable electricity, energy efficiency, water use and 
waste disposal. The Committee was updated on the 
work of the Energy Governance Committee (now known 
as the Net Zero Delivery Committee), a cross-divisional 
working group set up to coordinate a diverse mix of 
projects to meet our Net Zero targets. These projects 
include energy efficiency projects, onsite renewable 
projects, procurement of green electricity, moving to 
green fleets and alternative energy solutions.

During the divisional deep-dives, the Committee heard 
how the divisions have been driving environmental 
change in their businesses. As part of these updates, 
John Crane and Flex-Tek’s roadmaps to achieve their 
SBT trajectories were reviewed by the Committee who 
provided challenge and guidance. 

The Committee recommended to the Audit & Risk 
Committee the approval of the ISAE Limited Assurance 
of FY2022 and FY2023 energy efficiency and GHG data. 
Internal controls and rigour relating to sustainability 
data have progressed during the year and the Limited 
Assurance review by KPMG was an important exercise 
which highlighted where control efforts should be 
focused in the future. The Limited Assurance review 
also supported the Committee's confirmation to the 
Remuneration & People Committee of the attainment 
of the FY2023 energy efficiency targets and its 
recommendation for the new FY2024 targets to be 
included in remuneration. 

An ESG double materiality assessment was undertaken 
during the year, with oversight from the Committee. 
While this was an important exercise, it brought no 
surprises but, rather, confirmed that our current 
prioritisation of ESG-related topics is indeed on those 
of highest importance to our multiple stakeholders. 
The results highlighted five key ESG topics where 
Smiths must place the most focus. These are: 1) 
improving safety, health and well-being; 2) delivering 
Net Zero GHG; 3) commercialising high-value green 
technologies; 4) behaving ethically and legally; and        

5) supply chain management. As well as confirming the 
material ESG topics for Smiths, the assessment also 
supported our choice of key development areas for 
FY2024. The Committee is pleased with the outcome of 
the assessment and that so many colleagues engaged 
with the process through an internal survey. For more 
information on the ESG double materiality assessment, 
see page 32.

We were pleased to approve the FY2023 Sustainability 
at Smiths report which provides stakeholders with an 
enhanced understanding of the Group’s approach to, 
and measurement of, ESG progress. The report can be 
found on our website.

EXCELLENCE
The Group SES Director attended each Committee 
meeting to report on SES. The Committee was updated 
on the embedding of phase two of SES which leverages 
our Group focus on continuous improvement towards 
greater results-orientated process improvements. 

The Committee heard how the appointment of Master 
Black Belts and Black Belts, as well as projects that 
align with business priorities and deliver results, have 
helped drive support for SES through the business. High 
demand in the business for SES training has also shown 
the Committee that the value of SES is understood. 
Deep-dives from each division demonstrated how SES 
is becoming truly embedded in the business and in 
Smiths culture. 

Our divisions also highlighted how they have been 
working in partnership with our suppliers on SES 
projects in the areas of supply and customer 
satisfaction to ensure continuity of supply for 
key customers. 

Finally, the Committee was updated on the Internal 
Audit review of SES. The team assessed various 
SES projects and metrics to ensure that the 
communicated benefits were accurate. This was 
a valuable assurance exercise.

OF THE ANNUAL REPORT AND THE FINANCIAL STATEMENTS

STATEMENT OF DIRECTORS’ RESPONSIBILITIES 
IN RESPECT OF THE ANNUAL REPORT AND THE 
FINANCIAL STATEMENTS

115

The Directors are responsible for preparing the Annual 
Report, including a Strategic Report, Directors’ Report, 
Directors’ Remuneration Report and Corporate 
Governance Statement, and the Group and Parent 
Company financial statements in accordance with 
applicable law and regulations. 

Company law requires the Directors to prepare Group 
and Parent Company financial statements for each 
financial year. Under that law the Directors have elected 
to prepare the Group financial statements in 
accordance with UK-adopted international accounting 
standards in conformity with the requirements of the 
Act and applicable law and have elected to prepare the 
Parent Company financial statements in accordance 
with UK accounting standards and applicable law (UK 
Generally Accepted Accounting Practice), including  
FRS 101 ‘Reduced Disclosure Framework.’

Under company law the Directors must not approve the 
financial statements unless they are satisfied that they 
give a true and fair view of the state of affairs of the 
Group and the Parent Company and of their profit or 
loss for that period. In preparing each of the Group and 
Parent Company financial statements, the Directors 
are required to:

 – Select suitable accounting policies and then apply 

them consistently;

 – Make judgements and estimates that are 

reasonable, relevant, reliable and prudent;

 – For the Group financial statements, state whether 
applicable UK-adopted international accounting 
standards have been followed;

 – For the Parent Company financial statements, state 
whether applicable United Kingdom Accounting 
Standards have been followed subject to any 
material departures disclosed and explained in the 
Parent Company financial statements;

 – Assess the Group and Parent Company’s ability to 

continue as a going concern, disclosing, as 
applicable, matters related to going concern; and
 – Use the going concern basis of accounting unless 
they either intend to liquidate the Group or the 
Parent Company or to cease operations, or have no 
realistic alternative but to do so.

The Directors are responsible for keeping adequate 
accounting records that are sufficient to show and 
explain the Parent Company’s transactions and disclose 
with reasonable accuracy at any time the financial 
position of the Parent Company and enable them to 
ensure that its financial statements comply with the Act 
and, as regards the Group financial statements, Article 4 
of the IAS Regulation. The Directors are also 
responsible for such internal control as they determine 
is necessary to enable the preparation of financial 
statements that are free from material misstatement, 
whether due to fraud or error and have a general 
responsibility for taking such steps as are reasonably 
open to them to safeguard the assets of the Group and 
to prevent and detect fraud and other irregularities. 

The Directors are responsible for the maintenance  
and integrity of the corporate governance and financial 
information included on the Company’s website. 
Legislation in the United Kingdom governing the 
preparation and dissemination of the financial 
statements may differ from legislation in other 
jurisdictions.

In accordance with Disclosure Guidance and 
Transparency Rule 4.1.14R, the financial statements will 
form part of the annual financial report prepared using 
the single electronic reporting format under the 
Transparency Directive European Single Electronic 
Format (ESEF) Regulation. The auditor’s report on 
these financial statements provides no assurance over 
the ESEF format.

DIRECTORS’ RESPONSIBILITY 
STATEMENT
Each of the Directors (who are listed on pages 80 and 
81) confirms that to the best of his or her knowledge:

 – The financial statements, which have been prepared 
in accordance with the applicable set of accounting 
standards, give a true and fair view of the assets, 
liabilities, financial position and profit or loss of the 
Company and the undertakings included in the 
consolidation taken as a whole;

 – The Strategic Report and Directors’ Report, 

together the management report, includes a fair 
review of the development and performance of the 
business and the position of the Company and the 
undertakings included in the consolidation taken as 
a whole, together with a description of the principal 
risks and uncertainties that they face; and

 – As at the date of this Annual Report and financial 

statements, there is no relevant audit information of 
which the Company’s auditor is unaware. Each 
Director has taken all the steps he or she should 
have taken as a Director in order to make himself or 
herself aware of any relevant audit information and 
to establish that the Company’s auditor is aware of 
that information.

We consider the Annual Report and financial 
statements, taken as a whole, is fair, balanced and 
understandable and provides the information necessary 
for shareholders to assess the Group’s position and 
performance, business model and strategy.

KPMG LLP’S INDEPENDENT 
AUDITOR’S REPORT

TO THE MEMBERS OF SMITHS GROUP PLC

1. OUR OPINION IS UNMODIFIED
In our opinion:

 – the financial statements of Smiths Group Plc give a true and fair view of the state of the Group’s and of 

the Parent Company’s affairs as at 31 July 2023, and of the Group’s profit for the year then ended;

 – the Group financial statements have been properly prepared in accordance with UK-adopted 

international accounting standards;

 – the Parent Company financial statements have been properly prepared in accordance with UK 

accounting standards, including FRS 101 Reduced Disclosure Framework; and

 – the Group and Parent Company financial statements have been prepared in accordance with the 

requirements of the Companies Act 2006.  

WHAT OUR OPINION COVERS
We have audited the Group and Parent Company financial statements of Smiths Group Plc (“the Company”) for 
the year ended 31 July 2023 (FY2023) included in the Annual Report, which comprise: 

GROUP (SMITHS GROUP PLC AND ITS SUBSIDIARIES)

PARENT COMPANY (SMITHS GROUP PLC)

The consolidated income statement, consolidated 
statement of comprehensive income, consolidated 
balance sheet, consolidated statement of changes in 
equity, consolidated cash-flow statement

Company balance sheet, Company statement of 
changes in equity

Notes 1 to 31 to the Group financial statements, 
including the accounting policies.

Notes 1 to 13 to the Parent Company financial 
statements, including the accounting policies.

BASIS FOR OPINION 
We conducted our audit in accordance with International Standards on Auditing (UK) (“ISAs (UK)”) and applicable 
law. Our responsibilities are described below. We believe that the audit evidence we have obtained is a sufficient 
and appropriate basis for our opinion. Our audit opinion and matters included in this report are consistent with 
those discussed and included in our reporting to the Audit & Risk Committee (“ARC”). 

We have fulfilled our ethical responsibilities under, and we remain independent of the Group in accordance with, 
UK ethical requirements including the FRC Ethical Standard as applied to listed public interest entities.

2. OVERVIEW OF OUR AUDIT

FACTORS DRIVING OUR 
VIEW OF RISKS 

Following our FY2022 audit, and considering developments affecting the Group since then, we have 
updated our risk assessment decisions.

The Group recognises a goodwill balance in the Detection CGU of £630m which is subject to impairment 
assessment annually. The impairment assessment relies on assumptions and estimates which are 
subject to a high degree of uncertainty. These assumptions are sensitive to changes. Consistent with 
FY2022, there is significant auditor judgement involved in evaluating the assumptions and our assessment 
of the risk associated with this as a key audit matter remained consistent with the prior year.

The Group recognises a provision of £204m arising from ongoing asbestos litigation claims in John Crane 
Inc. There are significant judgements and estimates involved in the assumptions underlying the provision 
in respect of JCI asbestos litigation including the quantified projection period, the forecast number of 
future claims and associated claim and defence costs respectively and complex estimation methodology. 
Consistent with FY2022, there is significant auditor judgement involved in evaluating the assumptions and 
our assessment of the risk associated with this as a key audit matter remained consistent with the prior 
year.

The Parent company has material pension plan assets and liabilities, especially in the UK. Small changes 
in the assumptions used to determine the liabilities, in particular those relating to discount rates, inflation 
and mortality can have a significant impact on the valuation of the liabilities. The effect of these matters is 
that we determined that the pension assumptions have a high degree of estimation uncertainty. Due to the 
increase in discount rates in the year, the carrying value of the pension liability has reduced by £400m in 
the year. Consequently, while there is significant auditor judgement involved in evaluating the assumptions, 
our assessment of the risk associated with this as a key audit matter indicates a decrease in the potential 
impact of a material misstatement on the Group financial statements in the current year. 

During the year, the ARC met 4 times. KPMG are invited to attend all ARC meetings and are provided with 
an opportunity to meet with the ARC in private sessions without the Executive Directors being present. For 
each key audit matter, we have set out communications with the ARC in section 6, including matters that 
required particular judgement for each. 

The matters included in the Audit & Risk Committee Chairman’s report on pages 93 and 94 are materially 
consistent with our observations of those meetings.

SMITHS GROUP PLC ANNUAL REPORT FY2023KPMG LLP’S INDEPENDENT AUDITOR’S REPORTCONTINUEDOVERVIEWSTRATEGIC REPORTGOVERNANCEFINANCIAL STATEMENTS118

OUR INDEPENDENCE

We have fulfilled our ethical responsibilities and remain independent of the Group in accordance with UK 
ethical requirements, including the FRC Ethical Standard as applied to listed public interest entities. Apart 
from the matters noted below, we have not performed any non-audit services during the year ended 
31 July 2023 or subsequently which are prohibited by the FRC Ethical Standard. 

During 2023, we identified that certain KPMG member firms had provided preparation of local GAAP 
financial statement services and, in some cases, foreign language translation services over the period 
FY2020 to FY2023. Some of those entities to whom services were provided are and have been in scope for 
the Group audit. The services, which have been terminated, were administrative in nature and did not 
involve any management decision-making or bookkeeping. The work had no direct or indirect effect on 
Smiths Group plc’s consolidated financial statements

In our professional judgment, we confirm that based on our assessment of the breach, our integrity and 
objectivity as auditor has not been compromised and we believe that an objective, reasonable and 
informed third party would conclude that the provision of this service would not impair our integrity or 
objectivity for any of the impacted financial years. The Audit & Risk Committee concurred with this view.

We were first appointed as auditor by the shareholders for the year ended 31 July 2020. The period of total 
uninterrupted engagement is for the four financial years ended 31 July 2023. 

The Group engagement partner is required to rotate every 5 years. As these are the first set of the Group’s 
financial statements signed by Mike Barradell, he will be required to rotate off after the FY2027 audit.

The average tenure of partners responsible for component audits as set out in section 7 below is 4 years, 
with the shortest being 1 year and the longest being 4 years.

MATERIALITY
(ITEM 6 BELOW)

The scope of our work is influenced by our view of materiality and our assessed risk of material 
misstatement. 

We have determined overall materiality for the Group financial statements as a whole at £18m (FY2022: 
£16m) and for the Parent Company financial statements as a whole at £17.8m (FY2022: £15.8m). 

A key judgement in determining materiality was the most relevant metric to select as the benchmark, by 
considering which metrics have the greatest bearing on shareholder decisions.

Consistent with FY2022, we determined that Group profit before tax from continuing operations 
normalised to exclude the effect of specific items as explained in section 5 of this report remains the 
benchmark for the Group. We determined that normalised profit before tax remains the benchmark for 
the Group as Smiths Group Plc is publicly traded and a profit seeking entity. The Group is well established 
and operates in a stable environment across multiple geographies. The profitability and prospects for 
future net cash inflows is important to the users of the financial statements. We based our Group 
materiality on normalised PBTCO of £392m (FY2022: £314m), of which it represents 4.6% (FY2022: 5.1%). 

Materiality for the Parent Company financial statements was determined with reference to a benchmark 
of Parent Company total assets, limited to be less than materiality for Group materiality as a whole of 
which it represents 0.4% (FY22: 0.4%).

(ITEM 7 BELOW)

We have performed risk assessment and planning procedures to determine which of the Group’s 
components are likely to include risks of material misstatement to the Group financial statements, the 
type of procedures to be performed at these components and the extent of involvement required from our 
component auditors around the world.

We subjected 7 (FY2022: 23) to full scope audits for Group purposes and 10 (FY2022:9) to specified 
risk-focused audit procedures or audit of specific account balances. The components for which we 
performed audit of specific account balances were not individually financially significant enough to require 
a full scope audit for Group purposes but were included in the scope of our Group reporting work in order 
to provide further coverage over the Group’s results. 

The scope of the audit work performed was predominately substantive as we placed limited reliance 
upon the Group’s internal control over financial reporting.

In the prior year, all components were identified based on the Group’s legal entities. In the current year, 
we considered the Flex-Tek division as a single component, with the component auditor providing an 
opinion on the sub-consolidation prepared at the division level. This change to component scoping 
accounts for the reduction in the number of full scope components when compared to FY2022.

The components within the scope of our work accounted for the percentages illustrated opposite.

In addition, we have performed Group level analysis on the remaining components to determine 
whether further risks of material misstatement exist in those components. 

We consider the scope of our audit, as communicated to the Audit & Risk Committee, to be an 
appropriate basis for our audit opinion.

THE IMPACT OF CLIMATE 
CHANGE ON OUR AUDIT

We have considered the potential impacts of climate change on the financial statements as 
part of planning our audit. As the Group has set out on page 47, climate change has the 
potential to give rise to a number of transition risks and opportunities and physical risks and 
opportunities. The Group has stated their commitment to achieve Net Zero for Scope 1 & 2 
emissions by 2040 and to achieve Net Zero for Scope 3 emissions by 2050. The areas of the 
financial statements that are most likely to be potentially affected by climate related changes 
and initiatives are future loss of revenue due to supply chain challenges. The Group 
considered the impact of climate change and the Group’s targets in the preparation of the 
financial statements, as described on page 47 and concluded this did not have a material 
effect on the consolidated financial statements. We performed a risk assessment, taking into 

account climate change risks and the commitments made by the Group. We held inquiries of 
management regarding their processes for assessing the potential impact of climate change 
risk on the Group’s financial statements and held discussions with our own climate change 
professionals to challenge our risk assessment.

Based on our risk assessment we determined that that there was no significant impact of 
climate change on our key audit matters included in section 4 or other key areas of the audit. 
We have read the Group’s disclosure of climate related information in the front half of the 
Annual Report as set out on pages 47 to 57 and considered consistency with the financial 
statements and our audit knowledge.

3. GOING CONCERN, VIABILITY AND PRINCIPAL RISKS AND UNCERTAINTIES1 
The Directors have prepared the financial statements on the going concern basis as they do not intend to liquidate the Group or the Parent Company or to cease their operations, and as they have concluded that the Group’s and the 
Parent Company’s financial position means that this is realistic. They have also concluded that there are no material uncertainties that could have cast significant doubt over their ability to continue as a going concern for at least a 
year from the date of approval of the financial statements (“the going concern period”). 

GOING CONCERN 

We used our knowledge of the Group, its industry, and the general economic environment to identify the inherent 
risks to its business model and analysed how those risks might affect the Group’s and Parent Company’s 
financial resources or ability to continue operations over the going concern period. The risks that we considered 
most likely to adversely affect the Group’s and Parent Company’s available financial resources over this 
period were:

 – Adverse trading conditions and impact on the Group’s operations or that of its suppliers and customers, 
such as delays and cancellations of orders and deliveries, driven by geo-political and economic factors, 
resulting in a significant deterioration in the Group’s liquidity position.

 – Product quality failure which would result in reputational damage amongst customers and therefore 
reduction in orders and customer loss as well as potential significant liability claims raised against 
the Group.

OUR CONCLUSIONS
 – We consider that the Directors’ use of the going concern basis of accounting in the preparation of the 

financial statements is appropriate;

 – We have not identified, and concur with the Directors’ assessment that there is not a material uncertainty 
related to events or conditions that, individually or collectively, may cast significant doubt on the Group’s or 
Parent Company’s ability to continue as a going concern for the going concern period;

 – We have nothing material to add or draw attention to in relation to the Directors’ statement on page 135 on 
the use of the going concern basis of accounting with no material uncertainties that may cast significant 
doubt over the Group and Parent Company’s use of that basis for the going concern period, and we found 
the going concern disclosure on page 135 to be acceptable; and

 – The related statement under the Listing Rules set out on page 75 is materially consistent with the financial 

We considered whether these risks could plausibly affect the liquidity or covenant compliance in the going 
concern period by comparing severe but plausible downside scenarios that could arise from these risks 
individually and collectively against the level of available financial resources and covenant thresholds indicated 
by the Group’s financial forecasts. We also assessed the completeness of the going concern disclosure.

Accordingly, based on those procedures, we found the Directors’ use of the going concern basis of accounting 
without any material uncertainty for the Group and Parent Company to be acceptable. However, as we cannot 
predict all future events or conditions and as subsequent events may result in outcomes that are inconsistent 
with judgements that were reasonable at the time they were made, the above conclusions are not a guarantee 
that the Group or the Parent Company will continue in operation.

DISCLOSURES OF EMERGING AND PRINCIPAL RISKS AND LONGER-TERM VIABILITY 

OUR RESPONSIBILITY 
We are required to perform procedures to identify whether there is a material inconsistency between the 
Directors’ disclosures in respect of emerging and principal risks and the viability statement, and the financial 
statements and our audit knowledge. 

Based on those procedures, we have nothing material to add or draw attention to in relation to: 

 – the Directors’ confirmation within the going concern and viability statement on page 75 that they have 

carried out a robust assessment of the emerging and principal risks facing the Group, including those that 
would threaten its business model, future performance, solvency and liquidity; 

 – risk management disclosures describing these risks and how emerging risks are identified and explaining 

how they are being managed and mitigated; and 

 – the Directors’ explanation in the going concern and viability statement of how they have assessed the 
prospects of the Group, over what period they have done so and why they considered that period to be 
appropriate, and their statement as to whether they have a reasonable expectation that the Group will be 
able to continue in operation and meet its liabilities as they fall due over the period of their assessment, 
including any related disclosures drawing attention to any necessary qualifications or assumptions. 

We are also required to review the viability statement set out on page 75 under the Listing Rules. 

statements and our audit knowledge.

Our work is limited to assessing these matters in the context of only the knowledge acquired during our financial 
statements audit. As we cannot predict all future events or conditions and as subsequent events may result in 
outcomes that are inconsistent with judgements that were reasonable at the time they were made, the absence 
of anything to report on these statements is not a guarantee as to the Group’s and Parent Company’s longer-
term viability.

OUR REPORTING
We have nothing material to add or draw attention to in relation to these disclosures.

We have concluded that these disclosures are materially consistent with the financial statements and our 
audit knowledge.

4. KEY AUDIT MATTERS

WHAT WE MEAN

Key audit matters are those matters that, in our professional judgement, were of most significance in the audit of 
the financial statements and include the most significant assessed risks of material misstatement (whether or 
not due to fraud) identified by us, including those which had the greatest effect on: 

 – the overall audit strategy; 
 – the allocation of resources in the audit; and
 – directing the efforts of the engagement team. 

We include below the key audit matters in decreasing order of audit significance together with our key audit procedures to address those matters and our results from those procedures. These matters were addressed, and 
our results are based on procedures undertaken, for the purpose of our audit of the financial statements as a whole. We do not provide a separate opinion on these matters.

  We have not identified any significant changes to our assessment of 
the level of risk relating to Valuation of Goodwill for the Detection 
division compared to FY2022

OUR RESULTS 

FY2023: Acceptable 
FY2022: Acceptable

DESCRIPTION OF THE KEY AUDIT MATTER 
Forecast-based assessment
The Group holds a significant amount of goodwill, especially in relation to the Smiths Detection cash generating 
unit (CGU). The value in use calculation for the CGU, which represents the estimated recoverable amount, is 
subjective due to the inherent uncertainty involved in forecasting and discounting estimated future cash flows 
(specifically the key assumptions –discount rate, projected cost inflation and 5 year revenue growth). The effect 
of these matters is that, as part of our risk assessment, we determined that the value in use of the Smiths 
Detection CGU has a high degree of estimation uncertainty, with a potential range of reasonable outcomes 
greater than our materiality for the financial statements as a whole, and possibly many times that amount.

OUR RESPONSE TO THE RISK
We performed the tests below rather than seeking to rely on any of the group’s controls because the nature 
of the balance is such that we would expect to obtain audit evidence primarily through the detailed 
procedures described.

Our procedures to address the risk included:

Benchmarking assumptions and historical comparison: Assessing and challenging the key assumptions 
through retrospective review and comparison to external industry forecast. 

Our sector experience: Using our valuations specialists to challenge the appropriateness of discount rates by 
deriving our own independent range and using external market data to challenge the Group’s assumption of 
5-year revenue growth rates and EBIT margin.

Comparing valuations: Using our valuation specialist, we developed an independent valuation of the CGU’s value 
in use. In doing so, we considered relevance and reliability of expected enterprise valuations per analyst reports 
and comparable companies’ earnings multiple. 

Sensitivity analysis: We performed sensitivity analysis on key assumptions of discount rate, revenue growth rate 
and EBIT margin projection

Assessing transparency: We assessed whether the Group’s disclosures in respect of the judgement and 
estimates around goodwill recoverability for the Smiths Detection CGU, including disclosures of the sensitivity in 
the value in use calculations to changes in key assumptions 

COMMUNICATIONS WITH THE SMITHS GROUP PLC’S AUDIT & RISK COMMITTEE
Our discussions with and reporting to the Audit & Risk Committee included:
 – Our audit procedures relying fully on substantive audit procedures including engaging our valuation 

specialist team to test key assumptions in the impairment model.

 – Our conclusion on the overall assessment of the assumptions underlying the impairment model.
 – Our assessment of the adequacy of the disclosures in the financial statements particularly as it 
relates to sensitivity of the recoverable amount of the goodwill to changes in key assumptions.

AREAS OF PARTICULAR AUDITOR JUDGEMENT
We identified the following as the areas of particular auditor judgement:

 – Estimate of the cumulative average revenue growth rate including estimate of EBIT margin projections 

over the forecast period being within a range we consider to be reasonable.

 – Whether the discount rate used in the impairment model falls within an acceptable range.

OUR RESULTS
We found the Group’s conclusion that there is no impairment of goodwill to be acceptable (FY2022 result: 
acceptable). We found the sensitivity disclosures made to be acceptable (FY2022 result: acceptable).

Further information in the Annual Report and Accounts: See the Audit & Risk Committee Report on page 93 for details on how the Audit & Risk Committee considered Valuation of Goodwill for Detection Division as an area of 
significant attention, page 140 for the accounting policy on Valuation of Goodwill for Detection Division, and page 163 note 11 for the financial disclosures.

OUR RESULTS

FY2023: Acceptable 
FY2022: Acceptable

DESCRIPTION OF THE KEY AUDIT MATTER 
Subjective estimate 
There are significant judgements and estimates involved in the assumptions underlying the provision in respect 
of JCI asbestos litigation including the quantified projection period, the forecast number of future claims and 
associated claim and defence costs respectively and complex estimation methodology.

The effect of these matters is that, as part of our risk assessment, we determined that the asbestos litigation 
provision has a high degree of estimation uncertainty, with a potential range of reasonable outcomes greater 
than our materiality for the financial statements as a whole. 

OUR RESPONSE TO THE RISK
We performed the tests below rather than seeking to rely on any of the Group’s controls because the nature 
of the balance is such that we would expect to obtain audit evidence primarily through the detailed 
procedures described.

Our procedures to address the risk included:

Our actuarial expertise: Challenging the key judgement of the ten-year projection period using our own 
actuarial specialist and our sector knowledge and expertise. 

Benchmarking assumptions: Using our own actuarial specialists, we derived our own independent range of the 
estimated provision. We challenged the Group’s assumptions underlying the asbestos provision relying on 
industry trends across comparable peer companies, and effect of inflation and discount rate assumptions 
through comparison to external market data.

Enquiry of lawyers: Obtaining external independent legal confirmations of historical and ongoing claims data 
used by the Group’s management expert for estimating the future projected cost and claims.

Assessment of management’s expert: Assessing the competency, knowledge and independence of the expert 
using our own specialist.

Assessing methodology: Using our own actuarial specialists, we evaluated the methodology applied by 
management to the estimation to assess whether the methodology utilised is in line with industry practice. 

Historical comparison: Assessing and challenging the projected indemnity and defence expenditure through 
retrospective review of incurred cost. 

Assessing transparency: Assessing whether the disclosures of the effect of reasonably possible changes in 
key judgements and assumptions reflects the risks inherent in the provision’s estimation.

COMMUNICATIONS WITH THE SMITHS GROUP PLC’S AUDIT & RISK COMMITTEE
Our discussions with and reporting to the Audit & Risk Committee included:

AREAS OF PARTICULAR AUDITOR JUDGEMENT
We identified the following as the areas of particular auditor judgement:

 – Our audit procedures relying fully on substantive audit procedures including engaging our valuation 

specialist team to test the reasonableness of the provision recognised in the year

 – Our conclusion on the overall assessment of the assumptions supporting the litigation provision
 – Our assessment of the adequacy of the related disclosures in the financial statements 

 – Appropriateness of ten-year projection period for the estimation of the litigation liability
 – Range of possible outcome on litigation provision based on outcome of court judgements from ongoing 

litigation claims

OUR RESULTS
We found the level of litigation provisioning and related disclosures in the financial statements in respect of 
John Crane Inc. asbestos litigation to be acceptable (FY2022: acceptable).

UK defined benefit SIPS pension scheme 
liabilities

£1,251m £1,603m

FY2023

FY2022

  We noted a significant reduction in the value of UK defined benefit SIPS 
pension scheme liabilities and consequently a reduction in the 
potential impact of a material misstatement on the financial statement.

OUR RESULTS

FY2023: Acceptable 
FY2022: Acceptable

DESCRIPTION OF THE KEY AUDIT MATTER 
Subjective valuation and significant transaction
The Parent Company has material pension plan assets and liabilities, especially in the UK. Small changes in the 
assumptions used to determine the liabilities, in particular those relating to discount rates, inflation and 
mortality can have a significant impact on the valuation of the liabilities.

The effect of these matters is that we determined that the pension assumptions have a high degree of estimation 
uncertainty, with a potential range of reasonable outcomes greater than our materiality for the financial 
statements as a whole, and possibly many times that amount. We draw out amounts recognised and 
corresponding disclosures made in respect of uncertainties surrounding effective equalisation of benefits as a 
key audit matter for the Parent Company in our auditor’s report.

OUR RESPONSE TO THE RISK
We performed the tests below rather than seeking to rely on any of the Company’s controls because the  
nature of the balance is such that we would expect to obtain audit evidence primarily through the detailed 
procedures described.

Our procedures to address the risk included:

Benchmarking assumptions: Challenging the key assumptions applied in the calculation of the liability, including 
the discount rates, inflation rates, mortality and pension increases with the support of our own actuarial 
specialists by comparing the Company’s estimate of these assumptions against market data.

Assessing actuary’s credentials: Assessing the competence, independence and integrity of the scheme’s 
actuary.

Inspection of relevant documents: Inspecting legal advices, trustee communications and valuation documents 
to assess whether the amounts in relation to equalisation of retirement ages between men and women are 
accounted appropriately in the current year in accordance with the requirement of IAS 19 using our own actuarial 
specialists and our sector knowledge and expertise. 

Assessing legal advisor’s credentials: Assessing the competence, independence and integrity of the Trustee’s 
and Company’s legal advisors.

Assessing transparency: Assessing the adequacy of the disclosures in respect of the sensitivity of the obligation 
to key assumptions and uncertainties in respect of equalisation of benefits. 

COMMUNICATIONS WITH THE SMITHS GROUP PLC’S AUDIT & RISK COMMITTEE
Our discussions with and reporting to the Audit & Risk Committee included:

 – Assessment of the appropriateness of the amounts recognised and corresponding disclosures made in 
respect of uncertainties surrounding effective equalisation of retirement ages between men and women.

 – Our conclusion on the overall assessment of the assumptions and key judgements supporting the 

estimation of the defined benefit obligation.

 – Our assessment of the adequacy of the disclosures in the financial statements.

AREAS OF PARTICULAR AUDITOR JUDGEMENT
We identified the following as the areas of particular auditor judgement:

 – Assessment of the assumptions supporting the defined benefit obligation.

OUR RESULTS
We found the valuation of the pension scheme liabilities of SIPS scheme and the amounts and corresponding 
disclosures made in respect of uncertainties surrounding effective equalisation of benefits to be acceptable 
(FY2022: acceptable). 

Further information in the Annual Report and Accounts: See the Audit & Risk Committee Report on page 93 for details on how the Audit & Risk Committee considered valuation of UK defined benefit SIPS pension scheme liabilities 
as an area of significant attention, page 140 for the accounting policy on valuation of UK defined benefit SIPS pension scheme liabilities, and page 154 note 8 for the financial disclosures.

5. OUR ABILITY TO DETECT IRREGULARITIES, AND OUR RESPONSE 

FRAUD – IDENTIFYING AND RESPONDING TO RISKS OF MATERIAL MISSTATEMENT DUE TO FRAUD

FRAUD RISK ASSESSMENT 

To identify risks of material misstatement due to fraud (“fraud risks”) we assessed events or conditions that could indicate an incentive or pressure to commit fraud or provide an 
opportunity to commit fraud. Our risk assessment procedures included:

 – Enquiring of Directors, the Audit & Risk Committee, internal audit and inspection of policy documentation as to the Group’s high-level policies and procedures to prevent and 
detect fraud, including the internal audit function, and the Group’s channel for “whistleblowing”, as well as whether they have knowledge of any actual, suspected or alleged 
fraud.

 – Reading Board, Audit & Risk, Disclosure, Transactions, Nomination & Governance, Remuneration & People, Finance Committee minutes.
 – Considering remuneration incentive schemes and performance targets for management and Directors including the organic revenue growth targets and EPS target for 

management remuneration.

 – Using analytical procedures to identify any unusual or unexpected relationships

RISK COMMUNICATIONS

We communicated identified fraud risks throughout the audit team and remained alert to any indications of fraud throughout the audit. This included communication from the Group to full 
scope and audit of specific account balances scope component audit teams of relevant fraud risks identified at the Group level and requesting the full scope and audit account balance 
scope component audit teams to report to the Group audit team any instances of fraud that could give rise to a material misstatement at Group.

FRAUD RISKS

As required by auditing standards and taking into account possible pressures to meet profit targets, and our overall knowledge of the control environment, we perform procedures to 
address the risk of management override of controls and the risk of fraudulent revenue recognition, in particular in the Smiths Detection Inc, USA and Smiths Detection Germany GmbH 
components. Within these components a significant portion of multi-year contracts (programme revenue) revenue is normally recognised in the last month of the year. Therefore, there is 
a risk of revenue being overstated during the year end closing period through the manipulation of the timing of recording of revenue from such pressure. We did not identify any additional 
fraud risks.

PROCEDURES TO ADDRESS 
FRAUD RISKS 

We performed procedures including:

 – Identifying journal entries to test for all components within full scope and audit of specific account balances scope based on risk criteria and comparing the identified entries to 

supporting documentation. These included unusual entries in revenue accounts, cash and cash equivalents or borrowings accounts and entries posted by senior finance 
management.

 – Testing consolidation adjustment entries posted and comparing the identified entries to supporting documentation.
 – Specified procedures to be completed by relevant component teams over period end revenue recognition procedures. These procedures included tests over pre-year end and 

post year end revenue transactions

LAWS AND REGULATIONS – IDENTIFYING AND RESPONDING TO RISKS OF MATERIAL MISSTATEMENT RELATING TO COMPLIANCE WITH LAWS AND REGULATIONS

LAWS AND REGULATIONS 
RISK ASSESSMENT 

We identified areas of laws and regulations that could reasonably be expected to have a material effect on the financial statements from our general commercial and sector experience, 
through discussion with the Directors and other management (as required by auditing standards), and from inspection of the Group’s regulatory and legal correspondence and discussed 
with the Directors and other management the policies and procedures regarding compliance with laws and regulations.

As the Group is regulated, our assessment of risks involved gaining an understanding of the control environment including the entity’s procedures for complying with regulatory 
requirements.

RISK COMMUNICATIONS

We communicated identified laws and regulations throughout our team and remained alert to any indications of non-compliance throughout the audit. This included communication from 
the Group audit team to full-scope component audit teams of relevant laws and regulations identified at the Group level, and a request for full scope component auditors to report to the 
Group team any instances of non-compliance with laws and regulations that could give rise to a material misstatement at Group level. 

DIRECT LAWS CONTEXT AND 
LINK TO AUDIT

The potential effect of these laws and regulations on the financial statements varies considerably.

Firstly, the Group is subject to laws and regulations that directly affect the financial statements including financial reporting legislation (including related companies legislation), 
distributable profits legislation, taxation legislation and pensions legislation, and we assessed the extent of compliance with these laws and regulations as part of our procedures on the 
related financial statement items.

MOST SIGNIFICANT 
INDIRECT LAW/REGULATION 
AREAS

Secondly, the Group is subject to many other laws and regulations where the consequences of non-compliance could have a material effect on amounts or disclosures in the financial 
statements, for instance through the imposition of fines or litigation. We identified the following areas as those most likely to have such an effect: health and safety, anti-bribery and 
corruption, considering dealings with government customers, employment law, and certain aspects of company legislation

Auditing standards limit the required audit procedures to identify non-compliance with these laws and regulations to enquiry of the Directors and other management and inspection of 
regulatory and legal correspondence, if any. Therefore, if a breach of operational regulations is not disclosed to us or evident from relevant correspondence, an audit will not detect 
that breach.

CONTEXT

CONTEXT OF THE ABILITY  
OF THE AUDIT TO DETECT 
FRAUD OR BREACHES OF 
LAW OR REGULATION

Owing to the inherent limitations of an audit, there is an unavoidable risk that we may not have detected some material misstatements in the financial statements, even though we have 
properly planned and performed our audit in accordance with auditing standards. For example, the further removed non-compliance with laws and regulations is from the events and 
transactions reflected in the financial statements, the less likely the inherently limited procedures required by auditing standards would identify it.  In addition, as with any audit, there 
remained a higher risk of non-detection of fraud, as fraud may involve collusion, forgery, intentional omissions, misrepresentations, or the override of internal controls. Our audit 
procedures are designed to detect material misstatement.  We are not responsible for preventing non-compliance or fraud and cannot be expected to detect non-compliance with all laws 
and regulations.

6. OUR DETERMINATION OF MATERIALITY
The scope of our audit was influenced by our application of materiality. We set quantitative thresholds and overlay qualitative considerations to help us determine the scope of our audit and the nature, timing and extent of our 
procedures, and in evaluating the effect of misstatements, both individually and in the aggregate, on the financial statements as a whole. 

£18M
(FY2022: £16M)
MATERIALITY FOR THE 
GROUP FINANCIAL 
STATEMENTS AS A WHOLE

What we mean
A quantitative reference for the purpose of planning and performing our audit.

Basis for determining materiality and judgements applied
Materiality for the Group financial statements as a whole was set at £18m (FY2022: £16m). 
This was determined with reference to a benchmark of Group normalised profit before tax 
from continuing operations (‘PBTCO’). 

Consistent with FY2022, we determined that Group normalised PBTCO remains the main 
benchmark for the Group.  We determined that normalised profit before tax remains the 
benchmark for the Group as Smiths Group Plc is publicly traded and a profit seeking entity. 
The Group is well established and operates in a stable environment across multiple 
geographies. The profitability and prospects for future net cash inflows is important to the 
users of the financial statements. 

We normalised PBTCO (FY2022: normalised PBTCO) for these items because they do not 
represent the normal, continuing operations of the Group. In making the adjustments for the 

current year, we excluded  the net credit of £4m due to the retirement benefit obligation past 
service equalisation costs (note 8 of the financial statements) and added back restructuring 
costs of £36 million (note 3 of the financial statements). (FY2022: PBTCO was normalised to 
exclude foreign exchange gain on intercompany loan with discontinued operations of 
£22 million, retirement benefit scheme settlement loss £171 million, past service equalisation 
cost £43 million and impairment of assets £19 million). As such, we based our Group 
materiality on Group normalised PBTCO of £392m (FY2022: £314m).

Our Group materiality of £18m was determined by applying a percentage to the normalised 
PBTCO. When using a benchmark of normalised PBTCO to determine overall materiality, 
KPMG’s approach for listed entities considers a guideline range 3% – 5% of the measure. In 
setting overall Group materiality, we applied a percentage of 4.6% (FY2022: 5%) to the 
benchmark. 

Materiality for the Parent Company financial statements as a whole was set at £17.8m 
(FY2022: £15.8m), determined with reference to a benchmark of Parent Company total assets, 
of which it represents 0.4% (FY2022: 0.4%).

£11.7M
(FY2022: £10.4M
PERFORMANCE 
MATERIALITY

What we mean
Our procedures on individual account balances and disclosures were performed to a lower 
threshold, performance materiality, so as to reduce to an acceptable level the risk that 
individually immaterial misstatements in individual account balances add up to a material 
amount across the financial statements as a whole.

The Parent Company performance materiality was set at £11.5m (FY2022: £10.2m), which 
equates to 64.6% (FY2022: 64.6%) of materiality for the Parent Company financial statements 
as a whole. 

We applied this percentage in our determination of performance materiality because we did 
not identify any factors indicating an elevated level of risk.

Basis for determining performance materiality and judgements applied
We have considered performance materiality at a level of 65% (FY2022: 65%) of materiality for 
Smiths Group Plc Group financial statements as a whole to be appropriate. 

£0.89M
(FY2022: £0.79M)
AUDIT MISSTATEMENT 
POSTING THRESHOLD

What we mean
This is the amount below which identified misstatements are considered to be clearly trivial 
from a quantitative point of view. We may become aware of misstatements below this 
threshold which could alter the nature, timing and scope of our audit procedures, for example 
if we identify smaller misstatements which are indicators of fraud. 

Basis for determining the audit misstatement posting threshold and 
judgements applied
We set our audit misstatement posting threshold at 5% (FY2022: 5%) of our materiality for the 
Group financial statements. We also report to the Audit & Risk Committee any other identified 
misstatements that warrant reporting on qualitative grounds.

This is also the amount above which all misstatements identified are communicated to Smiths 
Group plc’s Audit & Risk Committee.

The overall materiality for the Group financial statements of £18m (FY2022: £16m) compares as follows to the main financial statement caption amounts:

GROUP SCOPE 

What we mean
How the Group audit team determined the procedures to be performed across the Group.

The Group audit team has also performed audit procedures on the following areas on behalf 
of the components: 

127

The Group operates in more than 50 countries across six continents with the largest 
footprints being in the US, Europe and Asia. The Group is organised into four divisions: John 
Crane, Smiths Detection, Flex-Tek and Smiths Interconnect which is a consolidation of over 
200 reporting components. We scoped the audit by obtaining an understanding of the Group 
and its environment and assessing the risk of material misstatement at the Group level. We 
have considered components based on their contribution to Group revenue; Group assets 
and Group profit before tax for continuing operations including whether we had sufficient 
coverage over each division and the specific risks in the components.

Of the Group’s 208 (2022: 253) reporting components, we subjected 7 (2022: 23) to full scope 
audits for Group purposes and 9 (2022:9) to specified risk-focused audit procedures or audit 
of specific account balances. In the prior year, all components were identified based on the 
Group’s legal entities.  In the current year, we considered the Flex-Tek division as a single 
reporting component, with the component auditor providing an opinion on the sub-
consolidation prepared at the division level.  This change to component scoping accounts for 
the reduction in the number of full scope components when compared to FY2022.

The components for which we performed audit of specific account balances were not 
individually financially significant enough to require a full scope audit for Group purposes but 
were included in the scope of our Group reporting work in order to provide further coverage 
over the Group’s results. The audit of account balance has been completed for revenue, 
trade receivables and cash and cash equivalents accounts.

The components for which we performed specified risk-focused audit procedures were not 
individually financially significant enough to require an audit for Group reporting purposes 
but did present specific individual risks that needed to be addressed. Specified risk-focused 
audit procedures were performed over a number of areas, including litigation provisions and 
defined benefit pension assets and liabilities.

The remaining 30% (FY2022: 26%) of total Group revenue, 26% (FY2022: 18%) of Group profit 
before tax and 13% (FY2022: 25%) of total Group assets is represented by 191 (FY2022: 221) 
of reporting components, none of which individually represented more than 10% (FY2022: 
10%) of any of total Group revenue, Group profit before tax or total Group assets. For these 
components, we performed analysis at an aggregated group level to re-examine our 
assessment that there were no significant risks of material misstatement within these.

We instructed 7 (FY2022: 23) reporting components to perform full scope audits for Group 
purposes, 3 reporting components (FY2022: 2) to perform specified audit procedures and 7 
reporting components (FY2022: 7) to perform audit of account balances. The component 
materiality for all components ranged from £1.1m to £17.8m (FY2022: £0.6m to £15.8m). 
Please see table below for a summary

 – Control environment, risk assessment, monitoring and information and communication 

components (CERAMIC) of internal control over financial reporting (ICFR) 

 – Review of transfer pricing arrangements across the Group

These items were audited by the Group team because of the centralised nature of the data 
processing activities within the Group. The Group team communicated the results of these 
procedures to the component teams.

In addition, we have performed Group level analysis on the remaining components to 
determine whether further risks of material misstatement exist in those components.

The scope of the audit work performed was predominately substantive as we placed limited 
reliance upon the Group’s internal control over financial reporting.

For those items excluded from normalised PBTCO, the component teams performed 
procedures on items relating to their components. The Group team performed procedures 
on the remaining excluded items.

The Group team instructed component auditors as to the significant areas to be covered, 
including the relevant risks detailed above and the information to be reported back.  The 
Group team approved the component materialities, as detailed in the table above, having 
regard to the mix of size and risk profile of the Group across the components.  

The work on 14 of the 17 components (FY2022: 30 of the 32 components) was performed by 
component auditors and the rest, including the audit of the Parent Company, was performed 
by the Group team.

GROUP AUDIT TEAM 
OVERSIGHT

What we mean
The extent of the Group audit team’s involvement in component audits.

In working with component auditors, we:

 – Held planning calls with component audit teams to discuss the significant areas of the 

audit relevant to the components.

 – Issued Group audit instructions to component auditors on the scope of their work.
 – Held risk assessment update discussions with all component audit teams before the 
commencement of the final phases of the audit led by the Group engagement partner.

 – Visited 6 (FY2022: Nil) components in-person as the audit progressed to understand 

and challenge the audit approach and organised 4 video conferences with the partners 
and directors of the Group and component audit teams. At these visits and/ meetings/ 
and video conferences, the findings reported to the Group team were discussed in 
more detail, and any further work required by the Group team was then performed by 
the component audit teams. The Group team also attended the audit close meetings 
for all component teams.

 – Inspection of component audit teams’ key work papers in person or using remote 
technology capabilities to evaluate the quality of execution of the audits of the 
components.

8. OTHER INFORMATION IN THE ANNUAL REPORT 
The Directors are responsible for the other information presented in the Annual Report together with the financial statements.  Our opinion on the financial statements does not cover the other information and, accordingly, we do 
not express an audit opinion or, except as explicitly stated below, any form of assurance conclusion thereon.  

ALL OTHER INFORMATION

Our responsibility is to read the other information and, in doing so, consider whether, based on our financial statements audit work, the information 
therein is materially misstated or inconsistent with the financial statements or our audit knowledge.

Based solely on that work we have not identified material 
misstatements or inconsistencies in the other information. 

STRATEGIC REPORT AND DIRECTORS’ REPORT  

OUR RESPONSIBILITY AND REPORTING
Based solely on our work on the other information described above we report to you as follows:  
 – we have not identified material misstatements in the Strategic Report and the Directors’ Report;

accordance with the Companies Act 2006.  

OUR REPORTING
In our opinion the part of the Directors’ Remuneration Report to be 
audited has been properly prepared in accordance with the Companies 
Act 2006.  

CORPORATE GOVERNANCE DISCLOSURES

OUR RESPONSIBILITY 
We are required to perform procedures to identify whether there is a material inconsistency between the financial statements and our audit 
knowledge, and:

 – the Directors’ statement that they consider that the Annual Report and financial statements taken as a whole is fair, balanced and 

understandable, and provides the information necessary for shareholders to assess the Group’s position and performance, business model 
and strategy; 

 – the section of the Annual Report describing the work of the Audit & Risk Committee, including the significant issues that the Audit & Risk 

Committee considered in relation to the financial statements, and how these issues were addressed; and

 – the section of the Annual Report that describes the review of the effectiveness of the Group’s risk management and internal control systems.

OUR REPORTING
Based on those procedures, we have concluded that each of these 
disclosures is materially consistent with the financial statements and our 
audit knowledge.    

We are also required to review the part of the Corporate Governance Statement relating to the Group’s compliance with the provisions of the UK 
Corporate Governance Code specified by the Listing Rules for our review.   

We have nothing to report in this respect.

SMITHS GROUP PLC ANNUAL REPORT FY2023KPMG LLP’S INDEPENDENT AUDITOR’S REPORTCONTINUEDOVERVIEWSTRATEGIC REPORTGOVERNANCEFINANCIAL STATEMENTSOTHER MATTERS ON WHICH WE ARE REQUIRED TO REPORT BY EXCEPTION 

OUR RESPONSIBILITY 
Under the Companies Act 2006, we are required to report to you if, in our opinion:  
 – adequate accounting records have not been kept by the Parent Company, or returns adequate for our audit have not been received from 

OUR REPORTING
We have nothing to report in these respects.

branches not visited by us; or  

 – the Parent Company financial statements and the part of the Directors’ Remuneration Report to be audited are not in agreement with the 

129

accounting records and returns; or  

 – certain disclosures of Directors’ remuneration specified by law are not made; or
 – we have not received all the information and explanations we require for our audit.  

9. RESPECTIVE RESPONSIBILITIES 
DIRECTORS’ RESPONSIBILITIES
As explained more fully in their statement set out on page 115, the Directors are responsible for: the preparation 
of the financial statements including being satisfied that they give a true and fair view; such internal control as 
they determine is necessary to enable the preparation of financial statements that are free from material 
misstatement, whether due to fraud or error; assessing the Group and Parent Company’s ability to continue as a 
going concern, disclosing, as applicable, matters related to going concern; and using the going concern basis of 
accounting unless they either intend to liquidate the Group or the Parent Company or to cease operations, or 
have no realistic alternative but to do so.  

AUDITOR’S RESPONSIBILITIES 
Our objectives are to obtain reasonable assurance about whether the financial statements as a whole are free 
from material misstatement, whether due to fraud or error, and to issue our opinion in an auditor’s report.  
Reasonable assurance is a high level of assurance but does not guarantee that an audit conducted in accordance 
with ISAs (UK) will always detect a material misstatement when it exists.  Misstatements can arise from fraud or 
error and are considered material if, individually or in aggregate, they could reasonably be expected to influence 
the economic decisions of users taken on the basis of the financial statements.  

A fuller description of our responsibilities is provided on the FRC’s website at www.frc.org.uk/
auditorsresponsibilities.  

The Company is required to include these financial statements in an annual financial report prepared using the 
single electronic reporting format specified in the TD ESEF Regulation.  This auditor’s report provides no 
assurance over whether the annual financial report has been prepared in accordance with that format.

10. THE PURPOSE OF OUR AUDIT WORK AND TO WHOM WE OWE OUR 
RESPONSIBILITIES 
This report is made solely to the Company’s members, as a body, in accordance with Chapter 3 of Part 16 of the 
Companies Act 2006.  Our audit work has been undertaken so that we might state to the Company’s members 
those matters we are required to state to them in an auditor’s report and for no other purpose.  To the fullest 
extent permitted by law, we do not accept or assume responsibility to anyone other than the Company and the 
Company’s members, as a body, for our audit work, for this report, or for the opinions we have formed.

CONSOLIDATED PRIMARY STATEMENTSCONTINUEDSMITHS GROUP PLC ANNUAL REPORT FY2023OVERVIEWSTRATEGIC REPORTGOVERNANCEFINANCIAL STATEMENTSACCOUNTING POLICIES

BASIS OF PREPARATION
The accounts have been prepared in accordance with UK adopted International Accounting 
Standards in conformity with the requirements of the Companies Act 2006.

The consolidated financial statements have been prepared under the historical cost convention 
modified to include revaluation of certain financial instruments, share options and pension assets 
and liabilities, held at fair value as described below. 

GOING CONCERN
The Directors are satisfied that the Group has adequate resources to continue to operate for a 
period not less than 12 months from the date of approval of the financial statements and that 
there are no material uncertainties around their assessment. Accordingly, the Directors continue 
to adopt the going concern basis of accounting.

The Group’s business activities, together with the factors likely to affect its future development, 
performance and position, are set out in the Strategic Report on pages 8 to 77. The Group’s 
financial position, cash-flows, liquidity and borrowing facilities are described in the CFO review 
section on pages 21 to 23.

Other factors considered by the Board as part of its going concern assessment included the 
inherent uncertainties in cash-flow forecasts. Based on the above, the Directors have concluded 
that the Group is well placed to manage its financing and other business risks satisfactorily, and 
they have a reasonable expectation that the Group will have adequate resources to continue in 
operation for at least 12 months from the signing date of these financial statements. They 
therefore consider it appropriate to adopt the going concern basis of accounting in preparing the 
financial statements.

KEY ESTIMATES AND SIGNIFICANT JUDGEMENTS 
The preparation of the accounts in conformity with generally accepted accounting principles 
requires management to make estimates and judgements that affect the reported amounts of 
assets and liabilities and disclosure of contingent assets and liabilities at the date of the accounts 
and the reported amounts of revenues and expenses during the reporting period. Actual results 
may differ from these estimates. 

RETIREMENT BENEFITS
Determining the value of the future defined benefit obligation involves significant estimates in 
respect of the assumptions used to calculate present values. These include future mortality, 
discount rate and inflation. The Group uses previous experience and independent actuarial advice 
to select the values for critical estimates. A portion of UK pension liabilities are insured via bulk 
annuity policies that match all or part of the scheme obligation to identified groups of pensioners. 
These assets are valued by an external qualified actuary at the actuarial valuation of the 
corresponding liability, reflecting this matching relationship.

The Group’s principal defined benefit pension plans are in the UK and the US and these have been 
closed so that no future benefits are accrued. Critical estimates for these plans, and the effect of 
variances in these estimates, are disclosed in note 8.

PROVISIONS FOR LIABILITIES AND CHARGES
The Group has made provisions for claims and litigations where it has had to defend itself against 
proceedings brought by other parties. These provisions have been made for the best estimate of 
the expected expenditure required to settle each obligation, although there can be no guarantee 
that such provisions (which may be subject to potentially material revision from time to time) will 
accurately predict the actual costs and liabilities that may be incurred. The most significant of 
these litigation provisions are described below.

John Crane, Inc. (JCI), a subsidiary of the Group, is one of many co-defendants in litigation relating 
to products previously manufactured which contained asbestos. Provision of £204m (FY2022: 
£229m) has been made for the future defence costs which the Group is expected to incur and the 
expected costs of future adverse judgements against JCI. Whilst well-established incidence 
curves can be used to estimate the likely future pattern of asbestos-related disease, JCI’s claims 
experience is significantly impacted by other factors which influence the US litigation 
environment. These can include: changing approaches on the part of the plaintiffs’ bar; changing 
attitudes amongst the judiciary at both trial and appellate levels; and legislative and procedural 
changes in both the state and federal court systems. Because of the significant uncertainty 
associated with the future level of asbestos claims and of the costs arising out of the related 
litigation, there can be no guarantee that the assumptions used to estimate the provision will 
result in an accurate prediction of the actual costs that will be incurred. 

The key sources of estimation uncertainty together with the significant judgements and 
assumptions used for these consolidated financial statements are set out below.

In quantifying the expected costs JCI takes account of the advice of an expert in asbestos liability 
estimation. The following estimates were made in preparing the provision calculation: 

SOURCES OF ESTIMATION UNCERTAINTY
IMPAIRMENT REVIEWS OF INTANGIBLE ASSETS
In carrying out impairment reviews of intangible assets, a number of significant assumptions have to 
be made when preparing cash-flow projections to determine the value in use of the asset or cash 
generating unit (CGU). These include the future rate of market growth, discount rates, the market 
demand for the products acquired, the future profitability of acquired businesses or products, 
levels of reimbursement, and success in obtaining regulatory approvals. If actual results differ or 
changes in expectations arise, impairment charges may be required which would adversely impact 
operating results.

Critical estimates, and the effect of variances in these estimates, are disclosed in note 11.

 – The period over which the expenditure can be reliably estimated is judged to be ten years, 
based on past experience regarding significant changes in the litigation environment that 
have occurred every few years and on the amount of time taken in the past for some of those 
changes to impact the broader asbestos litigation environment. See note 23 for a sensitivity 
analysis showing the impact on the provision of reducing or increasing this time horizon; and

 – The future trend of legal costs, the rate of future claims filed, the rate of successful resolution 
of claims, and the average amount of judgements awarded have been projected based on the 
past history of JCI claims and well-established tables of asbestos incidence projections, since 
this is the best available evidence. Claims history from other defendants is not used to calculate

the provision because JCI’s defence strategy generates a significantly different pattern of legal 
costs and settlement expenses. See note 23 for a sensitivity analysis showing the range of 
expected future spend. 

Titeflex Corporation, a subsidiary of the Group in the Flex-Tek division, has received a number of 
claims from insurance companies seeking recompense on a subrogated basis for the effects of 
damage allegedly caused by lightning strikes in relation to its flexible gas piping product. It has 
also received a number of product liability claims regarding this product, some in the form of 
purported class actions. Titeflex Corporation believes that its products are a safe and effective 
means of delivering gas when installed in accordance with the manufacturer’s instructions and 
local and national codes; however, some claims have been settled on an individual basis without 
admission of liability. Provision of £41m (FY2022: £52m) has been made for the costs which the 
Group is expected to incur in respect of these claims. In preparing the provision calculation, key 
estimates have been made about the impact of safe installation initiatives on the level of future 
claims. See note 23 for a sensitivity analysis showing the impact on the provision of reducing or 
increasing the expected impact. However, because of the significant uncertainty associated with 
the future level of claims, there can be no guarantee that the assumptions used to estimate the 
provision will result in an accurate prediction of the actual costs that may be incurred. 

TAXATION
The Group has recognised deferred tax assets of £75m (FY2022: £103m) relating to losses and 
£60m (FY2022: £69m) relating to the John Crane, Inc. and Titeflex Corporation litigation 
provisions. The recognition of assets pertaining to these items requires management to make 
significant estimates as to the likelihood of realisation of these deferred tax assets and the 
phasing and attribution of future taxable profits. This is based on a number of factors, which 
management use to assess the expectation that the benefit of these assets will be realised, 
including expected future levels of operating profit, expenditure on litigation, pension 
contributions and the timing of the unwind of other tax positions.

Taxation liabilities included provisions of £46m (FY2022: £38m), the majority of which related to 
the risk of challenge to the geographic allocation of profits by tax authorities.

In addition to the risks provided for, the Group faces a variety of other tax risks, which result from 
operating in a complex global environment, including the ongoing reform of both international and 
domestic tax rules, new and ongoing tax audits in the Group’s larger markets and the challenge to 
fulfil ongoing tax compliance filing and transfer pricing obligations given the scale and diversity of 
the Group’s global operations.

The Group anticipates that a number of tax audits are likely to conclude in the next 12 to 24 
months. Due to the uncertainty associated with such tax items, it is possible that the conclusion 
of open tax matters may result in a final outcome that varies significantly from the amounts 
noted above.

REVENUE RECOGNITION
Revenue is recognised as the performance obligations to deliver products or services are satisfied 
and revenue is recorded based on the amount of consideration expected to be received in exchange 
for satisfying the performance obligations. 

Smiths Detection and Smiths Interconnect have multi-year contractual arrangements for the sale 
of goods and services. Where these contracts have separately identifiable components with distinct 
patterns of delivery and customer acceptance, revenue is accounted for separately for each 
identifiable component.

The Group enters into certain contracts for agreed fees that are performed across more than one 
accounting period and revenue is recognised over time. Estimates are required at the balance sheet 
date when determining the stage of completion of the contract activity. This assessment requires the 
expected total costs of the contract and the remaining costs to complete the contract to be estimated. 

At 31 July 2023, the Group held contracts with a total value of £109m (2022: £181m), of which 
£83m (2022: £135m) had been delivered and £26m (2022: £47m) remains fully or partially 
unsatisfied. £24m of the unsatisfied amount is expected to be recognised in the coming year, with 
the remainder being recognised within two years. A 5% increase in the remaining cost to complete 
the contracts would have reduced Group operating profit in the current year by less than £1m 
(2022: less than £2m).

VALUATION OF FINANCIAL ASSETS
Following the sale of Smiths Medical the Group has recognised a financial asset for the fair value of 
the US$100m additional sales consideration that is contingent on the future share price 
performance of the enlarged ICU Medical, Inc (ICU) business.

The earnout requires the Group to retain beneficial ownership of at least 1.25 million ICU shares and 
for the ICU share price to average US$300 or more for any 30-day period during the first three years 
post-completion, or for any 45-day period in the fourth year post-completion.

An external valuation firm has been engaged to undertake Monte Carlo valuation simulations in 
order to estimate the probability of the future ICU share price exceeding US$300. These valuation 
simulations have determined a fair value of £13m (US$17m).

SIGNIFICANT JUDGEMENTS MADE IN APPLYING ACCOUNTING 
POLICIES 
BUSINESS COMBINATIONS
On the acquisition of a business, the Group has to make judgements on the identification of specific 
intangible assets which are recognised separately from goodwill and then amortised over their 
estimated useful lives. These include items such as brand names and customer lists, to which 
value is first attributed at the time of acquisition. The capitalisation of these assets and the related 
amortisation charges are based on judgements about the value and economic life of such items.

Where acquisitions are significant, appropriate advice is sought from professional advisers before 
making such allocations.

RETIREMENT BENEFITS
At 31 July 2023 the Group has recognised £195m of retirement benefit assets (FY2022: £309m) 
and a net pension asset of £89m (FY2022: £194m), principally relating to the Smiths Industries 
Pension Scheme (SIPS), which arises from the rights of the employers to recover the surplus at 
the end of the life of the scheme. 

PRESENTATION OF HEADLINE PROFITS AND ORGANIC GROWTH
In order to provide users of the accounts with a clear and consistent presentation of the 
performance of the Group’s ongoing trading activity, the income statement is presented in a 
three-column format with ‘headline’ profits shown separately from non-headline items. In 
addition, the Group reports organic growth rates for sales and profit measures. 

The recognition of this surplus is a significant judgement. There is judgement required in 
determining whether an unconditional right of refund exists based on the provisions of the 
relevant Trust deed and rules. Having taken legal advice with regard to the rights of the Group 
under the relevant Trust deed and rules, it has been determined that the surplus is recoverable by 
the Group and therefore can be recognised. In particular, in the ordinary course of business, the 
trustees of the scheme do not have a unilateral power to terminate and wind up the scheme or 
augment benefits. If the pension scheme was wound up while it still had members, the scheme 
would need to buy out the benefits of all members. The buyout would cost significantly more than 
the carrying value of the scheme liabilities within these financial statements which are calculated 
in accordance with IAS 19: Employee benefits.

See note 1 for disclosures of headline operating profit and note 29 for more information about the 
alternative performance measures (‘APMs’) used by the Group.

Judgement is required in determining which items should be included as non-headline. The 
amortisation/impairment of acquired intangibles, legacy liabilities, material one-off items and 
certain re-measurements are included in a separate column of the income statement. See note 3 
for a breakdown of the items excluded from headline profit.

Calculating organic growth also requires judgement. Organic growth adjusts the movement 
in headline performance to exclude the impact of foreign exchange, restructuring costs 
and acquisitions.

CAPITALISATION OF DEVELOPMENT COSTS
Expenditure incurred in the development of major new products is capitalised as internally 
generated intangible assets only when it has been judged that strict criteria are met, specifically 
in relation to the products’ technical feasibility and commercial viability (the ability to generate 
probable future economic benefits). 

The assessment of technical feasibility and future commercial viability of development projects 
requires significant judgement and the use of assumptions. Key judgements made in the 
assessment of future commercial viability include:

 – Scope of work to achieve regulatory clearance (where required) – including the level of testing 

evidence and documentation; 

 – Competitor activity – including the impact of potential competitor product launches on the 

marketplace and customer demand; and

 – Launch timeline – including time and resource required to establish and support the 

commercial launch of a new product.

TAXATION
As stated in the previous section ‘Sources of estimation uncertainty’, the Group has recognised 
deferred tax assets of £75m (FY2022: £103m) relating to losses and £60m (FY2022: £69m) relating 
to the John Crane, Inc. and Titeflex Corporation litigation provisions. The decision to recognise 
deferred tax assets requires judgement in determining whether the Group will be able to utilise 
historical tax losses in future periods. It has been concluded that there are sufficient taxable 
profits in future periods to support recognition. 

The Group has also applied judgement in the decisions made to recognise provisions against 
uncertain tax positions; please see note 6 for further details.

SIGNIFICANT ACCOUNTING POLICIES
BASIS OF CONSOLIDATION
The Group’s consolidated accounts include the financial statements of Smiths Group plc (the 
‘Company’) and all entities controlled by the Company (its subsidiaries). A list of the subsidiaries 
of Smiths Group plc is provided on pages 205 to 210.

The Company controls an entity when it (i) has power over the entity; (ii) is exposed or has rights to 
variable returns from its involvement with the entity; and (iii) has the ability to affect those returns 
through its power over the entity. The Group reassesses whether or not it controls a subsidiary if 
facts and circumstances indicate that there are changes to one or more of these three elements 
of control. Subsidiaries are fully consolidated from the date on which control is obtained by the 
Company to the date that control ceases. 

Where the Group loses control of a subsidiary, the assets and liabilities are derecognised along 
with any related non-controlling interest and other components of equity. Any resulting gain or 
loss is recognised in the income statement. Any interest retained in the former subsidiary is 
measured at fair value when control is lost.

The non-controlling interests in the Group balance sheet represent the share of net assets of 
subsidiary undertakings held outside the Group. The movement in the year comprises the profit 
attributable to such interests together with any dividends paid, movements in respect of corporate 
transactions and related exchange differences.

Interests in associates are accounted for using the equity method. They are initially recognised at 
cost, which includes transaction costs. Subsequent to initial recognition, the Group financial 
statements include the Group’s share of the profit or loss and other comprehensive income of 
equity-accounted investees, until the date on which significant influence ceases.

All intercompany transactions, balances, and gains and losses on transactions between Group 
companies are eliminated on consolidation.

SMITHS GROUP PLC ANNUAL REPORT FY2023OVERVIEWSTRATEGIC REPORTGOVERNANCEFINANCIAL STATEMENTS138

ACCOUNTING POLICIES

CONTINUED

FOREIGN CURRENCIES
The Company’s presentational currency and functional currency is sterling. The financial position 
of all subsidiaries and associates that have a functional currency different from sterling are 
translated into sterling at the rate of exchange at the date of that balance sheet, and the income 
and expenses are translated at average exchange rates for the period. All resulting foreign 
exchange rate movements are recognised as a separate component of equity.

Foreign exchange rate movements arising on the translation of non-monetary assets and 
liabilities held in hyperinflationary subsidiaries are recognised in OCI. The amounts taken to the 
CTA reserve represent the combined effect of restatement and translation and are expressed as 
a net change for the year.

On consolidation, foreign exchange rate movements arising from the translation of the net 
investment in foreign entities, and of borrowings and other currency instruments designated as 
hedges of such investments, are taken to shareholders’ equity. When a foreign operation is sold, 
the cumulative amount of such foreign exchange rate movements is recognised in the income 
statement as part of the gain or loss on sale.

Foreign exchange rate movements arising on transactions are recognised in the income 
statement. Those arising on trading are taken to operating profit; those arising on borrowings are 
classified as finance income or cost. 

REVENUE
Revenue is measured at the fair value of the consideration received, net of trade discounts 
(including distributor rebates) and sales taxes. Revenue is discounted only where the impact of 
discounting is material. 

When the Group enters into complex contracts with multiple, separately identifiable components, 
the terms of the contract are reviewed to determine whether or not the elements of the contract 
should be accounted for separately. If a contract is being split into multiple components, the 
contract revenue is allocated to the different components at the start of the contract. The basis of 
allocation depends on the substance of the contract. The Group considers relative stand-alone 
selling prices, contractual prices and relative cost when allocating revenue. 

The Group has identified the following different types of revenue:

(i) Sale of goods recognised at a point in time – generic products manufactured by Smiths 
Generic products are defined as either:

 – Products that are not specific to any particular customer; 

 – Products that may initially be specific to a customer but can be reconfigured at minimal cost, 

i.e., retaining a margin, for sale to an alternative customer; or

 – Products that are specific to a customer but are manufactured at Smiths risk, i.e., we have no 
right to payment of costs plus margin if the customer refuses to take control of the goods.

For established products with simple installation requirements, revenue is recognised when 
control of the product is passed to the customer. The point in time that control passes is defined in 
accordance with the agreed shipping terms and is determined on a case-by-case basis. The time 
of dispatch or delivery of the goods to the customer is normally the point at which invoicing 

occurs. However for some generic products, revenue is recognised when the overall 
performance obligation has been completed, which is often after the customer has completed its 
acceptance procedures and has assumed control.

Products that are sold under multiple element arrangements, i.e., contracts involving a 
combination of products and services, are bundled into a single performance obligation 
unless the customer can benefit from the goods or services either on their own, or together with 
other resources that are readily available to the customer and are distinct within the context of 
the contract.

For contracts that pass control of the product to the customer only on completion of installation 
services, revenue is recognised upon completion of the installation.

An obligation to replace or repair faulty products under the standard warranty terms is 
recognised as a provision. If the contract includes terms that either extend the warranty beyond 
the standard term or imply that maintenance is provided to keep the product working, these are 
service warranties and revenue is deferred to cover the performance obligation in an amount 
equivalent to the stand-alone selling price of that service.

(ii) Sale of goods recognised over time – customer-specific products where the contractual 
terms include rights to payment for work performed to date
Customer-specific products are defined as being:

 – Products that cannot be reconfigured economically such that it remains profitable to sell to 

another customer;

 – Products that cannot be sold to another customer due to contractual restrictions; and

 – Products that allow Smiths to charge for the work performed to date in an amount that 

represents the costs incurred to date plus a margin, should the customer refuse to take control 
of the goods.

For contracts that meet the terms listed above, revenue is recognised over the period that the 
Group is engaged in the manufacture of the product, calculated using the input method based on 
the amount of costs incurred to date compared to the overall costs of the contract. This is 
considered to be a faithful depiction of the transfer of the goods to the customer as the costs 
incurred, total expected costs and total order value are known. The time of dispatch or delivery of 
the goods to the customer is normally the point at which invoicing occurs.

An obligation to provide a refund for faulty products under the standard warranty terms is 
recognised as a provision. If the contract includes terms that either extend the warranty beyond 
the standard term or imply that maintenance is provided to keep the product working, these are 
service warranties and revenue is deferred to cover the performance obligation in an amount 
equivalent to the stand-alone selling price of that service.

(iii) Services recognised over time – services relating to the installation, repair and ongoing 
maintenance of equipment
Services include installation, commissioning, testing, training, software hosting and 
maintenance, product repairs and contracts undertaking extended warranty services.

SMITHS GROUP PLC ANNUAL REPORT FY2023OVERVIEWSTRATEGIC REPORTGOVERNANCEFINANCIAL STATEMENTSACCOUNTING POLICIES

CONTINUED

139

For complex installations where the supply of services cannot be separated from the supply of 
product, revenue is recognised upon acceptance of the combined performance obligation (see 
Sale of goods (i) above). 

For services that can be accounted for as a separate performance obligation, revenue is 
recognised over time, assessed on the basis of the actual service provided as a proportion of the 
total services to be provided.

Depending on the nature of the contract, revenue is recognised as follows:

 – Installation, commissioning and testing services (when neither linked to the supply of product 

nor subject to acceptance) are recognised rateably as the services are provided;

 – Training services are recognised on completion of the training course; 

 – Software hosting and maintenance services are recognised rateably over the life of the 

contract;

 – Product repair services, where the product is returned to Smiths premises for remedial action, 
are recognised when the product is returned to the customer and they regain control of the 
asset;

 – Onsite ad hoc product repair services are recognised rateably as the services are performed;

 – Long-term product repair and maintenance contracts are recognised rateably over the 

contract term; and

 – Extended service warranties are recognised rateably over the contract term.

Invoicing for services depends on the nature of the service provided with some services charged 
in advance and others in arrears.

Where contracts are accounted for under the revenue recognised over time basis, the proportion 
of costs incurred is used to determine the percentage of contract completion.

Contracts for the construction of substantial assets, which normally last in excess of one year, are 
accounted for under the revenue recognised over time basis, using an input method.

For fixed-price contracts, revenue is recognised based upon an assessment of the amount of cost 
incurred under the contract, compared to the total expected costs that will be incurred under the 
contract. This calculation is applied cumulatively with any over/under recognition being adjusted 
in the current period.

For cost-plus contracts, revenue is recognised based upon costs incurred to date plus any 
agreed margin. 

For both fixed-price and cost-plus contracts, invoicing is normally based on a schedule with 
milestone payments.

CONTRACT COSTS
The Group has taken the practical expedient of not capitalising contract costs as they are 
expected to be expensed within one year from the date of signing. 

LEASES
Lease liabilities are initially measured at the present value of the future lease payments at the 
commencement date, discounted by using either the rate implicit in the lease, or if not observable, 
the Group’s incremental borrowing rate. Lease payments comprise contractual lease payments; 
variable lease payments that depend on an index or rate, initially measured using the index or rate 
at the commencement date; and the amount expected to be payable under residual value 
guarantees. 

Right of use assets are measured at commencement date at the amount of the corresponding 
lease liability and initial direct costs incurred. Right of use assets are depreciated over the shorter 
of the lease term and the useful life of the right of use assets, unless there is a transfer of 
ownership or purchase option which is reasonably certain to be exercised at the end of the lease 
term, in which case depreciation is charged over the useful life of the underlying asset. Right of 
use assets are subject to impairment.

When a lease contract is modified, either from a change to the duration of the lease or a change to 
amounts payable, the Group remeasures the lease liability by discounting the revised future lease 
payments at a revised discount rate. A corresponding adjustment is made to the carrying value of 
the related right of use asset.

Leases of buildings typically have lease terms between one and seven years, while plant and 
machinery generally have lease terms between one and three years. The Group also has certain 
leases of machinery with lease terms of 12 months or less and leases of office equipment with 
low value (typically below £5,000). The Group applies the ‘short-term lease’ and ‘lease of low-
value assets’ recognition exemptions for these leases and recognises the lease payments 
associated with these leases as an expense on a straight-line basis over the lease term.

Interest on lease liabilities is presented as a financing activity in the Consolidated Cash-Flow 
Statement, included under the heading lease payments.

TAXATION
The charge for taxation is based on profits for the year and takes into account taxation deferred 
because of temporary differences between the treatment of certain items for taxation and 
accounting purposes. 

Current income tax assets and liabilities are measured at the amount expected to be recovered 
from or paid to taxation authorities. Tax benefits are not recognised unless it is likely that the tax 
positions are sustainable. Tax positions taken are then reviewed to assess whether a provision 
should be made based on prevailing circumstances. Tax provisions are included in current tax 
liabilities. The tax rates and tax laws used to compute the amount are those that are enacted or 
substantively enacted, at the reporting date in the countries where the Group operates and 
generates taxable income.

The Group operates and is subject to taxation in many countries. Tax legislation is different in each 
country, is often complex and is subject to interpretation by management and government 
authorities. These matters of judgement give rise to the need to create provisions for uncertain 
tax positions which are recognised when it is considered more likely than not that there will be a 
future outflow of funds to a taxing authority. Provisions are made against individual exposures

and take into account the specific circumstances of each case, including the strength of technical 
arguments, recent case law decisions or rulings on similar issues and relevant external advice.

The amounts are measured using one of the following methods, depending on which of the 
methods the Directors expect will better reflect the amount the Group will pay to the tax authority:

Pension obligations and post-retirement benefits
Pensions and similar benefits (principally healthcare) are accounted for under IAS 19. The 
retirement benefit obligation in respect of the defined benefit plans is the liability (the present 
value of all expected future obligations) less the fair value of the plan assets. 

 – The single best estimate method is used where there is a single outcome that is more likely 

than not to occur. This will happen, for example, where the tax outcome is binary or the range of 
possible outcomes is very limited; or

 – Alternatively, a probability weighted expected value is used where, on the balance of 

probabilities, there will be a payment to the tax authority but there are a number of possible 
outcomes. In this case, a probability is assigned to each of the outcomes and the amount 
provided is the sum of these risk-weighted amounts. In assessing provisions against uncertain 
tax positions, management uses in-house tax experts, professional firms and previous 
experience of the taxing authority to evaluate the risk. 

Deferred tax is provided in full using the balance sheet liability method. A deferred tax asset is 
recognised where it is probable that future taxable income will be sufficient to utilise the available 
relief. Tax is charged or credited to the income statement except when it relates to items charged 
or credited directly to equity, in which case the tax is also dealt with in equity.

Deferred tax is provided on temporary differences arising on investments in subsidiaries and 
associates, except where the timing of the reversal of the temporary differences is controlled by 
the Company and it is probable that the temporary difference will not reverse in the foreseeable 
future. Deferred tax liabilities and assets are not discounted. 

IAS 12 International Tax Reform: Pillar Two Model Rules.
On 19th July 2023, the UK Endorsement Board adopted the Amendments to IAS 12 International 
Tax Reform: Pillar Two Model Rules, issued by the IASB in May 2023. The Amendments introduce 
a temporary mandatory exception from accounting for deferred taxes arising from the Pillar Two 
model rules and the Group has applied this exception to recognising and disclosing information 
about deferred tax assets and liabilities related to Pillar Two income taxes.

EMPLOYEE BENEFITS 
Share-based compensation
The fair value of the shares or share options granted is recognised as an expense over the vesting 
period to reflect the value of the employee services received. The fair value of options granted, 
excluding the impact of any non-market vesting conditions, is calculated using established option 
pricing models, principally binomial models. The probability of meeting non-market vesting 
conditions, which include profitability targets, is used to estimate the number of share options 
which are likely to vest. 

For cash-settled share-based payment, a liability is recognised based on the fair value of the 
payment earned by the balance sheet date. For equity-settled share-based payment, the 
corresponding credit is recognised directly in reserves.

The income statement expense is allocated between current service costs, reflecting the 
increase in liability due to any benefit accrued by employees in the current period, any past 
service costs/credits and settlement losses or gains which are recognised immediately, and the 
scheme administration costs.

Actuarial gains and losses are recognised in the statement of comprehensive income in the year 
in which they arise. These comprise the impact on the liabilities of changes in demographic and 
financial assumptions compared with the start of the year, actual experience being different to 
assumptions and the return on plan assets being above or below the amount included in the net 
pension interest cost.

Payments to defined contribution schemes are charged as an income statement expense as they 
fall due.

INTANGIBLE ASSETS
Goodwill
Goodwill represents the excess of the cost of an acquisition over the fair value of the Group’s 
share of the identifiable net assets of the acquired subsidiary at the date of acquisition.

The goodwill arising from acquisitions of subsidiaries after 1 August 1998 is included in intangible 
assets, tested annually for impairment and carried at cost less accumulated impairment losses. 
Gains and losses on the disposal of an entity include the carrying amount of goodwill relating to 
the entity sold. The goodwill arising from acquisitions of subsidiaries before 1 August 1998 was 
set against reserves in the year of acquisition.

Goodwill is tested for impairment at least annually. Should the test indicate that the net realisable 
value of the CGU is less than current carrying value, an impairment loss will be recognised 
immediately in the income statement. Subsequent reversals of impairment losses for goodwill 
are not recognised.

Research and development
Expenditure on research and development is charged to the income statement in the year in 
which it is incurred with the exception of:

 – Amounts recoverable from third parties; and

 – Expenditure incurred in respect of the development of major new products where the outcome 
of those projects is assessed as being reasonably certain as regards viability and technical 
feasibility. Such expenditure is capitalised and amortised over the estimated period of sale 
for each product, commencing in the year that the product is ready for sale. Amortisation is 
charged straight line or based on the units produced, depending on the nature of the product 
and the availability of reliable estimates of production volumes.

The cost of development projects which are expected to take a substantial period of time to 
complete includes attributable borrowing costs.

Intangible assets acquired in business combinations
The identifiable net assets acquired as a result of a business combination may include intangible 
assets other than goodwill. Any such intangible assets are amortised straight line over their 
expected useful lives as follows:

Patents, licences and trademarks
Technology
Customer relationships

up to 20 years
up to 13 years
up to 15 years

The assets’ useful lives are reviewed, and adjusted if appropriate, at each balance sheet date.

Software, patents and intellectual property
The estimated useful lives are as follows:

Software

Patents and intellectual property

up to seven years
shorter of the economic life and the period the right is 
legally enforceable

The assets’ useful lives are reviewed, and adjusted if appropriate, at each balance sheet date.

PROPERTY, PLANT AND EQUIPMENT
Property, plant and equipment are stated at historical cost less accumulated depreciation and 
any recognised impairment losses. 

Land is not depreciated. Depreciation is provided on other assets estimated to write off the 
depreciable amount of relevant assets by equal annual instalments over their estimated useful 
lives. In general, the rates used are: 

Freehold and long leasehold buildings
Short leasehold property
Plant, machinery, etc.
Fixtures, fittings, tools and other equipment

2% per annum
over the period of the lease
10% to 20% per annum
10% to 33% per annum

The cost of any assets which are expected to take a substantial period of time to complete 
includes attributable borrowing costs. 

The assets’ residual values and useful lives are reviewed, and adjusted if appropriate, at each 
balance sheet date. An asset’s carrying amount is written down immediately to its recoverable 
amount if the asset’s carrying amount is greater than its estimated recoverable amount.

INVENTORIES
Inventories are stated at the lower of cost and net realisable value. Cost is determined using the 
first-in, first-out method. The cost of finished goods and work in progress comprises raw 
materials, direct labour, other direct costs and related production overheads (based on normal 
operating capacity). The cost of items of inventory which take a substantial period of time to 
complete includes attributable borrowing costs. 

The net realisable value of inventories is the estimated selling price in the ordinary course of 
business, less applicable variable selling expenses. Provisions are made for any slow-moving, 
obsolete or defective inventories.

TRADE AND OTHER RECEIVABLES
Trade receivables and contract assets are either classified as ‘held to collect’ and initially 
recognised at fair value and subsequently measured at amortised cost, less any appropriate 
provision for expected credit losses or as ‘held to collect and sell’ and measured at fair value 
through other comprehensive income (FVOCI).

A provision for expected credit losses is established when there is objective evidence that it will 
not be possible to collect all amounts due according to the original payment terms. Expected 
credit losses are determined using historical write-offs as a basis, adjusted for factors that are 
specific to the debtor, general economic conditions of the industry in which the debtor operates 
and with a default risk multiplier applied to reflect country risk premium. The Group applies the 
IFRS 9 simplified lifetime expected credit loss approach for trade receivables and contract assets 
which do not contain a significant financing component

PROVISIONS
Provisions are recognised when the Group has a present obligation (legal or constructive) as a 
result of a past event, it is probable that an outflow of resources embodying economic benefits 
will be required to settle the obligation, and a reliable estimate can be made of the amount of the 
obligation. Where the Group expects some or all of a provision to be reimbursed, for example 
under an insurance contract, the reimbursement is recognised as a separate asset but only when 
the reimbursement is virtually certain. 

Provisions for warranties and product liability, disposal indemnities, restructuring costs, property 
dilapidations and legal claims are recognised when: the Company has a legal or constructive 
obligation as a result of a past event; it is probable that an outflow of resources will be required to 
settle the obligation; and the amount has been reliably estimated. Provisions are not recognised 
for future operating losses.

Provisions are discounted where the time value of money is material.

Where there is a number of similar obligations, for example where a warranty has been given, the 
likelihood that an outflow will be required in settlement is determined by considering the class of 
obligations as a whole. A provision is recognised even if the likelihood of an outflow with respect 
to any one item included in the same class of obligations may be small.

DISCONTINUED OPERATIONS
A discontinued operation is either: 

 – A component of the Group’s business that represents a separate major line of business or 

geographical area of operations that has been disposed of, has been abandoned or meets the 
criteria to be classified as held for sale; or 

 – A business acquired solely for the purpose of selling it.

SMITHS GROUP PLC ANNUAL REPORT FY2023OVERVIEWSTRATEGIC REPORTGOVERNANCEFINANCIAL STATEMENTS142

ACCOUNTING POLICIES

CONTINUED

Discontinued operations are presented on the income statement as a separate line and are 
shown net of tax.

Financial assets are classified as current if they are expected to be realised within 12 months of 
the balance sheet date.

In accordance with IAS 21, gains and losses on intra-group monetary assets and liabilities are not 
eliminated. Therefore foreign exchange rate movements on intercompany loans with discontinued 
operations are presented on the income statement as non-headline finance cost items.

CASH AND CASH EQUIVALENTS
Cash and cash equivalents include cash at bank and in hand and highly liquid interest-bearing 
securities with maturities of three months or less.

In the cash-flow statement, cash and cash equivalents are shown net of bank overdrafts, which 
are included as current borrowings in liabilities on the balance sheet. 

FINANCIAL ASSETS
The classification of financial assets depends on the purpose for which the assets were acquired. 
Management determines the classification of an asset at initial recognition and re-evaluates the 
designation at each reporting date. Financial assets are classified as: measured at amortised 
cost, fair value through other comprehensive income or fair value through profit and loss.

Financial assets primarily include trade receivables, cash and cash equivalents (comprising cash 
at bank, money-market funds, and short-term deposits), short-term investments, derivatives 
(foreign exchange contracts and interest rate derivatives) and unlisted investments.

 – Trade receivables are classified either as ‘held to collect’ and measured at amortised cost or 
as ‘held to collect and sell’ and measured at fair value through other comprehensive income 
(FVOCI). The Group may sell trade receivables due from certain customers before the due date. 
Any trade receivables from such customers that are not sold at the reporting date are classified 
as ‘held to collect and sell’.

 – Cash and cash equivalents (consisting of balances with banks and other financial institutions, 
money-market funds and short-term deposits) and short-term investments are subject to low 
market risk. Cash balances, short-term deposits and short-term investments are measured at 
amortised cost. Money market funds are measured at fair value through profit and loss (FVPL).

 – Derivatives are measured at FVPL.

 – Listed and unlisted investments are measured at FVOCI.

 – Deferred contingent consideration are measured at FVPL.

Financial assets are derecognised when the right to receive cash-flows from the assets has 
expired, or has been transferred, and the Group has transferred substantially all of the risks and 
rewards of ownership. 

On initial recognition, the Group may make an irrevocable election to designate certain 
investments as FVOCI, if they are not held for trading or relate to contingent consideration on a 
business combination. When securities measured at FVOCI are sold or impaired, the 
accumulated fair value adjustments remain in reserves. 

FINANCIAL LIABILITIES
Borrowings are initially recognised at the fair value of the proceeds, net of related transaction 
costs. These transaction costs, and any discount or premium on issue, are subsequently 
amortised under the effective interest rate method through the income statement as interest over 
the life of the loan and added to the liability disclosed in the balance sheet. Related accrued 
interest is included in the borrowings figure.

Borrowings are classified as current liabilities unless the Group has an unconditional right to 
defer settlement of the liability for at least one year after the balance sheet date.

DERIVATIVE FINANCIAL INSTRUMENTS AND HEDGING ACTIVITIES 
The Group uses derivative financial instruments to hedge its exposures to foreign exchange and 
interest rates arising from its operating and financing activities.

Derivative financial instruments are initially recognised at fair value on the date a derivative 
contract is entered into and are subsequently re-measured at their fair value. The method of 
recognising any resulting gain or loss depends on whether the derivative financial instrument is 
designated as a hedging instrument and, if so, the nature of the item being hedged.

Where derivative financial instruments are designated into hedging relationships, the Group 
formally documents the following:

 – The risk management objective and strategy for entering the hedge;

 – The nature of the risks being hedged and the economic relationship between the hedged item 

and the hedging instrument; and

 – Whether the change in cash-flows of the hedged item and hedging instrument are expected to 

offset each other.

Changes in the fair value of any derivative financial instruments that do not qualify for hedge 
accounting are recognised immediately in the income statement.

Fair value hedge
The Group uses derivative financial instruments to convert part of its fixed rate debt to floating 
rate in order to hedge the risks arising from its external borrowings. 

The Group designates these as fair value hedges of interest rate risk. Changes in the hedging 
instrument are recorded in the income statement, together with any changes in the fair values of 
the hedged assets or liabilities that are attributable to the hedged risk to the extent that the hedge 
is effective. Gains or losses relating to any ineffectiveness are immediately recognised in the 
income statement.

NEW ACCOUNTING STANDARDS EFFECTIVE 2023
No new accounting standards have been adopted in the financial year. The accounting policies 
adopted in the preparation of these consolidated financial statements are consistent with those 
followed in the previous financial year.

NEW STANDARDS AND INTERPRETATIONS NOT YET ADOPTED
No other new standards, new interpretations or amendments to standards or interpretations have 
been published which are expected to have a significant impact on the Group’s financial 
statements.

PARENT COMPANY
The ultimate Parent Company of the Group is Smiths Group plc, a company incorporated in 
England and Wales and listed on the London Stock Exchange.

The accounts of the Parent Company, Smiths Group plc, have been prepared in accordance with 
the Companies Act 2006 and Financial Reporting Standard 101, ‘Reduced Disclosure Framework’.

The Company accounts are presented in separate financial statements on pages 197 to 204. The 
principal subsidiaries of the Parent Company are listed in the above accounts.

Cash-flow hedge
Cash-flow hedging is used by the Group to hedge certain exposures to variability in future cash-flows. 

The effective portions of changes in the fair values of derivatives that are designated and qualify as 
cash-flow hedges are recognised in equity. The gain or loss relating to any ineffective portion is 
recognised immediately in the income statement. Amounts accumulated in the hedge reserve are 
recycled in the income statement in the periods when the hedged items will affect profit or loss (for 
example, when the forecast sale that is hedged takes place). 

If a forecast transaction that is hedged results in the recognition of a non-financial asset (for 
example, inventory) or a liability, the gains and losses previously deferred in the hedge reserve are 
transferred from the reserve and included in the initial measurement of the cost of the asset or 
liability. When a hedging instrument expires or is sold, or when a hedge no longer meets the criteria 
for hedge accounting, any cumulative gain or loss existing in the hedge reserve at that time remains 
in the reserve and is recognised when the forecast transaction is ultimately recognised in the 
income statement.

When a forecast transaction is no longer expected to occur, the cumulative gain or loss that was 
reported in other comprehensive income is immediately transferred to the income statement.

Net investment hedge
Hedges of net investments in foreign operations are accounted for similarly to cash-flow hedges. 
Any gain or loss on the hedging instrument relating to the effective portion of the hedge is 
recognised in other comprehensive income; the gain or loss relating to any ineffective portion is 
recognised immediately in the income statement. When a foreign operation is disposed of, gains 
and losses accumulated in equity related to that operation are included in the income statement 
for that period.

FAIR VALUE OF FINANCIAL ASSETS AND LIABILITIES
The fair values of financial assets and financial liabilities are the amounts at which the instrument 
could be exchanged in a current transaction between willing parties, other than in a forced or 
liquidation sale. 

IFRS 13: ‘Fair value measurement’ requires fair value measurements to be classified according to 
the following hierarchy:

 – Level 1 – quoted prices in active markets for identical assets or liabilities;

 – Level 2 – valuations in which all inputs are observable either directly (i.e., as prices) or indirectly 

(i.e., derived from prices); and

 – Level 3 – valuations in which one or more inputs that are significant to the resulting value are 

not based on observable market data.

See note 21 for information on the methods which the Group uses to estimate the fair values of its 
financial instruments. 

DIVIDENDS
Dividends are recognised as a liability in the period in which they are authorised. The interim 
dividend is recognised when it is paid and the final dividend is recognised when it has been 
approved by shareholders at the Annual General Meeting.

1. SEGMENT INFORMATION
ANALYSIS BY OPERATING SEGMENT
The Group is organised into four divisions: John Crane; Smiths Detection; Flex-Tek; and Smiths 
Interconnect. These divisions design, manufacture and support the following products: 

 – John Crane – mechanical seals, seal support systems, power transmission couplings and 

specialised filtration systems; 

 – Smiths Detection – sensors and systems that detect and identify explosives, narcotics, 

weapons, chemical agents, biohazards and contraband; 

 – Flex-Tek – engineered components, flexible hosing and rigid tubing that heat and move fluids 

and gases; and

 – Smiths Interconnect – specialised electronic and radio frequency board-level and waveguide 

devices, connectors, cables, test sockets and sub-systems used in high-speed, high-reliability, 
secure connectivity applications.

The position and performance of each division are reported at each Board meeting to the Board of 
Directors. This information is prepared using the same accounting policies as the consolidated 
financial information except that the Group uses headline operating profit to monitor the divisional 
results and operating assets to monitor the divisional position. See note 3 and note 29 for an 
explanation of which items are excluded from headline measures. 

Intersegment sales and transfers are charged at arm’s length prices.

3. NON-STATUTORY PROFIT MEASURES
HEADLINE PROFIT MEASURES
The Group has identified and defined a ‘headline’ measure of performance which is not impacted 
by material non-recurring items or items considered non-operational/trading in nature. This non-
GAAP measure of profit is not intended to be a substitute for any IFRS measures of performance, 
but is a key measure used by management to understand and manage performance. See the 
disclosures on presentation of results in accounting policies for an explanation of the 
adjustments. The items excluded from ‘headline’ are referred to as ‘non-headline’ items.

NON-HEADLINE OPERATING PROFIT ITEMS
I. CONTINUING OPERATIONS
The non-headline items included in statutory operating profit for continuing operations were 
as follows:

Post-acquisition integration costs and fair value adjustment unwind
Following the sale of Smiths Medical to ICU Medical, Inc. (ICU) in FY2022, the Group holds a 
financial asset for the fair value of US$100m additional sales consideration that is contingent on 
the future share price performance of ICU. In FY2023 a fair value loss of £6m has been 
recognised on this financial asset. This is considered to be a non-headline item on the basis that 
these charges result from acquisition accounting and do not relate to current trading activity. 

The impact of unwinding the acquisition balance sheet fair value adjustments required by IFRS 3 
‘Business combinations’ has been recognised as non-headline as the charges do not relate to 
trading activity. The £2m charged in the prior period was due to the unwind of fair value uplifts on 
the acquisition of Royal Metal Products.

OVERVIEWSTRATEGIC REPORTGOVERNANCEFINANCIAL STATEMENTSNOTES TO THE ACCOUNTSCONTINUEDSMITHS GROUP PLC ANNUAL REPORT FY2023149

Acquisition and disposal related transaction costs and provision releases
The £1m (FY2022: £5m) business acquisition/disposal costs represented incremental transaction 
costs including the acquisition of Plastronics in FY2023. These costs did not include the cost of 
employees working on transactions and were reported as non-headline because they are 
dependent on the level of acquisition and disposal activity in the year. 

Legacy pension scheme arrangements
The past service credit/(costs) comprises the following:

 – A net credit of £4m (FY2022: £19m debit) has been recognised in respect of equalisation 

charges of retirement benefits for men and women. The net credit comprises a further liability 
of £12m and the release of £16m, recognised in previous years, following the identification of 
additional evidence of the obligation for equalisation (see note 8 for further details); and 
 – In the prior year £24m of costs were recognised following the TI Group Pension Scheme 

(TIGPS) executing an insurance buy-in policy. 

These past service credits/(costs) are reported as non-headline as they are non-recurring and 
relate to legacy pension liabilities.

Scheme administration costs of £2m (FY2022: £nil) relate to the TIGPS legacy pension scheme. 
As the Group has no expectation of receiving a refund from the scheme, an economic benefit 
value of zero has been placed on the TIGPS surplus. These are non-headline charges as the 
Smiths Group effectively has no economic exposure to these costs and they are paid from cash 
retained in the scheme.

Settlement losses of £1m (31 July 2022: £171m) on post-retirement benefit schemes relate to 
settlement arrangements made between the Group and former employees of the now disposed 
of Medical business. The prior year losses arose primarily on the buy-in of the TIGPS scheme. 
These items are considered non-headline as they are non-recurring and relate to legacy 
pension schemes.

Non-headline litigation provision movements
The following litigation costs and recoveries have been treated as non-headline items because 
the provisions were treated as non-headline when originally recognised and the subrogation 
claims and litigation relate to products that the Group no longer sells in these markets:

 – The £7m credit (FY2022: £2m charge) recognised by Titeflex Corporation was principally driven 
by discount rate movements and a reduction in the expected costs to settle future claims. See 
note 23 for further details; and

 – The £16m charge (FY2022: £7m) in respect of John Crane, Inc. asbestos litigation is principally 

due to litigation costs of £31m offset by £15m of discount rate movements following an increase 
in US treasury bond yields. See note 23 for further details; and

 – In FY23 £7m (FY2022: £nil) of asbestos litigation costs were recovered by John Crane, Inc. via 

insurer settlements.

Other items
Acquisition related intangible asset amortisation costs of £52m (FY2022: £51m) were recognised 
in the current period. This is considered to be a non-headline item on the basis that these charges 
result from acquisition accounting and do not relate to current trading activity. 

As announced in the FY2022 Annual Report, during FY2023 the Group has completed a 
restructuring project across the Group to better serve our customers, maximise growth 
opportunities and improve efficiency. In FY2023 £36m of non-headline charges have been 
expensed of which £26m has been paid to date, the remainder is forecast to be paid within the 
next 18 months. The restructuring project is a non-headline expense as the costs are material, 
non-recurring and part of a pre-approved programme.

The £2m of irrecoverable VAT (31 July 2022: £nil) relates to a historical VAT classification error. 
This error had resulted in certain intercompany chain export transactions being treated as VAT 
exempt when they should have been initially classified as subject to European VAT. This has been 
treated as non-headline as it relates to six years of past VAT practice and will involve payment and 
recovery of European VAT, which spans FY2023 and FY2024, so may have a material impact on the 
Group’s headline cash conversion metric.

In the prior year a £19m charge has been recognised in relation to Russia impairment charges 
and related closure costs. 

NON-HEADLINE FINANCE COSTS ITEMS
The non-headline items included in finance costs for continuing operations were as follows:

Unwind of discount on provisions
Other finance income – retirement benefits
Interest payable on overdue VAT
Other sundry financing losses
Fair value gain on investment in early stage business
Foreign exchange gain on intercompany loan with 
discontinued operations

Non-headline items in finance costs – continuing 
operations
Continuing operations – non-headline loss before 
taxation

The financing elements of non-headline legacy liabilities, including the £7m (FY2022: £3m) 
unwind of discount on provisions, were excluded from headline finance costs because these 
provisions were originally recognised as non-headline and this treatment has been maintained 
for ongoing costs and credits. 

Other finance income comprises £7m (FY2022: £7m) of financing credits relating to retirement 
benefits. These were excluded from headline finance costs because the ongoing costs and credits 
are a legacy of previous employee pension arrangements. 

OVERVIEWSTRATEGIC REPORTGOVERNANCEFINANCIAL STATEMENTSNOTES TO THE ACCOUNTSCONTINUEDSMITHS GROUP PLC ANNUAL REPORT FY2023150

The £7m of interest payable on overdue VAT (FY2022: £nil) relates to a historic VAT classification 
error. This was excluded from headline finance costs because the underlying issue was 
recognised as non-headline and this treatment has been maintained for ongoing costs 
and credits.

NON-HEADLINE TAXATION (CHARGE)/CREDIT
The non-headline items included in taxation for continuing operations were as follows:

Tax credit on non-headline loss
Increase in unrecognised UK deferred tax asset

Non-headline taxation (charge)/credit– continuing 
operations
Continuing operations – non-headline loss for the year

In the current year the Group has recognised an additional £6m gain on transactions related to 
the sale of Smiths Medical. An £11m credit was released in respect of disposal and restructuring 
provisions, that are no longer required, and an offsetting additional £5m of provisions were 
charged in respect of potential indemnity, litigation and arbitration costs. These items are 
considered to be non-headline as they relate to discontinued former business activities.

In the prior period:

 – Smiths Medical recognised a £33m provision against the costs of the remediation actions 

required to address each of the observations and discussion items contained in the US Food 
and Drug Administration ‘for-cause’ audit findings on the Medfusion product range; and

 – The decision by Smiths Medical to exit its commercial agreement with Ivenix, Inc. triggered an 
indicator of impairment to the carrying value of the Smiths Medical investment in Ivenix, Inc. 
and management impaired the entire £14m value of Smiths Medical’s investment; and

 – The £22m foreign exchange loss on intercompany loan with parent directly offsets the foreign 

exchange gain in continuing operations.

Provisions for tax liabilities amount to £46m (FY2022: £38m) the majority of which relates to the 
risk of challenge from tax authorities to the geographic allocation of profits across the Group. 

In addition to the risks provided for, the Group faces a variety of other tax risks, which result from 
operating in a complex global environment, including the ongoing reform of both international and 
domestic tax rules, new and ongoing tax audits in the Group’s larger markets and the challenge to 
fulfil ongoing tax compliance filing and transfer pricing obligations given the scale and diversity of 
the Group’s global operations.

The Group anticipates that a number of tax audits are likely to conclude in the next 12 to 24 
months for which provisions are recognised based on best estimates and management’s 
judgements concerning the ultimate outcome of the audit. Due to the uncertainty associated with 
such items, it is possible at a future date, on conclusion of open tax matters, the final outcome 
may vary significantly from the amounts noted above.

RECONCILIATION OF THE TAX CHARGE 
The headline tax charge for the year of £121m (FY2022: £104m) represents an effective rate of 
26.0% (FY2022: 27.6%). 

The tax charge on the profit for the year for continuing operations is different from the standard 
rate of corporation tax in the UK, with a rate for FY2023 of 21.0% (FY2022: 19.0%). The differences 
are reconciled as follows:

The table above reconciles the notional taxation charge calculated at the UK tax rate, to the actual 
total tax charge. As a group operating in multiple countries, the actual tax rates applicable to 
profits in those countries are different from the UK tax rate. The impact is shown above as 
different tax rates on non-UK profits and losses. The Group’s worldwide business leads to the 
consideration of a number of important factors which may affect future tax charges, such as: the 
levels and mix of profitability in different jurisdictions; transfer pricing regulations; tax rates 
imposed and tax regime reforms; acquisitions; disposals; restructuring activities; and 
settlements or agreements with tax authorities.

Of the amounts included within ‘Other’, shown in the above table, as at 31 July 2023, amounts 
relating to tax on unremitted earnings were £19m (FY2022: £19m). The aggregate amount of 
temporary differences associated with investments in subsidiaries for which deferred tax 
liabilities have not been recognised is immaterial. 

The deferred tax asset relating to losses has been recognised on the basis of strong evidence of 
future taxable profits against which the unutilised tax losses can be relieved or it is probable that 
they will be recovered against the reversal of deferred tax liabilities. The closing net deferred tax 
asset balance related to UK activities and included in the balance at 31 July 2023 amounted to £nil 
(FY2022: £nil). The deferred tax asset balance for provisions includes £51m (FY2022: £57m) 
relating to John Crane Inc. litigation provision, and £9m (FY2022: £12m) relating to Titeflex 
Corporation. See note 23 for additional information on provisions. 

UNRECOGNISED DEFERRED TAX
The Group has £521m of unrecognised deferred tax relating to losses (FY2022: £335m). 

The expiry date of operating losses carried forward is dependent upon the law of the various 
territories in which the losses arise. A summary of expiry dates in respect of which deferred tax 
has not been recognised is set out below:

Unrecognised deferred tax relating to losses has increased by £186m (FY2022: £228m). This 
comprises an increase of £78m that principally matches the reduction in the UK pensions 
deferred tax liability, an increase of £75m relating to Detection and Interconnect USA current year 
losses and £33m from a FY2022 change in local accounting method for tax purposes resulting in 
additional losses being booked in FY2023.

DEVELOPMENTS IN THE GROUP TAX POSITION 
In December 2021, the Organisation for Economic Co-operation and Development published 
rules relating to global minimum taxation called ‘Pillar 2 rules’, currently timetabled to apply 
in the UK to accounting periods beginning on or after 1 January 2024 (year ended 31 July 2025 
for Smiths). The Group will continue to monitor the development and future implementation of 
these rules globally. 

Smiths is actively working to fully understand the impact of the new rules and developing 
processes to enable compliance. Based upon our latest understanding, the current estimate of 
additional tax payable is not expected to have a material impact on the Group.

8. RETIREMENT BENEFITS
Smiths provides retirement benefits to employees in a number of countries. This includes defined 
benefit and defined contribution plans and, mainly in the United Kingdom (UK) and United States 
of America (US), post-retirement healthcare. 

DEFINED CONTRIBUTION PLANS
The Group operates defined contribution plans across many countries. In the UK a defined 
contribution plan has been offered since the closure of the UK defined benefit pension plans. In 
the US a 401(k) defined contribution plan operates. The total expense recognised in the 
consolidated income statement in respect of all these plans was £31m (FY2022: £34m).

DEFINED BENEFIT AND POST-RETIREMENT HEALTHCARE PLANS
The principal defined benefit pension plans are in the UK and in the US and these have been 
closed so that no future benefits are accrued. 

For all schemes, pension costs are assessed in accordance with the advice of independent, 
professionally qualified actuaries. These valuations have been updated by independent qualified 
actuaries in order to assess the liabilities of the schemes as at 31 July 2023. Contributions to the 
schemes are made on the advice of the actuaries, in accordance with local funding requirements.

UK PENSION SCHEMES
Smiths Group’s funded UK pension schemes are subject to a statutory funding objective, as set 
out in UK pension legislation. Scheme trustees need to obtain regular actuarial valuations to 
assess the scheme against this funding objective. The trustees and sponsoring companies need 
to agree funding plans to improve the position of a scheme when it is below the acceptable 
funding level. 

The UK Pensions Regulator has extensive powers to protect the benefits of members, promote 
good administration and reduce the risk of situations arising which may require compensation 
to be paid from the Pension Protection Fund. These include imposing a schedule of contributions 
or the calculation of the technical provisions, where a trustee and company fail to agree 
appropriate calculations. 

Smiths Industries Pension Scheme (SIPS)
This scheme was closed to future accrual effective 1 November 2009. SIPS provides index-linked 
(to applicable caps) pension benefits based on final earnings at date of closure. SIPS is governed 
by a corporate trustee (S.I. Pension Trustees Limited, a wholly owned subsidiary of Smiths Group 
plc). The board of trustee directors currently comprises four Company-nominated trustees and 
four member-nominated trustees, with an independent chairman selected by Smiths Group plc. 
Trustee directors are responsible for the management, administration, funding and investment 
strategy of the scheme.

The most recent actuarial valuation of this scheme has been performed using the Projected Unit 
Method as at 31 March 2020. The valuation showed a surplus of £34m on the Technical Provisions 
funding basis at the valuation date and the funding position has improved since then. As part of 
the valuation agreement, no contributions are currently being paid to SIPS and the Group’s 
current expectation is that these contributions will not recommence (although there are 
circumstances relating to the Scheme’s funding level in which contributions could be due to 
SIPS). The next actuarial valuation, due as at 31 March 2023, is currently in progress, with the 
results expected later in 2023.

The duration of SIPS liabilities is around 18 years (FY2022: 20 years) for active deferred members, 
19 years (FY2022: 20 years) for deferred members and 10 years (FY2022: 11 years) for pensioners 
and dependants. Durations have reduced primarily due to the increase in discount rate 
assumption, which reduces the average time it takes to receive all future pension payments when 
weighted by the present value of those future pension payments.

Under the governing documentation of SIPS, any future surplus would be returnable to 
Smiths Group plc by refund, assuming gradual settlement of the liabilities over the lifetime 
of the scheme.

In SIPS, as part of ongoing data cleansing work being undertaken to prepare the scheme for a 
potential full buy-out in the future, a wider review is being carried out to determine if the method 
used in the early 1990s to equalise retirement ages between men and women was implemented 
correctly. In FY2022, an additional liability of £19m was recognised as a past service cost to reflect 
the expected impact of correcting this issue for certain sections of the scheme. In the current 
year, a further liability of £12m has been recognised and £16m recognised in previous years has 
been released following the identification of additional evidence of the obligation for equalisation, 

resulting in a net credit to the income statement of £4m. The review remains ongoing however, no 
further material additional liabilities are expected.

SIPS uses a Liability Driven Investment (LDI) strategy to hedge against interest and inflation rate 
changes. During the significant volatility that followed the UK Government’s mini budget in 
September 2022, this hedging policy meant that SIPS asset values fell, as did the value of its 
obligations. All of SIPS’s collateral requirements in respect of the LDI assets were met, with no 
support required from the Group.

TI Group Pension Scheme (TIGPS)
This scheme was closed to future accrual effective 1 November 2009. TIGPS provides index-
linked (to applicable caps) pension benefits based on final earnings at the date of closure. TIGPS 
is governed by a corporate trustee (TI Pension Trustee Limited, an independent company). The 
board of trustee directors comprises four Company-nominated trustees and four member-
nominated trustees, with an independent trustee director selected by the trustee. The trustee is 
responsible for the management, administration, funding and investment strategy of the scheme.

In June 2022 the TIGPS trustee completed a deal to secure its remaining uninsured pension 
liabilities, by way of a bulk annuity buy-in with Rothesay Life plc. This means all of the scheme’s 
liabilities are insured via seven buy-in policies. The final buy-in has been secured with an intention 
to fully buy-out the Scheme as soon as reasonably practical and within a period of four years. The 
FY2022 income statement recognised a settlement loss of £171m in relation to the buy-in. 

In terms agreed between the Group and the TIGPS trustee prior to the transaction, when TIGPS 
converts all of its buy-in policies to buy-out policies and subsequently winds up, the trustee is 
expected to use any surplus remaining, after the costs of buying-out and winding up the scheme 
have been met, to improve member benefits. The FY 2022 income statement recognised a past 
service cost of £24m in relation to the derecognition of the remaining surplus. The Group has no 
expectation of receiving a refund from the scheme and has placed an economic benefit value of 
zero on the TIGPS surplus from 10 June 2022.

As TIGPS currently retains the legal obligation to pay all scheme benefits, TIGPS liabilities remain 
part of the retirement benefit obligations on the balance sheet alongside the corresponding 
buy-in assets. These liabilities and assets will be derecognised at the point the buy-in policies are 
converted to buy-outs and the legal obligation for payment of benefits is transferred to the 
relevant insurers.

The most recent actuarial valuation of this scheme has been performed using the Projected Unit 
Method as at 5 April 2020. The valuation showed a surplus of £22m on the Technical Provisions 
funding basis at the valuation date and the funding position has improved since then. Given 
TIGPS’s circumstances, the Group’s current expectation is that no further contributions to TIGPS 
will be required. The next actuarial valuation, due as at 5 April 2023, is currently in progress, with 
the results expected later in 2023.

The duration of the TIGPS liabilities is around 20 years (FY2022: 21 years) for active deferred 
members, 18 years (FY2022: 19 years) for deferred members and 10 years (FY2022: 10 years) for 
pensioners and dependants.

US PENSION PLANS
The valuations of the principal US pension and post-retirement healthcare plans were performed 
using census data at 1 January 2023.

The pension plans were closed with effect from 30 April 2009 and benefits were calculated as 
at that date and are not revalued. Governance of the US pension plans is overseen by a Settlor 
Committee appointed by Smiths Group Services Corp, a wholly owned subsidiary of the Group.

The duration of the liabilities for the largest US plan is around 15 years (FY2022: 16 years) for 
active deferred members, 14 years (FY2022: 15 years) for deferred members and 10 years 
(FY2022: 10 years) for pensioners and dependants.

RISK MANAGEMENT
In respect of uninsured liabilities, the pensions schemes are exposed to risks that: 

 – Investment returns are below expectations, leaving the schemes with insufficient assets in 

future to pay all their pension obligations; 

 – Members and dependants live longer than expected, increasing the value of the pensions which 

the schemes have to pay; 

The critical estimates and principal assumptions used in updating the valuations are set 
out below:

members

The assumptions used in calculating the costs and obligations of the Group’s defined benefit 
pension plans are set by the Group after consultation with independent professionally qualified 
actuaries. The assumptions used are estimates chosen from a range of possible actuarial 
assumptions which, due to the timescale covered, may not necessarily occur in practice. For 
countries outside the UK and USA, assumptions are disclosed as a weighted average.

 – Inflation rates are higher than expected, causing amounts payable under index-linked pensions 

to be higher than expected; and 

 – Increased contributions are required to meet funding targets if lower interest rates increase 

Inflation rate assumptions
The RPI inflation assumption of 3.3% has been derived using the Aon UK Government Gilt Prices 
Only Curve with an Inflation Risk Premium of 0.2% p.a.

the current value of liabilities. 

These risks are managed separately for each pension scheme. However, the Group has adopted a 
common approach of closing defined benefit schemes to cap members’ entitlements and of 
supporting trustees in adopting investment strategies which aim to hedge the value of assets 
against changes in the value of liabilities caused by changes in interest and inflation rates. 

Across SIPS and TIGPS, approximately 60% of all liabilities are now de-risked through 11 
bulk annuities.

TIGPS
TIGPS has covered roughly 100% of liabilities with matching annuities, eliminating investment 
return, longevity, inflation and funding risks in respect of those liabilities.

SIPS
SIPS has covered roughly 33% of liabilities with matching annuities, eliminating investment 
return, longevity, inflation and funding risks in respect of those liabilities. It has also adopted a 
LDI strategy to hedge interest and inflation risks of the scheme’s uninsured liabilities by 
investment in gilts together with the use of gilt repurchase arrangements, total return swaps, 
inflation swaps and interest rate swaps. The strategy also takes into account the scheme’s 
corporate bond investments. 

The Government’s response to its consultation on RPI reform was published on 25 November 
2020, and strongly implied that RPI will become aligned with CPI-H from 2030. No specific 
allowance (beyond anything already priced into markets) has been factored into the RPI 
assumptions for potential changes. The assumption for the long-term gap between RPI and CPI is 
0.5% p.a. (FY2022: 0.6%) reflecting the Group’s view on the market pricing of this gap over the 
lifetime of the UK schemes’ liabilities, i.e., 0.9% p.a. (FY2022: 1.0%) pre-2030 and 0.1% p.a. 
post-2030 (FY2022: 0.2%).

Short-term inflation has continued at rates higher than the Government’s targets, though future 
inflation is expected to fall in the short term as the Bank of England increases interest rates to 
combat high inflation. Consequently, the long-term inflation assumptions are similar to the prior 
year. The full impact of current high inflation is mitigated to an extent by the caps in place on 
index-linked increases. The Board considered and declined a request from the Trustee of SIPS to 
recommend an additional discretionary increase to pensions in payment. However, there is no 
change in the Group’s constructive obligations and allowance for certain discretionary increases 
in future continues to be included in the defined benefit obligations shown below.

OVERVIEWSTRATEGIC REPORTGOVERNANCEFINANCIAL STATEMENTSNOTES TO THE ACCOUNTSCONTINUEDSMITHS GROUP PLC ANNUAL REPORT FY2023157

Discount rate assumptions
The UK schemes use a discount rate based on the annualised yield on the Aon GBP Single Agency 
Select AA Curve, using the expected cash-flows from a notional scheme with obligations of the 
same duration as that of the UK schemes, whereas in previous years the Aon GBP Select AA 
Curve was used. The increase in the discount rate assumption at 31 July 2023 arises from market 
conditions and is not impacted by the change in discount rate methodology.

SENSITIVITY 
Sensitivities in respect of the key assumptions used to measure the principal pension schemes as 
at 31 July 2023 are set out below. These sensitivities show the hypothetical impact of a change in 
each of the listed assumptions in isolation, with the exception of the sensitivity to inflation which 
incorporates the impact of certain correlating assumptions. In practice, such assumptions rarely 
change in isolation.

The US Plan uses a discount rate based on the annualised yield derived from Willis Towers 
Watson’s RATE:Link (10th – 90th) model using the Plan’s expected cash-flows.

The discount rate assumptions have increased significantly since the prior year, largely due to 
the significant volatility that followed the UK Government’s mini budget in September 2022, 
though other factors have contributed to the continued rise in bond yields since then, including 
heightened political uncertainty, increases to interest rates to combat persistent high inflation 
and market illiquidity. A higher discount rate has led to a lower value being placed on the 
retirement benefit obligations, though there has also been a corresponding reduction in the 
value of assets.

Mortality assumptions
The mortality assumptions used in the principal UK schemes are based on the latest ‘SAPS S3’ 
birth year tables with relevant scaling factors based on the recent experience of the schemes. 
The assumption allows for future improvements in life expectancy in line with the 2021 latest 
2022 CMI projections, with a smoothing factor of 7.0 and ‘A’ parameter of 0.5%/0.25% (SIPS/
TIGPS) and blended to a long-term rate of 1.25%. The latest CMI projections incorporate 
allowance for the impact of COVID-19, equivalent to a reduction in life expectancy of around 
0.5 years. 

The mortality assumptions used in the principal US schemes are based on generational mortality 
using the latest Pri-2012 sex-distinct, employee/non-disabled annuitant table, with a 2012 base 
year, projected forward generationally with the latest MP-2021 mortality scale. No explicit 
adjustment has been made to mortality assumptions in respect of COVID-19. The impact of 
COVID-19 remains uncertain and further data studies are underway to better predict the impact 
on future mortality.

The effect on profit before tax reflects the impact of current service cost and net interest cost. 
The value of the scheme assets is affected by changes in mortality rates, inflation and discounting 
because they affect the carrying value of the insurance assets.

Asset valuation 
The pension schemes hold assets in a variety of pooled funds, in which the underlying assets 
typically are invested in credit and cash assets. These funds are valued. The price of the funds is 
set by administrators/custodians employed by the investment managers and based on the value 
of the underlying assets held in the funds. Prices are generally updated daily, weekly or quarterly 
depending upon the frequency of the fund’s dealing.

Bonds are valued using observable broker quotes. Gilt repurchase obligations are valued by 
the relevant manager, which derives the value using an industry recognised model with 
observable inputs.

Total return, interest and inflation swaps and forward FX contracts are bilateral agreements 
between counterparties and do not have observable market prices. These derivative contracts 
are valued using observable inputs.

Insured liabilities comprise annuity policies that match all or part of the scheme obligation to 
identified groups of members. These assets are valued by an external qualified actuary at the 
actuarial valuation of the corresponding liability, reflecting this matching relationship.

The insurance policies are treated as qualifying insurance policies as none of the insurers are 
related parties of Smiths Group, and the proceeds of the policies can only be used to pay or fund 
employee benefits for the respective schemes, are not available to Smiths Group’s creditors and 
cannot be paid to Smiths Group.

The UK Government bonds/LDI portfolios contain £717m (FY2022: £960m) of UK Government 
bonds (gilts), £276m (FY2022: £476m) of gilt repurchase obligations and £18m of interest and 
inflation swap obligations (FY2022: £9m assets) and forward FX contracts with a net obligation 
of £2m (FY2022: £5m asset). These are held to hedge against foreign currency risk. The pooled 
funds, insured liabilities and property assets are unquoted. The scheme assets do not include any 
property occupied by, or other assets used by, the Group.

The asset valuations are effective as at the end of the period, consistent with the calculations 
determining the obligations, except for a small legacy commercial property investment which is 
due to be sold down over 2023. This investment is only valued at the end of each calendar quarter, 
so no valuation is available as at the period end. The Group considers taking the most recent 
available valuation to be appropriate given the size of the commercial property investment relative 
to the overall value of invested assets and wider commercial property market returns since the 
most recent valuation. 

The Group acknowledges that responsibility for the effective management of the schemes’ 
assets lies primarily with the trustees, but also accepts that any risks inherent in the investment 
strategy, including ESG and climate risk, are ultimately underwritten by the Group. Consequently, 
the Group ensures that the trustees’ investment strategy and statements of investment principles 
are compatible with the Group’s wider sustainability strategy. For TIGPS, where all benefits are 
now secured by way of annuity purchase, all investment risks including ESG and climate risk, 
have effectively now been eliminated. For SIPS, a significant portion of investment risks have 
already been eliminated through annuity purchase and the scheme’s time horizon to full buy-in, 
hence exposure to investment risks including ESG and climate risk, continues to reduce.

Where any individual scheme shows a recoverable surplus under IAS 19, this is disclosed on the 
balance sheet as a retirement benefit asset. The IAS 19 surplus of any one scheme is not available 
to fund the IAS 19 deficit of another scheme. The retirement benefit asset disclosed arises from 
the rights of the employers to recover the surplus at the end of the life of the scheme, i.e., when 
the last beneficiary’s obligation has been met.

Cash contributions
Company contributions to the defined benefit pension plans and post-retirement healthcare plans 
totalled £5m (FY2022: £9m). No contributions were made to funded schemes in the year (FY2022: 
£3m to SIPS, £1m to Other). During the year, £5m (FY2022: £5m) was spent on providing benefits 
under unfunded defined benefit pension and post-retirement healthcare plans.

In FY2024, cash contributions to the Group’s schemes are expected to be up to £10m in total. 

9. EMPLOYEE SHARE SCHEMES
The Group operates share schemes and plans for the benefit of employees. The nature of the 
principal schemes and plans, including general conditions, is set out below:

LONG-TERM INCENTIVE PLAN (LTIP)
The LTIP is a share plan under which an award over a capped number of shares will vest after the 
end of a three-year performance period if performance conditions are met. LTIP awards are 
made to selected senior executives, including the Executive Directors.

LTIP performance conditions
Each performance condition has a threshold below which no shares vest and a maximum 
performance target at or above which the award vests in full. For performance between 
‘threshold’ and ‘maximum’, awards vest on a straight-line sliding scale. The performance 
conditions are assessed separately; so performance on one condition does not affect the 
vesting of the other elements of the award. To the extent that the performance targets are not 
met over the three-year performance period, awards lapse. There is no re-testing of the 
performance conditions.

LTIP awards have performance conditions relating to organic revenue growth, growth in headline 
EPS, ROCE, free cash-flow and meeting ESG targets.

SMITHS EXCELLENCE PLAN (SEP)
The last Smiths Excellence Plan (SEP) grant was issued in October 2019, vested on 31 July 2021 
and exercised in October 2021. No further SEP awards have been made.

RESTRICTED STOCK 
Restricted stock is used by the Remuneration & People Committee, as a part of recruitment 
strategy, to make awards in recognition of incentive arrangements forfeited on leaving a previous 
employer. If an award is considered appropriate, the award will take account of relevant factors 
including the fair value of awards forfeited, any performance conditions attached, the likelihood of 
those conditions being met and the proportion of the vesting period remaining. 

SAVE AS YOU EARN (SAYE)
The SAYE scheme is an HM Revenue & Customs approved all-employee savings-related share 
option scheme which is open to all UK employees. Participants enter into a contract to save a 
fixed amount per month of up to £500 in aggregate for three years and are granted an option 
over shares at a fixed option price, set at a discount to market price at the date of invitation to 
participate. The number of shares is determined by the monthly amount saved and the bonus paid 
on maturity of the savings contract. Options granted under the SAYE scheme are not subject to 
any performance conditions.

Options and awards were exercised on an irregular basis during the period. The average closing 
share price over the financial year was 1,629.8p (FY2022: 1,476.3p). There has been no change to 
the effective option price of any of the outstanding options during the period. The number of 
exercisable share options at 31 July 2023 was nil (31 July 2022: nil).

For the purposes of valuing options to arrive at the share-based payment charge, the binomial 
option pricing model has been used. The key assumptions used in the model were volatility of 25% 
to 20% (FY2022: 25% to 20%) and dividend yield of 2.4% (FY2022: 2.6%), based on historical data, 
for the period corresponding with the vesting period of the option. These generated a weighted 
average fair value for LTIP of £15.03 (FY2022: £14.81), and restricted stock of £14.60 (FY2022: 
£14.59). Staff costs included £14m (FY2022: £15m) for share-based payments, of which £13m 
(FY2022: £14m) related to equity-settled share-based payments.

11. IMPAIRMENT TESTING
GOODWILL
Goodwill is tested for impairment at least annually or whenever there is an indication that the 
carrying value may not be recoverable. 

Further details of the impairment review process and judgements are included in the ‘Sources 
of estimation uncertainty’ section of the ‘Basis of preparation’ for the consolidated financial 
statements.

For the purpose of impairment testing, assets are grouped at the lowest levels for which there 
are separately identifiable cash-flows, known as cash generating units (CGUs), taking into 
consideration the commonality of reporting, policies, leadership and intra-divisional trading 
relationships. Goodwill acquired through business combinations is allocated to groups of CGUs at 
a divisional (or operating segment) level, being the lowest level at which management monitors 
performance separately.

The carrying value of goodwill at 31 July is allocated by division as follows:

 In FY2022 the Smiths Detection CGU was restructured. The Detection Russia business split into a separate CGU and 
subsequently fully impaired.

Critical estimates used in impairment testing
The recoverable amount for impairment testing is determined from the higher of fair value 
less costs of disposal and value in use of the CGU. In assessing value in use, the estimated 
future cash-flows are discounted to their present value using a post-tax discount rate that 
reflects current market assessments of the time value of money, from which pre-tax discount 
rates are determined.

Fair value less costs of disposal is calculated using available information on past and expected 
future profitability, valuation multiples for comparable quoted companies and similar 
transactions (adjusted as required for significant differences) and information on costs of similar 
transactions. Fair value less costs to sell models are used when trading projections in the 
strategic plan cannot be adjusted to eliminate the impact of a major restructuring.

The value in use of CGUs is calculated as the net present value of the projected risk-adjusted 
cash-flows of each CGU. These cash-flow forecasts are based on the FY2024 business plan and 
the five-year detailed divisional strategic projections which have been prepared by divisional 
management and approved by the Board.

The principal assumptions used in determining the value in use were:

 – Revenue: Projected sales were built up with reference to markets and product categories. 

They incorporated past performance, historical growth rates and projections of developments 
in key markets;

 – Average earnings before interest and tax margin: Projected margins reflect historical 

performance, our expectations for future cost inflation and the impact of all completed projects 
to improve operational efficiency and leverage scale. The projections did not include the impact 
of future restructuring projects to which the Group was not yet committed;

 – Projected capital expenditure: The cash-flow forecasts for capital expenditure were based 

on past experience and included committed ongoing capital expenditure consistent with the 
FY2024 budget and the divisional strategic projections. The forecast did not include any future 
capital expenditure that improved/enhanced the operation/asset in excess of its current 
standard of performance;

 – Discount rate: The discount rates have been determined with reference to illustrative weighted 

average cost of capital (WACC) for each CGU. In determining these discount rates, management 
have considered systematic risks specific to each of the Group’s CGUs. These risk adjusted 
discount rates have then been validated against the Group’s WACC, the WACCs of the CGU’s 
peer group and an average of discount rates used by other companies for the industries in 
which Smiths divisions operate. Pre-tax rates of 11.4% to 13.0% (FY2022: 11.3% to 12.3%) have 
been used for the impairment testing; and

 – Long-term growth rates: For the purposes of the Group’s value in use calculations, a long-term 
growth rate into perpetuity was applied immediately at the end of the five-year detailed forecast 
period. CGU-specific long-term growth rates have been calculated by revenue weighting the 
long-term GDP growth rates of the markets that each CGU operates in. The long-term growth 
rates used in the testing ranged from 2.2% to 2.7% (FY2022: 1.7% to 2.4%). These rates do not 
reflect the long-term assumptions used by the Group for investment planning.

Of the principal assumptions above, the key assumptions that the impairment models are most 
sensitive to are: the revenue growth assumption; the average earnings before interest and tax 
margin assumption; and the discount rate assumption.

Forecast earnings before interest and tax have been projected using:

 – Expected future sales based on the strategic plan, which was constructed at a market level 
with input from key account managers, product line managers, business development and 
sales teams. An assessment of the market and existing contracts/programmes was made to 
produce the sales forecast; and

 – Current cost structure and production capacity, which include our expectations for future cost 
inflation. The projections did not include the impact of future restructuring projects to which 
the Group was not yet committed.

Sensitivity analysis
Smiths Detection is the only CGU of the Group that has limited goodwill impairment testing 
headroom. For all of the Group’s other CGUs the recoverable amount of the CGU exceeded the 
carrying value, on the basis of the assumptions set out in the preceding tables and any reasonably 
possible changes thereof.

The estimated recoverable amount of the Smiths Detection CGU exceeded the carrying value by 
£225m. Any decline in estimated value in use in excess of this amount would result in the 
recognition of impairment charges.

Management recognise that the goodwill impairment testing headroom of the Smiths Detection 
CGU is most sensitive to movements in the revenue growth rate, the EBIT margin and the 
discount rate assumptions. Of these key assumptions, management consider that the EBIT 
margin assumption is the most sensitive.

The Smiths Detection financial model assumes that EBIT margins grow from 11.2% in FY2023 to 
an average of 14.5% over the five-year financial model period. This increase in EBIT margin is 
principally driven by a change in revenue and profit mix, with the proportion of higher margin 
aftermarket revenue growing over the five-year projection period.

Management considers that it is plausible that this margin growth may not be fully captured by 
the business. For the CGU to be impaired, the average EBIT margin over the five-year financial 
model would have to be less than 12.3%; management recognises this to be a reasonably 
plausible downside scenario.

If the assumptions used in the impairment review were changed to a greater extent than as 
presented in the following table, the changes would, in isolation, lead to impairment losses being 
recognised for the year ended 31 July 2023:

Change required for carrying value to equal recoverable amount – FY2023

Revenue – compound annual growth rate (CAGR) over five-year projection period 
Average earnings before interest and tax margin
Post-tax discount rate

Change required for carrying value to equal recoverable amount – FY2022

Revenue – compound annual growth rate (CAGR) over five-year projection period 
Average earnings before interest and tax margin
Post-tax discount rate

Smiths Detection

-460 bps decrease
-220 bps decrease
+140 bps increase

Smiths Detection

-240 bps decrease
-130 bps decrease
+70 bps increase

Note: Long-term growth rates are not included in the sensitivity tables above as management 
consider that there is no reasonably possible change in long-term growth rate that would result 
in an impairment.

PROPERTY, PLANT AND EQUIPMENT, RIGHT OF USE ASSETS AND FINITE-LIFE 
INTANGIBLE ASSETS
At each reporting period date, the Group reviews the carrying amounts of its property, plant, 
equipment, right of use assets and finite-life intangible assets to determine whether there is any 
indication that those assets have suffered an impairment loss.

The Group has no indefinite life intangible assets other than goodwill. During the year, impairment 
tests were carried out for capitalised development costs that have not yet started to be amortised 
and acquired intangibles where there were indications of impairment. Value in use calculations 
were used to determine the recoverable values of these assets.

Trade receivables do not carry interest. Management considers that the carrying value of trade 
and other receivables approximates to the fair value. Trade and other receivables, including 
accrued income and other receivables qualifying as financial instruments are accounted for at 
amortised cost. The maximum credit exposure arising from these financial assets was £744m 
(FY2022: £726m).

Trade and other payables, including accrued expenses and other payables qualifying as financial 
instruments, are accounted for at amortised cost and are categorised as “Trade and other 
financial payables” in note 21. 

Contract liabilities comprise deferred income balances of £186m (FY2022: £163m) in respect of 
payments being made in advance of revenue recognition. The movement in the year arises 
primarily from the long-term contracts of the Smiths Detection division where invoicing under 
milestones precedes the delivery of the programme performance obligations. Revenue 
recognised in the year includes £97m (FY2022: £113m) that was included in the opening contract 
liabilities balance. This revenue primarily relates to the delivery of performance obligations in the 
Smiths Detection business.

Contract assets comprise unbilled balances not yet due on contracts, where revenue recognition 
does not align with the agreed payment schedule. The main movements in the year arose from 
increases in contract asset balances of £19m (FY2022: £19m) principally within Smiths 
Interconnect and Smiths Detection, offset by £9m decreases in John Crane and £7m (FY2022: 
£15m) decrease due to foreign currency translation losses. 

A number of Flex-Tek’s and Interconnect’s customers provide supplier finance schemes which 
allow their suppliers to sell trade receivables, without recourse, to banks. This is commonly 
known as invoice discounting or factoring. During FY2023 the Group collected £128m of 
receivables through these schemes (FY2022: £92m). The impact of invoice discounting on the 
FY2023 balance sheet was that trade receivables were reduced by £26m (2022: £19m). Costs of 
discounting were £2m (FY2022: less than £1m), charged to the income statement within financing 
costs. The cash received via these schemes was classified as an operating cash inflow as it had 
arisen from operating activities. 

Trade receivables are disclosed net of provisions for expected credit loss, with historical write-
offs used as a basis, adjusted for factors that are specific to the debtor, general economic 
conditions of the industry in which the debtor operates and a default risk multiplier applied to 
reflect country risk premium. Credit risk is managed separately for each customer and, where 
appropriate, a credit limit is set for the customer based on previous experience of the customer 
and third-party credit ratings. The Group has no significant concentration of credit risk, with 
exposure spread over a large number of customers. The largest single customer was the US 
Federal Government, representing 7% (FY2022: 7%) of Group revenue.

*  In FY22, the net cash inflow for the total Group including discontinued operations was £589m, £57m of which related to 

the cash held by Smiths Medical at the time of disposal.

** The Group has also incurred £9m (FY2022: £8m) of bank charges that were expensed when paid and were not included 

in net debt.

CASH POOLING
Cash and overdraft balances in interest compensation cash pooling systems are reported gross 
on the balance sheet. The cash pooling agreements incorporate a legally enforceable right of 
net settlement. However, as there is no intention to settle the balances net, these arrangements 
do not qualify for net presentation. At 31 July 2023 the total value of overdrafts on accounts in 
interest compensation cash pooling systems was £nil (FY2022: £nil). The balances held in zero 
balancing cash pooling arrangements have daily settlement of balances. Therefore netting is 
not relevant. 

CHANGE OF CONTROL
The Company has in place credit facility agreements under which a change of control would 
trigger prepayment clauses. The Company has one bond in issue, the terms of which would allow 
bondholders to exercise put options and require the Company to buy back the bonds at their 
principal amount plus interest if a rating downgrade occurs at the same time as a change of 
control takes effect.

169

LEASE LIABILITIES
Lease liabilities have been measured at the present value of the remaining lease payments. 
The weighted average incremental borrowing rate applied to lease liabilities in FY2023 was 4.01% 
(FY2022: 3.63%). 

19. FINANCIAL RISK MANAGEMENT
The Group’s international operations and debt financing expose it to financial risks which include 
the effects of changes in foreign exchange rates, debt market prices, interest rates, credit risks 
and liquidity risks. The management of operational credit risk is discussed in note 16.

TREASURY RISK MANAGEMENT POLICY
The Board maintains a Treasury Risk Management Policy, which governs the treasury operations 
of the Group and its subsidiary companies and the consolidated financial risk profile to be 
maintained. A report on treasury activities, financial metrics and compliance with the Policy is 
circulated to the Chief Financial Officer each month and key elements to the Audit & Risk 
Committee on a semi-annual basis.

The Policy maintains a treasury control framework within which counterparty risk, financing 
and debt strategy, cash and liquidity, interest rate risk and currency translation management 
are reserved for Group Treasury, while currency transaction management is devolved to 
operating divisions.

Centrally directed cash management systems exist globally to manage overall liquid resources 
efficiently across the divisions. The Group uses financial instruments to raise financing for its 
global operations, to manage related interest rate and currency financial risk, and to hedge 
transaction risk within subsidiary companies.

The Group does not speculate in financial instruments. All financial instruments hedge existing 
business exposures and all are recognised on the balance sheet.

The Policy defines four treasury risk components and for each component a set of financial 
metrics to be measured and reported monthly against pre-agreed objectives.

1) Credit quality
The Group’s strategy is to maintain a solid investment-grade rating to ensure access to the widest 
possible sources of financing at the right time and to optimise the resulting cost of debt capital. 
The credit ratings at the end of July 2023 were BBB+ / Baa2 (both stable) from Standard & Poor’s 
and Moody’s respectively. An essential element of an investment-grade rating is consistent and 
robust cash-flow metrics. The Group’s objective is to maintain a net debt/headline EBITDA ratio of 
two times or lower over the medium term. Capital management is discussed in more detail in 
note 26.

2) Debt and interest rate 
The Group’s risk management objectives are to ensure that the majority of funding is drawn from 
the public debt markets with the average maturity profile of gross debt to be at or greater than 
three years, and between 40-60% of gross debt (excluding leases) is at fixed rates. At 31 July 2023 
these measures were 100% (FY2022: 100%), 3.6 years (FY2022: 2.7 years) and 54% (FY2022: 44%).

NOTES TO THE ACCOUNTSCONTINUEDSMITHS GROUP PLC ANNUAL REPORT FY2023OVERVIEWSTRATEGIC REPORTGOVERNANCEFINANCIAL STATEMENTS170

The Group has no financial covenants in its external debt agreements. Interest rate risk 
management is discussed in note 19(b).

The following table shows the currency of financial instruments. It excludes loans and derivatives 
designated as net investment hedges.

3) Liquidity management
The Group’s objective is to ensure that at any time undrawn committed facilities, net of short-
term overdraft financing, are at least £300m and that committed facilities have at least 12 months 
to run until maturity. At 31 July 2023, these measures were £622m (FY2022: £657m) and 57 
months (FY2022: 27 months). At 31 July 2023, net cash resources were £285m (FY2022: £1,055m). 
Liquidity risk management is discussed in note 19(d).

4) Currency management
The Group is an international business with the majority of its net assets denominated in foreign 
currency. It protects the balance sheet and reserves from adverse foreign exchange movements 
by financing foreign currency assets where appropriate in the same currency. The Group’s 
objective for managing transaction currency exposure is to reduce medium-term volatility to 
cash-flow, margins and earnings. Foreign exchange risk management is discussed in note 19(a) 
below. 

(A) FOREIGN EXCHANGE RISK
Transactional currency exposure
The Group is exposed to foreign currency risks arising from sales or purchases by businesses in 
currencies other than their functional currency. It is Group policy that, when the net foreign 
exchange exposure to known future sales and purchases is material, this exposure is hedged 
using forward foreign exchange contracts. The net exposure is calculated by adjusting the 
expected cash-flow for payments or receipts in the same currency linked to the sale or purchase. 
This policy minimises the risk that the profits generated from the transaction will be affected by 
foreign exchange movements which occur after the price has been determined. Hedge accounting 
documentation and effectiveness testing are only undertaken if it is cost-effective.

These sensitivities were calculated before adjusting for tax and exclude the effect of quasi-equity

Cash-flow hedging
The Group uses forward foreign exchange contracts to hedge future foreign currency sales and 
purchases. At 31 July 2023, contracts with a nominal value of £123m (FY2022: £141m) were 
designated as hedging instruments. In addition, the Group had outstanding foreign currency 
contracts with a nominal value of £252m (FY2022: £226m) which were being used to manage 
transactional foreign exchange exposures, but were not accounted for as cash-flow hedges. The 
fair value of the contracts is disclosed in note 20.

The majority of hedged transactions will be recognised in the consolidated income statement in 
the same period that the cash-flows are expected to occur, with the only differences arising 
because of normal commercial credit terms on sales and purchases. It is the Group’s policy to 
hedge 80% of certain exposures for the next two years and 50% of highly probable exposures for 
the next 12 months.

Hedge effectiveness is determined at the inception of the hedge relationship, and through periodic 
prospective effectiveness assessments to ensure that an economic relationship exists between 
the hedged item and hedging instrument. The foreign exchange forward contracts have similar 
critical terms to the hedged items, such as the notional amounts and maturities. Therefore, there 
is an economic relationship and the hedge ratio is established as 1:1.

The main sources of hedge ineffectiveness in these hedging relationships are the effect of the 
Group’s and the counterparty credit risks on the fair value of the foreign exchange forward 
contracts, which is not reflected in the fair value of the hedged item and the risk of over-hedging 
where the hedge relationship requires re-balancing. No other sources of ineffectiveness 
emerged from these hedging relationships. Any hedge ineffectiveness is recognised immediately 
in the income statement in the period that it occurs. Of the foreign exchange contracts designated 
as hedging instruments, 98% are for periods of 12 months or less (FY2022: 98%).

The following tables set out information regarding the change in value of the hedged item used in 
calculating hedge ineffectiveness as well as the impacts on the cash-flow hedge reserve:

Cash-flow hedges generated £nil of ineffectiveness in FY2023 (FY2022: £nil) which was 
recognised in the income statement through finance costs.

Translational currency exposure
The Group has significant investments in overseas operations, particularly in the US and Europe. As 
a result, the sterling value of the Group’s balance sheet can be significantly affected by movements 
in exchange rates. The Group seeks to mitigate the effect of these translational currency exposures 
by matching the net investment in overseas operations with borrowings denominated in their 
functional currencies, except where significant adverse interest differentials or other factors would 
render the cost of such hedging activity uneconomic. This is achieved by borrowing primarily in the 
relevant currency or in some cases indirectly using cross-currency swaps. 

Net investment hedges

NOTES TO THE ACCOUNTSCONTINUEDSMITHS GROUP PLC ANNUAL REPORT FY2023OVERVIEWSTRATEGIC REPORTGOVERNANCEFINANCIAL STATEMENTS172

At 31 July 2023, cross-currency swaps hedged the Group’s exposure to US dollars and euros 
(31 July 2022: US dollars and euros). All the cross-currency swaps designated as net investment 
hedges were non-current (FY2022: current and non-current). Swaps generating £247m of the US 
dollar exposure (FY2022: £261m) will mature in February 2027.

In addition, non-swapped borrowings were also used to hedge the Group’s exposure to euros 
(31 July 2022: US dollars and euros). Borrowings generating £293m of the euro exposure 
(FY2022: £287m) will mature in February 2027. 

Hedge effectiveness is determined at the inception of the hedge relationship, and through periodic 
prospective effectiveness assessments to ensure that an economic relationship exists between 
the hedged item and hedging instrument. The swaps and borrowings have the same notional 
amount as the hedged items and, therefore, there is an economic relationship with the hedge 
ratio established as 1:1.

The main sources of hedge ineffectiveness in these hedging relationships are the effect of the 
counterparty and the Group’s own credit risk on the fair value of the foreign exchange forward 
contracts which is not reflected in the fair value of the hedged item and the risk of over-hedging 
where the hedge relationship requires re-balancing. No other sources of ineffectiveness 
emerged from these hedging relationships. Any hedge ineffectiveness is recognised immediately 
in the income statement in the period that it occurs.

The fair values of these net investment hedges are subject to exchange rate movements.

These movements would be fully offset by an opposite movement on the retranslation of the net 
assets of the overseas subsidiaries. These sensitivities were calculated before adjusting for tax.

(B) INTEREST RATE RISK
The Group operates an interest rate policy designed to optimise interest cost and reduce volatility 
in reported earnings. The Group’s current policy is to require interest rates to be fixed within a band 
of between 40% and 60 % of the level of gross debt (excluding leases). This is achieved through fixed 
rate borrowings and interest rate swaps. At 31 July 2023 54% (FY2022: 44%) of the Group’s gross 
borrowings (excluding leases) were at fixed interest rates, after adjusting for interest rate swaps 
and the impact of short maturity derivatives designated as net investment hedges.

The Group monitors its fixed rate risk profile against both gross and net debt. For medium-term 
planning, it focuses on gross debt to eliminate the fluctuations of variable cash levels over the 
cycle. The weighted average interest rate on borrowings and cross-currency swaps at 31 July 
2023, after interest rate swaps, was 4.53% (FY2022: 3.06%).

NOTES TO THE ACCOUNTSCONTINUEDSMITHS GROUP PLC ANNUAL REPORT FY2023OVERVIEWSTRATEGIC REPORTGOVERNANCEFINANCIAL STATEMENTSInterest rate profile of financial assets and liabilities and the fair value of borrowings
The following table shows the interest rate risk exposure of investments, cash and borrowings, 
with the borrowings adjusted for the impact of interest rate hedging. Other financial assets and 
liabilities do not earn or bear interest, and for all financial instruments except borrowings, the 
carrying value is not materially different from their fair value.

Interest rate hedging
The Group also has exposures to the fair values of non-derivative financial instruments such as 
EUR fixed rate borrowings. To manage the risk of changes in these fair values, the Group has 
entered into fixed-to-floating interest rate swaps and cross-currency interest rate swaps, which 
for accounting purposes are designated as fair value hedges.

At 31 July 2023 and 31 July 2022, the Group had designated the following hedges against 
variability in the fair value of borrowings arising from fluctuations in base rates:

 – €300m of the fixed/floating and € exchange exposure of EUR/USD interest rate swaps 

maturing on 23 February 2027 partially hedging the € 2027 Eurobond; and

 – €400m of the fixed/floating element of the EUR/USD interest rate swaps that partially hedged 

the € 2023 Eurobond was repaid on 28 April 2022.

The fair values of the hedging instruments are disclosed in note 20. The effect of the swaps was to 
convert £257m (FY2022: £588m) debt from fixed rate to floating rate. The swaps have similar 
critical terms to the hedged items, such as the reference rate, reset dates, notional amounts, 
payment dates and maturities. Therefore, there is an economic relationship and the hedge ratio is 
established as 1:1. Hedge effectiveness is determined at the inception of the hedge relationship, 
and through periodic prospective effectiveness assessments to ensure that an economic 
relationship exists between the hedged item and hedging instrument. 

The main source of hedge ineffectiveness in these hedging relationships is the effect of the 
currency basis risk on cross-currency interest rate swaps which are not reflected in the fair value 
of the hedged item. No other sources of ineffectiveness emerged from these hedging 
relationships. Any hedge ineffectiveness was recognised immediately in the income statement in 
the period in which it occurred.

Fair value hedges generated a £nil ineffectiveness in FY2023 (FY2022: £1m) which was recognised 
in the income statement through finance costs.

Sensitivity of interest charges to interest rate movements
The Group has exposure to sterling, US dollar and euro interest rates. However, the Group does 
not have a significant exposure to interest rate movements for any individual currency. Based on 
the composition of net debt and investments at 31 July 2023, and taking into consideration all fixed 
rate borrowings and interest rate swaps in place, a one percentage point (100 basis points) 
change in average floating interest rates for all three currencies would have a £2m impact 
(FY2022: £2m impact) on the Group’s profit before tax.

(C) FINANCIAL CREDIT RISK
The Group is exposed to credit-related losses in the event of non-performance by counterparties 
to financial instruments, but does not currently expect any counterparties to fail to meet their 
obligations. Credit risk is mitigated by the Board-approved policy of only placing cash deposits 
with highly rated relationship bank counterparties within counterparty limits established by 
reference to their Standard & Poor’s long-term debt rating. In the normal course of business, the 
Group operates cash pooling systems, where a legal right of set-off applies.

The maximum credit risk exposure in the event of other parties failing to perform their obligations 
under financial assets, excluding trade and other receivables and derivatives, totals £295m at 31 
July 2023 (FY2022: £1,067m).

At 31 July 2023, the maximum exposure with a single bank for deposits and cash was £65m 
(FY2022: £339m). The bank has a credit rating of A+. The maximum mark to market exposure with 
a single bank for derivatives was out of the money in both the current and prior year and does not 
represent a credit risk.

This table above presents the undiscounted future contractual cash-flows for all derivative 
financial instruments. For this disclosure, cash-flows in foreign currencies are translated using 
the spot rates at the balance sheet date. The fair values of these financial instruments are 
presented in note 20.

Gross contractual cash-flows for other financial liabilities
The contractual cash-flows for financial liabilities included in trade and other payables were  
£463m (FY2022: £474m) due in less than one year, £13m (FY2022: £13m) due between one and  
five years.

(D) LIQUIDITY RISK
Borrowing facilities
Board policy specifies the maintenance of unused committed credit facilities of at least £300m at 
all times to ensure that the Group has sufficient available funds for operations and planned 
development. The Group has Revolving Credit Facilities of US$800m maturing 5 May 2028. At the 
balance sheet date, the Group had the following undrawn credit facilities:

20. DERIVATIVE FINANCIAL INSTRUMENTS
The tables below set out the nominal amount and fair value of derivative contracts held by the 
Group, identifying the derivative contracts which qualify for hedge accounting treatment. 

ACCOUNTING FOR OTHER DERIVATIVE CONTRACTS
Any foreign exchange contracts which are not formally designated as hedges and tested are 
classified as ‘held for trading’ and not hedge accounted. 

NETTING
International Swaps and Derivatives Association (ISDA) master netting agreements are in place 
with derivative counterparties except for contracts traded on a dedicated international electronic 
trading platform used for operational foreign exchange hedging. Under these agreements if a 
credit event occurs, all outstanding transactions under the ISDA are terminated and only a single 
net amount per counterparty is payable in settlement of all transactions. The ISDA agreements 
do not meet the criteria for offsetting, since the offsetting is enforceable only if specific events 
occur in the future, and there is no intention to settle the contracts on a net basis.

The fair value of a financial instrument is the price at which an asset could be exchanged, or a 
liability settled, between knowledgeable, willing parties in an arm’s-length transaction. Fair 
values have been determined with reference to available market information at the balance sheet 
date, using the methodologies described below:

A   Carrying value is assumed to be a reasonable approximation to fair value for all of these assets 

and liabilities (Level 1 as defined by IFRS 13).

D   Borrowings are carried at amortised cost. Amounts denominated in foreign currencies are 

valued at the exchange rate prevailing at the balance sheet date. The fair value of borrowings is 
estimated using quoted prices (Level 1 as defined by IFRS 13).

E   Leases are carried at amortised cost. Amounts denominated in foreign currencies are valued 
at the exchange rate prevailing at the balance sheet date. The fair value of the lease contract is 
estimated by discounting contractual future cash-flows (Level 2 as defined by IFRS 13).

B   Carrying value is assumed to be a reasonable approximation to fair value for all of these assets 

F   The fair value of instruments is estimated by using unobservable inputs to the extent that 

and liabilities (Level 2 as defined by IFRS 13).

C   Fair values of derivative financial assets and liabilities, and trade receivables held to collect or 
sell are estimated by discounting expected future contractual cash-flows using prevailing 
interest rate curves. Amounts denominated in foreign currencies are valued at the exchange 
rate prevailing at the balance sheet date. These financial instruments are included on the 
balance sheet at fair value, derived from observable market prices (Level 2 as defined by 
IFRS 13).

relevant observable inputs are not available. Unobservable inputs are developed using the 
best information available in the circumstances, which may include the Group’s own data, 
taking into account all information about market participation assumptions that is reliably 
available (Level 3 as defined by IFRS 13).

IFRS 13 defines a three-level valuation hierarchy:

  Level 1 – quoted prices for similar instruments 
  Level 2 – directly observable market inputs other than Level 1 inputs 
  Level 3 – inputs not based on observable market data

The John Crane, Inc. and Titeflex Corporation litigation provisions were the only provisions that 
were discounted; other provisions have not been discounted as the impact would be immaterial.

TRADING
The provisions included as trading represent amounts provided for in the ordinary course of 
business. Trading provisions are charged and released through headline profit.

Warranty provision and product liability
At 31 July 2023, the Group had warranty and product liability provisions of £6m (FY2022: £7m). 
Warranties over the Group’s products typically cover periods of between one and three years. 
Provision is made for the likely cost of after-sales support based on the recent past experience of 
individual businesses.

Commercial disputes and litigation in respect of ongoing business activities
The Group has on occasion been required to take legal action to protect its intellectual property and 
other rights against infringement. It has also had to defend itself against proceedings brought by 
other parties, including product liability and insurance subrogation claims. Provision is made for any 
expected costs and liabilities in relation to these proceedings where appropriate, although there can 
be no guarantee that such provisions (which may be subject to potentially material revision from 
time to time) will accurately predict the actual costs and liabilities that may be incurred.

Contingent liabilities
In the ordinary course of its business, the Group is subject to commercial disputes and litigation 
such as government price audits, product liability claims, employee disputes and other kinds of 
lawsuits, and faces different types of legal issues in different jurisdictions. The high level of 
activity in the US, for example, exposes the Group to the likelihood of various types of litigation 
commonplace in that country, such as ‘mass tort’ and ‘class action’ litigation, legal challenges to 
the scope and validity of patents, and product liability and insurance subrogation claims. These 
types of proceedings (or the threat of them) are also used to create pressure to encourage 
negotiated settlement of disputes. Any claim brought against the Group (with or without merit) 
could be costly to defend. These matters are inherently difficult to quantify. In appropriate cases a 
provision is recognised based on best estimates and management judgement but there can be no 
guarantee that these provisions (which may be subject to potentially material revision from time 
to time) will result in an accurate prediction of the actual costs and liabilities that may be incurred. 
There are also contingent liabilities in respect of litigation for which no provisions are made.

The Group operates in some markets where the risk of unethical or corrupt behaviour is material 
and has procedures, including an employee ethics alert line, to help it identify potential issues. 
Such procedures will, from time to time, give rise to internal investigations, sometimes conducted 
with external support, to ensure that the Group properly understands risks and concerns and 
can take steps both to manage immediate issues and to improve its practices and procedures 
for the future. The Group is not aware of any issues which are expected to generate material 
financial exposures.

NON-HEADLINE AND LEGACY
John Crane, Inc.
John Crane, Inc. (JCI) is one of many co-defendants in numerous lawsuits pending in the United 
States in which plaintiffs are claiming damages arising from alleged exposure to, or use of, 
products previously manufactured which contained asbestos. Until 2006, the awards, the related 
interest and all material defence costs were met directly by insurers. In 2007, JCI secured the 
commutation of certain insurance policies in respect of product liability. Provision is made in 
respect of the expected costs of defending known and predicted future claims and of adverse 
judgements in relation thereto, to the extent that such costs can be reliably estimated. 

The JCI products generally referred to in these cases consist of industrial sealing products, 
primarily packing and gaskets. The asbestos was encapsulated within these products in such a 
manner that causes JCI to understand, based on tests conducted on its behalf, that the products 
were safe. JCI ceased manufacturing products containing asbestos in 1985. 

JCI continues to actively monitor the conduct and effect of its current and expected asbestos 
litigation, including the most efficacious presentation of its ‘safe product’ defence, and intends to 
continue to resist these asbestos claims based upon this defence. The table below summarises 
the JCI claims experience over the last 40 years since the start of this litigation:

The number of claims outstanding at 31 July 2023 reflected the benefit of 4,000 (FY2022: 1,000) 
claims being dismissed in the year.

JCI has also incurred significant additional defence costs. The litigation involves claims for a 
number of allegedly asbestos-related diseases, with awards, when made, for mesothelioma 
tending to be larger than those for the other diseases. JCI’s ability to defend mesothelioma cases 
successfully is, therefore, likely to have a significant impact on its annual aggregate adverse 
judgement and defence costs.

John Crane, Inc. litigation provision
The provision is based on past history of JCI claims and well-established tables of asbestos-
related disease incidence projections. The provision is determined using advice from asbestos 
valuation experts, Bates White LLC. The assumptions made in assessing the appropriate level of 
provision include: the period over which the expenditure can be reliably estimated; the future 
trend of legal costs; the rate of future claims filed; the rate of successful resolution of claims; and 
the average amount of judgements awarded. The provision utilised in the period is higher than 
previous periods, principally due to the resolution of outstanding verdicts from previous periods. 

Trial delays arising from the COVID-19 pandemic have largely abated and trial activity has 
returned to pre-pandemic levels.

Established incidence curves can be used to estimate the likely future pattern of asbestos-related 
disease. However, JCI’s claims experience is also significantly impacted by other factors which 
influence the US litigation environment. These can include: changing approaches on the part of 
the plaintiffs’ bar; changing attitudes amongst the judiciary at both trial and appellate levels in 
specific jurisdictions which move the balance of risk and opportunity for claimants; and legislative 
and procedural changes in both the state and federal court systems. 

The projections use a limited time horizon on the basis that Bates White LLC consider that there 
is substantial uncertainty in the asbestos litigation environment. So probable expenditures are 
not reasonably estimable beyond this time horizon. Asbestos is the longest running mass tort 
litigation in American history and is constantly evolving in ways that cannot be anticipated. JCI’s 
defence strategy also generates a significantly different pattern of legal costs and settlement 
expenses from other defendants. Thus JCI is in an extremely rare position, and evidence from 
other litigation cannot be used to improve the reliability of the projections. A ten-year (FY2022: 
ten-year) time horizon has been used based on past experience regarding significant changes in 
the litigation environment that have occurred every few years and on the amount of time taken in 
the past for some of those changes to impact the broader asbestos litigation environment.

The rate of future claims filed has been estimated using well-established tables of asbestos 
incidence projections to determine the likely population of potential claimants, and JCI’s past 
experience to determine what proportion of this population will make a claim against JCI. The JCI 
products generally referred to in claims had industrial and marine applications. As a result, the 
incidence curve used for JCI projections excludes construction workers, and is a composite of the 
curves that predict asbestos exposure-related disease from shipyards and other occupations. 
This is consistent with JCI’s litigation history. 

The rate of successful resolution of claims and the average amount of any judgements awarded 
are projected based on the past history of JCI claims, since this is the best available evidence, 
given JCI’s unusual strategy of defending all claims. 

The future trend of legal costs is estimated based on JCI’s past experience, adjusted to reflect the 
assumed levels of claims and trial activity, since the number of trials is a key driver of legal costs. 

John Crane, Inc. litigation insurance recoveries
While JCI has certain excess liability insurance, JCI has met defence costs directly. The 
calculation of the provision does not take account of any potential recoveries from insurers.

John Crane, Inc. litigation provision sensitivities 
The provision may be subject to potentially material revision from time to time if new information 
becomes available as a result of future events. There can be no guarantee that the assumptions 
used to estimate the provision will result in an accurate prediction of the actual costs that will be 
incurred because of the significant uncertainty associated with the future level of asbestos claims 
and of the costs arising out of related litigation, including the unpredictability of jury verdicts. 

NOTES TO THE ACCOUNTSCONTINUEDSMITHS GROUP PLC ANNUAL REPORT FY2023OVERVIEWSTRATEGIC REPORTGOVERNANCEFINANCIAL STATEMENTSJohn Crane, Inc. statistical reliability of projections over the ten-year time horizon
In order to evaluate the statistical reliability of the projections, a population of outcomes is 
modelled using randomised verdict outcomes. This generated a distribution of outcomes with 
future spend at the 5th percentile of £180m and future spend at the 95th percentile of £245m 
(FY2022: £203m and £268m, respectively). Statistical analysis of the distribution of these 
outcomes indicates that there is a 50% probability that the total future spend will fall between 
£228m and £257m (FY2022: between £239m and £263m), compared to the gross provision value 
of £246m (FY2022: £258m).

John Crane, Inc. litigation provision history
The JCI asbestos litigation provision of £204m (FY2022: £229m) is a discounted pre-tax provision 
using discount rates, being the risk-free rate on US debt instruments for the appropriate period. 
The deferred tax asset related to this provision is shown within the deferred tax balance (note 6).

John Crane, Inc. sensitivity of the projections to changes in the time horizon used
If the asbestos litigation environment becomes more volatile and uncertain, the time horizon over 
which the provision can be calculated may reduce. Conversely, if the environment became more 
stable, or JCI changed approach and committed to long-term settlement arrangements, the time 
period covered by the provision might be extended. 

181

The projections use a ten-year time horizon. Reducing the time horizon by one year would reduce 
the provision by £16m (FY2022: £18m) and reducing it by five years would reduce the provision by 
£87m (FY2022: £97m).

We consider, after obtaining advice from Bates White LLC, that to forecast beyond ten years 
requires that the litigation environment remains largely unchanged with respect to the historical 
experience used for estimating future asbestos expenditures. Historically, the asbestos litigation 
environment has undergone significant changes more often than every ten years. If one assumed 
that the asbestos litigation environment would remain unchanged for longer and extended the 
time horizon by one year, it would increase the pre-tax provision by £13m (FY2022: £15m) and 
extending it by five years would increase the pre-tax provision by £48m (FY2022: £56m). 
However, there are also reasonable scenarios that, given certain recent events in the US asbestos 
litigation environment, would result in no additional asbestos litigation for JCI beyond ten years. 
At this time, how the asbestos litigation environment will evolve beyond ten years is not 
reasonably estimable.

John Crane, Inc. contingent liabilities
Provision has been made for future defence costs and the cost of adverse judgements expected to 
occur. JCI’s claims experience is significantly impacted by other factors which influence the US 
litigation environment. These can include: changing approaches on the part of the plaintiffs’ bar; 
changing attitudes amongst the judiciary at both trial and appellate levels; and legislative and 
procedural changes in both the state and federal court systems. As a result, whilst the Group 
anticipates that asbestos litigation will continue beyond the period covered by the provision, the 
uncertainty surrounding the US litigation environment beyond this point is such that the costs cannot 
be reliably estimated.

Although the methodology used to calculate the JCI litigation provision can in theory be applied to 
show claims and costs for longer periods, the Directors consider, based on advice from Bates 
White LLC, that the level of uncertainty regarding the factors used in estimating future costs is 
too great to provide for reasonable estimation of the numbers of future claims, the nature of such 
claims or the cost to resolve them for years beyond the ten-year time horizon.

Titeflex Corporation
Titeflex Corporation, a subsidiary of the Group in the Flex-Tek division, has received a number of 
claims in the US from insurance companies seeking recompense on a subrogated basis for the 
effects of damage allegedly caused by lightning strikes in relation to its flexible gas piping 
product. It has also received product liability claims regarding this product in the US, some in the 
form of purported class actions. Titeflex Corporation believes that its products are a safe and 
effective means of delivering gas when installed in accordance with the manufacturer’s 
instructions and local and national codes. However, some claims have been settled on an 
individual basis without admission of liability. Equivalent third-party products in the US 
marketplace face similar challenges. 

NOTES TO THE ACCOUNTSCONTINUEDSMITHS GROUP PLC ANNUAL REPORT FY2023OVERVIEWSTRATEGIC REPORTGOVERNANCEFINANCIAL STATEMENTSThe projections use assumptions of future claims that are based on both the number of future 
settlements and the average amount of those settlements. If the assumed average number of 
future settlements increased 10%, the provision would rise by £3m (FY2022: £5m), with an 
equivalent fall for a reduction of 10%. If the assumed amount of those settlements increased 10%, 
the provision would rise by £2m (FY2022: £4m), also with an equivalent fall for a reduction of 10%.

Other non-headline and legacy provisions
Non-headline provisions comprise all provisions that were disclosed as non-headline items when 
they were charged to the consolidated income statement. Legacy provisions comprise non-material 
provisions relating to former business activities and discontinued operations and properties no 
longer used by Smiths.

These non-material provisions include non-headline reorganisation, disposal indemnities, 
litigation and arbitration in respect of old products and discontinued business activities, which 
includes claims received in connection with the disposal of Smiths Medical in the prior year. 
Provision is made for the best estimate of the expected expenditure related to the defence and/or 
resolution of such matters. There is an inherent risk in legal proceedings that the outcome may 
be unfavourable to the Group, and as such there can be no guarantee that such provisions (which 
may be subject to potentially material revision from time to time) will be sufficient.

Reorganisation
At 31 July 2023, there were reorganisation provisions of £7m (FY2022: £1m) relating to the various 
restructuring programmes that are expected to be utilised in the next 18 months.

Property
At 31 July 2023, there were provisions of £10m (FY2022: £10m) related to actual and potential 
environmental issues for sites currently or previously occupied by Smiths operations.

182

Titeflex Corporation litigation provision
The continuing progress of claims and the pattern of settlement, together with recent 
marketplace activity, provide sufficient evidence to recognise a liability in the accounts. Therefore 
provision has been made for the costs which the Group is expected to incur in respect of future 
claims to the extent that such costs can be reliably estimated. Titeflex Corporation sells flexible 
gas piping with extensive installation and safety guidance designed to assure the safety of the 
product and minimise the risk of damage associated with lightning strikes. 

The assumptions made in assessing the appropriate level of provision, which are based on past 
experience, include: the period over which expenditure can be reliably estimated; the number of 
future settlements; the average amount of settlements; and the impact of statutes of repose and safe 
installation initiatives on the expected number of future claims. The assumptions relating to the 
number of future settlements exclude the use of recent claims history due to the uncertain impact 
that the COVID-19 lockdown has had on the number of claims.

The provision of £41m (FY2022: £52m) is a discounted pre-tax provision using discount rates, 
being the risk-free rate on US debt instruments for the appropriate period. The deferred tax asset 
related to this provision is shown within the deferred tax balance (note 6).

Titeflex Corporation litigation provision history
A credit of £8m (FY2022: £2m charge) has been recognised by Titeflex Corporation in respect of 
changes to the estimated cost of future claims from insurance companies seeking recompense 
for damage allegedly caused by lightning strikes. The lower gross provision value has been 
principally driven by an increase in the discount factor deriving from increasing US dollar 
discount rates.

Titeflex Corporation litigation provision sensitivities
The significant uncertainty associated with the future level of claims and of the costs arising out of 
related litigation means that there can be no guarantee that the assumptions used to estimate the 
provision will result in an accurate prediction of the actual costs that will be incurred. Therefore 
the provision may be subject to potentially material revision from time to time, if new information 
becomes available as a result of future events.

The projections incorporate a long-term assumption regarding the impact of safe installation 
initiatives on the level of future claims. If the assumed annual benefit of bonding and grounding 
initiatives were 0.5% higher, the provision would be £2m (FY2022: £3m) lower, and if the benefit 
were 0.5% lower, the provision would be £2m (FY2022: £4m) higher.

In connection with the sale of Smiths Medical to ICU Medical, Inc., and in the light of our strong 
balance sheet and cash-flows, the Group announced that it intended to return an amount 
representing 55% of the initial cash proceeds (equating to an aggregate purchase price of up to 
US$1bn or £742m) to shareholders in the form of a Share Buyback Programme. All shares 
purchased under the Programme will be cancelled. This Programme was initiated on 19 
November 2021 as announced to the London Stock Exchange on 11 November 2021 and following 
shareholder approval at the General Meeting held on 17 November 2021. 

A total number of 13,008,032 ordinary shares of 37.5p each were repurchased during the period, 
for a total consideration of £206,142,265, of which 84,195 shares with a value of £1,430,464 were 
yet to settle and be cancelled. In total since the start of the Programme, 47,290,261 shares have 
been repurchased, for a total consideration of £718,939,264, representing 11.93% of the called-up 
ordinary share capital outstanding at the start of the Programme. 

A further 1,379,697 ordinary shares have been repurchased during the period of 1 August 
2023 to 15 September 2023, bringing the total number of shares repurchased to 48,669,958. 
At 15 September 2023, the Group had paid £737m of the expected £742m payable under the 
Programme, with the remaining £5m expected to be utilised within the next two weeks.

EMPLOYMENT SHARE SCHEMES
Shares acquired through Company share schemes and plans rank pari passu with the shares in 
issue and have no special rights. The Company operates an Employee Benefit Trust, with an 
independent trustee, to hold shares pending employees becoming entitled to them under the 
Company’s share schemes and plans. On 31 July 2023, the Trust held 1,742,929 (FY2022: 618,662) 
ordinary shares in the Company. The Trust waived its dividend entitlement on its holding during 
the year, and the Trust abstains from voting any shares held at General Meetings.

The holders of ordinary shares are entitled to receive the Company’s Reports and Accounts, to 
attend and speak at General Meetings of the Company, to appoint proxies and to exercise voting 
rights. None of the ordinary shares carry any special rights with regard to control of the Company 
or distributions made by the Company. 

There are no known agreements relating to, or restrictions on, voting rights attached to the 
ordinary shares (other than the 48-hour cut-off for casting proxy votes prior to a General 
Meeting). There are no restrictions on the transfer of shares, and there is no requirement to 
obtain approval for a share transfer. There are no known arrangements under which financial 
rights are held by a person other than the holder of the ordinary shares. There are no known 
limitations on the holding of shares.

POWERS OF DIRECTORS
The Directors are authorised to issue and allot shares and to buy back shares subject to receiving 
shareholder approval at the General Meeting. Such authorities were granted by shareholders at 
the 2022 Annual General Meeting. At the 2023 AGM, it will be proposed that the Directors be 
granted new authorities to allot and buy back shares.

SHARE BUYBACKS
As at 15 September 2023 (the latest practicable date for inclusion in this report), the Company had 
an unexpired authority to repurchase ordinary shares up to a maximum of 10.7 million ordinary 
shares (FY2022: 59 million). As at 15 September 2023, the Company did not hold any shares in 
treasury. Any ordinary shares purchased may be cancelled or held in treasury.

The FY2023 ratio of net debt to headline EBITDA of 0.7 (FY2022: 0.3) is within the Group’s stated 
policy of 2.0 or less over the medium term. The Group’s robust balance sheet and record of strong 
cash generation are more than able to fund immediate investment needs and legacy obligations. 
See note 29 for the definition of headline EBITDA and the calculation of this ratio. 

As part of its capital management, the Group maintains a solid investment grade credit rating to 
ensure access to the widest possible sources of financing and to optimise the resulting cost of 
capital. At 31 July 2023, the Group had a credit rating of BBB+/Baa2 (FY2022: BBB+/Baa2) with 
Standard & Poor’s and Moody’s respectively. 

In the current year a total dividend of 40.2p has been paid, comprising a final dividend of 27.3p paid 
in respect of FY2022 and an interim dividend of 12.9p paid in respect of FY2023. In the prior year a 
total dividend of 38.3p was paid, comprising a final dividend of 26.0p paid in respect of FY2021 and 
an interim dividend of 12.3p paid in respect of FY2022. 

The Board has a progressive dividend policy for future payouts, with the aim of increasing 
dividends in line with the long-term underlying growth in earnings. In setting the level of dividend 
payments, the Board will take into account prevailing economic conditions and future investment 
plans, along with the objective to maintain a minimum dividend cover of at least two times. 

The final dividend for the year ended 31 July 2023 of 28.7p per share was recommended by the 
Board on 21 September 2023 and will be paid to shareholders on 24 November 2023, subject to 
approval by the shareholders. This dividend is payable to all shareholders on the register of 
members at 6.00pm on 20 October 2023 (the record date). 

WAIVER OF DIVIDENDS
The following waived all dividends payable in the year, and all future dividends, on their 
shareholdings in the Company:

26. RESERVES
Retained earnings include the value of Smiths Group plc shares held by the Smiths Industries 
Employee Benefit Trust. In the year the Company issued nil (FY2022: nil) shares to the Trust, the 
Trust purchased 1,553,558 shares (FY2022: 1,069,998 shares) in the market for a consideration 
of £25m (FY2022: £16m) and redeemed 429,291 shares (FY2022: 777,700) to employees for a 
cumulative option cost of £1m (FY2022: £nil). At 31 July 2023, the Trust held 1,742,929 (FY2022: 
618,662) ordinary shares.

Other reserves comprise the capital redemption reserve, revaluation reserve and merger 
reserve, which arose from share repurchases, revaluations of property, plant and equipment, and 
merger accounting for business combinations before the adoption of IFRS, respectively. 

CAPITAL MANAGEMENT
Capital employed comprises total equity adjusted for goodwill recognised directly in reserves, net 
retirement benefit-related assets and liabilities, net litigation provisions relating to non-headline 
items and net debt. The efficiency of the allocation of capital to the divisions is monitored through 
the return on capital employed (ROCE). This ratio is calculated over a rolling 12-month period and 
is the percentage that headline operating profit comprises of monthly average capital employed. 
In FY2023 ROCE was 15.7% (FY2022: 14.2%); see note 29.

Capital structure is based on the Directors’ judgement of the balance required to maintain 
flexibility, whilst achieving an efficient cost of capital. 

HEDGE RESERVE
The hedge reserve on the balance sheet records the cumulative gain or loss on designated 
hedging instruments, and comprises:

NON-CONTROLLING INTEREST
The Group has recorded non-controlling interests of £22m (FY2022: £22m), of which the most 
significant balance is in John Crane Japan Inc., which represented £19m (FY2022: £20m) of the 
total non-controlling interests. 

The non-controlling interest in John Crane Japan Inc. represents a 30% interest. John Crane 
Japan Inc. generated operating profits of £5m in the period (FY2022: £5m), and cash inflows from 
operating activities of £2m (FY2022: £5m). It paid dividends of £1m (FY2022: £1m) and tax of £2m 
(FY2022: £1m). At 31 July 2023, the company contributed £53m (FY2022: £57m) of net assets to 
the Group.

27. ACQUISITIONS
On 5 January 2023, the Group’s Interconnect division acquired 100% of the share capital of 
Plastronics Sockets & Connectors (Plastronics) for consideration of £25m. The acquisition was 
financed using the Group’s own cash resources. Plastronics is a leading supplier of burn-in test 
sockets and patented spring probe contacts for the semiconductor test market segment. This 
acquisition strengthens the existing portfolio of Smiths Interconnect and provides cross-selling 
opportunities in Asia and the US.

The intangible assets recognised on acquisition comprise customer relationships, intellectual 
property and technology. Goodwill represents the expected synergies from the strategic fit of the 
acquisition and the value of the expertise in the assembled workforce. From the date of acquisition 
to 31 July 2023, Plastronics contributed £8m to revenue and less than £1m to profit before taxation 
and amortisation. If the Group had acquired this business from the beginning of the financial year, 
the acquisition would have contributed £15m to revenue and less than £1m to profit before taxation. 

Provisional balances at the date of acquisition have been provided in the table below. The amounts 
remain provisional due to the fair value of the deferred consideration not being finalised.

POST BALANCE SHEET DATE ACQUISITION
On 30 August 2023, the Group acquired the business of Heating & Cooling Products (HCP), for 
consideration of approximately £65m, financed using the Group’s own cash resources. HCP is a 
US-based manufacturer of Heating, Ventilation & Air Conditioning (HVAC) solutions. This 
acquisition will further expand the Flex-Tek division’s presence in the North American HVAC 
market, enabling Smiths to serve customers with an even broader product range.

The acquisition has historically contributed £47m of annualised revenue and £6m of annualised 
profit before taxation. Due to the short time between the completion of the acquisition and the 
announcement date, it has not been possible to complete the determination of the fair values of 
the acquired balance sheet.

HEADLINE CASH MEASURES – CONTINUING OPERATIONS
The Group measure of headline operating cash excludes interest and tax, and includes capital 
expenditure supporting organic growth. The Group uses operating cash-flow for the calculation 
of cash conversion and free cash-flow for management of capital purposes. See note 29 for 
additional details.

The table below reconciles the Group’s net cash-flow from operating activities to headline 
operating cash-flow and free cash-flow:

29. ALTERNATIVE PERFORMANCE MEASURES AND KEY 
PERFORMANCE INDICATORS
The Group uses several alternative performance measures (APMs) in order to provide additional 
useful information on underlying trends and the performance and position of the Group. APMs 
are non-GAAP and not defined by IFRS; therefore, they may not be directly comparable with other 
companies’ APMs and should not be considered a substitute for IFRS measures.

The Group uses these measures, which are common across the industry, for planning and 
reporting purposes, to enhance the comparability of information between reporting periods and 
business units. The measures are also used in discussions with the investment analyst 
community and by credit rating agencies.

We have identified and defined the following key measures which are used within the business by 
management to assess the performance of the Group’s businesses:

–  To add goodwill recognised directly in reserves in respect of subsidiaries 

acquired before 1 August 1998;

–  To eliminate the Group's investment in ICU Medical, Inc. equity and 

deferred consideration contingent on the future share price performance 
of ICU Medical, Inc; and 

–  To eliminate post-retirement benefit assets and liabilities and non-

headline litigation provisions related to John Crane, Inc. and Titeflex 
Corporation, both net of deferred tax, and net debt. 

It is used to monitor capital allocation within the Group. See below for a 
reconciliation from net assets to capital employed.

CAPITAL EXPENDITURE Comprises additions to property, plant and equipment, capitalised 

development and other intangible assets, excluding assets acquired 
through business combinations: see note 1 for an analysis of capital 
expenditure. This measure quantifies the level of capital investment into 
ongoing operations.

NOTES TO THE ACCOUNTSCONTINUEDSMITHS GROUP PLC ANNUAL REPORT FY2023OVERVIEWSTRATEGIC REPORTGOVERNANCEFINANCIAL STATEMENTSDHOP comprises divisional earnings before central costs, finance 
costs and taxation. DHOP is used to monitor divisional performance. A 
reconciliation of DHOP to operating profit is shown in note 1. 

OPERATING CASH-
FLOW

Comprises free cash-flow and excludes cash-flows relating to the 
repayment of lease liabilities, interest and taxation. The measure shows 
how cash is generated from operations in the Group. A reconciliation of 
operating cash-flow is shown in note 28.

187

DIVISIONAL HEADLINE 
OPERATING PROFIT 
(DHOP)

FREE CASH-FLOW

GROSS DEBT

HEADLINE

Free cash-flow is calculated by adjusting the net cash inflow from 
operating activities to include capital expenditure, the repayment of lease 
liabilities, the proceeds from the disposal of property, plant and equipment 
and the investment in financial assets relating to operating activities and 
pensions financing outstanding at the balance sheet date. The measure 
shows cash generated by the Group before discretionary expenditure on 
acquisitions and returns to shareholders. A reconciliation of free cash-flow 
is shown in note 28.

Gross debt is total borrowings (bank, bonds and lease liabilities). It is used 
to provide an indication of the Group's overall level of indebtedness. See 
note 18 for an analysis of gross debt.

The Group has defined a 'headline' measure of performance that excludes 
material non-recurring items or items considered non-operational/
trading in nature. Items excluded from headline are referred to as non-
headline items. This measure is used by the Group to measure and monitor 
performance excluding material non-recurring items or items considered 
non-operational. See note 3 for an analysis of non-headline items.

HEADLINE EBITDA

EBITDA is a widely used profit measure, not defined by IFRS, being 
earnings before interest, taxation, depreciation and amortisation. A 
reconciliation of headline operating profit to headline EBITDA is shown in 
the note below.

NET DEBT

NON-HEADLINE

Net debt is total borrowings (bank, bonds and lease liabilities) less cash 
balances and derivatives used to manage the interest rate risk and currency 
profile of the debt. This measure is used to provide an indication of the Group's 
overall level of indebtedness and is widely used by investors and credit rating 
agencies. See note 18 for an analysis of net cash/(debt). 

The Group has defined a 'headline' measure of performance that excludes 
material non-recurring items or items considered non-operational/trading 
in nature. Items excluded from headline are referred to as non-headline 
items. This is used by the Group to measure and monitor material non-
recurring items or items considered non-operational. See note 3 for an 
analysis of non-headline items.

OPERATING PROFIT

Operating profit is earnings before finance costs and tax. A reconciliation of 
operating profit to profit before tax is shown on the income statement on page 
130. This common measure is used by the Group to measure and monitor 
performance.

RETURN ON CAPITAL 
EMPLOYED (ROCE)

Smiths ROCE is calculated over a rolling 12-month period and is the 
percentage that headline operating profit represents of the monthly 
average capital employed on a rolling 12-month basis. This measure of 
return on invested resources is used to monitor performance and capital 
allocation within the Group. See below for Group ROCE and note 1 for 
divisional headline operating profit and divisional capital employed. 

The key performance indicators (KPIs) used by management to assess the performance of the 
Group’s businesses are as follows:

KPI term

Definition and purpose

DIVIDEND COVER – 
HEADLINE

Dividend cover is the ratio of headline earnings per share (see note 5) to 
dividend per share (see note 25). This commonly used measure indicates 
the number of times the dividend in a financial year is covered by headline 
earnings.

EARNINGS PER SHARE 
(EPS) GROWTH

EPS growth is the growth in headline basic EPS (see note 5), on a reported 
basis. EPS growth is used to measure and monitor performance.

FREE CASH-FLOW (AS 
A % OF OPERATING 
PROFIT)

This measure is defined as free cash-flow divided by headline operating 
profit averaged over a three-year performance period. This cash 
generation measure is used by the Group as a performance measure for 
remuneration purposes. 

GREENHOUSE GAS 
(GHG) EMISSIONS 
REDUCTION

GHG reduction is calculated as the percentage change in normalised 
Scope 1 & 2 GHG emissions. Normalised is calculated as tCO2e per £m of 
revenue. This measure is used to monitor environmental performance.

NOTES TO THE ACCOUNTSCONTINUEDSMITHS GROUP PLC ANNUAL REPORT FY2023OVERVIEWSTRATEGIC REPORTGOVERNANCEFINANCIAL STATEMENTS188

KPI term

Definition and purpose

GROSS VITALITY

Gross Vitality is calculated as the percentage of revenue derived from new 
products and services launched in the last five years. This measure is used 
to monitor the effectiveness of the Group's new product development and 
commercialisation.

MY SAY ENGAGEMENT 
SCORE

The overall score in our My Say employee engagement survey. The 
biannual survey is undertaken Group-wide. This measure is used by the 
Group to monitor employee engagement.

OPERATING CASH 
CONVERSION

Comprises headline operating cash-flow, excluding restructuring costs, 
as a percentage of headline operating profit. This measure is used to show 
the proportion of headline operating profit converted into cash-flow from 
operations before investment, finance costs, non-headline items and 
taxation. The calculation is shown in note 28.

OPERATING PROFIT 
MARGIN

Operating profit margin is calculated by dividing headline operating profit 
by revenue. This measure is used to monitor the Group’s ability to drive 
profitable growth and control costs.

ORGANIC GROWTH

Organic growth adjusts the movement in headline performance to exclude 
the impact of foreign exchange and acquisitions. Organic growth is used by 
the Group to aid comparability when monitoring performance.

ORGANIC 
REVENUE GROWTH 
(REMUNERATION)

Organic revenue growth (remuneration) is compounded annualised growth 
in revenue after excluding the impact of foreign exchange and acquisitions. 
The measure used for remuneration differs from organic revenue growth 
in that it is calculated on a compounded annualised basis. This measure 
has historically been used by the Group for aligning remuneration with 
business performance. 

PERCENTAGE OF 
SENIOR LEADERSHIP 
POSITIONS TAKEN BY 
FEMALES

R&D CASH COSTS AS A 
% OF SALES

Percentage of senior leadership positions taken by females is calculated 
as the percentage of senior leadership roles (G14+ group) held by females. 
This measure is used by the Group to monitor diversity performance.

This measure is defined as the cash cost of research and development 
activities (including capitalised R&D, R&D directly charged to the P&L and 
customer-funded projects) as a percentage of revenue. Innovation is an 
important driver of sustainable growth for the Group and this measures 
our investment in research and development to drive innovation.

RECORDABLE 
INCIDENT RATE (RIR)

Recordable Incident Rate is calculated as the number of recordable 
incidents – where an incident requires medical attention beyond first aid 
– per 100 colleagues, per year across Smiths. This measure is used by the 
Group to monitor health and safety performance.

CAPITAL EMPLOYED
Capital employed is a non-statutory measure of invested resources. It comprises statutory net 
assets adjusted to add goodwill recognised directly in reserves in respect of subsidiaries acquired 
before 1 August 1998 of £478m (FY2022: £478m), to eliminate the Group’s investment in ICU 
Medical, Inc. equity and deferred consideration contingent on the future share price performance 
of ICU Medical, Inc. and to eliminate post-retirement benefit assets and liabilities and non-
headline litigation provisions related to John Crane, Inc. and Titeflex Corporation, both net of 
related tax, and net debt. 

Net assets
Adjust for: 
Goodwill recognised directly in reserves

COMPANY ACCOUNTING POLICIES
BASIS OF PREPARATION
These financial statements were prepared in accordance with Financial Reporting Standard 101 
Reduced Disclosure Framework (FRS 101). In preparing these financial statements, the Company 
applies the recognition, measurement and disclosure requirements of UK-adopted international 
accounting standards (Adopted IFRSs), but makes amendments where necessary in order to 
comply with Companies Act 2006 and has set out below where advantage of the FRS 101 
disclosure exemptions has been taken.

These accounts have been prepared on a going concern basis and under the historical cost 
convention modified to include revaluation of certain financial instruments, share options and 
pension assets and liabilities held at fair value.

As permitted by Section 408(3) of the Companies Act 2006, the Company’s income statement and 
statement of comprehensive income have not been presented. As permitted by Section 408(2), 
information about the Company’s employee numbers and costs is not presented. 

GOING CONCERN
The Directors are satisfied that the Group, (of which the Company is the holding company) has 
adequate resources to continue to operate for a period not less than 12 months from the date of 
approval of the financial statements and that there are no material uncertainties around their 
assessment. Accordingly, the Directors continue to adopt the going concern basis of accounting. 
Details of the going concern assessment for the Group are provided in the accounting policies 
note of the consolidated financial statements.

EXEMPTIONS FROM THE REQUIREMENTS OF IFRS APPLIED IN ACCORDANCE WITH FRS 101
The following exemptions from the requirements of IFRS have been applied in the preparation of 
these financial statements, in accordance with FRS 101: 

 – Paragraphs 45(b) and 46 to 52 of IFRS 2, ‘Share-based payment’ (details of the number and 

weighted-average exercise prices of share options, and how the fair value of goods or services 
received was determined);

 – IFRS 7, ‘Financial Instruments: Disclosures’;

 – Paragraphs 91 to 99 of IFRS 13, ‘Fair value measurement’ (disclosure of valuation techniques 

and inputs used for fair value measurement of assets and liabilities);

 – Paragraph 38 of IAS 1, ‘Presentation of financial statements’ comparative information 

requirements in respect of:
 – paragraph 79(a)(iv) of IAS 1;
 – paragraph 73(e) of IAS 16 ‘Property, plant and equipment’;

 – The following paragraphs of IAS 1, ‘Presentation of financial statements’:

 – 10(d) (statement of cash-flows);
 – 16 (statement of compliance with all IFRS);
 – 38A (requirement for minimum of two primary statements, including cash flow statements);
 – 38B-D (additional comparative information);

 – 111 (cash flow statement information); and
 – 134-136 (capital management disclosures).

 – IAS 7, ‘Statement of cash-flows’

 – Paragraph 30 and 31 of IAS 8 ‘Accounting policies, changes in accounting estimates and errors’ 
(requirement for the disclosure of information when an entity has not applied a new IFRS that 
has been issued but is not yet effective)

 – Paragraph 17 of IAS 24, ‘Related party disclosures’ (key management compensation)

 – The requirements in IAS 24, ‘Related party disclosures’ to disclose related party transactions 

entered into between two or more members of a group.

 – The requirements of paragraphs 52 and 58 of IFRS 16 Leases

SIGNIFICANT JUDGEMENTS, KEY ASSUMPTIONS AND ESTIMATES
The preparation of the accounts in conformity with generally accepted accounting principles 
requires management to make estimates and judgements that affect the reported amounts of 
assets and liabilities and disclosure of contingent assets and liabilities at the date of the accounts 
and the reported amounts of revenues and expenses during the reporting period. Actual results 
may differ from these estimates.

The key sources of estimation uncertainty together with the significant judgements and 
assumptions used in these Parent Company financial statements are set out below.

SOURCES OF ESTIMATION UNCERTAINTY
Taxation
The Company has recognised deferred tax assets of £40m (FY2022: £66m) relating to revenue 
losses brought forward. The recognition of these assets requires management to make 
significant estimates as to the ability to recover them against the unwind of other tax positions 
and forecast UK taxable profits of the tax group. Further detail on the Company’s deferred 
taxation position is included in note 4.

Retirement benefits
Determining the value of the future defined benefit obligation involves significant estimates in 
respect of the assumptions used to calculate present values. These include future mortality, 
discount rate and inflation. The Company uses previous experience and independent actuarial 
advice to select the values for critical estimates. A portion of the Company’s pension liabilities are 
insured via bulk annuity policies that match all or part of the scheme obligation to identified 
groups of pensioners. These assets are valued by an external qualified actuary at the actuarial 
valuation of the corresponding liability, reflecting this matching relationship.

The Company’s principal defined benefit pension plans have been closed so that no future 
benefits are accrued. Critical estimates for these plans, and the effect of variances in these 
estimates, are disclosed in note 8 to the consolidated financial statements.

SMITHS GROUP PLC COMPANY ACCOUNTSCONTINUEDSMITHS GROUP PLC ANNUAL REPORT FY2023OVERVIEWSTRATEGIC REPORTGOVERNANCEFINANCIAL STATEMENTS200

SIGNIFICANT JUDGEMENTS MADE IN APPLYING ACCOUNTING POLICIES
Taxation
As stated in the previous section ‘Sources of estimation uncertainty’, the Company has 
recognised deferred tax assets of £40m (FY2022: £66m) relating to revenue losses brought 
forward. The decision to recognise deferred tax assets requires judgement in determining 
whether the Company will be able to utilise historical tax losses in future periods. It has been 
concluded that there are sufficient taxable profits in future periods to support recognition.

Retirement benefits
At 31 July 2023 the Company has recognised £195m of retirement benefit assets (FY2022: £309m), 
which arises from the rights of the employers to recover the surplus at the end of the life of the 
scheme. 

The recognition of this surplus is a significant judgement. There is judgement required in 
determining whether an unconditional right of refund exists based on the provisions of the 
relevant Trust deed and rules. Having taken legal advice with regard to the rights of the Company 
under the relevant Trust deed and rules, it has been determined that the surplus is recoverable by 
the Company and therefore can be recognised. If the pension schemes were wound up while they 
still had members, the schemes would need to buy out the benefits of all members. The buyouts 
would cost significantly more than the carrying value of the scheme liabilities within these 
financial statements which are calculated in accordance with IAS 19: Employee benefits.

FOREIGN CURRENCIES
Foreign currency transactions are recorded at the exchange rate ruling on the date of 
transaction. Foreign exchange gains and losses resulting from the settlement of such 
transactions, and from the retranslation at year-end exchange rates of monetary assets and 
liabilities denominated in foreign currencies, are recognised in the profit and loss account.

LEASES
At the commencement date of the lease, the Company recognises lease liabilities measured at 
the present value of lease payments to be made over the lease term, which includes periods 
covered by renewal options the Company is reasonably certain to exercise. In calculating the 
present value of lease payments, the Company uses the incremental borrowing rate at the lease 
commencement date.

The Company recognises right of use assets at the commencement date of the lease. Right of use 
assets are measured at cost including the amount of lease liabilities recognised and initial direct 
costs incurred, less any incentives granted by the lessor. Right of use assets are subject to 
impairment and are depreciated over the shorter of the lease term and the useful life of the right 
of use asset.

The Company has a buildings lease with a remaining term of five months. Other leases with lease 
terms of 12 months or less and leases of office equipment with low value (typically below £5,000) 
are recognised as an expense on a straight-line basis over the lease term with the Company 
having applied ‘short-term lease’ and ‘lease of low-value assets’ recognition exemptions.

INVESTMENTS IN AND LOANS TO GROUP COMPANIES
The Company’s investments in shares in Group companies are stated at cost less provision for 
impairment. Any impairment is charged to the profit and loss account as it arises.

The recoverability of intercompany loans is assessed applying the methodology of IFRS 9 by 
looking at the credit quality of the subsidiary and any support available to the entity. These 
calculations require the use of estimates including projected future cash-flows and other future 
events. The application of the expected credit loss model has not had a material impact on the 
Company’s loan receivables provisioning position.

FINANCIAL INSTRUMENTS
The policies disclosed in the Group accounting policies on pages 135 to 143 for recognition, 
measurement and presentation of financial instruments are applied in the Company accounts.

TAXATION
Deferred tax is provided using the balance sheet liability method. A deferred tax asset is recognised 
where it is probable that future taxable income will be sufficient to utilise the available relief. 

Deferred tax is provided on temporary differences arising on investments in subsidiaries, except 
where the timing of the reversal of the temporary difference is controlled by the Company and it is 
probable that the temporary difference will not reverse in the foreseeable future.

PROVISIONS
Provisions for disposal indemnities, restructuring costs, property dilapidations and legal claims 
are recognised when: the Company has a legal or constructive obligation as a result of a past 
event; it is probable that an outflow of resources will be required to settle the obligation; and the 
amount has been reliably estimated. Provisions are not recognised for future operating losses.

Provisions are discounted where the time value of money is material.

RETIREMENT BENEFITS
The Company has both defined benefit and defined contribution plans. The policies disclosed 
in the Group accounting policies on pages 135 to 143 for recognition, measurement and 
presentation of retirement benefits are applied in the Company accounts. Note 8 to the 
consolidated accounts explains the valuation basis for the Company’s retirement benefit 
schemes assets and liabilities.

SHARE-BASED PAYMENT
The Company operates a number of equity-settled and cash-settled share-based 
compensation plans. 

The fair value of the shares or share options granted is recognised over the vesting period to 
reflect the value of the employee services received. The charge relating to grants to employees of 
the Company is recognised as an expense in the profit and loss account and the charge for grants 
to employees of other Group companies is recognised as an investment in the relevant subsidiary. 

The fair value of options granted, excluding the impact of any non-market vesting conditions, is 
calculated using established option pricing models, principally binomial models. The probability 
of meeting non-market vesting conditions, which include profitability targets, is used to estimate 
the number of share options that are likely to vest. 

SMITHS GROUP PLC COMPANY ACCOUNTSCONTINUEDSMITHS GROUP PLC ANNUAL REPORT FY2023OVERVIEWSTRATEGIC REPORTGOVERNANCEFINANCIAL STATEMENTSFor cash-settled share-based payment schemes, a liability is recognised based on the fair value 
of the payment earned by the balance sheet date. For equity-settled share-based payment 
schemes, the corresponding credit is recognised directly in reserves. 

DIVIDENDS
Dividends are recognised as a liability in the period in which they are authorised. The interim 
dividend is recognised when it is paid and the final dividend is recognised when it has been 
approved by shareholders at the Annual General Meeting.

Loans due to subsidiaries are offset against loans due from subsidiaries only to the extent that 
there is a legal right of set-off. At 31 July 2023 £nil of loans payable are offset against loans 
receivable (FY2022: £1,664m). The Company has large offsetting loan balances because it uses 
loans to reduce its foreign currency exposures and separately monitor net cash generated from 
trading activities.

relating to losses £51m (FY22: £36m), share-based payments £1m (FY22: £3m) and other £2m 
(FY22: £2m).

From 1 April 2023, the rate increases from 19% to 25%. Deferred tax, as at 31 July 2023 has been

At 31 July 2023, all of the issued share capital was in free issue. All issued shares are fully paid. 
See note 9 to the consolidated accounts for information about share schemes, including total 
shares under options and options exercisable at the balance sheet date. During the year, the 
Company received £nil (FY2022: £2m) on the issue of shares in respect of the exercise of options 
awarded under various share option schemes. 

Smiths Industries Employee Benefit Trust
The retained earnings include the purchase of Smiths Group plc shares by the Smiths Industries 
Employee Benefit Trust, and the issue of these shares upon the exercise of share options. The 
consideration paid was £25m (2022: £16m) and £1m (2022: £nil) was received as a result of 
employees exercising share options under the SAYE. At 31 July 2023 the Trust held 1,742,929 
(2022: 618,662) ordinary shares.

Distributable profits
Smiths Group plc, the Parent Company of the Group, holds investments in subsidiaries and 
operates as a financing entity for the Group. Its profits are derived from dividend receipts, 
royalties, corporate recharges, and loan interests from its subsidiary companies. Prior to the 
declaration of interim and final dividends to shareholders, the Board conducts a review of the 
level of distributable profits of the Parent Company. This ensures the profits provide sufficient 
coverage for dividend payments; see note 26 in the Group accounts for a discussion of capital 
management and the factors which the Board considers when proposing dividends. 

In accordance with the UK Companies Act 2006 Section 831(1), a public company may only make 
a distribution if, after fulfilling this distribution, the amount of its net assets is not less than the 
aggregate of its called-up share capital and non-distributable reserves as it appears in the 
relevant accounts. The Company establishes what is realised and unrealised in accordance 
with the guidance provided by ICAEW TECH 02/17BL and the requirements of UK law.

Profits available for distribution at 31 July 2023 and 31 July 2022 were comprised as follows:

Other reserves
Other reserves arose from the cancellation of the share premium arising from an equity-funded 
acquisition in the year ended 30 July 1988.

Differential between consolidated and Parent Company net assets
The Group’s consolidated balance sheet shows net assets that are £31m lower (FY2022: £185m 
lower) than the net assets shown on the Parent Company’s balance sheet. This deficit principally 
arose in 2007 when the Group returned £2.1bn of capital to shareholders, creating a net asset 
deficit of £1.9bn. Earnings retained within the Group have subsequently reduced this deficit.

12. CONTINGENT LIABILITIES
The Company has provided guarantees and arranged letter of credit facilities to support 
the Group’s pension plans. The current amount outstanding under letters of credit is £56m 
(FY2022: £56m). The Company has guaranteed the US$800m revolving credit facility available 
to a subsidiary.

13. POST BALANCE SHEET EVENT
Details of the proposed final dividend announced since the end of the reporting period are given 
in note 25 to the Group consolidated financial statements.
