Strategic 
Report

Governance

Financial 
Statements

Other 
Information

We have a lean and highly 
decentralised structure with 
only three layers – companies, 
sectors and Group. 

Our portfolio of life-saving technology companies 
are locally managed and place operational resources 
close to their customers.

This gives us the agility to respond quickly to our 
customers’ needs and to changes in our end markets.

Our companies are individual legal entities, managed by their own board of directors, with the freedom 
to set their own growth strategy. This drives accountability for performance and good governance. 
Each company is focused on growing organically and inorganically in a specific global niche market.

Chair’s statement

Continuity in  
a year of change

Our purpose-led approach and 
Sustainable Growth Model continue 
to drive strong growth, high returns 
and positive impact for stakeholders. 
These fundamental principles remain 
as the foundations for our sustainable 
growth over the years ahead.

On behalf of the Board, I would like to thank Andrew 
for his remarkable leadership at Halma. I would also 
like to extend my personal thanks for his support and 
knowledge-sharing as I stepped into the role as Chair. 
I wish Andrew well for the future. 

Looking ahead with confidence 
I was attracted to Halma by its purpose-driven 
approach. The positive impact that the Group has 
on the world remains at the core of our strategy. We 
are structured to deliver sustainable growth through 
our decentralised operating model, which places our 
companies close to their customers and end markets. 
We have entrepreneurial talent, a positive culture and 
an ambition to deliver on our purpose. 

With the support of our great people and companies, I 
am confident that we will continue our long track record 
of growth, and deliver a positive impact on communities 
worldwide through our innovative products and services, 
and our charitable partnerships, in the years ahead.

Annual Board evaluation

Record results delivered 
Once again, it is pleasing to report that the Group 
delivered record results and, through our people, 
products and services, increased the positive impact 
that we have made. I would like to thank all of our 
colleagues around the world for their support and 
dedication to Halma over the past year. 

Continuity in a year of change 
Looking back over the year, while there were notable 
changes in our executive management team – with 
the appointment of a new Group Chief Executive 
and Chief Financial Officer – the fundamentals of our 
purpose-led approach and Sustainable Growth Model 
remained the same. I am delighted that the Board’s 
planning and execution for this succession delivered 
two strong candidates – in Marc Ronchetti and Steve 
Gunning – who are well equipped to continue Halma’s 
strategic evolution and growth story. On behalf of 
my Board colleagues, I congratulate them on their 
appointments and wish them every success in their 
respective roles. 

I would like to thank Andrew Williams who, prior to 
his retirement as Group Chief Executive, led the Group 
for over 18 years. During his tenure, Halma delivered 
revenue and profit growth of 10% per annum on average, 
an annual increase in dividend per share of 5% or more 
and, as at 31 March 2023, an increase of over 2,000% 
in Halma’s share price. In recent years, Andrew refined 
our purpose to align the Group’s focus on growing a 
safer, cleaner, healthier future for everyone, every day. 
He developed our strategic Growth Enablers, increased 
diversity at Board and senior management levels, 
and navigated the Group through the credit crisis 
and COVID pandemic – while always putting our 
employees, customers, shareholders and other key 
stakeholders at the heart of his decision-making.

Letter from Andrew Williams

Delivering  
continued success

Halma has greater potential 
now than at any time in its 
history. I am excited to see 
what the future will bring.

It has been a privilege and a pleasure to lead Halma 
for the last 18 years, and to have worked with so many 
talented people to deliver its continued success. Halma 
is a stronger business and has greater opportunities 
today than at any time in its history, due to the 
commitment and outstanding ability of leaders 
and colleagues throughout the Group. I would like 
to thank each one of them for the support, learning 
and enjoyment they have given me during my tenure 
as Group Chief Executive. 

Halma has changed enormously since I joined the 
Group in 1994, constantly adapting to changes in 
our markets and new technologies, yet always keeping 
our customers’ and stakeholders’ needs at our core. 
Our success is underpinned by the solid foundations 
laid in the early 1970s by our founder, David Barber, 
which holistically combine a sustainable growth 
strategy, a simple financial model, and a unique 
organisational design.

We continue to build on these foundations today. 
Halma maintains a disciplined focus on niche markets 
with strong, long-term fundamental growth drivers, 
and a culture which empowers our companies to 
be entrepreneurial – responding with agility to 
new challenges and opportunities. These elements 
continue to be critical in supporting our delivery 
of superior organic and inorganic performance over 
the long term, and I know that this belief is shared by 
Halma’s new Group Chief Executive, Marc Ronchetti. 
I have worked very closely with Marc over the past few 
years, and I am confident that Halma will continue to 
thrive and grow to new heights under his leadership.

As we look to the future, we are seeing a rapid 
increase in the scale of opportunities in our markets. 
Our customers are facing a wider range of intensifying 
factors, many of which are having global impacts. 

These include the effects of climate change, 
increasing threats to the availability of natural 
resources, unprecedented pressures on healthcare 
systems, growing requirements to ensure people’s 
safety and a drive for enhanced efficiency as the 
trends of urbanisation and industrialisation 
continue to strengthen. 

I believe Halma has greater capacity than ever 
before to address these challenges through our 
innovation, intimate customer relationships and 
market knowledge. We have grown not just in terms 
of our size and capabilities, but also in our ambition 
and clarity of direction. We are united by a common 
purpose which drives our growth strategy, aligns our 
portfolio with our customers’ needs, and challenges 
us to have a greater positive impact in the world. 

We have deep expertise in our chosen markets, a 
collaborative culture, and a holistic business strategy 
that has delivered sustainable and resilient growth in 
varying market conditions. One of the achievements 
of Halma in recent years, of which I am most proud, is 
the evolution of a more inclusive culture which nurtures 
the creation of diverse and high-performing leadership 
teams, and the development of extraordinary talent 
at all levels in our Group.

Halma has greater potential now than at any time in 
its history. The scale of the opportunities in the Group’s 
markets is matched by the depth of our capabilities, 
the strength of our leadership teams and the talent 
in our companies. I am excited to see what the 
future will bring.

Group Chief Executive’s review

Record revenue, and record profit 
for the 20th consecutive year

Our performance in the year reflects 
the clarity of our purpose, the 
strength of our Sustainable Growth 
Model, and the hard work and 
dedication of our people.

Marc Ronchetti
Group Chief Executive

Over the last 20 years, our profit before tax (on a 
statutory basis) has increased by over six times, at a 
10% compound annual growth rate. This is a substantial 
achievement given that this period includes major 
economic and geopolitical shocks, such as the Global 
Financial Crisis and Brexit, and, more recently, the 
COVID pandemic and the war in Ukraine. 

For most of the last 20 years, Halma was led by 
Andrew Williams, who stepped down as Group Chief 
Executive at the end of March after 18 years. Over that 
time, he has led the evolution of Halma to become an 
organisation with ever greater ambitions, considerable 
strengths and substantial growth opportunities. I would 
like to thank him for his leadership, the success he has 
created and for his investment in me personally as part 
of the Group Chief Executive transition, and wish him 
all the best after retiring from Halma.

I am excited by the opportunities in front of us and 
believe that we are well-positioned to address them. 
We have a resilient business model and clear growth 
strategy, diverse and high quality leadership teams, and a 
proven ability to adapt and evolve with agility to a rapidly 
changing world. Our robust financial model is underpinned 
by significant growth momentum and is enabling us to 
invest record amounts to help our customers address 
some of the biggest challenges facing the world today, 
and continue our track record of long-term growth.

A strong financial performance
We delivered a strong financial performance in the year. 
Revenue in the year grew by 21% to £1,852.8m, Adjusted1 
profit before taxation increased by 14% to £361.3m and 
Adjusted1 earnings per share was up 17%, well above 
our 10% target. The decrease in Statutory profit before 
taxation of 4% to £291.5m principally reflected the 
non-recurrence of a gain on disposal of a Safety 
Sector business in the prior year.

Record revenue, and record profit for the 20th 
consecutive year
In this, my first review as Group Chief Executive, I am 
pleased to report record revenue and Adjusted1 profit, 
and Halma’s 20th year of consecutive profit growth. 
We delivered strong revenue growth, continued high 
returns, well above our cost of capital, and solid 
cash generation, while at the same time investing 
record amounts, both organically and in acquisitions, 
to support our growth over the medium term.

Our performance in the year reflects the strength of 
our Sustainable Growth Model and the hard work and 
dedication of our people. I would like to thank everyone 
at Halma for their contributions to our success and 
their commitment to growing a safer, cleaner, 
healthier future for everyone, every day.

Driven by our purpose
It is a huge privilege to be leading a business with such 
a strong sense of purpose and inclusive culture, and 
that has a positive impact on millions of lives every day.

Halma’s ability to deliver resilient growth reflects the 
strength of our Sustainable Growth Model (see pages 
18 to 25). Our purpose sits at the heart of this. It unites 
and motivates us to help our customers address many 
of the key challenges facing society and helps us attract 
talented people who share our values. Our Sustainable 
Growth Model gives us the agility and entrepreneurialism 
to respond rapidly to changes in the markets we serve 
and the wider world, and ensures we take a disciplined 
approach to investing in markets with long-term, 
fundamental and highly sustainable growth drivers. 
It also provides a clear financial framework, of strong 
organic growth and margins, high returns and cash 
generation, and continuous reinvestment to expand 
our opportunities for growth.

Adjusted1 profit before taxation

Growth was broadly spread across our sectors, regions 
and companies. We delivered revenue growth in all 
our sectors and regions, including on organic constant 
currency basis, and Adjusted1 profit growth in all sectors.

We delivered continued high returns. Return on Sales1 
was 19.5%, within our KPI target range of 18-22%. This 
compared to an unusually high level (within our target 
range) of 20.7% in the prior year, which had benefited 
from the cost reduction measures implemented during 
the COVID pandemic. Return on Total Invested Capital1 
of 14.8% (2022: 14.6%) remained ahead of our KPI target 
of 12% and well above our estimated weighted average 
cost of capital of 8.9% (2022: 7.1%).

Cash conversion for the year was solid at 78%, compared 
to our KPI target of 90%, and was improved and in line 
with our target at 90% in the second half of the year. 
Our continued cash generation allows us to maintain 
a strong balance sheet, while making substantial 
investments to support our future growth. Our gearing 
ratio (net debt to EBITDA) at the year end was 1.38 times 
(2022: 0.74 times), well within our operating range of up 
to two times. Together, our cash generation and balance 
sheet strength underpin our investment in growth and 
provide capacity to fund acquisitions and our progressive 
dividend policy.

The Board is recommending a 7% increase in the final 
dividend to 12.34p per share (2022: 11.53p per share). 
Together with the 7.86p per share interim dividend, 
this would result in a total dividend for the year of 
20.20p (2022: 18.88p), also up 7%, making this the 
44th consecutive year of dividend per share growth 
of 5% or more.

Record strategic investment to support future growth 
One of Halma’s key strengths is the ability to deliver 
strong performance in the shorter-term and maintain 
a strong balance sheet, while simultaneously making 
substantial investments to support sustainable growth 
over the longer-term. We invested a record sum of over 
half a billion pounds in this financial year, to support our 
future growth. This included investment to expand our 
growth opportunities through acquisitions and organic 
investment in product research and development, 
technology infrastructure, and our people and culture 
so that we can continue to attract, develop, retain, 
and engage the high performing teams that are 
critical to our success.

Substantially increased investment in organic growth
During the year, we further increased investment 
supporting organic growth, for example in new 
product development. R&D expenditure increased 
by £17m to a record £103m and represented 5.5% of 
revenue (2022: 5.6%), remaining well ahead of our 
4% KPI. We also increased investment in our technology 
infrastructure by £7m to £18m to improve our security, 
data and operating technology, both at the company 
level and centrally.

The increase in these investments reflects our companies’ 
confidence in the substantial growth prospects they 
see in their markets. Our products and services have 
never been more relevant than today, as health, safety 
and environmental regulations continue to increase, 
demand for healthcare grows and the world addresses 
ever greater demands on life-critical resources and 
the urgent need to tackle climate change, waste, 
and pollution.

Seven acquisitions completed across all three sectors
We further expanded our opportunities for growth 
through a record investment of £397m in acquisitions 
(maximum total consideration), acquiring the equivalent 
of 5.5% of our prior year profit (after interest), ahead 
of our 5% KPI target. We made seven acquisitions, 
each highly aligned to our purpose. Of these seven 
acquisitions, four are standalone companies with 
the Group, and three are bolt-ons to enhance our 
companies’ technologies and market reach.

The acquisitions were spread geographically across 
North America, Mainland Europe and the UK and 
across our three sectors, with four acquisitions in Safety, 
two in Environmental & Analysis and one in Healthcare. 
Details of the individual acquisitions are contained in the 
relevant sector reviews and in the notes to the Accounts.

We are particularly pleased to see this strong momentum 
in M&A combined with an overall increase in the scale 
of acquisitions, supported by investment in our three 
sector M&A teams over the past 18 months. This activity 
has continued since the period end, with two further 
acquisitions completed in the new financial year for a 
maximum total consideration of approximately £57m.

Investing in our talent and culture
People are at the heart of the Group’s and our 
individual companies’ growth strategies. We are 
committed to supporting their development and 
ensuring that Halma’s culture is highly inclusive. 
In this way, we can recruit, develop and retain the 
very best talent and have a wide diversity of voices 
and experience within our leadership teams.

During the year, we increased investment in the 
development of our leaders, introducing three new 
leadership development programmes, with over 200 
leaders participating in face-to-face learning events 
and 750 participating online. We also recognise that 
the current environment continues to present challenges 
and we therefore invested in support for our people’s

wellbeing, including through our Employee Assistance 
Programme and through flexible working practices 
and enhanced benefits.

One measure of inclusion is gender diversity. Last year, 
we introduced a stretching goal of achieving 40-60% 
gender balance on all company boards by March 2024, 
equivalent to the balance already achieved on the 
Group, Executive and sector boards. While female 
representation on our company boards has increased 
from 22% in 2021 to 29% at 31 March 2023, we 
recognise that we need to accelerate the pace of 
change. We launched a number of initiatives to 
support this, including promoting diverse sourcing 
strategies and inclusive hiring practices, and 
incorporating progress towards our target in the 
bonus element of remuneration for our senior leaders. 
Alongside gender equality, we also want to grow our 
ethnic diversity relative to the markets we operate in 
and remove barriers to leadership for ethnic minority 
groups, and launched a number of initiatives to 
support this aim.

Our seventh global employee engagement survey 
reflected the progress made in the year. Given the 
pressures our people continued to face, I was pleased 
that we continued to have a strong response rate of 
85% and that our overall engagement score remained 
stable at 76%, reflecting the ongoing actions taken 
by our companies to support their people and nurture 
inclusive workplace cultures. We saw our biggest 
improvement in companies providing opportunities 
for our people to learn and grow, and our drive to build 
inclusive businesses was reflected in high engagement 
scores on colleagues feeling they are treated fairly and 
respectfully (83%) and can be their authentic self at 
work (80%). 

I am also proud of the engagement our companies 
and our people have with the communities where 
they operate, and the positive impact we have 
through charitable initiatives. This year, for example, 
we continued to support the humanitarian relief 
effort for Ukraine through raising and matching 
employee donations and providing online support for 
our colleagues. We also completed our Water for Life 
campaign, which, together with our partner WaterAid, 
has provided access to safe, clean water for over 10,000 
villagers in India and sustainable water infrastructure, 
supported by Halma fund raising of over £400,000.

Further detail on our people and culture initiatives is 
given on pages 66 to 71 of this Report.

Executive Board changes
With Andrew Williams retiring as Group Chief Executive 
at the end of the year, and my appointment to that 
role, we were delighted to welcome Steve Gunning to 
Halma as Chief Financial Officer on 16 January 2023. 
He brings a tremendous breadth of experience as a 
FTSE 100 Chief Financial Officer and I look forward to 
working with him as part of my leadership team.

  Halma plc |  Annual Report and Accounts 2023

Shortly after the year end, we announced internally 
that, after five years with Halma, Wendy McMillan, 
Safety Sector Chief Executive, had decided to leave 
Halma to pursue leadership opportunities elsewhere. 
Drawing from the strength and depth in our leadership 
team, we were delighted to be able to appoint Funmi 
Adegoke, currently Group General Counsel and Chief 
Sustainability Officer and a member of the Executive 
Board, to lead the Safety Sector from early July. Funmi 
brings strong strategic, commercial and business 
acumen and considerable experience across multiple 
industries to the Safety Sector Chief Executive role. 
As a result of this move, we were also pleased that 
Constance Baroudel, Environmental & Analysis Sector 
Chief Executive, will take on the additional role of 
Chief Sustainability Officer. 

We also made the decision to restructure the digital 
growth support for our companies. As part of this 
restructure we announced that we would be 
disbanding the central Innovation and Digital team. 
This reflects its achievement over the last six years in 
embedding greater innovation and digital capabilities 
in our companies, and the resultant evolution of our 
companies’ needs towards greater go-to-market 
support which will now be provided by our Technology 
team. As a result, we announced that Inken Braunschmidt, 
Chief Innovation and Digital Officer, will leave Halma at 
the end of June.  

I would like to thank Wendy and Inken for their significant 
contribution to Halma and wish them every success in 
the future.

Our Executive Board comprises a highly experienced 
team, drawn from different backgrounds, with diverse 
talents and capabilities. I am excited to be working 
with them in leading the next stage of Halma’s success.

Increasing sustainability opportunities
Sustainability has always been at the heart of our 
Sustainable Growth Model and our purpose. In recent 
years, the scale and urgency of global sustainability 
challenges, for example, in terms of the changing 
climate, preserving the environment, or protecting 
human health, have grown. We are responding by 
increasing investment in products and solutions 
which help our customers address these issues, and 
by ensuring that we operate in a sustainable way. 

We see substantial growth prospects for our companies 
in sustainability and are increasing the support we 
give to them in understanding sustainability-related 
trends, and in identifying opportunities arising from 
them to grow their businesses. We are also excited by 
acquisitions that deliver on our purpose and long-term 
growth drivers and additionally have significant, long-
term sustainability opportunities, and it is pleasing that 
so many of our standalone acquisitions this year, such 
as FirePro, WEETECH and Deep Trekker, fit this profile. 

We are also contributing by operating in a sustainable 
manner, to ensure that we can continue to grow over 
the long term. During the year, we continued to make 
progress on the two areas identified in 2021 as the 
most important in our own value chain: supporting 
our people and protecting our environment. 

Each of our companies has now set their own bottom-
up targets and action plans to support the Group’s goals 
in these areas. The goals ensure we are focused on the 
substantial growth opportunities for our companies and 
translate simply into a challenge to “do more good” and 
“do less harm”. In terms of protecting our environment, 
we were pleased to see our operational greenhouse gas 
emissions continue to reduce, with a 47% reduction since 
our FY20 baseline and renewable electricity reaching 
62% of total consumption, thereby exceeding our targets.

These direct operational emissions are a small part 
of our broader emissions footprint. The majority of 
our environmental footprint arises within our wider 
value chain and we have focused this year on estimating 
indirect (Scope 3) emissions baselines so that we can 
set appropriate reduction targets in the future. It is 
encouraging that we are already seeing actions in a 
number of companies to reduce Scope 3 emissions, 
including through supplier engagement programmes 
and an increasing focus on sustainable design. 

For the first time this year, our executive remuneration 
incorporated annual energy productivity metrics 
alongside the gender diversity targets mentioned above. 
We consider these metrics aligned to remuneration as a 
good starting point from which they will no doubt evolve 
and it is pleasing to see them driving a focus on gender 
balance and energy conservation within our companies. 

Summary and Outlook 
2023 was a successful year for Halma, reflecting 
the contributions and continued commitment to 
our purpose of everyone in the Group. We delivered 
record revenue and Adjusted1 profit, achieving our 
20th consecutive year of profit growth and our 44th 
consecutive year of dividend per share growth of 5% 
or more. At the same time, we substantially increased 
strategic investment to record levels, increasing our 
opportunities for future growth through organic 
investment and acquisitions, while maintaining a 
strong balance sheet.

We have made a positive start to the new financial 
year. We have a strong order book, and order intake 
in the year to date is broadly in line with revenue and 
ahead of the comparable period last year. Based on 
current market conditions, we expect to deliver good 
organic constant currency1 revenue growth in the year 
ahead, and Return on Sales1 to increase to approximately 
20%. We are well positioned to make further progress 
this year and in the longer term.

Case study

Water for Life

In 2020, Halma launched Water for Life in 
partnership with WaterAid to help raise awareness 
of the daily challenges that millions of people face 
in accessing clean, safe water.

The campaign focused on a network of villages 
in northern India, where the groundwater is 
contaminated with arsenic, which is slowly 
poisoning the local population. 

Over the last two years, together with WaterAid, 
the campaign has:

• Supplied over 18,000 water quality tests, 
using technology donated by Palintest.
• Provided access to safe, clean water for 

over 10,000 villagers.

• Trained 1,800 local volunteers to become 

community water testers.

• Installed clean water systems in 70 schools 

and healthcare facilities.

• Provided safe water to over 7,000 people 

during floods.

To support these initiatives, Halma raised over 
£400,000 to build this new water infrastructure 
and to train local volunteers to continue to keep 
their water supply safe for generations to come. 

Halma has seven water companies in the Group: 
HWM, Palintest, Sensorex, Minicam, Sewertronics, 
Hydreka and Nuvonic. They are all focused on 
solving different parts of the global water challenge. 
One of them, Palintest, makes specialist water 
testing technology that can detect contaminants 
in water, including arsenic.

Chief Financial Officer’s review

Strong growth 
and continued investment

I am pleased to report a strong 
financial performance for the year, 
which included record revenue, record 
profit for the 20th consecutive year, 
and continued high returns.

Steve Gunning
Chief Financial Officer

At the same time, we were able to make substantial 
investments, of over half a billion pounds in aggregate, 
to support our future growth. These included record 
levels of expenditure on research and development, 
technology infrastructure, and acquisitions to 
expand our market opportunities.

These investments were supported by the strength 
of our balance sheet, and by our continued cash 
generation. We expect our strong financial position 
and high levels of cash conversion to underpin 
our growth over the longer term as our companies 
address the significant opportunities in their markets.

Record revenue and profit
Revenue for the year to 31 March 2023 was £1,852.8m 
(2022: £1,525.3m), up 21.5%, which included a strong 
organic performance with organic constant currency2 
revenue growth up by 10.2%. There was a positive effect 
from currency translation of 8.1%, due to the weakness 
in Sterling, and a benefit from recent acquisitions 
(net of disposals) of 3.2%. Investment in our products 
and services to ensure they continue to address our 
customers’ needs enabled us to deliver a resilient 
price performance, which offset the majority of cost 
increases, resulting in only a small decrease in gross 
margin. We estimate that price increases accounted 
for approximately four percentage points of our 
revenue growth, broadly evenly spread across 
the sectors.

Chief Financial Officer’s review

This year, we have divided the Financial review 
into two parts.

This Chief Financial Officer’s review (Part 1) focuses 
on the key financial metrics for the Group: revenue, 
profit, cash generation, organic and inorganic 
investment, and returns.

More detail on our financial performance and 
position, including on our performance by region, 
is given in Part 2, on pages 32 to 37 of this Report.

Details of the performance of our individual 
sectors is given in each of the sector reviews, 
on pages 38 to 55 of this Report.

A strong financial performance
I am pleased to report that the Group delivered a 
strong financial performance for the year, which 
included record revenue, record profit1 for the 20th 
consecutive year, and continued high returns.

This performance was supported by strong and  
broadly-based demand for our products and services, 
and enabled by our Sustainable Growth Model which 
gives our companies considerable autonomy and 
agility, allowing them to respond quickly to new 
growth opportunities and to act rapidly to address 
operational challenges when they arise.

Adjusted1 profit before taxation grew by 14.2% to 
£361.3m (2022: £316.2m). This reflected the increase in 
revenue, partially offset by the reduction in Return on 
Sales2 to 19.5% from the unusually high level of 20.7% 
in the prior year. Adjusted1 profit growth comprised a 
3.1% increase in organic constant currency2 profit, a 
2.1% contribution from acquisitions (net of disposals), 
and a positive effect from currency of 9.0% due to 
the weakening of Sterling. 

Statutory profit before taxation of £291.5m (2022: 
£304.4m) was 4.2% lower; excluding the gain on 
disposal of a Safety Sector business in the prior year, 
Statutory profit before tax would have increased by 
7.8%. There were no disposals made during this financial 
year. Statutory profit before taxation is calculated after 
charging the amortisation and impairment of acquired 
intangible assets of £56.5m (2022: £42.7m) and other 
items of a net £13.3m (2022: £3.1m). There were no 
gains on disposals (2022: £34.0m). Further detail 
on these items is given in note 1 to the Accounts.

Performance broadly based across 
sectors and regions
Our results reflected high levels of demand for our 
products and services, with this demand broadly 
spread across our sectors and regions. This resulted 
in strong revenue growth in all sectors, both on a 
reported and organic constant currency2 basis. While 
there was more variability in sector profitability, all 
sectors grew Adjusted1 profit, and only the Safety 
Sector saw a small decline on an organic constant 
currency2 basis. 

Our two largest regions, the USA and Mainland Europe 
grew strongly on both a reported and organic constant 
currency2 basis. Growth in the UK was slower, but 
compared with an exceptionally strong performance 
in the prior year, while momentum in Asia Pacific 
was affected by lockdowns in China. There was 
strong growth in the smaller other regions.

Further information on regional and sector performance 
is given in the individual sector reviews on pages 38 to 
55 of this Report, and commentary on performance by 
region is given in Part 2 of this review, later in this Report.

Continued high returns
Halma’s Return on Sales2 has exceeded 16% for 38 
consecutive years5. This year’s Return on Sales2 was 
19.5%, within our KPI target range of 18-22%. This year’s 
performance compared to the unusually high levels of 
20.7% in 2022 and 21.1% in 2021, which had benefited 
from lower spend on overheads such as travel and 
marketing during the COVID pandemic and the cost 
reduction measures we decided to take at the onset 
of the pandemic.

  Halma plc |  Annual Report and Accounts 2023

Our Return on Sales2 performance in 2023 reflected 
the impact of increased finance costs given higher 
average levels of indebtedness and rises in interest 
rates. It also included the effect, mainly in the second 
half of the year, of supply chain disruptions in a number 
of companies, principally in the Safety Sector. We 
currently expect these disruptions to ease during the 
2024 financial year and for Return on Sales2 in the 
2024 financial year to be approximately 20%.

We successfully achieved our objective of continuing 
to invest in our businesses while delivering growth, with 
record organic and inorganic investment in the year to 
support our future growth. We maintained a high level 
of Return on Total Invested Capital (ROTIC)2, the post-
tax return on the Group’s total assets including all 
historical goodwill. This year, ROTIC2 increased to 14.8% 
(2022: 14.6%), with the change principally reflecting a 
benefit from exchange rate movements, offsetting the 
effect of a lower level of constant currency earnings 
growth than in the prior year. Our ROTIC remains within 
our target range of 12%-17%. It is also substantially 
above Halma’s Weighted Average Cost of Capital 
(WACC), which is estimated to be 8.9% (2022: 7.1%), 
with the increase mainly a result of higher interest rates.

Record investment to support future growth
All sectors continue to innovate and invest in new 
products, reflecting our companies’ confidence in the 
future growth prospects of their respective markets. 
R&D expenditure as a percentage of revenue remained 
well above our KPI target of 4% at 5.5% (2022: 5.6%), 
increasing by 20% to £102.8m (2022: £85.4m), in line 
with revenue growth.

We are also continuing to invest group-wide in 
automation and technology upgrades, including 
enhanced security, improved data and analytics 
capabilities and upgrades to operating technology 
both at the company level and centrally. Technology 
spend totalled £18m in the 2023 financial year, 
reflecting increased investment of £7m. 

In the year we made a record investment in acquisitions 
of £391.5m (net of cash acquired of £10.1m and including 
acquisition costs). These seven acquisitions were broadly 
spread by both sector and geography. The acquisitions 
completed in the current and prior year contributed to 
revenue this year in line with expectations overall, and 
we expect a good performance from them in the 
future. Details of the acquisitions and investments 
made in the year are given in the sector reviews on 
pages 38 to 55 of the Report and in notes 25 and 14 
to these Accounts.

Solid cash generation and strong financial position
Cash generation is an important component of 
the Halma model, underpinning further investment 
in organic growth, supporting value-enhancing 
acquisitions and funding an increasing dividend 
to shareholders.

We have a KPI target for cash conversion of 90%. 
For the year as a whole, cash conversion was solid at 
78% (2022: 84%), reflecting continued good underlying 
working capital control, but also including strategic 
investment in inventory by a number of companies 
to support supply chain resilience, which resulted in 
cash conversion of 63% in the first half of the year. 
Cash conversion in the second half of the year was 
improved at 90%; we currently expect to deliver a 
strong cash performance in 2024.

Our financial position remains strong, with gearing 
(net debt to EBITDA) of 1.38 times at the year end. 
This was despite significant increases in both organic 
investment and acquisition spend, which resulted in 
net debt (on an IFRS 16 basis which includes lease 
commitments) increasing by £321.9m to £596.7m.

We have substantial available liquidity. In the first half 
of the year, we refinanced our syndicated credit facility, 
which remains at £550m. It now matures in May 2028, 
following the exercise, after the year end, of one of 
two options to extend its maturity for one year. We 
also completed a new Private Placement of c.£330m 
with a seven year average life. Further detail on cash 
generation and our financial position is given in Part 2

Conclusion
Halma is a company I have known and admired 
for many years. Since I joined in January, I have been 
impressed by the clear priority that is given to creating 
value over the longer term, guided by our Sustainable 
Growth Model. Balanced with this is the determination 
to deliver a strong financial performance every year. 
This year’s results are further testimony both to the 
longer term decisions that have been made, and 
that determination. 

I am excited by both the opportunities ahead for 
the Company and by the strength of the Halma team 
that will seek to convert them. The finance team will 
continue to play an important role in providing insights 
to support our sustained delivery of growth and high 
returns. I would like to thank all my colleagues for their 
warm welcome and support, and congratulate them 
on another successful year.

Sustainable Growth Model

1.
Our purpose
We have been a purpose-led 
business for 50 years. It powers every 
decision we make, from choosing our 
markets to finding the right talent. It 
attracts people who want to solve the 
same problems as we do, and keeps 
us focused on the things that 
matter to our business.

p20

Our Sustainable 
Growth Model

We deliver sustainable growth, consistently 
high returns and positive impact.

Each of the elements of our Sustainable Growth 
Model create a self-reinforcing system that gives 
us the resources and flexibility to address new 
opportunities and challenges.

It is the combination and interdependency 
of all of them that enables us to deliver value 
over the long term for all our stakeholders.

5.
Our business model
We have a simple and self-
sustaining financial model which 
supports investment in our Sustainable 
Growth Model. It enables us to deliver 
both strong performance in the short 
term and high and sustainable growth 
and returns in the longer term.

Our DNA
The combination of our 
organisational model and culture is a 
fundamental part of what makes Halma 
a successful, sustainable business. We 
call this Halma’s DNA, and it runs 
through our business at all levels.

3.
Our markets and 
their long-term 
growth drivers 
We choose niches in markets with 
resilient, long-term growth drivers. We 
find niches that are driven by growing 
demand for healthcare, increasing 
scarcity of life-critical resources, 
increasing regulation, and growing 
global efforts to address climate 
change, waste and pollution.

Our purpose 
Our purpose is to grow a safer, 
cleaner, healthier future for everyone, 
every day. By growing in line with our 
purpose, we create sustainable value 
for all our stakeholders and deliver 
a positive impact in the markets 
we serve and beyond.

Our purpose drives every business decision we make. 
It ensures everyone who works with us is focused 
on doing those things that make it happen.

Our companies develop technologies which save 
lives and protect critical infrastructure and services. 
Our technologies solve some of the world’s most 
pressing issues, from air quality and clean water, 
to worker safety and preventable blindness.

Our purpose defines the three broad market 
areas where we choose to operate:

Safety
Protecting people’s safety and the environment 
as populations grow, and enhancing worker safety.

Environment 
Addressing the impacts of climate change, pollution 
and waste, protecting life-critical resources and 
supporting scientific research.

Health
Meeting the increasing demand for better healthcare 
as chronic illness rises, driven by growing and ageing 
populations and lifestyle changes.

We believe these issues are global and long term in 
nature. We expect them to support Halma’s success 
sustainably for the foreseeable future.

By growing in line with our 
purpose, we create sustainable 
value for all our stakeholders and 
deliver a positive impact in the 
markets we serve and beyond.

Our DNA
Halma’s DNA runs through our business at all levels. 
It embodies the core elements of our organisation 
and culture that are inextricably linked to enable 
our success. Even though we have to continuously 
change, these core elements remain constant.

Halma Organisational Genes

and have proved themselves to be fundamental 
drivers in delivering consistent, long-term growth. 
They describe what we will protect while we 
continuously transform ourselves.

Purpose drives us
Our purpose powers every business decision we make, 
from choosing our markets to finding the right talent.

and deliver our purpose. 

Live the purpose
Be passionate about making the world safer, 
cleaner and healthier. See real problems and

Agility is everything
We are built to be responsive. Individual businesses 
make decisions close to our customers. We manage 
our portfolio to respond rapidly when market 
dynamics change.

Embrace the adventure
Continually grow and change, as individuals 
and collectively. Challenge assumptions and 
see opportunities. Seek insight from all directions

businesses. Diverse viewpoints on every team ensure 
we don’t miss a thing.

ambitions into reality. Be agile and responsive

our deep application knowledge.

We invest for the future

and means we can continue to innovate for the future 
regardless of individual short-term market conditions.

We are structured for growth
Individual businesses within the Group have access 
to our internal and external networks, enabling us 
to go faster by learning from the experiences of others. 
Central expertise and capital are available to accelerate 
organic growth, which in turn allow us to continue 
to acquire additional growth and capabilities.

Say yes, and…
Be comfortable with paradox. Choose “Yes, and...” 
to seemingly conflicting priorities. Build for tomorrow 
and deliver today. Have stability and constantly evolve. 
Enjoy autonomy and eagerly collaborate to accomplish 
our goals.

Just be a good person
Play to win, but not at the expense of others. 
Operate with impeccable ethics, transparency 
and integrity in all that you do.

Our markets and their 
long-term growth drivers 
We operate in three broad market areas, 
safety, the environment, and health, which 
are defined by our purpose of growing a safer, 
cleaner, healthier future for everyone, every day.

Our companies operate in niches within these broad market areas. Each of these niches has a high 
exposure to long-term growth drivers. 

These growth drivers reflect demographic trends, including growing, ageing and urbanising populations, 
increasing demands on infrastructure and natural resources, and growing sustainability-related opportunities. 

They are expected to persist over the long-term and reflect fundamental global challenges:

• A growing need to improve the safety and 

• The growing need to protect life-critical 

efficiency of vital industry and infrastructure 
as populations grow and urbanise, and as demand 
for automation and connected industrial and 
infrastructure systems continues to increase.

natural resources as they are increasingly threatened 
by scarcity, pollution and increasing and evolving 
demands like population growth and climate change.

• Increasing demand for healthcare as people 
live longer and the prevalence of chronic health 
conditions increases, as innovation presents new 
options for prevention, diagnosis and treatment, 
and as aspirations to improve efficiency and the 
standard of care increase.

In each of these areas, growth is underpinned 
by increasing safety, health and environmental 
regulation, as governments and regulators demand 
higher standards in response to these challenges.

We operate in more than 20 countries, with major 
operations in the UK, Mainland Europe, the USA 
and Asia Pacific, and supply customers in over 100 
countries, through a variety of routes to market, 
from direct sales to third party distribution.

• Global efforts to address climate change, 

waste and pollution as these impacts become more 
severe and as populations are increasingly affected.

We have a diverse customer base, ranging from small 
businesses to OEMs, who operate in a wide variety of 
sectors, including commercial and public buildings, 
utilities, healthcare, science, the environment, process 
industries, and energy and resources. Further details on 
our customers are given in the individual sector reviews 
on pages 38 to 55 of this report.

Our growth strategy 
Our growth strategy is to acquire small to  
medium-sized companies that are aligned with 
our purpose and to grow them over the long-term.

Managing our portfolio for growth
We look for companies that operate in high-value niches 
that we know well, within the broad market areas of 
safety, the environment, and health. These niches have 
global potential and a high exposure to the long-term 
growth drivers set out in section 3. 

Investing in our companies for growth
We continually invest in our business and our people 
to maintain strong positions in our markets. The highly 
cash generative nature of our companies allows us 
to fund this investment, both to support organic 
growth and drive growth through acquisitions.

We actively manage our portfolio of companies through 
investing in acquisitions in niches adjacent to our existing 
operations which offer new opportunities for growth, 
and through mergers and disposals where market 
conditions change. 

This ensures that our portfolio can sustain strong growth 
and returns over the long term, and that it maintains a 
high degree of resilience given its diversity, supporting 
our aspiration to double our earnings every five years, 
while maintaining a conservative capital structure and 
delivering high returns.

Talent, innovation, technology and sustainability are 
core elements of our growth strategy. This includes 
investment in developing our people, our products and 
services (including through research and development), 
our intellectual property, and our knowledge of the 
markets we serve. 

Our companies’ growth is supported by our 
Growth Enablers (see 25), which leverage a unique 
set of skills and expertise from across the Group, 
powered and coordinated by small central teams. 

How our companies grow
Our companies look at growth 
opportunities that are aligned 
with our purpose across 
three dimensions of Core, 
Convergence and Edge.

•  Core focuses on growing through 

new product development, 
including digital offerings and

Our business model
We have a simple and self-sustaining financial model which 
supports investment in our growth strategy and our scalable 
organisational model, underpinned by Halma’s DNA. It delivers 
strong performance in both the short and longer term.

We are structured for growth
Our structure is simple and lean, with 
only three layers – companies, sectors 
and Group teams – all three of which are 
aligned and rewarded on driving growth. 
This allows for fast decision-making, 
and reduced bureaucracy. 

Our companies
Each company is a separate legal entity 
with a board of directors. This drives 
accountability for performance and good 
governance. It also allows companies 
to drive innovation in their chosen niche 
markets, and be agile and responsive 
to changes in their customers’ needs.

Read more about
How we are structured

Our sectors
Our sector teams are the vital connection 
between our companies and Growth 
Enablers, and drive our M&A efforts. 
They promote internal networks and 
collaboration between companies, 
enabling companies to capitalise on 
broader sector trends.

Group teams
Group teams provide expertise in capital 
management and control frameworks. 
They support our companies through our 
Growth Enablers, oversee our portfolio of 
companies and the allocation of capital, 
set our risk appetite, and ensure 
compliance and good governance.

Continuous reinvestment
We maintain our strong market 
and product positions by continuously 
reinvesting in cash-generative R&D and 
product innovation projects, which drive 
future growth and maintain high returns.

Value-enhancing acquisitions 
We make value-enhancing acquisitions 
in core and adjacent niches, expanding 
our growth opportunities, technology 
capabilities and geographical reach.

Flexibility to invest and grow dividends 
Our strong cash generation not only 
supports continuous reinvestment 
and value-enhancing acquisitions with 
modest levels of financial leverage, but 
also enables us to sustain a progressive 
dividend policy for our shareholders.

We have a sustainable financial model
Our purpose drives our focus on growing 
and acquiring businesses in global niches 
in the safety, environmental, and 
healthcare markets. 

This market focus results in a highly 
sustainable financial model with strong 
organic growth and cash generation 
allowing us to continuously reinvest in 
future growth and acquisitions, as well as 
increasing dividends to investors each year.

Strong organic growth and margins
The foundation of strong and consistent 
organic revenue and profit growth is driven 
by our disciplined focus on niches in global 
markets which have resilient, long-term 
growth drivers, and customer solutions 
that offer consistently superior margins.

High returns and cash generation
We acquire and grow companies that 
have relatively low capital intensity and 
high returns on sales. This, together with 
high rates of revenue growth and margins, 
drives strong returns on capital and 
high levels of cash generation.

Op 1: Strat Comms 
and Brand

Talent and Culture
We ensure Halma has world-class 
teams and high-performance, inclusive 
cultures across all three layers of our 
operating model.

Strategic Communications and Brand
We enable our companies to reach all 
stakeholders by helping them build their 
brand, understand their market needs 
and develop leading positions, using the 
endorsement of the Halma brand where 
it makes sense.

Finance, Legal and Risk
We give our leaders the insight to make 
good decisions, through accurate, timely, 
and actionable financial data, legal advice 
and risk analysis.

We measure our achievements 
and reward performance
We measure our achievements 
through financial and non-financial key 
performance indicators (KPIs), through 
customer satisfaction and the delivery 
of shareholder value.

We continue to review and develop 
our financial and non-financial KPIs 
to ensure they remain relevant to the 
delivery of our strategy and to the 
fulfilment of our purpose.

Rewarding our people
We reward our people for delivering 
superior and sustainable growth and 
returns, also holding them accountable 
for delivering our strategy and complying 
with our control frameworks. Short-term 
incentives based on Economic Value 
Added (profit growth, adjusted for a 
charge for the use of any capital) are 
balanced by longer-term incentives in 
the form of Halma shares.

Setting challenging targets 
We aspire to double our earnings every 
five years while maintaining high returns, 
and set targets for our growth, returns, 
cash generation and investment KPIs. 
We work hard to ensure that we have 
the right culture, talent and diversity 
and set challenging targets for employee 
engagement, health and safety, training 
and sustainability.

Closely monitoring performance 
We closely monitor our companies’ 
performance, strategic plans and 
forecasts. Twice a year, each company 
certifies its compliance, with minimum 
controls for finance, legal and IT; this 
is complemented by independent 
peer reviews of financial performance, 
and internal and external audits.

Through careful selection of our market 
niches and strategic investment, we aim 
to achieve organic growth in excess of 
our blended market growth rate, broadly 
matching revenue and profit growth in 
the medium term.

Organic profit growth at constant currency 
was below our target, principally reflecting 
a reduction in Return on Sales from the 
exceptionally high level in 2022. Organic 
growth over the last five years has averaged 
6.5%, ahead of our target and in line with 
our aspiration to double our profitability 
every five years through a mixture of 
organic and acquired growth.

Organic profit growth is calculated at 
constant currency and measures the 
change in adjusted profit achieved in 
the current year compared with the prior 
year from continuing Group operations.

We buy companies with business and 
market characteristics similar to those 
of existing Halma operations. Acquired 
businesses have to be a good fit with our 
operating culture and strategy in addition 
to being value enhancing financially.

The measure of how successful we are in 
growing our business organically and by 
acquisition coupled with strong financial 
disciplines, including those related to tax 
and capital allocation, is captured in the 
Group’s adjusted earnings per share.

Through careful selection of our market 
niches and targeted strategic investment, 
we aim to achieve organic growth in 
excess of our blended market growth 
rate, broadly matching revenue and 
profit growth in the medium term.

Acquisition profit growth was ahead of our 
target at 5.5% and 9.3% excluding financing 
costs. We completed seven acquisitions for 
a maximum total consideration of £397m, 
a record spend. We have completed two 
further acquisitions since the year end 
and have a healthy pipeline of M&A 
opportunities.

Growth in adjusted earnings per share 
was above our KPI, reflecting organic 
profit growth and a contribution from 
acquisitions, as well as a substantial 
benefit from currency translation. 
Growth in adjusted earnings per share 
over the past five years has averaged 
11.1%, in line with our KPI.

Organic revenue growth at constant currency 
was substantially above our KPI, reflecting 
widespread growth across all sectors and 
regions. Growth was substantially ahead 
of our target in both halves of the year. 
Organic constant currency revenue growth 
has averaged 7.4% over the last five years, 
ahead of our target.

Acquisition profit growth measures the 
annualised profit (net of financing costs) 
from acquisitions made in the year, 
measured at the date of acquisition, 
expressed as a percentage of prior 
year profit.

The Board has established a long-term 

organic growth target of at least 5% pa, 

slightly above the blended long-term 

average growth rate of our markets.

Acquisitions must meet our demanding 
criteria and we continue to have a strong 
pipeline of opportunities to meet our 
minimum 5% growth target.

Adjusted earnings per share is calculated 
as earnings from continuing operations 
attributable to owners of the parent 
before adjustments (as outlined on 
page 198) and the associated taxation 
thereon, including the increase in the 
UK’s corporation tax rate from 19% to 
25% (2022 only), divided by the weighted 
average number of shares in issue during 
the year (net of shares purchased by the 
Group and held as own shares).

We aim for the combination of organic 
and acquisition growth to exceed an 
average of 10% pa over the long term. 
The Directors consider that adjusted 
earnings represent a more consistent 
measure of underlying performance.

Organic revenue growth is calculated 
at constant currency and measures the 
change in revenue achieved in the current 
year compared with the prior year from 
continuing Group operations.

The effect of acquisitions and disposals 
made during the current or prior financial 
year has been eliminated.

The Board has established a long-term 
minimum organic revenue growth target 
of 5% pa, slightly above the blended long- 
term average growth rate of our markets.

Growth in organic profit is a key element 

of the Economic Value Added (EVA) 

performance which forms the basis of 

the annual bonus plan for Group, sector 

and company boards, requiring consistent 

annual and longer-term growth, with 

disciplined financial management. 

See the Annual Remuneration Report 

for details of the EVA calculation.

Growth in acquired profit is the second key 
element of the EVA performance which 
forms the basis of the annual bonus plan 
for Group, sector and company boards, 
requiring consistent annual and longer-
term growth, with disciplined financial 
management.

EPS provides a clear link to the aims of 
the business growth strategy. It is a key 
financial driver for our business and 
provides a clear line of sight for our 
executives. EPS growth is 50% of the 
performance condition attaching to 
the Executive Share Plan.

Organic revenue drives earnings growth 
which contributes to the EVA performance. 
This forms the basis of the annual bonus 
plan for Group, sector and company 
boards, requiring consistent annual 
and longer-term growth with disciplined 
financial management.

We choose to operate in market niches 
which are capable of delivering growth and

returns is a result of maintaining strong 
market and product positions sustained by 
continuing product and process innovation.

Return on Sales remained well above our 
minimum target, at 19.5%, and within our 
longer-term range of 18-22%, although 
below the unusually high levels achieved in 
2021 and 2022. Return on Sales remained 
above our minimum target in each of our 
three sectors. We expect Return on Sales in 
the 2024 financial year to return to levels 
similar to the average of the five years 
prior to the pandemic of around 20%.

We have maintained high levels of R&D 
investment and spending on innovation. 
The successful introduction of new 
products is a key contributor to the 
Group’s ability to build competitive 
advantage and grow organically 
and internationally.

Total R&D spend remained well above our 
KPI target at 5.5% of revenue (2022: 5.6%). 
In absolute terms, R&D expenditure in the 
year increased by £17.4m to £102.8m. 
This increasing investment reflected our 
companies’ confidence in the growth 
prospects of their respective markets. 
In the medium term we expect R&D 
expenditure to continue to increase 
broadly in line with revenue growth.

Halma conducts an annual survey of its 
employees to assess engagement across 
the Group. This provides visibility of 
engagement at the Group, sector 
and company levels.

The baseline for our target was established 
in 2017 when we ran our first global 
employee engagement survey. We were 
pleased to see the employee engagement 
score remain strong this year, achieving 
the same engagement score as last year. 

Total research and development 
expenditure in the financial year 
(both that expensed and capitalised)

continuing operations.

The engagement of employees as measured 
through an externally facilitated survey over 
nine dimensions: engagement, empowerment, 
accountability, collaboration and teamwork, 
communication, development, ethics and 
fair treatment, innovation and leadership.

New products contribute strongly to 
organic growth, maintaining high returns 
and building strong market positions.

Our target remains to match or  
beat the baseline achieved in 2017 
of 74% engagement.

The 4% minimum investment target is 
appropriate to the mix of product life 
cycles and technologies within Halma.

Successful research and development 
investment is a key component of 
sustaining strong growth and returns 
which, in turn, help to drive EVA, EPS and 
ROTIC – all key elements of our annual 
bonus and longer term incentive plans.

As part of our sustainability pillar of 
supporting our people, diversity, equity 
and inclusion is a key focus area. Following 
our success in increasing gender diversity 
at the Halma and Executive Boards, our 
current target is to increase gender 
diversity on our company boards.

This year we have 29% women on 
company boards, increasing from 26% 
last year. Whilst this is an improvement, 
we recognise we need to accelerate the 
pace of change to meet our target for 
all boards to be within a 40–60% gender 
balanced range by 31 March 2024.

The total number of female board 
members as a proportion of the total 
number of Halma company board 
directors (197 company directors as 
at 31 March 2023).

As part of our sustainability pillar of 
protecting our environment, reducing 
our own emissions is a key focus area 
for the Group as a whole and for each 
of our companies.

Scope 1 & 2 emissions have reduced by 
47% since 2020, thereby exceeding our 
target, largely as a result of increasing 
renewable energy, alongside energy 
efficiency initiatives and other operational 
improvements. We have reported our 2020 
Scope 3 baseline and are working towards 
putting in place appropriate Scope 3 targets 
while also reviewing our Scope 1 & 2 targets.

The total reduction in global Scope 1 & 2 
greenhouse gas emissions compared to our 
2020 baseline (as adjusted for acquisitions 
and disposals), with Scope 2 measured 
using a market-based approach that takes 
account of contractual instruments for 
renewable electricity. Full details of our 
definition and measurement are set 
out in our ESG Data Basis of Preparation 
at www.halma.com.

The Group is targeting Net Zero Scope 1 & 2 
emissions by 2040. Our interim target for 
2030, set in line with a 1.5 degree trajectory, 
is to reduce Scope 1 & 2 emissions 42% from 
our 2020 baseline.

All Halma company boards to be within 
a 40–60% gender balance range by 
31 March 2024.

5% of the maximum bonus opportunity 
of our Annual Bonus plan is related to 
achievement of an energy productivity 
target. This target was exceeded this year 
as outlined on page 145 of the Remuneration 
Committee Report. Energy productivity is a 
key action that can be remunerated on an 
annual basis and underpins our achievement 
of these Scope 1 & 2 targets. This applies to 
the annual bonus for the Executive Directors 
and other senior leaders in the business – 
across the Executive and sector boards and 
all MDs and Presidents of Halma companies.

5% of the maximum opportunity of 
our Annual Bonus plan is related to the 
achievement of annual interim targets 
which reflect our 31 March 2024 ambition 
of achieving 40-60% gender balance on 
our company boards. This applies to the 
annual bonus for the Executive Directors 
and other senior leaders in the business – 
across the Executive and sector boards 
and all MDs and Presidents of Halma 
companies. The interim target of 33% 
was not met this year. See page 145.

Health and safety is a top priority for 
the Group. Halma collects details of its 
worldwide reported health and safety 
incidents and encourages all Group 
companies to seek continuous 
improvement in their health 
and safety records and culture.

The Health & Safety AFR performance this 
year was 0.08 (2022: 0.09) representing a 
decrease against last year. We continue 
to promote the importance of health and 
safety and review all reported incidents. 
There are no specific underlying patterns 
which cause concern.

The year-to-date Accident Frequency Rate 
(AFR) is the total number of reportable* 
incidents in the period divided by the 
number of hours worked in that period by 
employees (including temporary staff and 
any overtime) multiplied by 100,000 hours 
(representing the estimated number of 
working hours in an employee’s work 
lifetime). The AFR figure represents an 
indication of how many incidents 
employees will have in their working lives.

The target is set at the lowest rate we have 
achieved as a Group and was re-set at 
<0.02 in 2021.

*  Specified major injury incidents are reportable 

incidents which result in more than three 
working days lost.

Revenue growth in all regions 
Our revenue performance by region reflected broadly-
based demand for the Group’s products and services, 
with all regions delivering revenue growth on both a 
reported and an organic constant currency basis. 
Reported growth rates in each region were impacted 
to differing extents by acquisitions (net of disposals), 
and, outside the UK, positive effects from foreign 
currency translation, given the relative weakness of 
Sterling. On an organic constant currency basis, 
there was strong growth in our two largest regions, 
the USA and Mainland Europe, good growth in the 
UK against a strong prior year comparative, and a 
solid performance in Asia despite weakness in China 
as a result of lockdowns. The smaller other regions 
performed strongly.

Strong and broadly-based growth in the USA
Revenue in the USA increased by 30.7%, and the USA 
remains our largest revenue destination, accounting for 
42% of Group revenue, an increase of three percentage 
points compared to the prior year. Reported revenue 
included a 4.6% contribution from acquisitions (net of 
disposals), and a positive effect of 14.0% from foreign 
exchange translation. Organic constant currency 
revenue increased 12.3%, with growth evenly spread 
across the three sectors, reflecting good momentum 
in the vast majority of subsectors.

Strong growth in Mainland Europe, led by Safety 
and Healthcare Sectors
Mainland Europe revenue was 22.2% higher, or up 
13.5% on an organic constant currency basis. Reported 
revenue included a 5.0% contribution from acquisitions 
(net of disposals), and a positive effect of 3.7% from 
foreign exchange translation. 

There was strong growth in the Safety Sector, led by the 
two largest subsectors, Fire Safety and Urban Safety, 
and in the Healthcare Sector, with a notably strong 
performance in the ophthalmology market within 
Therapeutic Solutions. Growth in the Environmental 
& Analysis Sector was more modest, with a strong 
performance in Environmental Monitoring partly offset 
by weaker trends in Water Analysis and Treatment.

Good organic growth in the UK
UK revenue was 4.4% higher, or up 6.0% on an organic 
constant currency basis. There was a negative effect 
on reported revenue from the prior year disposal, which 
was only partly offset by the benefit from acquisitions. 
The largest sector, Safety, delivered good growth, led 
by its largest subsector, Fire Safety. In the smaller Safety 
subsectors, while there was only marginal growth in 
Urban Safety following the end of a significant road 
safety contract, there was strong momentum in the 
Industrial Safety subsector. Healthcare grew strongly, 
reflecting demand for our communication technologies 
within the Healthcare Assessment & Analytics subsector.

Adjusted1 profit increased by 10.9% in the first half 
and by 17.5% in the second half. There was a first half/
second half split of Adjusted1 profit of 48%/52%, 
compared to our typical 45%/55% pattern. Organic 
profit at constant currency increased by 1.9% in the 
first half, and by 4.3% in the second half, resulting 
in growth of 3.1% for the year. 

Central costs, which include our Growth Enabler 
functions, increased from £30.9m in 2022 to £38.6m 
below our previous guidance as a result of strong 
cost control and revisions to the phasing of technology 
project spend. The increase reflected investment in our 
Growth Enabler teams, technology infrastructure and 
talent to support our future growth, and investment in 
reconnecting our Halma networks. In 2024, we expect 
central costs to be approximately £44m, including the 
revised phasing of technology spend referred to above.

Currency effects on reported revenue and profit
Halma reports its results in Sterling. Our other key 
trading currencies are the US Dollar, Euro and to a 
lesser extent the Swiss Franc, the Chinese Renminbi 
and the Australian Dollar. Almost 50% of Group 
revenue is denominated in US Dollars, approximately 
26% in Sterling and approximately 12% in Euros.

The Group has both translational and transactional 
currency exposure. Translational exposures are 
not hedged, except for net investment hedges. 
Transactional exposures, after matching currency 
of revenue with currency costs wherever practical, 
are hedged using forward exchange contracts for a 
proportion (up to 75%) of the remaining forecast net 
transaction flows where there is a reasonable certainty 
of an exposure. We hedge up to 12 months forward.

Sterling weakened on average in the year, principally 
in the first half. This gave rise to a positive currency 
translation impact of 8.1% on revenue and 9.0% 
on profit for the full year.

There was only modest growth within the Environmental 
& Analysis Sector, given lower order intake from UK 
utilities in Water Analysis and Treatment, and weaker 
demand in Gas Detection.

Strong growth in other regions despite 
weakness in China
Revenue from territories outside the UK/Mainland 
Europe/the USA grew by 18.1%, which was ahead 
of our 10% KPI growth target. 

Asia Pacific revenue increased 12.6%, but by only 3.3% 
on an organic constant currency basis. This reflected 
an organic constant currency revenue decline in China, 
our largest market in the region at approximately 6% of 
Group revenue, mainly as a result of COVID lockdowns. 
This was partly offset by strong growth in India and 
Australasia, the second and third largest markets in 
the region. Performance by sector was mixed, with 
good organic constant currency growth in the Safety 
Sector and a strong performance by the Environmental 
& Analysis Sector. In Healthcare, however, organic 
constant currency revenue declined. Reported revenue 
included a 2.1% contribution from acquisitions (net of 
the impact of disposals), and a positive effect of 7.2% 
from foreign exchange translation. 

Other regions, which represent 8% of Group revenue, 
reported revenue 31.5% higher on a reported basis, 
and up 15.6% on an organic constant currency basis 
reflecting strong growth in all sectors.

First and second half profit performance
Revenue grew by 18.8% in the first half of the year and 
by 24.0% in the second half, with second half revenue 
11.6% higher than revenue in the first. Organic constant 
currency revenue increased by 10.2%, comprising a 9.5% 
increase in the first half and growth of 10.9% in the 
second half. There was a positive effect of 8.3% from 
currency translation in the first half, and of 7.9% in the 
second half, giving a positive effect of 8.1% for the year 
as a whole. Acquisitions (net of disposals) had a positive 
effect of 3.2%, comprising a 1.0% positive effect in the 
first half and 5.2% in the second half.

Financial review continued

Based on the current mix of currency denominated 
revenue and profit, a 1% movement in the US Dollar 
relative to Sterling changes revenue by approximately 
£9m and profit by approximately £2m. Similarly, a 1% 
movement in the Euro changes revenue by approximately 
£2m and profit by approximately £0.5m. If Sterling 
weakens against foreign currencies, this has a positive 
impact on revenue and profit as overseas earnings are 
translated into Sterling.

If currency rates for the financial year to the end of 
March 2024 were US Dollar 1.237/ Euro 1.138 relative 
to Sterling respectively, and assuming a constant 
mix of currency results, driven by the strengthening 
of Sterling versus the US Dollar we would expect 
approximately a £20m negative revenue and a £4m 
negative profit impact compared to the financial year 
to the end of March 2023, with the majority of the 
impact in the first half of the year.

Solid cash generation
Halma’s operations have continually been cash 
generative. Cash generated from operations in the year 
was £325.2m (2022: £293.4m) and adjusted operating 

cash flow, which excludes operating cash adjusting 
items, and includes net cash capital expenditure, was 
£293.2m (2022: £273.2m) which represented a cash 
conversion of 78% (2022: 84%) of Adjusted operating 
profit1. Cash conversion was 63% in the first half of 
the year, reflecting strategic investment in inventory 
to support supply chain resilience, but was stronger 
at 90% in the second half of the year.

Overall, the strategic investment in inventory had an 
impact on working capital, with an outflow of £95.7m, 
comprising changes in inventory, receivables and 
creditors (2022: outflow of £62.7m), which also reflected 
the strong revenue growth in the period. These effects 
would have been more significant were it not for the 
continued good underlying control of working capital by 
our companies. Adjusted operating cash flow is defined 
in note 3 to the Accounts. 

A summary of the year’s cash flow is shown in the tables 
below. The largest outflows in the year were in relation 
to acquisitions, dividends and taxation paid. Acquisition 
of businesses including cash and debt acquired and fees 
increased to £391.5m (2022: £164.4m), reflecting the

year. Taxation paid increased to £67.2m (2022: £56.0m).

Substantial funding capacity and liquidity; 
financing cost well managed
The Group has access to competitively priced committed 
debt finance, providing good liquidity. Group treasury 
policy remains conservative and no speculative 
transactions are undertaken.

We have a strong balance sheet and substantial available 
liquidity. At the beginning of the 2023 financial  year, 
we refinanced our syndicated revolving credit facility. 
The new facility remains at £550m. It now matures in 
May 2028, following the exercise after the year end of 
one of two one-year extension options. In addition, 
we completed a new Private Placement issuance of 
c.£330m in May 2022. The issuance consists of Sterling, 
Euro, US Dollar and Swiss Franc tranches and matures 
in July 2032, with an amortisation profile giving it a 
seven year average life.

The financial covenants on these facilities are for 
leverage (net debt /adjusted EBITDA) to not be more 
than three and a half times and for adjusted interest 
cover to be not less than four times. The Group continues 
to operate well within its banking covenants with 
significant headroom under each financial ratio.

At 31 March 2023, net debt was £596.7m, a combination 
of £677.3m of debt, £87.9m of IFRS 16 lease liabilities and 
£168.5m of cash held around the world to finance local 
operations. Net debt at 31 March 2022 was £274.8m.

The gearing ratio at the year-end (net debt to 
EBITDA) was 1.38 times (2022: 0.74 times). Net 
debt represented 7% (2022: 3%) of the Group’s  
year-end market capitalisation.

The net financing cost in the Income Statement of 
£16.9m was higher than the prior year (2022: £8.4m). 
This reflected a higher weighted average interest rate 
in the year (see the “Average debt and interest rates” 
table on page 36 for more information) and a higher 
average level of indebtedness due to acquisitions. The 
Private Placement issuance has resulted in an increased 
proportion of fixed coupon debt on the Group’s balance 
sheet (at 56% at 31 March 2023, compared to 30% 
at 31 March 2022, excluding leases), which positions 
us well ahead of any increases in interest rates, and 
secures debt financing sufficient to meet the Group’s 
likely medium-term requirements. We would expect 
the net financing cost for the 2024 financial year to 
be approximately £29m, if no further acquisitions were 
to be made. This reflects higher average net debt and 
a forecast higher weighted average interest rate in 
the year. 

The net pension financing impact under IAS 19 is included 
in the net financing costs. This year the Group recognised 
a gain of £1.1m (2022: charge of £0.3m).

Group tax rate decreased
The Group has major operating subsidiaries in a 
number of countries and the Group’s effective tax 
rate is a blend of these national tax rates applied 
to locally generated profits.

The Group’s effective tax rate on adjusted profit was 
lower than the prior year at 20.2% (2022: 21.6%) due 
to one-off credits. Based on the latest forecast mix 
of adjusted profits for the year to 31 March 2024 we 
currently anticipate the Group effective tax rate to 
be higher at approximately 22% of adjusted profits, 
reflecting the increase in the UK corporation tax 
rate to 25% from 1 April 2023.

On 2 April 2019, the European Commission (EC) 
published its final decision that the UK controlled 
Finance Company Partial Exemption (FCPE) constituted 
State Aid. In common with many other UK companies, 
Halma has benefited from the FCPE and had appealed 
against the European Commission’s decision, as had 
the UK Government. The EU General Court delivered 
its decision on 8 June 2022. The ruling was in favour 
of the European Commission but in August 2022 the 
UK Government and the taxpayer have appealed this 
decision. Following receipt of charging notices from 
HM Revenue & Customs (HMRC) we made a payment 
in February 2021 of £13.9m to HMRC in respect of tax, 
and in May 2021 made a further payment of 
approximately £0.8m in respect of interest.

Whilst the EU General Court was in favour of the EC, 
our assessment is that there are strong grounds for 
appeal and the appeal is expected to be successful. 
As a result, and given the appeal process is expected 
to take more than a year, we continue to recognise 
a non-current receivable of £14.7m in the balance sheet. 

Capital allocation and funding priorities
Halma aims to deliver high returns, measured by ROTIC², 
well in excess of our cost of capital. We invest to deliver 
the future earnings growth and strong cash returns which 
enable us to achieve this aim on a sustainable basis, and 
our capital allocation priorities remain as follows:

• Investment for organic growth: Organic growth is our 
first priority and is driven by investment in our existing 
businesses, including through capital expenditure, 
innovation in digital growth and new products, 
international expansion and the development of 
our people.

• Value-enhancing acquisitions: We supplement organic 

growth with acquisitions in current and adjacent market 
niches, aligned with our purpose. This brings new 
technology, intellectual property and talent into the 
Group and expands our market reach, keeping Halma 
well-positioned in growing markets over the long term.

• Regular and increasing returns to shareholders: We 

have maintained a progressive dividend policy for over 
40 years and this is our preferred route for delivering 
regular cash returns to shareholders without impacting 
on our investment to grow our business.

Continued investment for organic growth
All sectors continue to innovate and invest in new 
products, with R&D spend determined by each individual 
Halma company. R&D expenditure as a percentage of 
revenue remained well above our KPI target of 4% at 
5.5% (2022: 5.6%). In absolute terms, this meant that 
R&D expenditure increased by £17.4m to £102.8m (2022: 
£85.4m), and grew in line with revenue. This increasing 
investment reflects our companies’ confidence in the 
growth prospects of their respective markets. In the 
medium term we expect R&D expenditure to continue 
to increase broadly in line with revenue growth.

Under IFRS accounting rules we are required to capitalise 
certain development projects and amortise the cost over 
an appropriate period, which we determine as three 
years. This year we capitalised £15.8m (2022: £13.4m), 
impaired £0.5m (2022: £2.9m) and amortised £8.5m 
(2022: £7.0m). The closing intangible asset carried on the 
Consolidated Balance Sheet, after a £1.2m gain (2022: 
£1.3m gain) relating to foreign exchange was £49.6m 
(2022: £41.7m). All R&D projects requiring capitalisation 
are subject to rigorous review and approval processes 
by the relevant sector board and Group financial control.

Capital expenditure on property, plant, equipment and 
vehicles, computer software and other intangible assets 
was £30.1m (2022: £26.6m), with last year reflecting 
a lower spend as a result of pandemic constraints. 
Expenditure was principally on plant, equipment and 
vehicles. We anticipate capital expenditure to increase 
to approximately £40m in the coming year, reflecting 
investment in the expansion of manufacturing facilities 
and automation to support future growth.

Lease right-of-use asset additions and remeasurements 
were £32.2m (2022: £23.0m). This included additions of 
£9.3m as a result of acquisitions made in the year, and 
the commencement of new leases and extensions or 
renewals of existing leases.

Value-enhancing acquisitions and investments 
Acquisitions and disposals are a key component of our 
Sustainable Growth Model, as they keep our portfolio 
of companies focused on markets which have strong 
growth opportunities over the medium and long term.

In the year we made seven acquisitions at a cost of  
£386.9m (net of cash acquired of £10.1m and including 
acquisition costs). In addition, we paid £4.6m in 
contingent consideration for acquisitions made in 
prior years, giving a total spend of £391.5m. We also 
made two small strategic minority investments totalling 
£6.7m, including an incremental funding round for a 
minority investment in the Safety Sector. We made 
two further acquisitions following the year end, for a 
maximum total consideration of approximately £57m.

Details of the acquisitions and investments made in the 
year are given in the sector reviews on pages 38 to 55 of 
the Report and in notes 25 and 14 to these Accounts. 

Regular and increasing returns for shareholders 
Adjusted earnings per share increased by 16.6% to 
76.34p (2022: 65.48p). Statutory basic earnings per 
share decreased by 3.9% to 62.04p (2022: 64.54p), 
as the prior year included a gain on the disposal of 
a Safety Sector business. 

The Board is recommending a 7.0% increase in the 
final dividend to 12.34p per share (2022: 11.53p per 
share), which together with the 7.86p per share 
interim dividend gives a total dividend per share 
of 20.20p (2022: 18.88p), up 7.0% in total.

Dividend cover (the ratio of adjusted profit after 
tax to dividends paid and proposed) is 3.78 times 
(2022: 3.47 times).

The plans’ actuarial valuation reviews, rather than 
the accounting basis, are used to evaluate the level 
of any cash payments into the plan. This year these 
contributions amounted to £15.6m. Following a triennial 
actuarial valuation of the two UK pension plans in the 
2021/22 financial year, the cash contributions were 
agreed with the trustees aimed at eliminating 
the deficit. 

During the 2022/23 financial year the aggregate 
payments made since the last triennial actuarial 
valuation, coupled with the performance of the plan 
assets and movement in the liabilities resulted in the 
Halma Group Pension Plan being funded over the 
trustees’ secondary funding target and close to the 
expected current valuation on a solvency basis. As 
a result, it has been agreed with the trustees of the 
Halma Group Pension Plan that contributions will be 
suspended until 1 April 2025, when they will either fall 
due or be superseded by cash contributions agreed 
with the trustees in respect of the latest triennial 
actuarial valuation. 

We therefore expect contributions to the schemes in 
the 2023/24 financial year to be £4.2m. In the event that 
these payments result in a surplus on winding up of the 
schemes, the Group has an unconditional right to a 
refund under the plan rules.

Steve Gunning
Chief Financial Officer

The final dividend for the financial year ended March 
2023 is subject to approval by shareholders at the 
Annual General Meeting on 20 July 2023 and, if approved, 
will be paid on 18 August 2023 to shareholders on the 
register at 14 July 2023.

We aim to increase dividends per share each year, 
while maintaining a prudent level of dividend cover, 
and declare approximately 35-40% of the anticipated 
total dividend as an interim dividend. The Board’s 
determination of the proposed final dividend increase 
this year took into account the Group’s financial 
performance, economic and geopolitical uncertainty, 
the Group’s continued balance sheet strength and 
medium-term organic constant currency growth.

Pensions update
The Group accounts for post-retirement benefits 
in accordance with IAS 19 Employee Benefits. The 
Consolidated Balance Sheet reflects the net accounting 
surplus on our pension plans as at 31 March 2023 based 
on the market value of assets at that date and the 
valuation of liabilities using discount rates derived 
from year end AA corporate bond yields. Lane Clark & 
Peacock LLP assist the Company in setting assumptions, 
and the valuation work is performed by Mercer Limited.

We closed the two UK defined benefit (DB) plans to new 
members in 2002. In December 2014 we ceased future 
accrual within these plans with future pension benefits 
earned within the Group’s Defined Contribution (DC) 
pension arrangements. These two plans represent over 
95% of consolidated plan liabilities.

On an IAS 19 basis, before deferred taxes, the Group’s 
DB plans at 31 March 2023 had a net surplus of £37.9m 
(2022: £30.5m surplus). The value of plan assets 
decreased to £284.7m (2022: £347.6m). Plan liabilities 
decreased to £246.8m (2022: £317.1m) due to the 
increase in the discount rate (2.80% to 4.75%) being 
greater than the decrease in the long-term inflation 
rate (3.6% to 3.3%). Mortality assumptions include 
this year an assumption for post pandemic mortality 
experience in line with market practices.

Diversifying into  
high-growth markets

The global energy transition is picking 
up speed as economies shift investment 
towards a more sustainable future. Key 
to making this shift happen is the move 
towards renewable energy. But what about 
the energy infrastructure that underpins 
the move to a Net Zero future?

Upgrading the grid 
To distribute electricity into our homes and businesses, 
a technology called switchgear is used throughout 
the transmission and distribution networks. This 
technology helps protect against sudden surges 
of electricity and also adjusts electricity to the 
right voltage so it can be transported safely through 
the powerlines. Switchgear components, such as 
transformers and circuit breakers, are traditionally 
insulated by a gas called SF6. This gas stops any 
sparks from an electrical fault before they can 
cause a fire or explosion. 

environment. Historically, the company’s bigger 
markets were in the oil and gas distribution, 
and chemical processing industries. Spotting an 
opportunity to grow, OsecoElfab is increasingly 
diversifying to support the move to a greener future. 

One example is in switchgear use for electricity 
distribution. Clean air – with all its humidity and 
impurities removed – is a far greener alternative to 
SF6 for insulating switchgear technology. However, 
to make it work as an effective insulator, it requires 
specialised components. 

However, SF6 is one of the most potent greenhouse 
gases in existence. With a warming potential of 
23,900 times that of CO2, SF6 can remain in the 
atmosphere for up to 3,200 years. Although the gas 
is slowly being phased out in electricity distribution, 
there are technical challenges in safely replacing it. 

Spotting new growth opportunities
OsecoElfab, a Halma company based in the US 
and UK, designs and manufactures pressure safety 
solutions to protect people, equipment and the

By working closely with its customers, OsecoElfab 
has customised its rupture disc technology to provide 
a solution for switchgear insulated by clean air. Its 
rupture discs are specialist pressure release devices 
that activate in milliseconds to release heat and 
pressure. This protects against dangerous surges 
caused by electrical faults which could lead to fires 
that damage the equipment or, worse, explosions 
that endanger life. Thanks to OsecoElfab’s technology, 
switchgear can now be designed that keep people 
safe without the damaging SF6 gas being released.

As technology advances and regulations evolve in 
support of a Net Zero future, OsecoElfab continues 
to partner with industry leaders to solve their 
problems and grow faster in support of a safer 
and cleaner future.

Safety Sector performance in the year
The Safety Sector delivered a solid performance. Revenue 
growth was very strong. Return on Sales1 was however 
lower than historic norms as a consequence of supply 
chain impacts related to electronic components. 
Investment in future growth continued, including 
through increased R&D spend and acquisitions. 

Revenue of £745.6m (2022: £641.4m) was 16.2% higher 
than in the prior year. Year-on-year revenue growth on 
an organic constant currency1 basis was strong at 11.2%, 
with double digit growth in both halves of the year. 
Growth was broadly spread, with all but two companies 
delivering organic constant currency1 revenue growth. 
Sector companies continued to be agile in responding 
to customer demand while addressing supply chain 
challenges, although disruptions in a number of 
companies contributed to a small decline in Adjusted1 
profit on an organic constant currency1 basis.

Revenue growth on an organic constant currency1 
basis was broadly spread across all four subsectors, 
with three achieving double-digit growth. Industrial 
Safety’s performance reflected strong execution in 
two subsector companies and Power Safety saw 
strong demand for interlock products in the electrical 
sector. Growth on a reported basis also benefited 
from acquisitions including WEETECH Holding GmbH 
(WEETECH) during the year. The largest subsector, 
Fire Safety continued to grow strongly, having seen 
substantial growth in the prior year, supported by 
organic constant currency1 revenue growth in all 
companies. Urban Safety organic constant currency1 
revenue growth was good overall, although performance 
was mixed with strong demand for automatic access 
solutions and elevator systems partially offset by the 
end of a significant road safety contract.

The sector’s revenue performance by geography 
reflected these themes. There was strong growth in 
the sector’s largest two geographies, the USA and 
Mainland Europe, both on a reported and organic 
constant currency1 basis. This included strong growth in 
Industrial Safety in the USA, with Fire Safety and Urban 
Safety performing strongly in Mainland Europe. The UK 
saw good growth on an organic constant currency1 basis 
led by its largest subsector, Fire Safety, and there was 
strong momentum in Industrial Safety. Urban Safety 
delivered a more mixed performance with the effect of 
the end of the road safety contract mentioned above 
offsetting good performance elsewhere. On a reported 
basis, UK growth was lower, due to the non-recurrence 
of revenue from a disposal in the prior year. Asia Pacific 
also saw good growth on an organic constant currency1 
basis, led by a strong performance in Fire Safety, which 
more than offset a decline in Urban Safety principally as 
a result of lockdowns, and a non-recurring road safety 
contract in China.

Profit1 grew by 4.3% to £152.5m (2022: £146.2m), and 
decreased by 1.1% on an organic constant currency1 
basis. Return on Sales1 decreased by 230 basis points to 
20.5% (2022: 22.8%). This reflected a strong comparator, 
which had benefited from cost savings made during the 
pandemic, and supply chain disruptions in a number of 
companies. These resulted in higher costs for electronic 
components used in devices with current regulatory 
approvals, and costs in recertifying devices to use 
alternative components. We expect these disruptions 
to ease over the current financial year. R&D expenditure 
of £41.0m remained at a good level, representing 5.5% 
of revenue (2022: £35.6m; 5.6% of revenue). 

The sector made four acquisitions in the year for an 
aggregate consideration of approximately £207m 
(on a cash and debt free basis and excluding acquisition 
costs). These included two new standalone companies 
within the sector: WEETECH, which designs and 
manufactures critical electrical testing technology, 
purchased in October 2022; and FirePro Systems 
Limited, a designer and manufacturer of aerosol-based 
fire suppression systems, which was acquired shortly 
before the financial year end. Sector companies also 
made two bolt-on acquisitions: Apollo Fire Detectors 
acquired Thermocable (Flexible Elements) Ltd, a 
developer and manufacturer of linear heat detectors; 
and Sentric purchased ZoneGreen Limited, a provider 
of rail depot protection solutions. 

The impact of acquisitions was a positive effect of 2.4% 
on revenue and 2.3% on profit. The disposal of Texecom 
in the first half of the prior year had a negative effect of 
2.6% on revenue and 1.4% on profit. Currency exchange 
movements had a positive effect of 5.2% on revenue 
and 4.5% on profit.

Growth driven by electrification 

Ensuring the safety
of electric transport

The transport sector is responsible for 20% of global 
carbon emissions. Supporting the electrification of 
this sector is a crucial step towards creating a more 
sustainable future. For the past few years, changes in 
global regulatory standards for the safe electrification 
of transport systems have not kept pace with demand, 
but now governments across the world are catching 
up fast as the trend for electrification accelerates. 

Regulation underpinning long-term growth 
As the world moves to a more sustainable future, 
safety regulation will have an increasingly important 
role to play. The Safety Sector’s acquisition of WEETECH 
is part of a new strategic subsector focused on power 
safety. This subsector has the potential to grow fast, 
powered by the safety demands of the energy 
transition, and is fully aligned with our purpose.

Making electric transport safer
With businesses and consumers looking to reduce their 
carbon footprint, rapid technological advances have 
been made to accelerate electrification in transport. 
However, this brings a new set of technical challenges. 
Modern electric trains need higher voltages to operate 
increasingly complex electrical systems. Faulty wiring 
or a malfunction can have disastrous consequences, 
making testing of these systems critical to ensure 
their safe operation.

In October 2022, Halma acquired WEETECH, a German 
company that designs and manufactures electrical 
testing technology to ensure high voltage systems 
are safe to use and remain compliant with increasing 
safety regulation. WEETECH provides customised 
testing solutions for cabling harnesses – multiple 
cables bound together to transmit electrical power 
– ensuring they are fit for purpose while protecting 
workers in these dangerous testing environments. 

As the uptake in electric transport 
accelerates, safety needs are driving 
more regulations. WEETECH’s testing 
technology ensures that greener modes 
of transport can be used safely for 
customers around the world. I am 
pleased that WEETECH has joined 
the Safety Sector – together we can 
support the energy transition while 
helping to protect workers in 
dangerous testing environments.

Growing through 
partnerships

Two-thirds of the global population is 
expected to live in urban areas by 2050. 
While there are significant benefits to 
urbanisation, it creates unintended 
consequences, including air pollution. 

Poor air quality severely impacts people’s long-term 
health and wellbeing. Many European countries are 
now developing clean air strategies to introduce 
tighter regulations to protect people’s health.

Air quality monitoring
Smart technology is key in tackling the global 
air quality issue and making sure new regulations 
are met. With the help of monitoring solutions, air 
quality can be measured to help identify levels and 
sources of pollution. This enables city authorities to 
make informed decisions about ways to improve it. 

Sensit is a Halma gas detection company based in 
the US, with 40 years of experience making products 
that help detect leaks in gas pipes. Responding to the 
rapid growth opportunity in the air quality monitoring 
market in Europe, Sensit wanted to use its expertise to 
develop a high-quality air monitoring solution. However, 
it had limited experience of selling in the European 
market and lacked the local regulatory knowledge, 
which was far more complex than in the US. 

Crowcon, a Halma company based in the UK, 
specialises in gas detection technology that can 
identify hazardous gases before they become a 
problem. The company was keen to grow into the 
air quality monitoring market in Europe but did not 
have the right expertise to customise its technology.

They soon realised they could combine their 
individual strengths and resources to seize 
this growth opportunity.

Collaboration to tackle air pollution
Using Sensit’s product expertise and Crowcon’s 
market knowledge, they joined forces to develop 
a co-branded product, made by Sensit and sold by 
Crowcon. The collaboration resulted in a new series 
of air quality monitors sold into the European market 
that provide real-time insights into the air we breathe.

One example is installed in Kent, UK. Sandwiched 
between the busy port of Sheerness to the north 
and the M2 motorway to the south, the area regularly 
exceeds national limits for air pollution. The local 
council has developed an Air Quality Action Plan 
for improving air quality over the next few years. 
As part of its plan, it has installed the Sensit by 
Crowcon products to monitor air pollution. 

Together these Halma companies have collaborated 
to grow their businesses. By working together and 
using each other’s strengths to solve a problem 
they are helping to grow a safer, cleaner, future 
for everyone, every day.

and optical analysis. They are supported by high 
levels of customer responsiveness and often leverage 
digital, optical and optoelectronic expertise.

They serve a wide variety of end markets with 
applications across a very broad range of sectors and 
customers. Their end markets include: water and waste 
water management and treatment, including for water 
utilities; gas analysis and detection; food, beverage, 
medical and bio-medical; communications; aquaculture; 
research and science; inspection and maintenance of 
infrastructure in water, for example, dams and offshore 
wind turbines; and a variety of industrial markets.

The Environmental & Analysis Sector’s  
long-term growth drivers
The sector’s long-term growth is sustained by rising 
demand for life-critical resources, the impact of climate 
change, increasing environmental regulations and 
worldwide population growth with rising standards of 
living. It is underpinned by our ability to design, develop 
and manufacture innovative, high-technology detection 
and analysis solutions. 

The increasingly urgent need to address climate change 
is creating new opportunities in many of the sector’s 
markets. It is driving new policies globally, including 
initiatives to meet Net Zero commitments through 
energy transition and sectoral decarbonisation plans, 
as well as plans to increase adaptation and resilience. 
Combined with the biodiversity crisis and an increasing 
focus on plastics and waste, it is also driving new 
regulatory initiatives to preserve life-critical resources. 
These include initiatives such as, in the UK, Ofwat’s 
investigations into waste water treatment and internal 
sewer flooding to prevent environmental degradation. 

These and similar initiatives are creating growing 
long-term opportunities for our companies to help 
their customers, for example, to prevent emissions, 
detect leaks and analyse air and water quality, and 
to support new technologies to address these issues, 
such as renewable energy and storage, sustainable 
food systems and mobility in cities.

Environmental & Analysis continued

Environmental & Analysis Sector  
performance in the year
The Environmental & Analysis Sector delivered a good 
performance. Revenue of £552.1m (2022: £442.9m) 
was 24.7% higher than in the prior year, and up 9.1% 
on an organic constant currency1 basis. Sector growth 
was driven by increasing demand and supported by 
strong execution, in particular from the sector’s 
largest companies. 

All subsectors grew revenue on an organic constant 
currency1 basis. Organic constant currency1 growth 
was led by Environmental Monitoring, where growth 
on a reported basis also benefited from the acquisition 
of Deep Trekker, Inc. (Deep Trekker) during the year. 
Organic constant currency1 revenue growth was also 
strong in our gas detection companies, supported 
by increasing demand for products addressing the 
minimisation of emissions. Both the Optical Analysis 
and the Water Analysis & Treatment subsectors saw 
good organic constant currency1 revenue growth, with 
Photonics within Optical Analysis continuing to benefit 
from increasing demand for technologies that support 
the building of digital and data capabilities; and within 
the Water Analysis & Treatment subsector, revenue 
grew more strongly in the second half of the year 
following a pick-up in project tenders from UK utilities, 
which offset lower order intake in our water testing and 
disinfection companies, principally relating to products 
related to consumer discretionary end-markets.

By region, the USA accounts for half of the sector’s 
revenue, and reported the highest organic constant 
currency1 growth at 12%. Performance was strong 
across all four subsectors, supported by further growth 
in a continuing large photonics contract within Optical 
Analysis, increased demand including larger customer 
orders in our gas detection companies, in products 
supporting the transition to new sources of energy in 
Environmental Monitoring, and international expansion 
from our water infrastructure companies within Water 
Analysis & Treatment. Asia Pacific also grew strongly, 
at 10% on an organic constant currency1 basis, driven 
by substantial growth in the flow and pressure control 
market within Environmental Monitoring in India and 
China. Organic constant currency1 revenue growth 
was more modest in the UK and Mainland Europe, 
with growth reflecting strengthening UK water 
project spend in the second half of the year, and 
strong demand in our gas detection companies in 
Mainland Europe.

In the other regions which represent about 6% of 
the sector’s revenue, our gas detection companies 
continued to benefit from a recovery in the energy 
sector, which drove strong organic growth in Africa, 
Near & Middle East, and there was a good contribution 
to reported revenue growth in the other smaller regions 
from the acquisition of Deep Trekker.

Profit1 grew by 22.2% to £134.2m (2022: £109.8m), or by 
7.1% on an organic constant currency1 basis. Return on 
Sales1 decreased by 50 basis points to 24.3% (2022: 24.8%). 
This reflected a return to a level similar to the years 
before the pandemic. Gross margin was marginally 
higher, driven by business mix and good management 
of pricing. R&D expenditure of £28.6m was maintained 
at a good level at 5.2% of revenue (2022: £22.8m; 
5.1% of revenue). 

The sector made one standalone acquisition during 
the year for a consideration of approximately £38m: 
Deep Trekker, which is a market-leading manufacturer 
of remotely operated underwater robots used for 
inspection, surveying, analysis and maintenance, 
was purchased in April 2022. Ocean Insight also made 
a small bolt-on acquisition. Since the year end, there 
have been two further acquisitions in the sector for a 
maximum total consideration of approximately £57m: 
Sewertronics Sp. Z o.o., which designs and manufactures 
equipment and associated consumables for wastewater 
pipeline rehabilitation, was purchased as a standalone 
company in May 2023; and Visual Imaging Resources LLC, 
which distributes and services wastewater inspection 
equipment in North America, was purchased in April 
2023 as a bolt-on to Minicam. This good momentum 
reflects the investment made in a dedicated M&A 
team for the Environmental & Analysis Sector, and the 
increasing ability of our individual companies to make 
bolt-on acquisitions to enhance their technological 
capabilities and market reach. 

The impact of acquisitions during the year contributed 
growth of 6.6% to revenue, and 5.9% to profit. Currency 
exchange movements had a positive effect of 9.0% on 
revenue and 9.2% on profit.

New capabilities in environmental monitoring

A Deep Trekker 
submersible robot

The global transition to renewable energy is creating 
a new type of energy infrastructure. Hydroelectric 
dams, solar farms and offshore wind farms are now 
competing with power stations that use fossil fuels 
to become the main energy source of the future. 
The offshore wind farm industry alone is expected 
to increase tenfold over the next decade and is on 
track to supply 20% of global energy by 20301.

All energy systems require continuous inspection 
and maintenance to ensure safe operation, and 
clean energy is no different. However, many of 
these renewable energy structures present new 
challenges for monitoring teams. Offshore wind 
farms in particular face a unique set of challenges, 
due to critical infrastructure being submerged in deep 
waters and subject to intense pressures from the sea. 

The traditional method is to send a specialist dive 
team. This can be costly, time-consuming, and, 
most importantly, dangerous for the divers. As 
a result, operators are looking for alternative 
approaches that reduce the risk to life.

Remotely Operated Vehicles (ROVs) are unmanned 
submersible devices deployed from a boat and 
controlled remotely from the surface. They offer 
a safer and more cost-effective alternative for 
both routine operations and emergency 
investigation response. 

In April 2022 Halma acquired Deep Trekker, based 
in Ontario, Canada, one of the largest underwater 
robotics manufacturers in the world. Its submersible 
robots monitor and maintain critical underwater 
infrastructure, including offshore wind farms, 
without putting human life at risk.

Deep Trekker is not only helping support the global 
transition to clean energy but also plays a key role 
in the efforts to maintain the health of our marine 
environments. Its ROVs are used to examine the 
health of sea and plant life and detect changes 
in the underwater environment without having 
to send a diver into the water or risk contamination 
to the environment. It also enables ocean science 
and research by offering a cost-effective underwater 
research alternative. 

The addition of Deep Trekker is aligned to Halma’s 
purpose and is a valuable addition to our Environmental 
& Analysis Sector. It adds exciting capabilities to our 
environmental monitoring sector and expands our 
growth opportunities in a fast-growing global niche.

Deep Trekker brings new capabilities 
and complements our strong portfolio 
in the Environmental & Analysis Sector. 
Its technology not only improves the 
safety of underwater inspections but 
plays an important role in ensuring 
a cleaner environment, which is well 
aligned to our purpose.

Growing by  
solving customer problems 

Demand for healthcare is growing fast. 
As global populations get older the need 
for better testing, diagnosis and treatment 
is increasing. In China alone, there will 
be 400 million people over the age of 60 
by 2040, almost double what it is today.

Longer Pump’s close relationship with the 
customer, its understanding of the sector’s 
regulatory requirements, and its ability to move 
fast and adapt its existing technology meant that 
it could provide a high-quality solution at speed.

Growing into new markets
Longer Pump’s deep application expertise and its 
focus on solving customer problems has enabled 
it to keep growing not just in its home market of 
China, but also internationally. 

Since joining Halma ten years ago, Longer Pump 
has taken advantage of Halma’s Growth Enablers 
to seize new opportunities and today it sells in more 
than 130 markets, including the US and Europe. 

850 million

People worldwide with chronic kidney disease*

This huge demographic shift is being replicated in 
countries all over the world and it is driving demand 
for better healthcare to keep our ageing populations 
healthier for longer. 

Longer Pump is a Halma company based in Baoding 
in northern China. Its innovative healthcare solutions 
are helping to solve some of these global challenges. 
The company makes pumps that can control the flow 
of fluids with an accuracy a hundred times smaller 
than a drop of water. These pumps go into a range of 
healthcare applications, from dialysis machines that 
clean a patient’s blood to In Vitro Diagnostics (IVD) 
that analyse medical samples to detect disease.

Solving customer problems
Longer Pump was approached by a long-standing 
customer, a large Chinese medical equipment 
company, to help solve a problem. The company 
needed a pump for its new dialysis machine that 
could be custom-built while meeting the high 
standards of the national healthcare regulator. 

Longer Pump’s core technology enables the 
continuous and precise transfer of fluids, without 
the need for valves. This type of technology is 
called a peristaltic pump, which uses compression 
to squeeze and release tubing to create a gentle 
and continuous movement of fluid. This was critical 
for this customer’s requirements as it prevents 
blood cells from getting damaged by the pumping 
mechanism, which could harm the patient. It also 
ensures the blood only touches the inner lining 
of the tube, reducing the risk of contamination.

What the Healthcare Sector does
Our Healthcare Sector companies’ technologies and 
digital solutions help providers improve the care they 
deliver and enhance the quality of patients’ lives. Their 
products and technologies are components, devices, 
systems and therapies critical to delivering the required 
standards of care for patients.

Our Healthcare Sector companies deliver advanced 
technologies and solutions in high value niches. These 
include: eye health, where they support both diagnostics 
and surgical treatment; monitoring and support of vital 
signs, including blood pressure and respiration; products 
to assist with interventional radiology and oncology and 
image guided surgery; synthetic bone grafts for clinical 
applications; and artificial intelligence (AI) based early 
warning systems and clinical decision support tools 
for childbirth. 

Sector companies also supply critical fluidic components 
for diagnostic and analytical instruments, and sensor 
technologies to track assets, increase efficiency, and 
support patient and staff safety.

The Healthcare Sector operates across a wide range 
of healthcare segments and settings, including 
ophthalmology, dentistry, orthopedics, perinatal 
care, surgical intervention, diagnostics and analytics. 
Its customers range from individual healthcare 
professionals to large healthcare systems and 
medical device original equipment manufacturers.

The Healthcare Sector’s long-term growth drivers
The sector’s long-term growth is supported by 
demographic trends, technological innovation, and 
improving the standard of care and increased efficiency. 

Most countries in the world are experiencing growth in 
both the size of population and the proportion of older 
people. By 2050, the world’s population of people aged 
60 years and older is estimated to double to 2.1 billion. 
The number of people aged 80 years or older is forecast 
to triple by 2050 to reach 426 million. This is expected 
to lead to an increased prevalence of chronic conditions, 
driving demand for diagnostics and treatment. These 
factors are key growth drivers for our Therapeutic Solutions 
businesses, given their presence in the ophthalmic surgery, 
respiratory therapy, bone replacement, interventional 
radiology, oncology and image-guided surgery markets.

Technological innovations drive growth, by increasing 
the capabilities of healthcare professionals to prevent, 
diagnose and treat conditions, including remotely 
through telemedicine. They contribute to improving 
standards of care and increasing efficiency by enabling 
better, earlier, faster and more cost-effective diagnosis 
and treatment of patients. This in turn leverages the 
skills and availability of increasingly scarce healthcare 
staff. These factors are strong growth drivers for 
our Patient Assessment & Analytics businesses, such 
as PeriGen, whose AI-powered algorithms prevent

complications during childbirth, or CenTrak, whose 
real-time location services improve safety, asset 
utilisation and efficiency in healthcare facilities.

Rising patient demand, workforce shortages, 
and disruptions as a result of the COVID pandemic 
have created substantial backlogs of patients, which 
are likely to persist for many years. Our Healthcare 
companies, through their innovative technologies 
and deep application knowledge, are helping to 
address these global health challenges.

Healthcare Sector performance in the year
The Healthcare Sector delivered a strong performance. 
Revenue of £556.4m (2022: £442.3m) was 25.8% higher, 
and up 9.8% on an organic constant currency1 basis. 
Sector growth continued to be supported by a strong 
order book, reflecting high patient caseload levels 
and order backlogs, and by generally strong execution 
by sector companies, with all but three companies 
delivering organic constant currency1 revenue growth, 
and five achieving organic constant currency1 revenue 
growth of 15% or more. 

All subsectors grew revenue on an organic constant 
currency1 basis. Growth was led by Healthcare 
Assessment & Analytics, which benefited from demand 
in vital signs monitoring, clinical ophthalmology, and 
communication and software systems for healthcare 
facilities. There was good organic constant currency1 
growth in Therapeutic Solutions, supported by high 
patient caseload levels in eye surgery; subsector growth 
on a reported basis also benefited from the acquisition 
of IZI Medical Products, LLC (IZI) during the year. 
There was only marginal growth on an organic constant 
currency1 basis in the smaller Life Sciences subsector, 
however, principally reflecting the impact of lockdown 
restrictions in China.

All regions except Asia Pacific reported double digit 
increases in revenue, on both a reported and organic 
constant currency1 basis. On a reported basis, growth 
was strongest in the USA, which accounts for more 
than half of sector revenues. This was led by strong

organic growth in communication and software systems 
for healthcare facilities, and the region also benefited 
from the positive effect of currency translation and 
the acquisition of IZI. There was also strong revenue 
growth on an organic constant currency1 basis in 
Mainland Europe and the UK, driven by a substantial 
backlog of demand for eye surgery products and for 
communication systems for healthcare facilities 
respectively. However, revenue in Asia Pacific declined 
on an organic constant currency1 basis, reflecting 
lockdowns in China, which represents close to half 
of the region’s revenues.

Profit1 grew by 30.8% to £130.1m (2022: £99.5m), 
or by 14.0% on an organic constant currency basis. 
Return on Sales1 improved by 90 basis points to 
23.4% (2022: 22.5%). This reflected a stable gross 
margin, which included a beneficial product mix 
and good management of pricing and material costs, 
and operational efficiencies. R&D expenditure increased 
to £33.1m, representing 5.9% of revenue (2022: £26.9m; 
6.1% of revenue), reflecting continued high levels of 
investment in new product development.

The sector made one acquisition during the year: IZI 
was purchased in September 2022 for a maximum 
total consideration of £151m. IZI is a US-based designer, 
manufacturer and distributor of medical consumable 
devices which are mainly used by interventional 
radiologists and surgeons in a range of acute, 
hospital based diagnostic and therapeutic procedures.

Acquisitions had a positive effect of 4.7% on revenue 
and 4.0% on profit. Currency exchange movements had 
a positive effect of 11.3% on revenue and 12.8% on profit.

Improving patients’ lives every day

IZI Medical uses image – 
guided surgery to treat patients

The World Health Organisation estimates that the 
proportion of people over the age of 60 will nearly 
double from 12% to 22% of the population by 2050. 
This global trend towards an ageing population is 
driving an increase in chronic illnesses, including one of 
the most deadly – cancer. Cancer can develop at any 
age, but its incidence rises dramatically at later stages 
in life. Currently, half of all cancers diagnosed are in 
people over 65. 

One of the most successful ways to treat cancer 
is through traditional surgery. However, medical 
procedures on elderly people bring a higher risk of 
complications. Advances in healthcare technology 
mean that surgeons can now use new operating 
techniques that are less damaging to patients 
and improve their recovery time.

Image-guided surgery is an innovative technique that 
allows surgeons to see in minute detail the area they 
are operating on. This approach enables them to reach 
difficult areas and remove even the smallest tumours 
with speed and precision. This means less pain, shorter 
hospital stays, fewer complications and quicker 
recovery for patients, as well as reducing the risk 
of the cancer returning.

In October 2022, Halma acquired IZI Medical, a 
company based in Baltimore, USA. The company 
manufactures medical devices used for minimally 
invasive diagnosis and treatment of acute conditions, 
principally cancer. 

The company works closely with surgeons and 
radiologists to develop advanced products that help 
detect and treat health conditions with more accuracy 
and less invasive damage, and so improving outcomes 
for patients. 

Increasing demand for healthcare as populations get 
older is a key long-term growth driver for Halma’s 
Healthcare Sector. The acquisition of IZI Medical is 
well positioned to support this growth while helping 
healthcare providers improve patients’ lives every day. 

IZI Medical is an excellent addition 
to our Healthcare Sector. The rising 
demand for healthcare requires 
innovative technology to help diagnose 
and treat more complex health issues. 
The company’s products enable earlier 
treatment and reduce operating times 
to improve the patient’s quality of life, 
especially in an ageing population.

The theme of the event was “connected for growth” 
and comprised of three days of plenary presentations 
and break-out functional sessions and also included 
charity initiatives to contribute to the local 
community in Orlando, Florida. 

Our non-executive Directors hosted a breakfast event 
with a wider group of leaders across the Group and 
our three sectors, which provided opportunities for 
informal networking as well as highlighting the 
benefits and experience that our companies 
can leverage from our non-executive Directors. 

Following the conference, an anonymous evaluation 
was conducted which demonstrated the success of 
the event. The feedback gathered highlighted that 
the event had provided a better understanding of 
the Group and connections between Halma’s growth 
model, purpose and DNA, as well as an enhanced 
feeling of connection to others, whilst providing 
new connections through relationships built 
during the conference. 

The ability to network, share common 
challenges, and look for synergies and 
potential opportunities to leverage 
common technology, tools, and people 
across Halma companies was really great.

How we engage 
As a highly decentralised business our companies work closely with 
their suppliers. Our DCEs engage with our key suppliers to ensure 
that we continue to deliver the best products and services for our 
customers and have the infrastructure in place to respond to 
market developments. DCEs report back to the Board periodically 
on significant supplier contracts and arrangements, and the Board 
maintain oversight of potential supply chain issues and mitigations. 

Some of our companies have been engaging with suppliers through 
our supplier sustainability platform, EcoVadis, to gain a broader 
view of their sustainability credentials (see below). More broadly, 
many of our companies have been engaging with suppliers on 
sustainability matters and as part of reducing Scope 3 emissions 
linked to our supply chain, we expect increased engagement from 
our companies starting to develop decarbonisation plans with 
key suppliers. 

Our Halma Strength in Numbers (HSIN) team provides a strategic 
purchasing function to our companies, offering collective economies 
of scale and introduction of new vendors to serve a specific business 
need. The HSIN team engage with key suppliers to develop proposals 
and present options to our companies. 

Our principal suppliers are subject to regular engagement, including 
audits, and are encouraged to operate with the high ethical standards 
that are set out in our Code of Conduct. The Board annually reviews 
and approves our Modern Slavery Act statement.

Outcomes and actions in the year
• Approved our annual Modern Slavery Act statement and refreshed 

our Code of Conduct, for roll-out in FY24.

• Engaged with suppliers on sustainability, for example: 

 – A number of our companies are utilising the EcoVadis platform 
via Halma’s group-licence to gain a better understanding of 
supplier sustainability credentials.

 – Apollo held a supplier sustainability webinar to introduce 

their sustainability goals and ongoing supplier expectations. 

 – Keeler has been engaging with some of its key suppliers 

on logistics and packaging efficiencies.

• Held a supplier “Innovation Day”, hosted by a key supplier in Dallas 
and attended by our technical teams. The objective of the day was 
to provide a better understanding of the suppliers offering, their 
pipeline for new product innovation and the potential benefits 
of partnering for both Halma companies and the supplier. 

• Held a “Halma Strategic Supplier” event (see page 60).

Case study

Halma Strategic Supplier event

In September 2022, the HSIN team conducted 
their first Halma Strategic Supplier event, hosted in 
Florida by Ocean Insight. The event brought together 
key suppliers from across our supply chain with 
operational leaders from our companies. Keynote 
speakers provided talks and suppliers presented 
to a panel of our companies, fielding questions 
and providing networking opportunities. 

The event encouraged an open dialogue between 
companies and suppliers, facilitated the sharing 
of best practices, provided opportunities for our 
companies to work with developed partners among 
our Group and identified strategic initiatives. 

The event was highly beneficial to both suppliers 
and companies and strengthened the bond with 
key suppliers by showing how much we value 
their commitment to Halma’s business, as well 
as introducing our companies to existing HSIN 
programmes. Additionally, it promoted 
engagement between our companies, 
seeking to solve similar problems. 

The event was a great opportunity 
to collaborate with other Halma 
companies on how to overcome 
challenges that we face in supply 
chains. I also enjoyed collaborating 
with our strategic preferred suppliers 
and gaining additional knowledge.

How we engage 
The Board recognises the value of engaging with all of our investors 
and debt holders and gaining a diverse selection of shareholder and 
stakeholder views from a range of geographies. We maintain an 
annual programme of investor publications and key engagement 
initiatives, and the Directors meet investors on a regular basis, 
principally through investor roadshows, investor events and the 
Annual General Meeting. 

The Chair is accessible to shareholders and will invite the Company’s 
largest equity shareholders to meet to discuss Company strategy, 
direction and any other significant matters. The Senior Independent 
Director provides an alternative channel for shareholders to raise 
concerns, independent of executive management and the Chair.

The Head of Investor Relations, Head of Sustainability, the Company 
Secretary and Group Treasurer maintain an ongoing dialogue with 
shareholders, investor bodies, financial analysts and our lenders 
regarding financial, operational, risk and environmental, social 
and governance issues and provide regular reports to the Board 
on these interactions. 

Outcomes and actions in the year
•  Held 200 investor meetings, with over 250 investors, attended 
by a broad range of senior Halma management, including the 
Group Chief Executive, Chief Financial Officer and members of 
the Executive Board. 

•  Held roadshows focused on smaller investors and private 

client brokers. 

•  Held a series of meetings with major shareholders and key debt 

holders to introduce Steve Gunning, Chief Financial Officer. 

•  Held a series of meetings between our Chair, Dame Louise Makin, 
and major shareholders, covering approximately 25% of our issued 
share capital. Key discussions included Group Chief Executive and 
Chief Financial Officer succession and transition, Board composition, 
sustainability, governance and remuneration. 

•  Jo Harlow, non-executive Director and Chair of the Remuneration 
Committee, led consultations with shareholders on remuneration 
matters.

•  Strong relationships with key debt holders led to a very successful 

refinancing of our revolving credit facility at extremely competitive 
rates and a very strong demand for our private placement issuance 
in May 2022. 

•  Held our first fully in-person Annual General Meeting since 2019, 
allowing for face-to-face interaction between Board members 
and a range of investors.

Factors considered by the Board

Longer-term considerations

Strong talent and leadership is key to 
Halma’s ongoing success and delivery 
of strategy. Ensuring fulfilment of key 
leadership roles will position Halma to 
continue to produce strong returns and 
growth for our shareholders and wider 
stakeholders, whilst staying true to our 
established Sustainable Growth Model.

Balancing investment for future 
growth while considering shorter term 
inflationary cost pressures and political 
and economic risks.

That dividends are consistent with the 
Company’s financial performance and 
would not be detrimental to the strength 
of the balance sheet and future 
sustainable growth.

The Board considered a range of factors 
during the succession planning process 
for the positions of Group Chief 
Executive and Chief Financial Officer, 
including ongoing alignment with 
the Group’s purpose, culture, and 
Sustainable Growth Model. The Board 
were mindful throughout their decision-
making process of the long-term impact 
that such a decision would have on 
the future success of the Company, 
including through investor and 
employee sentiment. 

The Group’s Budget, approved by the 
Board, sets the allocation of capital 
to deliver our growth strategy through 
investment in R&D, capital expenditure, 
talent and acquisitions. The Board were 
cognisant of the Group’s short to 
medium term priorities in setting the 
Group Budget whilst being mindful 
of macroeconomic and geopolitical 
circumstances, to ensure continued 
delivery of growth and the safeguard 
of shareholders’ interests, as well as 
those of its wider stakeholders including 
employees, customers and suppliers. 

For its 44th consecutive year, the Board 
took the decision to increase dividend 
payments by more than 5%. As a high 
growth company, the Board carefully 
balanced the financial resources 
required to execute our strategy, 
including organic investment needs and 
acquisition opportunities in line with our 
Budget; the Group’s medium-term rate 
of organic constant currency growth; 
maintaining a prudent level of dividend 
cover and moderate indebtedness; and 
equitable treatment of our stakeholders 
when taking this decision.

Factors considered by the Board

Longer-term considerations

The Group completed seven acquisitions 
during the year, five of which required 
Board approval. The detailed acquisition 
proposals from the Group Chief Executive 
set out the long-term implications of the 
acquisition and the effect on Halma’s 
stakeholders. It is essential that each of 
our companies aligns with our purpose 
and the Board carefully balanced the 
financial commitment required against 
the risks and anticipated return, whilst 
considering the strategic fit with our 
purpose, the opportunities for geographic 
or market growth (either organic or 
through further M&A) and the talent 
and know-how which would be acquired. 

The Board considered any negative or 
positive impact the refreshed Code of 
Conduct would have on employees, 
culture, the autonomous operating 
model and the legal and compliance 
framework. Investor expectations were 
also considered and the Board satisfied 
themselves that the refreshed Code of 
Conduct had been benchmarked and 
was aligned with all applicable laws 
and regulations. The Board assessed the 
alignment with our purpose and values 
and concluded that these were aligned 
and would improve compliance across 
the Group. 

Halma’s discipline in making acquisitions 
which are aligned to our purpose and 
which are in market niches with long-term 
growth drivers are core to our strategy and 
are critical to ensure that we can continue 
to grow sustainably for the benefit of all 
our stakeholders. 

The refreshed Code sets out Halma’s 
expectations for ethical behaviour and 
corporate responsibility. It is rooted in 
Halma’s purpose and cultural DNA 
and goes beyond compliance with laws 
and regulations, requiring a commitment 
to just be a good person and operate 
ethically and sustainably. The Code 
highlights Halma’s approach, expected 
behaviours and aspirations around key 
environment, social and governance 
themes as well in relation to key 
compliance areas such as bribery and 
corruption, competing fairly and data 
ethics. It sets out the standards by which 
we conduct business as well as setting out 
our expectations of our business partners.

By promoting a culture of acting ethically 
and sustainably, the Code will build trust 
and strengthen our relationship with all 
of our stakeholders as well as continue 
to encourage the best talent to join, and 
remain with Halma. It will also promote 
Halma’s cultural DNA and help all to work 
together to fulfil Halma’s purpose and 
deliver on its strategy.

Our people and culture

Our people
and culture

Our DNA
The combination of our culture and our agile 
organisational model is one of our unique strategic 
assets and vital to delivering our purpose and growing 
a sustainable and successful business. We call this 
combination Halma’s DNA (see page 21), and both 
strands are inextricably linked to enable our success.

We bet on talent
Our DNA drives our talent philosophy. One of the most 
important aspects of our DNA is “We bet on talent”. 
Due to our highly decentralised model, we need 
exceptional people who are empowered and accountable 
for making decisions close to their customers without 
the need for complex reporting lines. It also encourages 
diverse viewpoints on every team to ensure we don’t 
miss a thing. Our agile model then enables our people 
to respond quickly to their customers’ needs to capture 
new growth opportunities. This means that finding the 
right people, and then supporting and developing them 
to grow, is central to how our companies think about 
their growth strategies. 

People at the heart of our growth strategy
Over the last year our people have faced a number of 
global challenges that have impacted them at work 
and at home. The ongoing war in Ukraine has led to a 
rise in global energy prices and inflation pressures that 
have resulted in a sharp increase in the cost of living. 
In China the lockdowns in early 2022, followed by the 
sudden lifting of restrictions later that year, also put 
significant stresses on our local workforce. 

66 

  Halma plc |  Annual Report and Accounts 2023

Our leaders have been able to 
navigate global challenges and 
also seize new opportunities by 
putting people at the heart of 
their growth strategies. 

Jennifer Ward
Group Talent, Culture and Communications Director

Our leaders have been able to navigate these challenges 
and also seize new opportunities by putting people at 
the heart of their growth strategies. Guided by our DNA 
they have invested in our people in a number of ways, 
knowing that the ability to attract, retain and engage 
high-performing teams is vital to each company’s success. 

Employee engagement
In 2023, we ran our seventh global employee engagement 
survey. Once again, we had a strong response rate of 
85% in line with the previous year and our overall 
engagement score remained stable at 76%. This is 
reassuring given all the pressures our people continued 
to face. We saw our biggest improvement in companies 
providing their people with opportunities to learn 
and grow – which shows steady growth since 2020. 

Our drive to build inclusive businesses continues to pay 
dividends with high engagement scores on colleagues 
feeling they are treated fairly and respectfully (83%) 
and can be their authentic self at work (80%). These 
are both trending upwards from 2022.

A new driver of engagement is sustainability, with 
68% of colleagues telling us they feel good about the 
efforts their company is making on sustainability. This is 
encouraging to see given our purpose, and how strongly 
sustainability features in the long-term growth drivers 
that power our business.

The value colleagues place on community engagement 
was shown by how they joined forces through our 
two-year Water for Life campaign. In partnership 
with WaterAid, the campaign aimed to share our 
water-testing technology and to raise funds to 
provide safe drinking water to 8,000 people in rural 
India. We’re incredibly proud to have surpassed our 
target of £200,000 which was doubled by Halma’s 
match. Through our shared purpose, our passion, 
and our expertise our colleagues have come together 
to make long-lasting change for some of the most 
vulnerable communities. See page 68.

Continued focus on diversity and inclusion
We see diversity and inclusion as a competitive 
advantage that can help our businesses grow and meet 
the challenges of the future. To achieve our purpose, we 
must attract and retain a diverse workforce that helps 
us spot and unlock new opportunities and innovate 
to solve complex problems. This year we sustained our 
focus on creating a more balanced and representative 
employee population and cultivating an inclusive 
environment where people feel empowered to contribute. 

Gender balance
We have set a clear goal for all our company boards 
to be within a 40–60% gender balanced range by the 
end of March 2024. This year we have 29% women 
on company boards, increasing from 26% last year. 
Whilst this is an improvement, we recognise we need 
to accelerate the pace of change. During the year we 
took deliberate action in talent mapping to identify, 
engage and nurture top female leaders which led 
to several successful hires. We expanded our diverse 
recruiter list and are already seeing the benefit of this 
with a stronger pipeline of diverse candidates coming 
through into senior roles. We developed toolkits to help 
our companies with diverse sourcing strategies and 
inclusive hiring practices. We also continued to shine a 
spotlight on women leaders across functions through 
our annual International Women’s Day celebration to 
inspire the next generation to join us. In fact, our 2023 
Halma Future Leaders cohort is 41% women ensuring 
that we continue to build a strong pipeline of female 
talent. We will build upon initiatives that have driven 
positive change and identify new opportunities to 
reach our overall objectives.

At the executive level, we’re pleased to have remained 
within our 40–60% gender-balanced range, with 
women representing 45% and 55% of Halma’s Board 
and Executive Board, respectively. Our three sector 
boards are also within our 40–60% gender balanced 
range and 48% of all our senior roles (Executive Board, 
Sector Chief Executives, Divisional Chief Executives) 
are held by women. In acknowledgement of our efforts, 
we were awarded a Balance in Business award in 2023 
which recognises trail-blazing FTSE 350 organisations 
leading the way in improving the representation of 
women on boards and in leadership positions.

Our people and culture continued

Case study

Living the purpose

“Live the purpose” is one of Halma’s cultural genes 
and in the last two years we have seen colleagues 
exemplify this across our companies. In 2020, Halma 
launched Water for Life in partnership with WaterAid 
(see page 13) to help raise awareness of the global 
challenge of water accessibility and quality. 

Thanks to our people’s fundraising efforts, Water for 
Life has transformed the lives of over 10,000 people 
in Northern India, giving them access to safe, clean 
water, and water management training, so they 
can continue to keep their water supply safe for 
generations to come.

Through creative fundraising activities our companies 
raised over £200,000, and Halma donated £200,000, 
to support the building of new water infrastructure 
and training volunteers in water quality management. 

For example, Medicel, based in Switzerland, did a 
2,500km bike-to-work fundraiser. Colleagues from 
Minicam Group, based in the UK, did a sponsored 
sky dive. Sofis, based in the Netherlands, organised an 
online charity auction and started a recycling scheme 
for employees to donate their glass bottles. CenTrak 
held a gift basket raffle in their office in Pennsylvania, 
US, and Florida-based Ocean Insight coordinated 
several activities including a Valentine’s Day bake 
sale, a barbecue, and a photo contest.

Gender pay gap
We are pleased to be publishing a mean Gender Pay 
Gap figure for all Halma employees in two of our largest 
regions (UK and USA) for the third consecutive year. 
We are also pleased to report a reduction from 20.1% 
to 18.7% as at 31 March 2023. Although most Halma 
companies (including Halma plc) do not directly employ 
more than 250 employees – the UK statutory reporting 
threshold – we are proud to publish this crucial metric.

While we continue to see an improvement in female 
representation at senior levels, we still have more men 
in our most senior leadership levels and higher paid 
roles, as well as more women in hourly paid positions 
and this is why we have the pay gap. However, it is 
encouraging to see that our commitment to build 
an inclusive culture in all parts of our organisation 
continues to have an impact on helping to reduce 
the gap as evidenced by the steady progress made 
since we started publishing this figure in 2021, when 
we reported a figure of 25.9%. 

Our Global Parental Leave policy and Future of Work 
philosophy, although aimed at supporting both men 
and women, create better work-life balance whilst 
reducing career impediments for mothers. Our Halma 
Future Leaders Programme has a good gender ratio 
helping to build the pipeline of women leaders for our 
businesses. We continue to work towards our goal of 
achieving gender balance on our company boards, 

68 

  Halma plc |  Annual Report and Accounts 2023

with a view to not only having a positive impact on 
female talent recruitment and retention but also to 
help to close the overall pay gap with more female 
representation at this level. 

While we have observed positive changes year-on-year, 
we recognise that there is further progress to be made 
and that some of the actions we are taking to close the 
gap will take time to have impact. We are committed to 
continuing to drive change and our aspiration is to make 
ongoing, progressive improvement towards creating a 
more diverse workforce and a more inclusive culture.

Race and ethnicity
Alongside gender equality, we’re building the foundations 
for greater ethnic diversity across the business. Currently, 
27% of our senior leadership team is from a diverse ethnic 
background and 14% of all employees consider themselves 
to be in an ethnic minority. We want to grow our ethnic 
diversity relative to the markets we operate in and 
remove barriers to leadership for ethnic minority groups.

In line with being a signatory to Change the Race Ratio, 
we are committed to implementing its four key industry 
actions towards racial equity. This year, we celebrated 
Black History Month in both the UK and the US. This 
provided opportunities to spotlight Black role models 
in our businesses, educate colleagues on the importance 
of challenging behaviours that are not inclusive and 
equip them with resources to have conversations 
on race. 

At Board level, we will continue to meet the Parker 
Review target this year to have at least one director 
from an ethnic minority background on FTSE 100 boards 
by 2021. In March 2023, the Parker Review announced 
a new recommendation for FTSE 350 companies to set 
a percentage target for senior management positions 
that will be occupied by ethnic minority executives by 
December 2027. This is aligned to our existing commitment 
under Change the Race Ratio, and we fully support the 
intent for transparency and accountability. However, as 
a diversified group of around 45 autonomous small to 
medium-sized businesses this presents unique challenges 
in collecting and analysing consolidated data for our 
global workforce. We’ve been implementing the 
technology that will enable us to do so and we’re on 
track to have a system in place by 2024. This first step 
is aimed at establishing the baseline so we can set a 
target next year and report on it with confidence. 

Fostering inclusion
Our inclusive policies ensure a level playing field for 
women and men and promote equity. Our gender-
neutral global parental leave policy is available to all 
employees providing 14 weeks of fully paid leave for 
births, adoption, or surrogacy. Since it was introduced 
in October 2020, nearly 500 employees across the 
Group have benefited from the policy. Beyond this, 
our companies are spearheading initiatives to achieve 
our ambition of truly inclusive businesses, as in the 
case of Apollo’s new programme supporting women 
experiencing menopause.

Supporting 
menopause in 
the workplace

Apollo is one of Halma’s largest companies and 
shares in our ambition to build diverse and inclusive 
businesses. The fire detector leader has been making 
positive strides towards this ambition including a 
more gender-balanced company board and leadership 
team. A key initiative for last year was a focus on 
menopause, which has a significant impact on 
women, who represent 52% of their UK workforce. 
28% of their female employees are in the age range 
of the peri, menopausal, or post-menopausal stages. 
Apollo launched a two-pronged initiative for its UK 
and EMEA employees aiming to eliminate the stigma 
attached to this normal transition in women’s lives 
and to provide funding to access specialist medical 
support currently not offered in private healthcare 
plans. They now provide mandatory training for all 
managers so they can better support their team 
members and colleagues. They have also partnered 
with Clinic51, a private women’s health and menopause 
service, to provide their own menopause private 
health package as well as subsidise medication to 
manage the effects of hormonal therapy. Additionally, 
Apollo covers the cost of Hormone Replacement 
Therapy prescriptions and offers private health 
consultations with menopause-trained general 
practitioners through a third-party.

Our people and culture continued

Delivering on total wellbeing
Having an inclusive culture and supporting healthy 
lifestyles leads to a more energised and productive 
workforce. We recognise that health is not just 
about physical wellbeing, and we are working to 
help our people be emotionally, physically, socially, 
and financially healthy. Our Employee Assistance 
Programme is an independent and confidential 
resource that employees in the US, UK and Europe 
can tap into for support on a wide range of issues – 
whether it is personal or work related —free of charge. 
In October 2022 this was expanded to all colleagues 
in China. 

We also understand that the outlook for work-life 
balance has changed dramatically, and employees are 
looking for benefits to help foster a healthy integration 
of work and family. In response, many of our companies 
now have flexible working practices including a four-day 
work week in production, diverse shift patterns, flexible 
working hours and hybrid working for office staff. 

Looking after the wellbeing of our people is critical 
to our business and a key priority for all our leaders. 
The Group’s Accident Frequency Rate (“AFR”) for 
the year was 0.08. Whilst it is still relatively low 
and represents a decrease against the AFR for 2022, 
it is greater than our target of 0.02. We continue to 
promote the importance of health and safety and 
the role that everyone has to help maintain a safe 
workplace. There were no work-related fatalities in 
2023 or in prior years and details of both the number 
of days lost to preventable work injuries and recorded 
injuries during the year and the prior four years are set 
out in the graphs. Despite the decrease in the AFR the 
days lost to preventable work injuries has increased by 
284 – this is largely attributable to two incidents in 
2022 which led to days lost in 2023. 

Maintaining a compelling employee value proposition 
that each of our companies can use to attract and 
retain talent locally remains a key priority for us. We 
have focused our efforts on providing an increasingly 
competitive, flexible and inclusive set of benefit offerings 
around the globe. In the US, in light of the landmark 
decision made by the US Supreme Court to overturn 
Roe v. Wade, we quickly made several changes to our 
medical plans. Namely, we expanded travel and lodging 
benefits for employees and dependents making not 
just reproductive health but also all types of healthcare 
more accessible. We also added coverage for gender 
affirmation and reassignment services and in 2023 
implemented a fertility benefit.

*  Specified major injury incidents are reportable incidents which result in more 

than three working days lost.

Beyond healthcare, we have made other enhancements 
to simplify and increase the competitiveness of our 
401(k) retirement savings and deferred compensation 
plans. We increased Halma’s matching contribution 
limit for employees participating in the 401(k) retirement 
savings plan from 3% to 5% of salary and increased the 
percentage of employer contributions to their retirement 
from the moment they join our companies. The vesting 
of employer contributions has also been improved, from 
a three-year cliff to a percentage method with 100% 
vesting at three years. This has resulted in a higher level 
of employee participation in retirement planning and a 
higher percentage of monies they are saving for their 
future financial well-being. In recognition of our unique 
offering, we have been shortlisted for an award in the 
US as a Plan Sponsor of the Year.

We are proud that we continue to meet our commitment 
to pay a Real Living Wage as all our UK companies are 
paying wages in line with the levels set by the Living 
Wage Foundation. We also recognise that the cost of 
living continues to be an issue, and our companies are 
taking measures to support our colleagues, as outlined 
on page 71.

A collaborative culture 
Our strong internal networks and collaborative culture 
help us solve problems faster. As we have grown, we 
have deliberately developed a more collaborative culture. 
This has allowed our companies to address opportunities 
and solve common issues together. For the first time 
since the COVID pandemic our top leaders came 
together in Orlando, Florida for the Accelerate conference 
under the theme of “connected for growth”. They had 
an opportunity to network in person to address some 
of the challenges and opportunities ahead and to 
celebrate innovation across our businesses. The 
conference also reinforced why connection makes 
such a tangible difference to our relationships and 
to our ability to bring innovative ideas to reality.

Supporting the increasing cost of living

With rising inflation and higher cost of living in many 
countries we know colleagues are facing tough choices. 
Our companies are taking a localised approach to 
support them. For example, Sofis paid a one-off bonus 
to employees in the US, UK, India, UAE, Germany, and 
the Netherlands. In Tunisia, Sentric increased medical 
cover for all employees as well as provided meal 
vouchers. In the UK, Advanced provided a pay raise 
outside of their standard pay review cycle for those 
individuals hardest hit, taking its lowest paid employees 
beyond “the real living wage”. Similarly, Fortress gave a 
sizeable pay increase in addition to a Christmas bonus. 
Palintest have also provided a one-time cost-of-living 
supplement and voucher schemes. Crowcon offered a 
free Health Cash Plan to meet the cost of everyday 
health expenses and is subsidising annual bus passes 
and train tickets.

To further facilitate collaboration and innovation we 
have made several investments in the year. In India, we 
invested in a new 42,000 square feet state-of-the-art 
facility which adopts several environmentally-friendly 
measures, as well as increasing collaboration with more 
spaces for creativity and working together. In Shanghai, 
we established a new office in December 2022 to provide 
better facilities for our regional team and act as a hub 
for companies operating in the region. 

We are also two-thirds of the way through our Security 
Upgrade Programme, which brings all Halma companies 
into the same Microsoft environment. This will not only 
increase our cyber-security across the Group, it will also 
greatly enhance our ability to connect across companies, 
learn from one another and collaborate. The 
programme will complete in July 2023.

Professional growth and development
Developing our leaders to enable them to succeed is a 
critical component of our talent philosophy. We invest 
in them so that they have the skills required to lead 
inclusively and operate as high-performing teams. In 
2022 we introduced three new leadership development 
programmes; for Managing Directors, for Directors/Vice 
Presidents, and for high-potential leaders not yet on a 
company leadership team who we want to invest in as 
future talent. We reached over 200 leaders with face-to-
face learning events and have a population of 750 
active online users, which is increasing steadily and has 
doubled compared to the previous year. Lastly, we have 
formalised a network of internal mentors and launched 
a coaching platform. 

Fortress acted fast
to support its people

Coupled with these incentives, many of our 
companies are delivering financial guidance to 
help educate employees on smarter savings and 
spending, as well as organising several employee 
engagement and wellbeing activities. 

We know that the successful development of emerging 
talent is key to the future of our companies. Halma’s 
Future Leaders (HFL) Development Programme is a 
unique opportunity for new graduates to develop 
professionally and personally and make a positive 
difference. Since 2012, we have had 132 graduate 
trainees in the programme. We continue to build 
a diverse pipeline of future leaders; with 41% of all 
programme participants being female, 36% ethnically 
diverse, and 22 different nationalities.

Our aim is to see these graduates on one of our company 
boards within seven years of joining the programme. 
Last year we continued to see their progression with 12 
HFL alumni developed and promoted to company board 
level. Seven within eight years, and five within five years 
of joining Halma. Fifteen more have been developed 
and promoted to senior leadership roles. 

It is gratifying to see how our companies continue to 
build inclusive businesses and support our people so they 
can drive the growth of our businesses. This is testament 
to our DNA, the unique combination of our culture and 
organisation model, which continues to guide us and 
will enable our future success. Many thanks to our 
colleagues around the world for living our DNA every 
day and putting it at the heart of everything you do.

Sustainability

Our approach to sustainability

Our sustainability approach 
has three pillars:

1.

Drive growth 
in sustainability

• we invest in growth opportunities driven by our 
purpose, long-term growth drivers and evolving 
sustainability demands.

• we aim to increase and broaden the benefits 
enabled by our products and services – from 
improving lives to supporting the transition 
to a greener economy.

2.

Support 
our people

• we support our employees, communities 

and suppliers.

3.

Protect our 
environment

• we are focused on reducing our 

environmental footprint.

Our growth strategy and sustainability approach
Sustainability has always been at the core of our 
growth strategy.

We acquire and grow businesses in safety, environmental 
and healthcare markets that solve real problems in 
the world – enabling our customers to provide safer 
environments, protect life-critical resources, and 
deliver better healthcare. 

Their agility means that they can respond to the 
demands of their customers as the world changes, 
which includes evolving their products and services 
towards sustainability-related opportunities over time. 

Similarly, our sector teams identify acquisitions in 
markets driven by our purpose and long-term growth 
drivers. This means that our portfolio is also evolving 
towards greater and wider sustainability opportunities.

We are challenging ourselves by creating more focus 
on sustainability as a core driver for growth, and 
further investing in existing and new growth 
opportunities driven by sustainability trends. 

We believe our first sustainability pillar – driving growth 
in sustainability – will allow us to accelerate our 
progress and broaden the benefits that our companies 
already enable through their products and services.

At the same time, our purpose and cultural DNA drives 
our second sustainability pillar – to support our people 
– including employees, suppliers and the communities 
we operate in. Within this pillar, we have a key focus 
area of diversity, equity and inclusion. 

Finally, we are focused on our third pillar – to protect 
our environment – both because it is the right thing for 
us to do, and because it will support our future growth. 
Within this pillar, we have a key focus area of sustainable 
product design and reducing emissions. 

For our companies, our three sustainability pillars 
together translate into a challenge to “do more good” 
and “do less harm”.

Sustainability governance
Our approach to sustainability governance across the 
wider Group aligns with our decentralised organisational 
model, which places our operational resources close 
to our customers through locally-managed, 
autonomous companies.

p03

Find out more about our decentralised 
Group structure.

Our companies
Our Divisional Chief Executives (DCEs) work with the 
MDs and local boards of each company to encourage 
the consideration of sustainability opportunities and 
risks in strategic planning, in a way that is relevant 
and appropriate to the circumstances, markets and 
capacity of each company. 

Each of our companies also has a local board member 
who is responsible, along with their company MD/CEO, 
for developing and maintaining their company’s plans 
to support people and protect the environment.

Halma Group 
At the Group level, our Board is ultimately responsible 
for approving our Sustainable Growth Model, which 
has sustainability at its core and includes oversight 
of climate-related risks and opportunities. Further 
embedding sustainability into our business was one 
of the Board’s key priorities for 2023. 

Our sustainability agenda is led by our Group General 
Counsel & Chief Sustainability Officer, who has principal 
responsibility for our sustainability activities and policy. 
She is a member of the Executive Board and a standing 
invitee at the Board. She also chairs our Sustainability 
Management committee, which is a cross-functional 
team of Group and sector representatives which provide 
direction and oversight of our sustainability initiatives 
and implementation of our sustainability agenda.

Evolving our approach

During 2023, much of our companies’ focus 
was on our second and third sustainability pillars, 
and our key focus areas within these two pillars.

These key focus areas – diversity, equity and 
inclusion, and sustainable product design and 
reducing emissions – were chosen in 2021 following 
an informal strategic materiality assessment.

Each of our companies set their own bottom-up 
targets and action plans for these areas, in the 
context of the Group’s goals (see pages 76 to 79). 
Our DCEs have been working with our companies 
to challenge and further develop these plans.

In 2024, we are increasing internal focus on our 
first pillar – driving growth in sustainability – while 
maintaining progress on our goals to support our 
people and protect our environment. 

Read more about our sustainability 
approach and strategic materiality 
assessment at www.halma.com.

Evolving our disclosures

This year, we have produced a sustainability section 
that allows us to share our progress on the key 
elements of our sustainability agenda.

Further social and environmental metrics 
and information on our progress can be 
found in our ESG Data Supplement and 
Emissions Reduction Report at

1. Drive growth in sustainability

Overview
Our commitment to drive growth in sustainability 
will see us encouraging our sectors and companies to 
understand and leverage existing and new sustainability-
related demands – both to grow their businesses and 
broaden the benefits their products and services enable. 

Our companies know their markets and customers best. 
Therefore, progress will be delivered through a “bottom-
up” approach. The opportunities they identify will be in 
markets that align with our purpose of growing a safer, 
cleaner, healthier future for everyone, every day.

Our diversified portfolio means that each of our 
companies will adopt a different approach to identifying 
sustainability-related opportunities. For many companies, 
leveraging innovation and digital technologies will be key 
to solving sustainability challenges. It also means that 
the outcomes will look different in each company.

At the Group level, we are excited by acquisitions 
that deliver on our purpose and long-term growth 
drivers and additionally have significant, long-term 
sustainability growth opportunities. Our sector and 
M&A teams continue to explore and acquire these 
types of companies, and some examples are 
highlighted on these pages.

We continue to develop various frameworks and internal 
tools to support our progress. During 2023, sessions were 
delivered to our sector boards on climate change and 
circular economy trends. And at our global Accelerate 
leadership conference in October 2022, we challenged 
our company board members to come up with new 
growth ideas for their businesses at the intersection 
of sustainability and digital. 

Case study

Driving growth in sustainability 
through acquisitions

We are excited about the long-term growth 
opportunities our companies can access by helping 
their customers solve sustainability challenges. We 
look for these sustainability-linked opportunities when 
we make decisions about how to allocate capital, and 
we challenge our DCEs to seek acquisitions that will 
deliver strong long-term growth in a world transitioning 
towards greener and fairer economies. 

Our Group General Counsel and Chief Sustainability 
Officer is a member of our Executive Board and is 
encouraged by the sustainability-linked opportunities 
in many of our recent acquisitions.

As an example, she cites the recent acquisition 
of FirePro, which produces a non-pressurised 
condensed aerosol technology that is considered 
a more sustainable alternative to established 
pressurised gas fire suppression solutions. 

Having discussed FirePro’s technology 
in detail, we were delighted to 
recommend the acquisition to the Board 
for approval. It is a company that both 
provides a more sustainable product¹ 
than other alternatives on the market, 
but is also targeting markets – such 
as lithium-ion battery power storage – 
that we expect to grow as we transition 
towards a greener, Net Zero future.

Driving growth in context – 
our impact and UN SDG contribution
Our purpose and the agility of our companies in meeting 
customer needs drives our Sustainable Growth Model. 
At the same time, the societal and environmental 
benefits we enable through our products and services 
help us contribute towards the broad aims of many 
UN Sustainable Development Goals (SDGs).

Our companies’ diversity means that the contribution 
from our products and services is varied. Previously, we 
identified four SDGs as highly aligned with our purpose 
and our products and services (SDGs 3, 6, 9 and 11). 
As we broaden the impact enabled by our products 
and services, other SDGs such as SDG 7 (affordable 
and clean energy) and SDG 8 (decent work and 
economic growth) are becoming more relevant. 

We aim to give some indicative examples of the benefit 
enabled by our companies’ products and services, along 
with relevant SDGs, as part of how we communicate our 
purpose and our impact.

Improving lives and 
delivering value to 
society through better 
hypertension diagnosis

Hypertension is a common but serious 
cardiovascular disease in which blood vessels 
have persistently raised pressure. It affects 
over 1 billion adults worldwide and is a major cause 
of premature death. SDG 3.4 aims to reduce the 
mortality rate attributed to cardiovascular diseases 
by one third by 2030. 

Halma companies SunTech, Meditech and Cardios 
offer Ambulatory Blood Pressure Monitors (ABPM) 
as well as static devices. These are designed to be 
worn by the patient over 24-48 hours, measuring 
blood pressure every 20-30 minutes. Blood pressure 
data from patients’ daily activities, including at night 
time, provide valuable diagnostic information that 
help doctors avoid misdiagnosis of hypertension.

Using third-party data and techniques, we have 
broadly estimated the added value to society from 
Halma’s ABPM technologies from avoided deaths due 
to correct hypertension diagnoses and avoided health 
costs from ensuring optimal treatment and reducing 
unnecessary treatment. We estimate this annual 
economic benefit to be greater than £6.5m globally. 
This conservative estimation doesn’t include the 
benefits of avoiding other cardiac events, such as 
strokes and heart attacks, that don’t result in death.

Because ABPM are currently a very small proportion 
of total blood pressure measurements, we expect 
to increase this value to society over time.

Each year, we aim to quantify the value to society 
from the benefits provided by at least one of our 
diverse companies or products. For more information 
on the methodology as well as examples from prior 
years, please see www.halma.com.

Key focus area: diversity, equity and inclusion
Increasing diversity, equity and inclusion significantly 
benefits our global societies and is fundamental to 
achieving our purpose. It is therefore our current key 
focus area.

As a group, we are working towards achieving targets in 
DEI, the first of which is gender balance on our company 
boards (see key target below). We continue to see strong 
gender balance at the Group, Executive Board and 
Board levels. Our people and culture section (pages 66 
to 71) also sets out our plans for reporting additional 
ethnicity data and updates on the progress we have 
made in this area.

Investing in diversity, equity 
and inclusion and the employee experience

Diversity, equity and inclusion will always 
be a smart investment. We know that 
diversity grows the bottom line and that 
it’s better for business. We’re investing in 
our culture and workplace to succeed in 
the emerging talent market and position 
us for continued growth.

Rob Sweitzer
President, SunTech Medical

SunTech Medical is the leading manufacturer of 
high-performance, clinical-grade motion tolerant 
blood pressure technology. It is headquartered in 
North Carolina, in the largest science research 
park in the US. Over the past two years, through a 
combination of education and targeted recruitment, 
SunTech has put people at the heart of its growth 
strategy by increasing the diversity of its employees 
and investing in the employee experience. 

The benefits of this are now starting to come through, 
with higher employee engagement, improved decision-
making, and better performance. Now the challenge 
is to keep pace with growth, and ensure the employee 
experience can continue to attract and retain  
high-calibre talent to meet the future needs 
of the business.

To support their growth strategy, SunTech has 
recently relocated to an improved facility with 
modern amenities to create a more open, inclusive 
work environment. This includes an onsite fitness 
centre, a wellness room which accommodates nursing 
mothers, additional private areas for production staff,

3. Protect our environment

Key focus area:

Sustainable product design and reducing emissions

Relevant SDGs

Overview
Our purpose – to grow a safer, cleaner and healthier 
future for everyone, every day – drives our commitment 
to protect our environment for future generations. 

Our companies see the commercial and environmental 
benefit of more sustainable operations. This positions 
them to meet their customers’ changing expectations 
while potentially lowering their operating costs.

Further information about our wider 
environmental impacts, including waste, water 
and SASB disclosures, can be found in our 
ESG Data Supplement at www.halma.com. 

Key focus area: Sustainable product design 
and reducing emissions
The majority of our environmental footprint arises 
within our wider value chain, and is often embedded 
in the design of our products and services. We are 
also committed to reducing our own emissions while 
supporting our companies to pursue climate-related 
opportunities. Therefore, sustainable product design 
and reducing emissions is our current key focus area.

We have 1.5 degree-aligned Group targets for Scope 
1 & 2 emissions (aligned with guidance from the Science-
based Targets institute), and supporting targets for 
renewables and energy productivity. Our companies 
have now developed their initial emissions reduction 
plans to support these targets where relevant. We have 
made good progress towards these targets, and as at 
the end of 2023 we have exceeded our 2030 Scope 1 & 2 
target (see overleaf).

Estimating Scope 3 emissions 
Our Scope 1 & 2 emissions are a small part of our 
broader GHG emissions footprint and not where we can 
drive the biggest impact. Therefore, we have reported 
our 2020 Scope 3 baseline for the first time this year, 

Case study

Sharing knowledge to create 
more sustainable products

Halma’s Functional Networks bring our companies 
together to share knowledge and solve common 
problems – including those related to sustainability. 

During 2023, a sub-group of our Technical Network, 
comprising representatives from four Halma 
companies, started creating a sustainable design 
toolkit to “minimise environmental impact while 
ensuring customer value”. 

Palintest’s redesigned 
Pooltester kit

  Halma plc |  Annual Report and Accounts 2023

To begin, they reviewed sustainable design principles 
and incorporated these into a product design process 
being used by many Halma companies. They aimed 
to develop a practical and tailored approach to 
enable engineers in our small businesses to engage 
with sustainable design on existing product ranges. 

Halma company Palintest tested this approach 
with their Pooltester product range, which provides 
simple and cost-effective pool and hot tub testing 
for residential users. Overcoming several design 
challenges, the range was relaunched using recycled 
plastic cases and recyclable components. Palintest 
estimates that virgin material was reduced by more 
than 60%, while generating new customer interest. 

The subgroup presented their approach and learnings 
to the Technical Network and shared through our 
sustainability networks. There is more to do on the 
toolkit and not all Halma companies are yet ready to 
apply this approach. However, encouraging learning 
around the Group by sharing our leading companies’ 
challenges and breakthroughs is a key component of 
our approach to this sustainability pillar.

and will continue to work towards putting in place 
appropriate targets on Scope 3 while also reviewing 
our current Scope 1 & 2 targets. 

Our work during the year confirmed that total Scope 3 
emissions in 2020 were approximately 0.95 million 
tonnes CO2e, or approximately 98% of our total 2020 
greenhouse gas footprint. As expected, these emissions 
are concentrated in the supply chain and in the use of 
our products.

2020 emissions from our supply chain, including 
upstream transport and distribution, were estimated at 
approximately 0.34 million tonnes CO2e (c.35% of total 
baseline emissions). In addition, most of our companies’ 
products use electricity, and therefore emissions from 
our products’ use phase were estimated at around 
0.58 million tonnes of CO2e (c.59% of baseline). 
Approximately 60% of product use emissions relate to 
one company, comprising approximately 1% of Group 
revenue, which sells products which have high energy 
usage to meet customer needs. 

Further information about our Scope 1 & 2 
emission sources, targets and progress; and 
detailed Scope 3 baselines; can be found in 
our Emissions Reduction Report at 
www.halma.com. 

Sustainable design and reducing Scope 3 emissions
For the majority of our companies, supply chain and 
upstream transport emissions make up the bulk of 
their Scope 3 footprint. They will need to concentrate 
on sustainable product design and supply chain 
engagement to reduce emissions (including through 
our EcoVadis supply chain programme outlined on 
page 102).

We’ve seen encouraging progress in a number of 
companies already, including supplier engagement 
programmes and an increasing focus on sustainable 
design (see case study on page 78). 

We are taking a considered approach to developing 
further targets in this area, which reflects the need 
to balance Group-led top down goals with bottom-up 
actions that are most appropriate to each company, 
while minimising reporting burden on our relatively 
small companies.

and Scope 1, 2 & 3 reporting methodologies is

TCFD Statement

Our approach to climate change
The climate emergency is one of the biggest issues facing our society and our environment. The physical 
impacts of climate change are of significant concern to all of us, as individuals and as businesses.

We believe that a robust and timely low-carbon transition in line with a 1.5-degrees Celsius trajectory is highly 
aligned with Halma’s purpose to grow a safer, cleaner, healthier future for everyone, every day and therefore 
a significant source of potential opportunities for Halma. Alongside this, climate change presents potential 
transition and physical risks for Halma. However, as set out further in this Report, on balance we believe 
that pursuing potential climate-related opportunities for Halma, which are highly aligned with our 
purpose and long-term growth drivers, should be the focus of our strategic response.

Introduction
Our disclosures within this Annual Report and Accounts 
are consistent with the four Task Force on Climate-
related Financial Disclosures (TCFD) recommendations 
and the 11 recommended disclosures as required by 
the Listing Rule. 

In order to ensure our TCFD report is proportionate 
with our overall strategic report and business risks 
and opportunities, supplementary details which are 
not material to our overall assessment or disclosures, 
including additional details from our inaugural risk 
and opportunity assessment process in 2022, are set 
out in last year’s 2022 Annual Report and Accounts 
on pages 89 to 95 (available on our website at 
www.halma.com). 

We wrote last year in our first mandatory TCFD Report 
that we would continue to improve our disclosures 
over time as best practice develops, and we remain 
committed to this. In preparing our disclosures, we 
have considered the TCFD additional guidance for 
all sectors (2021 TCFD Annex).

This year, we have made progress in screening, 
estimating and publishing baselines for all relevant 
categories of Scope 3 emissions. While quantifying 
our baselines has identified two main relevant 
Scope 3 categories for Halma, it has also confirmed 
our expectation that our Scope 3 emissions do not 
represent a significant risk to our business model.

TCFD in the context of our business model
Our approach to sustainability, risk management 
and climate aligns with our Sustainable 
Growth Model. 

We have a highly decentralised organisational 
model that places our operational resources 
close to our customers through locally-
managed, autonomous and agile companies. 

Our companies operate in highly diverse markets 
and none of our companies contribute more than 
10% of Group revenue. 

This business model enables our companies to 
respond quickly to changing markets and events 
and company boards are empowered to make 
strategic decisions within Halma’s framework.

Group structure.

Governance
Our Group management structure is simple and lean, 
with only three layers – companies, sectors, and Group 
teams – all of which are focused on driving purpose-
aligned growth enabling fast decision-making and 
minimising bureaucracy.

Further details of our Board and management structure, 
including the connections between the management 
structure and the Board governance structure, are set 
out in the Corporate Governance Report on page 103. 

This Governance section and diagram below shows how 
our climate-related governance sits within our overall 
governance structure. There have been no changes to 
our climate-related governance during the year.

Other 
Information

a) Describe the Board’s oversight of  
climate-related risks and opportunities.
The Board as a whole has ultimate oversight of and 
responsibility for climate-related opportunities and risks 
and is highly engaged on this topic. At least annually, 
it reviews management’s Group-level assessment of 
climate-related opportunities and risks; our performance 
against our sustainability framework and our climate 
change-related targets; approves any new or amended 
climate-related targets; and reviews additional 
information on relevant climate-related opportunities 
and risks for standalone acquisition opportunities. 

The Board also received a report on sustainability at 
two thirds of scheduled Board meetings during 2023, 
and receives an update on our progress on climate 
change-related actions and targets at least annually. 

The Audit Committee has responsibility for approving 
our overall TCFD disclosures as part of the Annual 
Report and Accounts process. During 2023, the 
Remuneration Committee continued to oversee 
the inclusion of climate-related targets in executive 
remuneration, as set out in our Remuneration 
Committee Report on page 136.

b) Describe management’s role in assessing and 
managing climate-related risks and opportunities.
The Sustainability Management committee (SMC) is 
responsible for identification and management of 
climate-related opportunities and risks at the Group 
level. It meets at least quarterly, and its decisions and 
activities are relayed to and reviewed by the Executive 
Board and Board via the SMC Chair, our Group General 
Counsel and Chief Sustainability Officer. It brings 
together a cross-functional team of Group and 
Sector representatives. 

During 2023, as part of our Principal Risks process, it 
performed an annual review of the climate-related risks 
identified in 2022, as well as reviewing the methodology 
and assumptions used to determine our Scope 3 baselines 
and our assessment on the potential significance of this 
information on our climate-related risks. In addition, the 
SMC input into the continued development and rollout 
of our sustainability strategy, which encourages our 
companies to pursue climate and sustainability-related 
business opportunities.

The Sector Chief Executives are responsible for 
identifying and pursuing opportunities at the 
sector level. Sector-level climate-related risks 
are not captured separately, but are captured 
within the Group risk overview.

The SMC and Sector Chief Executives are informed 
about and monitor climate-related issues through 
informal updates and discussions, as relevant topics 
arise, with the Sustainability function and/or 
external advisers.

Each company board is responsible for identifying and 
managing climate-related opportunities and risks at 
the company level, reflecting our decentralised, agile 
and autonomous business model. As explained further 
in the Risk management section below, they are 
continuing to develop their capabilities in this area.

Strategy
Like all businesses, Halma is exposed to potential 
transition and physical risks associated with climate 
change, as outlined further in this Report. However, 
given the potential scale of climate-related opportunities, 
our strategic response is primarily focused on developing 
and pursing these opportunities over the short to 
medium term. 

a) Describe the climate-related risks and 
opportunities the organisation has identified 
over the short, medium and long term.
Time scales and significance
We use financial materiality (as set out on page 170) 
to make decisions about the potential significance of 
risks and opportunities and the appropriate level of 
detail to include in our TCFD disclosures, considering 
proportionality with the rest of the Annual Report and 
Accounts and our Principal Risks. We assess this on a 
“net basis” after consideration of mitigating factors 
or actions in place.

We consider the following timeframes in assessing 
climate-related risks and opportunities: 

Short  
term

Medium 
term

0-3 years

3-10 years

Annual strategic planning process and 
viability assessment.

Useful life of most premise leases and 
assets. Timeframe for major product 
and market shifts.

Long 
term

10-30+ years Sustainable Growth Model and M&A 
assessment timeframes.

Opportunities
We continue to believe that in aggregate, climate-
related product and market sub-opportunities (both 
organic and inorganic) will become significant for the 
Halma Group over the medium to longer term (3-30+ 
years). Given that these opportunities are only expected 
to be significant in aggregate, not individually, we refer 
to individual opportunities as “sub-opportunities” in this 
Report for clarity.

This assessment, carried out in 2022, was supported 
by top-down qualitative scenario analysis, which 
identified multiple potential organic and inorganic 
sub-opportunities within our existing Environmental & 
Analysis and Safety Sector strategies. These included 
new products and technologies, as well as greater 
demand for existing product lines1. 

A small selection of potential sub-opportunities, where 
Halma already had a market presence as at 31 March 
2022, are described in the table below in order to give 
some detail on the types of potential sub-opportunities 
that could be available to Halma companies. Given the 
diversified nature of Halma’s business model and our 
companies’ markets, and the bottom-up nature of 
investigation and pursuit of sub-opportunities, these are 
illustrative only, and significant financial impacts would 
only be expected at an aggregated level (across multiple 
sub-opportunities being pursued by multiple companies). 

Examples of potential climate-related sub-opportunities over the medium to longer term2

Description

Most relevant scenarios

Clean water leak detection, 
recycling and reuse

Stormwater and wastewater 
management

All – physical climate change driving increasing water scarcity.

All – physical climate change driving increasing storm and flooding events.

Energy efficiency-related building 
improvements and retrofits

1.5 degrees – increase in pace and scale of building retrofits required to meet 
Net Zero targets.

Industrial refrigerant detection

1.5 degrees – phase out of HFC-based refrigerants and introduction of low 
GHG potential refrigerants.

Methane detection and leakage 
prevention

1.5 degrees – reducing methane emissions as a key lever to mitigate 
near-term temperature rises.

Growth in hydrogen usage

1.5 degrees – increasing use of hydrogen in diverse applications, requiring 
detection and management.

Growing renewable energy, energy 
storage and other energy transition 
and Net Zero related end markets

1.5 degrees – rapid expansion of renewable energy and electricity end 
markets for existing Safety and Environmental & Analysis products, as well 
as new markets.

Potential financial impact

Increased profits 
from growing 
revenues and/or 
higher margin 
opportunities 
(organic and 
inorganic).

1 

In order to support our assessment that these sub-opportunities could be significant in aggregate, quantitative and qualitative data in relation to a number 
of scenarios were considered internally for a selection of the sub-opportunities. However, we do not believe that it would be appropriate or practical to disclose 
potential quantified financial impacts for the aggregate impact from climate-related opportunities. This is because there is a high degree of uncertainty about 
which specific sub-opportunities will become most impactful, and our aggregate opportunity is likely to be distributed across a high volume of small sub-
opportunities. Given Halma’s dual organic and inorganic growth strategy, potential sub-opportunities to participate in the Net Zero transition could be highly 
varied both in terms of the scale of the sub-opportunities, and the cost of accessing them. We continue to explore further sub-opportunities, including those 
related to the Net Zero transition within our Healthcare sector.

2  This table is not exhaustive and may not represent the individual sub-opportunities which are likely to become most significant over time.

Other 
Information

Nevertheless, we do not currently expect these risks to 
become significant, as our business model is expected to 
be resilient to climate-related risks, and highly exposed 
to climate-related growth opportunities. Our resilience 
stems from our highly diverse, agile and decentralised 
business model (see page 80), as well as our ability 
to provide products and operate in sectors expected 
to thrive in a low-carbon economy. 

Key mitigating factors which influenced our risk 
assessment included the diversification of the Group’s 
products, markets (including low exposure to highly 
impacted markets), geographies and first tier supply 
chains, the inherent resiliency of the Group’s business 
model, our pricing resilience, and our asset-light model. 
Fuller details are included in our 2022 Annual Report and 
Accounts on page 93, and are not repeated here in the 
interest of proportionate disclosures.

Taking the above factors into account, we have not 
identified climate change as a standalone principal 
risk for the Group, but have included the potential 
impact of climate-related issues as drivers, modifiers 
or accelerators to existing relevant principal risks, 
as shown on pages 91 to 97 in the Principal risks 
and uncertainties section3.

The table below shows the potential directional impacts 
and key mitigating actions that are captured within our 
principal risk processes for those three risk categories 
that were considered to be the most potentially 
impactful over the longer term compared to the other 
climate-related risks assessed (although these are not 
currently identified as significant risks in the context of 
our risk management framework). Equivalent information 
for all eight risk categories originally assessed is available 
in our 2022 Annual Report and Accounts on pages 89 
to 95. In the interest of proportionate disclosures, this 
information has not been reproduced in this Report due 
to the very low potential impact/likelihood of those risks 
compared to our principal risks. 

Risks
Like all businesses, Halma is exposed to both transition 
and physical climate risks. During 2022, we assessed the 
potential significance of eight risk categories identified 
in 2021. These were 

Transition risks:
• Supply chain
• Business model and communications
• Products and markets
• M&A and portfolio strategy
• Skills, talent and information
• Regulatory environment

Physical risks:
• Supply chain disruption
• Operational interruption

Our assessment included analysis of potential impacts 
across different geographies and markets/sectors. 

In 2023, we also reassessed the potential significance 
of transition-related supply chain risks and product and 
market risks as we screened and estimated baselines 
for our Scope 3 emissions, which are set out in the 
Metrics and Targets section. In particular, we noted 
that approximately 60% of our product-in-use 
emissions baseline is related to only one company 
which contributes approximately 1% of Group revenue. 
This company sells products which have high energy 
usage to meet customer needs. 

Our analysis in 2022 and 2023 concluded that there 
were no significant individual risks arising in the short 
to medium term (0-10 years). Over the longer-term 
(10-30+ years), we identified physical and transition-
driven supply chain impacts, as well as business model 
and communication risks, as potentially having the 
highest impact on the business compared to the 
other climate-related risks assessed, due to the 
higher likelihood of underlying risk events under 
transition scenarios. 

Climate-related risks over the medium to longer term

Risk category & description

Physical supply chain disruption: Increasingly 
severe extreme weather events could reduce 
availability of materials and components  
and/or interrupt transportation and logistics.

Transition-induced supply chain risks: Increased 
costs (including from carbon pricing) and 
constrained material/component availability 
resulting from the low-carbon transition.

Business model and communications: Meeting 
increasing or shifting stakeholder, regulatory 
and reporting expectations within our 
decentralised business model.

Potential financial impacts (not currently 
expected to have a significant impact on 
financial position or performance)

Key actions

•  Increased costs
•  Revenue disruption

3  Despite our assessment that these risks are not likely to be significant, at 31 March 2023 we continued to subject balance sheet items to detailed review against our 

climate-related risks, including goodwill, acquired intangible assets and PP&E. As set out in the Critical accounting judgements and key sources of estimation uncertainty 
section of the Accounting Policies of the Accounts (page 185), there were no indicators of impairment identified or adjustments made as a result of these reviews.

TCFD Statement continued

As set out in the Risk Management section of these 
disclosures, we continue to reassess the potential 
impact of climate-related risks on an ongoing basis. 

They may become more significant over time if new 
information becomes available or we have significant 
changes to our structure.

b) Describe the impact of climate-related risks 
and opportunities on the organisation’s businesses, 
strategy, and financial planning.
Opportunities
Our approach to climate-related opportunity 
identification and pursuit reflects our Sustainable 
Growth Model (see pages 18 to 25), and 
the highly granular, diverse and early-stage nature 
of sub-opportunities. Our approach contrasts with a 
more centralised decision-making, prioritisation and 
target setting approach which would not be 
appropriate within our business model.

Sector and company level:
• Talented people throughout the organisation 

seek and pursue most relevant sub-opportunities 

• Autonomous and agile individual companies 

can rapidly take advantage of sub-opportunities

• R&D and capital expenditure budgets are set 

from the bottom up

Group level:
• Low-carbon transition and adaptation sub-

opportunities are considered in the development 
of M&A strategies

• Standalone acquisitions’ level of alignment with 
the low-carbon transition is explicitly considered

• Focus on increasing education and awareness around 

low-carbon transition and adaptation across the Group

During 2023, we made three standalone acquisitions 
(for our Safety and Environmental & Analysis Sectors) 
which have market sub-opportunities aligned with a 
low-carbon transition4. Please see the case studies on 
WEETECH (page 43), Deep Trekker (page 49) and FirePro 
(page 74) for more information.

Introductory sessions on climate change mitigation 
and adaptation were delivered during 2023 to the 
Safety and Environmental & Analysis Sector boards, 
encouraging discussion of where companies may be 
able to grow by enabling the Net Zero transition or 
supporting adaptation. Similar sessions with the 
Healthcare sector board focused on the circular 
economy and resultant issues (including climate-
related issues).

Although climate opportunities/risks are not yet uniformly 
incorporated into board discussions across companies, a 
number of companies are actively investigating climate-
related sub-opportunities.

4  Our fourth standalone acquisition was in a niche of the Healthcare Sector 

where climate-related opportunities were considered less significant.

Risks
As a result of the risk assessment mentioned above, 
we do not outline additional details on our strategic 
response to climate-related risks or risk-related metrics 
and targets within this Report. In addition, we do not 
expect to carry out quantitative scenario analysis on 
these risks or disclose their quantified financial impacts, 
unless our assessment of their significance changes as 
a result of our ongoing risk management process.

Our plans to transition to a low-carbon economy
Halma operates globally and recognises the need 
to work towards Net Zero for our entire value chain. 
We are considering the developing guidance 
from the UK Government around transition plans, 
as well as the TCFD’s transition plan guidance. 

While we have not identified our own emissions as a 
significant risk to Halma, we have set interim and long-
term Scope 1 & 2 targets and have disclosed our Scope 3 
baselines in order to set appropriate Scope 3 interim 
and longer-term targets (see Metrics and Targets section 
below). As such, we currently disclose some information 
covering how we are planning to reduce Scope 1 & 2 
emissions in our Emissions Reduction Report available 
at www.halma.com, given this is not significant 
information to include in our TCFD report. We will work 
towards creating a full transition plan as we develop our 
Scope 3 targets, taking into account our business model 
(see page 80) where our companies are empowered to 
develop their own sustainability and transition plans 
from the bottom up. 

c) Describe the resilience of the organisation’s 
strategy, taking into consideration different 
climate-related scenarios including a 2°C or 
lower temperature scenario.
During 2022, we identified and assessed climate-
related opportunities and risks using the three high-level, 
qualitative, narrative scenarios shown in the table below.

Given our assessment that climate-related risks are 
unlikely to have a significant impact on the business, 
and the significant diversity of opportunities available, 
we will continue to review whether and in what contexts 
quantitative scenario assessment might be able to 
provide investor-useful additional information.

related risks, and highly exposed to climate-related 
growth opportunities.

Nevertheless, the “late policy action” scenario creates 
the largest potential challenge for Halma over the 
medium to long term, particularly in relation to 
navigating rapid and divergent regulatory, disclosure 
and stakeholder expectation changes within our 
decentralised business model. In this scenario, 
however, we would expect significant transition-
related growth opportunities.

Over the longer-term, a “fossil-fuelled growth” scenario 
would create increasing operational and supply-chain 
challenges, and fewer climate-related opportunities 
for Halma. However, we believe this scenario is the 
least likely outcome given increasing momentum and 
commitments to a Net Zero future among governments, 
businesses and other stakeholders – all of which support 
Halma’s future growth.
Risk Management
a) Describe the organisation’s processes for 
identifying and assessing climate-related risks; 
b) describe the organisation’s processes for 
managing climate-related risks; and c) describe 
how processes for identifying, assessing and 
managing climate-related risks are integrated 
into the organisation’s overall risk management.
The Risk management and internal controls section 
on pages 88 to 90 sets out our overall risk management 
system in which climate-related risks are identified 
and managed within both the “bottom-up risk 
assessment” and the “top-down principal and 
emerging risks” frameworks.

The Group’s existing risk management process enables 
bottom-up, climate-related opportunities and risks 
to be captured. As set out in the Risk management 
and internal controls section on pages 88 to 90, 
companies and functions identify opportunities and 
risks on an ongoing basis and, more formally, as part 
of their annual strategic reviews where they assess 
how these are currently controlled and whether any 
further actions are required.

We do not expect that our mostly small- to medium-
sized companies are yet sufficiently educated and 
equipped to fully capture and manage transition 
and physical risks, particularly over the medium to 
longer term. For example, the companies do not 
currently utilise climate scenario analysis. However, 
we generally do not expect climate-related risks 
arising at the individual company level to create a 
significant risk to the Group as a whole, because of 
the decentralised and diversified nature of Halma 
(see page 80). 

In 2022 we concentrated on identifying and assessing 
the significance of potential climate-related opportunities 
and risks as part of a standalone process, using scenario 
analysis, at the Group level. This standalone assessment 
is described in more detail in our 2022 Annual Report 
and Accounts to conserve space for more relevant 
and timely disclosures.

This year and going forward, the continued identification, 
assessment and management of these Group-level risks 
is integrated into our top-down principal risk process, 
which includes a review of the emerging risks landscape 
(see page 90). In addition, we are supporting our 
companies to improve their ability to capture bottom-
up climate-related risks, by integrating climate-related 
risks into the overall risk landscape in a more 
prominent manner.

We assess the relative importance of climate-related 
opportunities and risks at the Group level by comparing 
qualitative potential impact and likelihood with the 
same scales used to assess principal risks. This qualitative 
process includes a high level, directional assessment of 
financial impact as well as reputational, regulatory and 
other impacts (including considering existing and 
emerging regulatory requirements).
Metrics and Targets
a) Disclose the metrics used by the organisation 
to assess climate-related risks and opportunities in 
line with its strategy and risk management process.
We disclose total GHG emissions in line with the TCFD 
cross-industry metric guidance, as set out below. Although 
we have not identified our Scope 1 & 2 emissions as a 
significant risk, 5% of executive bonuses are linked to an 
energy productivity target that supports achievement 
of our Scope 1 & 2 targets (outlined below), as set out 
further in our Remuneration Report on page 136. 

We do not consider that most of the other suggested 
cross-industry metrics are currently appropriate for 
our business model and the nature of our 
opportunities and risks. 

Given our assessment that climate-related risks do not 
pose a significant risk to our business model, we do not 
currently intend to disclose the amount or percentage 
of assets or activities vulnerable to transition or physical 
risks. We will continue to consider the use of an internal 
carbon price, if relevant, as we develop our Scope 3 
transition plan. 

We do not currently use any central metrics to manage 
climate-related opportunities, including the TCFD’s 
suggested cross-industry metrics on opportunities or 
capital deployment. Where individual businesses and 
sectors identify climate-related opportunities, they may 
use specific metrics to track their progress against these, 
in line with our decentralised model and the granular, 
diverse and early-stage nature of the sub-opportunities.

TCFD Statement continued

As our climate governance process evolves and we 
increase centrally available climate-related information 
over time, we may be able to disclose other climate-
relevant opportunity metrics such as taxonomy-aligned 
revenues or product development where relevant.

b) Disclose Scope 1, Scope 2, and, if appropriate, 
Scope 3 greenhouse gas (GHG) emissions and 
the related risks.
Scope 1 & 2 emissions
Our Scope 1 & 2 emissions, calculated in accordance 
with the GHG protocol, are disclosed in the SECR-
compliant table at the bottom of this Report. Our 
Scope 1 & 2 emissions profile is fairly simple, and at 
approximately 18 ktCO2e in our 2020 baseline year, 
is small compared to the FTSE 100 average and only 
c.2% of our total baseline greenhouse gas footprint.

We do not currently obtain assurance over our 
Scope 1 & 2 emissions or related metrics, but are 
reviewing what level of assurance may be appropriate 
considering our business and the way we use these metrics.

Scope 3 emissions 
During 2023, we worked with an external consultant 
to estimate our Scope 3 baseline (2020) emissions. 
Figures were calculated for all relevant categories in 
accordance with the GHG protocol and using 
acceptable Scope 3 methodologies, but as these figures 
are heavily reliant on assumptions and estimates they 
may be recalculated in the future as data availability 
and accuracy improves. We estimate that 2020 Scope 3 
emissions were approximately 0.95 million tonnes CO2e, 
or c.98% of our total baseline greenhouse gas footprint. 

The main components of this footprint are as follows:

• Supply chain (including upstream transport and 
distribution): approximately 0.34 million tCO2e 
(c.35% of total 2020 baseline emissions). 

• Products’ use phase: approximately 0.58 million tCO2e 
(c.59% of total baseline) – with approximately 60% 
of these emissions relating to one company comprising 
approximately 1% of Group revenue, which sells 
products which have high energy usage to meet 
customer needs.

Full details of all categories of baseline Scope 3 emissions 
are available in our Emissions Reduction Report at 
www.halma.com, given this is not significant 
information to include in our TCFD report.

c) Describe the targets used by the organisation 
to manage climate-related risks and opportunities 
and performance against targets.
Scope 1 & 2 emissions
Despite not identifying our Scope 1 & 2 emissions as a 
significant risk, we have targets in place to reduce our 
emissions in line with stakeholder expectations. These 
targets are outlined in the table below and include Net 
Zero by 2040 and a 1.5 degree-aligned interim 
2030 target.

During 2023, our company boards have focused on 
creating their sustainability action plans. These include 
their bottom-up Scope 1 & 2 emissions reduction plans 
where relevant. A high level summary of performance 
against our targets is included in the table below. 
Full details on the definitions of our Scope 1 & 2 targets, 
our current and historic performance against them, 
and narrative discussion about key Scope 1 & 2 emission 
sources, milestones, and key levers required to reach 
our targets and our progress is disclosed in our Emissions 
Reduction Plan available at www.halma.com. This 
level of detail is not included in our strategic report in 
the interests of proportionate disclosures, given the 
low materiality of our emissions.

Scope 3 emissions 
We have estimated and reported our 2020 Scope 3 
baselines in order to confirm our assessment that 
these do not constitute a significant risk. However, 
we recognise the need for us to work towards Net 
Zero for our entire value chain. We are now developing 
our reporting plan and capabilities to be able to 
update these figures on a more regular basis to meet 
stakeholder expectations, and working towards setting 
appropriate reduction targets. Halma companies are 
also already investigating how they can reduce Scope 3 
emissions from their supply chains.

10% During the year, we saw a c.10% increase in revenue (adjusted to remove the 
effects of currency movements and acquisitions) while energy consumption 
(adjusted on the same basis) remained relatively flat. Changes in energy 
consumption reflected various operational changes and investments, 
including premise moves and expansions, the impact of energy efficiency 
measures at a number of our companies, and a number of elements outside 
our control (i.e. warmer winters in some geographies). In our first year of 
targeting energy productivity, we were pleased to see an increased focus 
on this issue among most of our companies. 

Long term: Net Zero by 20404

 Market-based calculation of Scope 2 emissions. This target is aligned with guidance from the Science-based Targets initiative (SBTi) and is an absolute measure 
aligned with the non-sector specific 1.5-degree emissions pathway. This target has not been verified, as SBTi verification requires our target to include Scope 3.

2  Current year renewable % reflects the full year impact of acquisitions and disposals made during the period. Comparative figures are not updated for the 

impact of acquisitions and disposals made in subsequent periods.

3  Revenue/energy consumed. Annual straight-line increase from 2022. Due to the inclusion of this metric in remuneration, it is calculated on a different basis to 

Scope 1 & 2 emissions and renewable electricity percentage. Revenue is adjusted to a constant currency basis, and both revenue and energy are adjusted to exclude 
all acquisitions in the current and prior period. This target was set using the EP100 initiative minimum commitment (to double energy productivity over 25 years).
4  Market-based calculation of Scope 2 emissions. Our Net Zero target is aligned with guidance from the Science-based Targets initiative (SBTi). We will reach Net Zero 

by reducing emissions as much as is feasible before using carbon removal instruments, as set out in our Emissions Reduction Report at www.halma.com.

Reporting methodology and scope:
We have reported on all the emission sources required under the Companies (Directors’ Report) and Limited Liability Partnerships (Energy and Carbon Report) 
Regulations 2018. We have employed the Operational Control definition to outline our carbon footprint boundary; included within that boundary are Scope 1 & 2 
emissions from manufacturing sites and offices which we own and/or operate. Excluded from our footprint boundary are emissions from manufacturing sites and 
offices which we do not own and/or operate and emissions considered non-material by the business. We have used the GHG Protocol Corporate Accounting and 
Reporting Standard (revised edition) and the Environmental Reporting Guidelines (March 2019) including Streamlined Energy and Carbon Reporting (SECR) guidance 
published by the UK’s Department for Business, Energy & Industrial Strategy (BEIS). Emission factors were sourced from the UK Government’s GHG Conversion Factors 
for Company Reporting 2022 and the International Energy Agency’s Emissions Factors (2022 edition). For our Scope 2 market-based calculations, we used residual 
emission factors where available from the Reliable Disclosure Organization (RE-DISS 2021 edition). Further information about our basis of preparation for all emissions 
and energy data can be found on our website at www.halma.com.

Included in Scope 1 are GHG emissions from direct fuel combustion at our sites, refrigerants, and from fuel use in our company-owned or leased vehicle fleet.

1 
2  Electricity purchased for our own use. Market-based is net of market instruments. 
3  Business air travel, Well to Tank, grey fleet (private and hire cars used for business), waste generation. 2023 Scope 3 annually calculated emissions reflect the 

continued recovery in business travel following restrictions during the pandemic.

4  Prior to 2021, we did not show market-based Scope 2 emissions. In line with our science-based target, which is calculated using the market-based approach, 

we have transitioned to showing our intensity measure based on the market-based method. We do not show a recalculated intensity measure for our 2020 baseline.
5  Estimated as explained further in our TCFD report above, and in our Emissions Reduction Report and ESG Data Basis of Preparation document at www.halma.com.
6  Our Scope 1 & 2 (market-based) GHG emissions for the year ended 31 March 2020 form the baseline for our Science-based target. Given the acquisitive nature of 
Halma, we have chosen to apply a 5% base year threshold for the structural change trigger of acquisitions and disposals. This year the impact of our acquisitions 
and disposals did not reach the 5% threshold for a base year recalculation. We do not recalculate Scope 3 annually calculated emissions for acquisitions and disposals.

Examples of energy efficiency measures undertaken during the year by our companies included upgrades to more energy efficient equipment and premises, LED 
lighting upgrades, retrofitting motion sensors, improving HVAC controls and processes, and improving monitoring, metering and energy awareness programmes.

Risk management and internal control

Managing risk and leveraging opportunities 
to achieve our sustainable growth strategy

Our approach to risk management 
Effective management of risks enables us to leverage 
opportunities to achieve our strategic goals and provides 
a solid foundation from which our businesses can grow. 
Whilst there is a group-wide framework and approach 
to risk management, as described in this section, our 
decentralised business model empowers every employee 
and every business at Halma to identify and manage 
risks and take advantage of opportunities. Our risk 
management approach is underpinned by a risk 
awareness culture which allows management to make 
better commercial decisions, deliver our sustainable 
growth strategy and maximise the benefits of our 
decentralised business model. During the year, the 
responsibility of the risk management area has been 
transitioned from the Director of Internal Audit & 
Assurance to the newly created role of the Director 
of Risk & Compliance. 

The new structure has strengthened our governance 
model by enhancing the independence between the 
second and third line of defence, enabling enhanced 
risk and compliance support to Halma companies, and 
expanding the current independent assurance coverage. 

The Director of Risk & Compliance is responsible 
for ensuring that our Risk, Control and Compliance 
Framework is continuously evolving in alignment 
with the Group’s growth, strategy and DNA. A key 
focus in 2023, which will continue in the upcoming 
years, is on enhancing the quality of risk discussions 
at the companies board level and increasing the 
inclusion of opportunities within those discussions, 
where appropriate. 

Our risk and control governance framework

Risk management process
As in prior years, each company within Halma identifies 
risks and opportunities as part of their annual strategic 
reviews, assesses their likelihood and impact, evaluates 
existing risk mitigations and assesses whether any 
further actions are required. A similar exercise is 
performed at sector and Group level as part of the 
Group’s “bottom-up” risk assessment process. 

Our “top-down” approach focuses on reviewing our 
principal risks and takes into account the results of the 
bottom-up risk assessment, the emerging risk review 
and the Executive Board perspectives. The assessment 
of the principal risks, the risk appetite, mitigating 
actions, and the evaluation of potential emerging risks 
are reviewed and approved by the Executive Board. 
The Audit Committee reviews the effectiveness of the 
process, whilst the Board reviews and approves the 
principal risks, the risk appetite and evaluates whether 
the risks are managed within the risk appetite assigned 
to them.

Any actions to improve how we manage our principal 
risks are captured and tracked to completion in our 
integrated risk, control and assurance software. Risk 
mitigations are periodically audited by the Internal 
Audit & Assurance Team.

During the year, deep-dive risk analyses are performed 
on specific areas to assist the Executive Board in their 
strategic decision-making. These areas included specific 
elements of emerging and principal risks, such as 
climate-related risks (refer to our TCFD statement 

section on page 80). The risk deep dives and their 
outcome are integrated into the wider risk management 
approach and process.

Risk Appetite
The risk appetite is a foundational element of our risk 
framework as it provides guidance to management on 
the amount and type of risk we seek to take in pursuing 
our strategic objectives. For the purpose of identifying 
the level of risk appetite we have towards our principal 
risks, we defined four risk appetite categories, as follows:

• Averse: We have little appetite for risk and will seek 
to minimise our exposure and avoid uncertainty.
• Cautious: We have an appetite for some risk but 
prefer options that have a low degree of downside.
• Open: We are open to taking risks after considering 

potential options, and will choose options that have a 
greater likelihood of success and offer an acceptable 
level of reward.

• Seeking: We are willing to proactively take risks and be 
more innovative to achieve higher returns, despite the 
higher inherent risks. 

The risk appetite statements are approved by the Board, 
which also reviews the level of risk appetite associated 
with our principal risks annually, recognising that risk 
appetite will change and evolve over time. Principal 
risks are assessed against their risk appetite to evaluate 
whether further risk mitigation actions should be taken 
to ensure that the risk levels remain within the Board’s 
risk appetite.

Case study

A proactive and agile approach to the fast-
changing geopolitical and economic landscape

In light of the rising complexity of the geopolitical 
landscape and its repercussions on the economic 
outlook, the Group carried out a deep dive assessment 
to understand macro and geopolitical trends and their 
potential impact on Halma.

The assessment was carried out with the support of 
our external advisors which helped us to include the 
perspective of external stakeholders into the analysis. 
The exercise led to the setup of a comprehensive 
framework to provide reassurance that we are 
managing this risk appropriately within our 
unique structure. 

Internal monitoring networks were enhanced by 
leveraging Halma’s Hubs regional presence to monitor 
the developments of the geopolitical landscape and 
gain on-the-ground insights. To ensure a consistent 
and comprehensive monitoring, key leading indicators 

of changes in macro and geopolitical risk have 
been identified and are being regularly monitored 
by the internal networks, which periodically update 
the sectors and the Group. 

The companies have embraced the insights of the 
analysis and used them to inform the assessment 
of their strategic and operational decisions, where 
relevant. In line with Halma’s highly decentralised 
and agile model, some of our companies have 
implemented a range of initiatives to adjust to 
the evolving geopolitical landscape, such as the 
enhancement of a regionalised approach within 
their global footprints or reassessments of their 
supply chain setup.

Risk management and internal control continued

Emerging Risks 
We consider emerging risks as part of our risk 
management review process and as part of the 
everyday management of the business. In addition to 
the daily management of such risks, we conducted a 
specific review to assess the emerging risks landscape 
over the short (0 to 2 years), medium (3 to 5 years) and 
long (6 to 10 years) periods. The review was informed by:

• emerging risk factors identified at company and sector 

level during the bottom-up assessment process;
• leading external thought leaders’ views on global 

emerging risks; and

• insights from Executive Board members on emerging 

risks trends.

Whilst a number of potential emerging risks were 
identified and assessed during the review this year, such 
as social unrest, livelihood crisis, biodiversity loss, natural 
resources crisis and other climate-related risks (see also 
TCFD Statement section at page 80), currently, none of 
these is expected to become future principal risks. 

The outcomes of the emerging risk assessment have 
been discussed with and reviewed by the Executive 
Board and by the Board. We will continue to monitor 
the evolution of emerging risks and reassess the 
landscape at least on an annual basis.

Our risk profile and principal risks
Below is a visual representation of Halma’s risk profile, 
showing the level of residual risk and the risk type for 
each principal risk. We also use Halma’s risk profile as 
a basis for our scenario analysis, including those used 
in the long-term viability statement.

Risk and impact
Failing to innovate to create new 
high-quality products to meet 
customer needs whilst capturing 
digital and sustainability growth 
opportunities, or failure to adequately 
protect intellectual property, resulting 
in a loss of market share and poor 
financial performance.

How do we manage the risk? 
Halma's digital innovation strategy focuses on the education 
of our companies around customer centricity and the incubation 
and acceleration of innovation across the companies. This 
includes regular promotion, training and monitoring of agile 
or lean start-up ways of working in companies. As the I&D 
team execute on their strategy over time, we expect that 
the companies will develop greater capabilities on innovation 
and digital as they drive their product strategies.

For more information on our innovation-
related target, see the “Research & 
Development” KPI in the KPIs section.

Risk evolution 
The risk score was minimally adjusted 
during the year based on a new 
estimate of the missed opportunity 
of failing to innovate.

The strategy delivery is supported by an innovation champions 
network and partnerships, conferences, development 
programmes and innovation awards which help spread 
and reward ideas across the Group. Sectors also play a key 
role in promoting active collaboration between companies 
to share ideas and experiences and reviewing R&D budgets 
and projects to ensure that the spend effectively supports 
the growth strategy in targeted markets. Sector M&A activity 
is also targeted to help address innovation and R&D gaps, in 
line with sector-specific initiatives. Key R&D and innovation 
metrics are periodically reviewed to measure positive impact.

Product development is devolved to our companies who 
are closest to the customer. Companies are encouraged to 
develop and protect intellectual property, and focus on talent 
and retention to ensure there is sufficient expertise within 
the business.

How do we manage the risk? 
We have comprehensive recruitment processes to recruit the 
brightest talent, including the "Future Leaders" programme 
to attract and develop graduates into future leadership roles.

The Senior Management reward structure is aligned with 
strategic priorities of companies, sectors and Group and 
DEI targets. Periodic review of reward packages to ensure 
competitiveness, benchmark with the market and 
alignment with high long-term growth. 

An Annual Performance and Development Review process 
is in place for sector and Executive Board members. The 
Nomination Committee reviews succession and development 
plans annually. A strategic review of sector board and company 
leadership talent is performed annually to identify and develop 
future leaders. 

Programmes to develop talent and enhance skills (including 
climate and sustainability-related skills) are in place across 
our companies.

An annual employee engagement survey is carried out to 
provide insight into employee sentiment, including alignment 
between strategy and objectives and clarity to employees 
about their contribution towards achieving objectives.

02. Talent and Diversity

Risk Owner:
Group Talent, Culture and 
Communications Director

Inherent risk level:

Risk and impact
Not having the right talent and diversity 
at all levels of the organisation to deliver 
our strategy, resulting in reduced 
financial performance.

Residual risk level:

Residual risk change:

 No change 

Risk appetite: Open

For more information on our talent 
and diversity-related targets, see the 
“Employee engagement”, “H&S” and 
the “ Diversity, Equity & Inclusion” 
KPIs in the KPIs section.

Risk evolution
During the year, a number of initiatives 
started in 2022 were finalised and fully 
implemented, such as a diversity, equity 
and inclusion target for the Managing 
Director level. The year saw the Group 
Chief Executive and Chief Financial 
Officer transitions, which, although 
brings an inherent risk, have been 
extensively planned, significantly 
mitigating the risk. Overall the risk 
level remains in line with the prior year.

03. Acquisitions and Investments

Risk Owner:
Group Chief Executive

Inherent risk level:

Residual risk level:

Residual risk change:

 Increased

Risk appetite: Open

Risk and impact
Failing to achieve our strategic growth 
target for acquisitions and investments 
due to insufficient opportunities being 
identified, poor due diligence or poor 
integration, resulting in erosion of 
shareholder value.

For more information on our inorganic 
growth target, see the “Acquisition 
profit growth” KPI in the KPIs section.

Risk evolution
During the year, the risk level rose 
due to the increasingly challenging 
macroeconomic (i.e. increased cost 
of capital and debt) and geopolitical 
environment. The highly volatile 
external environment increases the 
complexity of finding deals that are 
able to deliver on our inorganic growth 
strategy and are at the right level of 
risk appetite. Given their role in the 
acquisition strategy, we recognise 
that the Group Chief Executive and 
Chief Financial Officer combined 
change might be seen as introducing 
a certain level of risk. This potential risk 
is adequately mitigated by the strength 
of well established end-to-end M&A 
processes led by experienced teams. 
Furthermore, the Group Chief Executive 
and the Group Financial Offer have 
extensive M&A experience gained both 
internally to Halma and externally, 
which further mitigates this risk. 

How do we manage the risk? 
Acquisitions are a core element of Halma's sustainable growth 
model; hence the Group has a clear strategy that allows us 
to take advantage of new growth opportunities through the 
acquisition of companies in our existing or adjacent markets. 

Regular reporting of the acquisition pipeline to the Executive 
Board and the Board. All acquisitions are reviewed and 
approved by the Group Chief Executive, Chief Financial 
Officer and Board.

Dedicated M&A Directors who support the sectors in their 
acquisition strategy, from pipeline development to the delivery 
of the acquisition. A robust due diligence process is carried 
out for all acquisitions by experienced staff who bring in 
specialist expertise as required, and low-carbon transition 
risk and opportunity reviews are built into our standalone 
M&A process.

Strategic transformation plans and clear processes are in 
place for new acquisitions to enable them to achieve their 
growth potential whilst integrating into the Group (including 
from a control framework and compliance perspective).

Internal Audit reviews are performed within 12 months of 
acquisition to assess the effectiveness of the required control 
framework for standalone acquisitions. Post-acquisition 
reviews are performed for all acquisitions after 12 months 
to ensure strategic objectives are being met and to identify 
learnings for future acquisitions.

Minority equity investments are assessed through the lenses 
of Halma's investment framework and executed in line 
with an established acquisition process which ensures an 
appropriate level of assessment and oversight. Minority 
investments are regularly reviewed by the Investment 
committee, and "Lessons learnt reviews" are carried out 
to improve the existing processes.

04. Cyber

Risk Owner:
Chief Technology Officer

Inherent risk level:

Residual risk level:

Residual risk change:
 Marginal increase

Risk appetite: Averse

Risk and impact
Loss of digital intellectual property/ 
data or ability to operate systems 
or connected devices due to internal 
failure or external attack. There is 
resulting loss of information or ability 
to continue operations, and therefore 
financial and reputational damage.

Risk evolution
The inherent risk level increased during 
the year due to the continuously 
evolving landscape of external cyber 
threats, however it is mitigated by the 
delivery of investments to upgrade the 
cybersecurity defence. The finalisation 
of the current initiatives is crucial to 
keep the risk within the risk appetite.

How do we manage the risk? 
Cyber risk is owned by the CTO at an executive level, who 
periodically updates the Board and Audit Committee.

All employees are required to comply with the IT Acceptable 
Use Policy. Regular online IT awareness training is provided 
for all employees who use computers.

A group-wide IT framework is in place, periodically reviewed 
and includes Cyber risk policies and procedures. Companies 
confirm the effectiveness of their most critical IT controls 
(including documented and tested disaster recovery plans 
for critical systems and infrastructure) every six months 
through the Internal Control Certification process. The 
Internal Audit & Assurance Team periodically and 
independently tests these controls.

There are central and local IT resources maintaining and 
sharing updated technical knowledge. The central technology 
resources are available to companies to help them better 
manage cyber risk.

Cyber threats are monitored and reported upon every two 
months for all parts of the Group. 

Group-wide Incident Management Policy and Crisis 
communications plans are in place. Access to cyber 
expertise is available should a cyberattack occur.

05. Economic and Geopolitical Uncertainty

Risk Owner:
Group Chief Executive

Inherent risk level:

Residual risk level:

Residual risk change:

 Increased

Risk appetite: Cautious 

Risk and impact
Failure to anticipate or adapt to 
macroeconomic and geopolitical 
changes, resulting in a decline in 
financial performance and an impact 
on the carrying value of goodwill and 
other assets. This risk remains elevated 
in certain geographies due to geopolitical 
events such as the conflict in Ukraine 
and US/ China trade relations.

Risk evolution
During the year, the overall risk level 
increased, triggered by the higher level of 
inherent risk due to the macroeconomic 
situation and increasing geopolitical 
complexities. During the year, a deep 
dive risk assessment was carried out 
to assess the Group's exposure to 
key macroeconomic and geopolitical 
risks, which resulted in an enhanced 
monitoring process for relevant 
geopolitical risk factors. Halma remains 
resilient to macroeconomic volatility 
due to growth drivers linked to highly 
regulated markets, demand for 
healthcare and life-critical resources, 
and growing efforts to address 
climate change, waste and pollution. 
See the case study on page 89 for 
more information on the 
assessment performed.

How do we manage the risk? 
The diverse portfolio of companies across the sectors, 
in multiple countries and in relatively non-cyclical global 
niche markets with secular long-term growth drivers helps 
to minimise the impact of any single event.

Monitoring mechanisms are established at Group, 
sector and company levels, including:

•  Regular monitoring and assessment of emerging trends 

and potential risks and opportunities relating to economic 
or geopolitical uncertainties.

•  Monitoring of end market exposure and changes in key 

end markets due to macroeconomic factors.

•  Financial warning signs KPIs give earlier indications of 

potential problems, and half-yearly assessments of the 
carrying value of goodwill and other assets are performed.

In line with Halma's model, the risk is managed at the local 
company level through decentralised decision-making and 
autonomy to rapidly adjust to changing circumstances. 
The companies have robust credit management processes 
in place and operations, cash deposits and sources of 
funding in uncertain regions are kept to a minimum.

The Group provides continuous support to company boards 
and DCEs to navigate geopolitical changes (including when 
these changes are triggered by disorderly low-carbon transition 
scenarios). Halma's financial strength and availability of 
pooled resources in the Group can be deployed, if needed, 
to further mitigate the risk. 

06. Non-compliance with Laws and Regulations

Risk Owner:
Group General Counsel & 
Chief Sustainability Officer

Inherent risk level:

Residual risk level:

Residual risk change:
 Marginal increase

Risk appetite: Averse 

Risk and impact
We are not fully compliant with 
relevant laws and regulations, resulting 
in fines, reputational damage and 
possible criminal liability for Halma 
senior management.

Risk evolution
The marginal increase in the risk 
likelihood is primarily driven by the 
increasing complexity of the regulatory 
environment and the growth of our 
companies and the Group. Effective 
mitigating controls are in place to 
mitigate the current risk and take a 
proactive approach to this increasingly 
challenging context. 

How do we manage the risk? 
Legal compliance is owned by the Group General Counsel 
& Chief Sustainability Officer at an executive level, who 
periodically updates the Board and Audit Committee. Group 
policies, procedures and guidance are in place, setting out 
the Group's requirements from a compliance and regulatory 
perspective. Companies confirm the effectiveness of their 
most critical legal compliance controls every six months 
through the Internal Control Certification process. The Internal 
Audit & Assurance Team periodically and independently tests 
these controls. Group Legal, Sustainability & Governance (LSG) 
Team advises on legislative and regulatory changes relevant 
to the Group as a listed company. All employees are required 
to sign to confirm that they have read and understood the 
Halma Code of Conduct. An ongoing compliance training 
programme is in place for Group and its companies. A 
whistleblowing hotline is available to all employees and 
third parties to raise concerns over the lack of compliance 
and misconduct. These are independently followed up and 
investigated. The Group LSG Team resources, including the 
Deputy General Counsels, who sit on the sector boards, and 
a panel of high-quality external legal advisors, are available 
to sectors and companies to help them better manage legal 
compliance risks, including during due diligence processes. 

The board of each company is accountable for identifying 
and monitoring what laws are relevant to their business, 
including any emerging or changing legislation, and for 
ensuring commercial legal risks are appropriately managed. 
Claims and litigation risks are reported to Group by all 
companies every six months. Material legal issues and risks 
are reported to and discussed by the Board every quarter. 
Appropriate levels of Group insurance cover are maintained. 
A crisis management plan exists to manage communications 
and the reputational risk for Halma and/or its companies.

Risk Owner:
Group General Counsel & 
Chief Sustainability Officer

Inherent risk level:

Residual risk level:

Residual risk change:

 No change 

Risk appetite: Averse

Risk and impact
There is a risk we are unable to respond 
to large scale disasters or natural 
catastrophes such as hurricanes, 
floods, fires or pandemics, as well as 
longer term changes to the climate 
such as increasing water scarcity and 
temperatures, resulting in the inability 
of one or more of our businesses to 
operate, causing financial loss and 
reputational damage. This risk 
includes potential impacts from 
physical climate change on our 
supply chains. 

Risk evolution
The reassessment of the climate-
related risks and opportunities 
confirmed the risk level to be in line 
with the prior year. More information 
is available in our TCFD Statement on 
page 80. 

08. Organic Growth

Residual risk level:

Residual risk change:

 No change 

Risk appetite: Open 

Risk and impact
Failing to deliver desired organic growth, 
resulting in missed expected strategic 
growth targets and erosion of 
shareholder value.

This risk includes potential impacts 
from the Net Zero transition on 
our supply chain. 

For more information on our 
organic growth target, see the 
“Organic revenue growth” and 
“Organic profit growth” KPIs in 
the KPIs section at page 26.

Risk evolution
During the year, the delivery of 
the organic growth targets has 
been continuously challenged by 
the economic and geopolitical 
environment, however the ability 
to fulfil strategic growth targets 
remains strong. 

How do we manage the risk? 
Halma operates in end markets with strong long-term growth 
drivers contributing to a low-carbon economy and lower risks 
of disruptions due to natural hazards. Our business model is 
expected to be resilient to climate-related risks, due to Halma's 
highly diversified portfolio of companies and agile business 
model, which enable our companies to quickly address 
challenges caused by natural hazards and climate change. 

The geographical diversity of Halma's companies reduces 
the impact of any single event, and the companies' 
manufacturing capabilities can be leveraged, in case of 
need, to provide flexibility to support the companies affected.

All companies are required to have business continuity and 
disaster recovery plans in place which are tested periodically 
and tailored to manage the specific risks they are most likely 
to face. The Group has a crisis management plan to manage 
communications and the reputational risk for Halma and/or 
its companies.

Business interruption insurance is in place to mitigate any 
financial loss that may occur from natural hazards. Climate 
risk and opportunity review processes and governance are in 
place, and we continue to work with our companies to help 
them manage disruption risks within their supply chains. 
More information on climate-related risks is available in 
the TCFD Statement (page 80).

How do we manage the risk? 
Halma has a clear Group strategy to achieve growth targets 
through the organic growth of Halma's companies, which is 
accelerated by the Halma Growth Enablers and the Halma 
DNA. The remuneration of companies' executives and above 
is based on profit growth.

Companies achieve organic growth through the continuous 
focus on the development of an agile business model and a 
culture of innovation to take advantage of new growth 
opportunities as they arise.

Company strategies are reviewed and challenged by the sector 
to ensure they are aligned with the Group strategy and organic 
growth targets. Sector management ensures that the Group 
strategy is fulfilled through ongoing review and chairing of 
companies. Regional hubs, for example those located in 
China and India, support local strategic growth initiatives for 
all companies. Potential new partnerships and investments are 
comprehensively assessed for future organic growth prospects. 

Companies continuously focus on attracting and developing 
the best talent to deliver Halma’s organic growth 
strategy effectively. 

At a Group level, the annual strategic planning process, the 
annual budget and the monthly 12-month rolling forecast 
enable a review of the effectiveness of the delivery of the 
organic growth strategy through control over the Balance 
Sheet and the Profit & Loss.

Climate risk and opportunity review processes and governance 
are in place, ad we continue to work with our companies to 
help them manage transition risks within their supply chains. 
More information on climate-related risks is available in the 
TCFD Statement (page 80).

This risk includes meeting increasing 
or shifting shareholder expectations 
around climate change and 
sustainability.

Risk evolution
During the year, the risk appetite has 
been reassessed and reduced from 
"Open" to "Cautious" to capture the 
fact that although Halma's sustainable 
growth model is constantly challenged 
and fine-tuned to ensure that it enables 
the companies to grow, these evolutions 
are carefully thought through, and a 
low level of risk is sought.

The inherent and residual risk level 
remains in line with the prior year.

How do we manage the risk? 
The Halma Sustainable Growth Model is at the core of the 
Group strategy and a key success factor underpinning the 
Group's ability to deliver returns for its stakeholders. More 
information on our business model is available on page 24.

The sector and Executive Boards perform periodic reviews to 
identify opportunities which may require a new organisational 
approach or evolutions of the existing approach.

The current model is challenged through the lenses of the 
learnings from past experience and through the continuous 
search and exploration of innovative ideas and opportunities 
to grow and scale the Group as the global economic 
environment evolves.

The Board performs strategic reviews of the business model 
to consider the strengths and weaknesses of the existing 
model and the need to make changes.

The Group has a clear strategy to communicate its business 
model to internal and external stakeholders, which is crucial 
to the successful execution of the Group's sustainable 
growth strategy. 

Regular communications and updates on the business model 
underpin the delivery of the communication strategy. These 
target Group, sector and company boards throughout the 
year and are integral to the recruiting and onboarding process.

Sustainability, including climate change, is integral to Halma’s 
strategy at all levels. Sustainability strategies are regularly 
reviewed and discussed in the companies, sectors and, 
Executive Board as well as at the Board. 

Sustainability networks are in place to share learnings and 
promote awareness in our companies. There are central 
growth-enabling resources with sustainability-related 
knowledge which are available to sectors and companies 
to help them better manage sustainability risks 
and opportunities.

Risk and impact
A failure in one of our products, 
including due to non-compliance 
with product regulations, may result in 
severe injuries, death, financial loss and 
reputational damage, which might be 
amplified in cases of large contracts.

How do we manage the risk? 
Our companies manufacture and assemble a wide variety of 
product types across different geographies and end markets. 
They are, therefore, experts in their trade and carry the 
responsibility for complying with relevant product safety 
and quality requirements, obtaining relevant accreditations 
and all necessary product certifications.

Risk evolution
During the year, the risk likelihood 
saw a marginal increase to reflect the 
current/historical cases' frequency and 
the potential challenge posed by the 
Medical Device Regulation (MDR) to 
achieve regulatory compliance for 
some of the products of our Healthcare 
Sector companies produced for the 
European market. MDR is a key focus 
within the Healthcare Sector which is 
coordinating several risk-mitigating 
initiatives (e.g. regulatory monitoring, 
knowledge sharing amongst 
companies). 

Halma's companies have adopted customised sets of controls 
to achieve high-quality standards – these might include but 
are not limited to:

•  Strict product development and rigorous testing procedures.
•  Clear requirements for suppliers to ensure safety and quality.
•  Quality checks on products received from suppliers.
•  Monitoring of defects and warranty returns.
•  Traceability of product.
•  Obtaining ISO 9001 certification, where relevant.
•  Product compliance with regulations is checked as part 

of due diligence for any new acquisition.

•  Ensuring employees have appropriate quality-related skills.

Furthermore, potential liabilities are limited as much as 
possible through terms and conditions of sale and liability 
insurance cover.

Risk and impact
There is a risk that the Group's cash/
funding resources are inadequate 
to support its activities or there is 
a breach of funding terms.

For more information on our liquidity 
target, see the “Cash generation” 
KPI in the KPI section at page 29.

Risk evolution
Due to the strength of Halma’s 
cash-generation model and the tight 
controls over liquidity, the residual risk 
remains low, in line with the prior year. 
We renewed our syndicated credit 
facility during the year, which remains 
at £550m, and now matures in May 
2028 and completed a new Private 
Placement of £330m with a seven 
year average life. More information 
is given in Note 27 to the Accounts. 

How do we manage the risk? 
A clear liquidity management strategy is a core pillar of 
the Halma financial model. More information is available 
on page 24.

The strong cash flow generated by the Group provides 
financial flexibility, together with a revolving credit facility.

Treasury policy and procedures provide comprehensive 
guidance to the Group and companies on banking and 
transactions, including required approvals for drawdowns 
and all new or renewed sources of funding.

Cash needs and the Group cash position are monitored 
regularly through the review of the 12-month rolling forecast, 
of the three-years liquidity forecast and of current and 
forecast covenant compliance. The currency mix of debt is 
reviewed annually, and on acquiring or disposing of a business.

Risk and impact
Failure in financial controls either on 
its own or via a fraud which takes 
advantage of a weakness, resulting 
in financial loss and/or misstated

Risk evolution
No significant risk factors have been 
identified at both inherent and residual 
risk levels during the year.

We continuously challenge, review 
and enhance our financial controls 
and the processes across the Group, 
which ensure these are effective whilst 
we continue to closely monitor the 
developments of the UK Corporate 
Governance Code. 

How do we manage the risk? 
Group policies, procedures and guidance are in place, 
setting out the Group's requirements for financial controls. 
Companies confirm the effectiveness of their most critical 
financial controls (including segregation of duties, delegation 
of authorities and financial accounts reconciliations) every 
six months through the Internal Control Certification process. 
The Internal Audit & Assurance Team periodically and 
independently tests these controls.

Sector and Group finance teams perform regular reviews of 
financial reporting and indicators. Six-monthly peer reviews 
of reported results for each company are performed to provide 
an independent challenge.

Ongoing training of finance personnel (including finance 
teams of newly acquired companies) on Halma's policies 
and financial control framework.

Companies’ directors have legal and operational responsibilities 
as they are statutory directors of their companies. This fits 
with Halma's decentralised model and contributes to ensuring 
an effective financial control environment is in place.

Viability statement

During the year, the Board carried out a robust 
assessment of the principal risks affecting the Group, 
including those that would threaten its business model, 
future performance, solvency or liquidity. The principal 
risks and uncertainties, including an analysis of the 
potential impact and mitigating actions are set out 
on pages 91 to 97 of the Strategic Report.

The Board has assessed the viability of the Group over 
a three-year period, taking into account the Group’s 
current position and the potential impact of the 
principal risks and uncertainties. While the Board has 
no reason to believe that the Group will not be viable 

over a longer period, it has determined that three years 
is an appropriate period. In drawing its conclusion, the 
Board has aligned the period of viability assessment 
with the Group’s strategic planning process (a three-
year period). The Board believes that this approach 
provides greater certainty over forecasting and, therefore, 
increases reliability in the modelling and stress testing of 
the Company’s viability. In addition, a three-year horizon 
is typically the period over which we review our external 
bank facilities and is also the performance-based period 
over which awards granted under Halma’s share-based 
incentive plan are measured.

In reviewing the Company’s viability, the Board has identified
the following factors which they believe support their assessment:

1

The Group operates 
in diverse and 
relatively non-cyclical 
markets with long 
term growth drivers.

2

There is considerable 
financial capacity 
under current 
facilities and the 
ability to raise 
further funds if 
required.

3

The decentralised 
nature of our Group 
ensures that risk is 
spread across our 
businesses and 
sectors, with limited 
exposure to any 
particular industry, 
market, geography, 
customer or supplier.

4

There is a strong 
culture of local 
responsibility and 
accountability 
within a robust 
governance and 
control framework.

5

An ethical approach 
to business is set 
from the top and 
flows throughout 
our business.

In making their assessment, the Board carried out a 
comprehensive exercise of financial modelling and 
stress-tested the model with a downside scenario based 
on the principal risks identified in the Group’s annual risk 
assessment process. The scenarios modelled used the 
same assumptions as for the going concern review, as 
set out on page 167, for the years ending 31 March 2024 
and 31 March 2025 with further assumptions applied for 
the year ending 31 March 2026. The base case reflects 
the latest forecasts and strategic plans of the business. 
The downside scenario included a reduction in trading 
for the year to 31 March 2024 which could be caused 
by a significant downside event with the addition of 
impacts from other of the Group’s principal risks such 
as litigation or product failure. 

For the years ending 31 March 2025 and 31 March 2026 
the downside scenario reflects growth at half the rate 
modelled in the base case. In both scenarios, the effect 
on the Group’s KPls and borrowing covenants was 
considered, along with any mitigating factors. Based 
on this assessment, the Board confirms that they have 
a reasonable expectation that the Group will be able 
to continue in operation and meet its liabilities as they 
fall due over the three-year period to 31 March 2026.

Due diligence, implementation and outcomes

Halma’s Environmental Policy has been set by the Board, and our Group General Counsel & Chief 
Sustainability Officer, who chairs our Sustainability Management committee, has principal 
responsibility for coordinating and monitoring. 

We encourage our companies and their suppliers to improve energy productivity, reduce water 
consumption, waste and emissions and, in terms of materials, to reduce or make more efficient 
use of them. Focusing on our sustainability pillar of Protecting our environment will help us limit 
our key environmental impacts including energy consumption, GHG emissions and hazardous and 
other waste production. Our energy use and emissions performance can be found in the TCFD 
Statement on page 80 and in more detail in our ESG Data Supplement at www.halma.com. 

More information on our programmes to reduce our environmental impact and data is available 
in the Sustainability section on page 72 and on our website. Our assessment of and response to 
climate-related risks and opportunities can be found in our TCFD Statement on page 80.

All Halma companies are encouraged to undertake an ISO 14001 environmental management 
accreditation, where warranted. For the year to 31 March 2023, based on available data reported 
by our companies, we estimate that approximately 20% of the Group’s sites, contributing 
approximately 24% of revenue, were covered by an ISO 14001 accreditation (2022: 17% sites; 
22% revenue).

Anti-bribery and corruption

Halma has a zero-tolerance 
policy on bribery and corruption, 
as set out in its Anti-Bribery 
and Corruption Policy2,4, which 
extends to all business dealings 
and transactions in which the 
Group is involved. This includes 
a prohibition on making 
political donations, offering or 
receiving inappropriate gifts or 
making undue payments to 
influence the outcome of 
business dealings. 

Our policy and guidance in this area is well understood, routinely reviewed and compliance is 
checked as part of the half year and year-end control process. There are set criteria for any 
gifts, hospitality, entertainment and charitable donations including that any gifts, hospitality, 
entertainment or charitable donations in excess of the thresholds set out in the policy must 
receive set pre-approval and be recorded in the Gifts and Hospitality Register. 

We require customers and suppliers who contract on our standard business terms to comply with 
anti-corruption and anti-bribery laws and any suspected breaches of compliance with this policy 
can be reported through the whistleblowing reporting service.

Online anti-bribery and corruption compliance training is mandatory for senior management, 
all company board directors and other key business personnel. Over 600 employees completed 
anti-bribery and corruption training during the year ended 31 March 2023.

Employees

The Code of Conduct3 (Code) 
aims to ensure that Halma 
maintains consistently high 
ethical standards globally, 
while recognising that our 
companies operate in markets 
and countries with cultural 
differences and practices. It is 
issued to all Halma employees 
and published on our website.

Halma has a group-wide 
Whistleblowing Policy2,4 
which applies to all employees 
and Halma operations as well 
as joint venture partners, 
suppliers, customers and 
distributors relating to 
our companies. 

Our Health and Safety Policy2 
requires companies to manage 
their activities in a way which 
avoids causing unnecessary or 
unacceptable risks to health 
and safety and provides clear 
guidelines for our companies 
on managing health and safety 
risks to ensure a safe work 
environment. 

Our Diversity and 
Inclusion Policy3 sets out 
our commitment to building 
inclusive and diverse companies. 

Our Equal Opportunities 
Policy2 is a Group policy which 
promotes equal opportunity 
for all employees and job 
applicants and aims to create 
a working environment in 
which all individuals are able 
to make the best use of their 
skills, free from discrimination 
or harassment. 

Due diligence, implementation and outcomes

Code of Conduct
Each officer or employee who joins the Group is required to acknowledge that they have read 
the Code and understood its importance. The Code was refreshed in 2023 and is being rolled out. 
Please see page 65 for further details regarding the new Code. 

Whistleblowing
All whistleblowing reports are appropriately investigated and concluded. The Audit Committee 
receives details of any reports relating to financial misconduct and the Board receives an 
overview of reports relating to people and culture. 

We have an independent third-party reporting line, NavexGlobal, for individuals to raise 
concerns that they are either not able to do so through other channels or would prefer to raise 
anonymously. Details about the confidential reporting service are available in our Code (which is 
available on our website, www.halma.com) and SharePoint sites, and are prominently displayed 
on posters within all of our Group and company locations.

Health and Safety
The Board monitors health and safety performance, which is collected through the central 
financial consolidation system, at every meeting. 

In the event of any accident, the company in which the accident occurred is to review the relevant 
root cause and ensure that preventative measures are taken, including further training and 
education of their employees. 

In line with Halma’s autonomous structure, operational responsibility for compliance with 
local health and safety regulations, including that of suppliers, resides with the board of each 
company. However, we routinely monitor health and safety performance across the Group and 
companies are encouraged to seek continuous improvement and to promote a strong health 
and safety culture. Companies are required to carry out an independent health and safety review 
every three years to assess compliance and to ensure that there is a consistent and adequate 
level of reporting and investigation of health and safety incidents across the Group. In addition, 
our lead global insurer reviews employee and third-party safety and controls at four to five 
properties per year as part of their rotational assessments.

During the year ended 31 March 2023 over 800 employees completed our Group online health 
and safety training programmes. 

Based on available data reported by our companies, approximately 17% (2022: 15%) of the 
Group’s sites are covered by ISO 45001 or BS OHSAS 18001 accreditation, a minimum standard 
for occupational health and safety management best practice. These sites currently contribute 
approximately 17% (2022: 16%) of the Group’s revenue and we continue to encourage our 
companies to certify to the ISO 45001 standard.

Diversity and Inclusion
We have identified Diversity, Equity and Inclusion (DEI) as a key societal issue in which Halma 
can have a strong positive impact. DEI is one of our key focus areas within our Protecting our 
people sustainability pillar.

Further information on health and safety, employee wellbeing and engagement, diversity and 
inclusion, gender pay gap and training and development, including metrics, can be found in 
the Our people and culture section on page 66.

Social

Halma has a group-wide Data 
Protection Policy2 and 
Guidance which requires our 
companies to comply with six 
key data protection principles, 
which are Lawfulness, Fairness 
and Transparency, Purpose 
Limitation, Data Minimisation, 
Accuracy, Storage Limitation 
and Integrity and Confidentiality.

The Group has a policy on 
Competition Law2 which is 
applicable to all employees.

We have a Conflict Minerals 
Policy2 which gives guidance 
to all companies on how to 
determine whether any of 
the four minerals, or their 
derivatives, classified by the 
US government as “conflict 
minerals” are contained in 
any product.

Due diligence, implementation and outcomes

Code of Conduct
We expect our external business partners and suppliers to be aware of the Code of Conduct 
and apply similar ethical standards in their operations. Each of our companies is responsible 
for monitoring the standards of their business partners and suppliers. 

Data Protection
Under the Data Protection Policy, all companies are required to have their own Privacy Policy in 
place which is tailored to their business and local law, relating to the categories of individuals 
whose personal data they process. Privacy Policies and security measures are required to be 
reviewed at least annually and tested where appropriate. Our companies are also required to 
ensure appropriate and robust clauses are included in any contracts with third parties where 
personal data will be disclosed.

Competition Law
Our companies must confirm that the relevant people in their business are familiar with 
the Competition Compliance manual as part of the half year and year-end control process. Online 
anti-competition compliance training is mandatory for senior management, all company board 
directors and other key business personnel. Over 400 employees completed competition law 
training during the year ended 31 March 2023.

Conflict Minerals
Our companies are responsible for managing their own supply chains, which includes complying 
with conflict mineral due diligence requests from their customers where applicable, supported 
by Group guidance to do so. A number of our companies already confirm that their supply chains 
are conflict mineral-free, including a number of our largest companies. Historically, we have not 
collated data on these policies or procedures centrally.

Product safety
Our companies take pride in the quality of their work and are committed to the highest levels 
of quality and safety standards at every stage of the product life cycle. Given the significant 
diversity of types of products and end markets, responsibility for complying with relevant product 
safety and quality requirements and obtaining relevant accreditations and certifications sits with 
the local, legally constituted company boards. For the year to 31 March 2023, based on available 
data reported by our companies, we estimate that approximately 62% of the Group’s sites, 
contributing approximately 75% of revenue, were covered by an ISO 9001 quality management 
accreditation (2022: 60% of sites; 70% of revenue).

Human rights

Halma is committed to 
conducting its business ethically 
and in line with all relevant 
legislation including human 
rights laws. Halma has 
published seven Modern 
Slavery Act Statements3 since 
September 2016, which detail 
the progressive steps taken 
annually to tackle modern 
slavery and human trafficking. 

Halma’s Human Rights and 
Labour Conditions Policy4 
reflects the core requirements 
of the Universal Declaration of 
Human Rights and the Group 
observes the International 
Labour Organization (ILO) 
Declaration on Fundamental 
Principles and Rights at Work, 
including the conventions 
relating to forced labour, child 
labour, non-discrimination, 
freedom of association and 
right to collective bargaining.

Due diligence, implementation and outcomes

The Group Chief Executive has overall responsibility for ensuring that human rights considerations 
are integral to the way in which existing operations and new opportunities are developed and 
managed. Compliance with, and respect for, these fundamental principles are integrated 
throughout our organisation. 

All companies have been provided with a detailed guidance note to raise awareness of the Modern 
Slavery Act and the issue of modern slavery in business and supply chains. Each company is required 
to consider the potential issue of modern slavery and human trafficking within their business and 
supply chain and may take varying approaches, such as supplier due diligence, questionnaires and 
the use of terms and conditions, according to their specific circumstances.

Online compliance training on the Modern Slavery Act has been rolled out to senior management, 
all company board members and other relevant employees across the Group. Over 550 employees 
have completed this training during the year ended 31 March 2023. This is an important tool in 
assisting our business management in raising awareness of the issues and understanding their 
responsibilities in their operations. 

We have onboarded 35 suppliers onto the EcoVadis platform, which assesses suppliers against all 
aspects of their treatment of their people, and will give additional support over time, particularly 
to our smaller companies, as they continue to manage modern slavery risks going forward. 

Our Modern Slavery Act Statement can be found at www.halma.com. 

Managers and supervisors must provide leadership that promotes human rights as an equal priority 
to other business issues. All employees are responsible for ensuring that their own actions do not 
impair the human rights of others, and are encouraged to bring forward, in confidence, any 
concerns they may have about human rights.

In addition to the Code of Conduct having been refreshed, the following policies referenced in this section have also been refreshed: Whistleblowing, Health and 
Safety, Data Protection, Competition and Anti-Bribery and Corruption. The main changes have been to streamline and simplify the policies in order to enable easier 
compliance by Halma’s companies, whilst also continuing to meet all applicable legal requirements. The updated policies will come into effect in FY24 at the same 
time as the new Code of Conduct.

Good governance supports

Dame Louise Makin
Chair

Priorities for 2023/24 
The Board’s priorities for 2023/24 are to:

• Embed Halma’s DNA throughout the Group, 
aligning our culture through the refreshed 
Executive Board, to maintain our collegiate, 
purpose-led and growth-orientated 
management teams.

• Keep supporting our companies to identify, 
assess and capitalise on sustainability-linked 
growth opportunities.

• Continue to review Growth Enabler investments 
to ensure that they are appropriately utilised 
by our companies and deliver strong returns.
• Revisit our APAC strategy to inform our capital 

allocation priorities in the region.

• Maintain our focus on purpose-aligned M&A.
• Evolve our ongoing portfolio review to optimise 
each component for long-term sustainable 
value creation.

This Report outlines the governance framework within 
which the Company operates, how it has supported 
the Board’s strategic activities during the year and 
how the Principles set out in the UK Corporate 
Governance Code 2018 have been applied. 

Last year the Board set the following priorities for 
the year ahead: 

• To keep the talent pipeline under review at 
Executive Board level and one level below.

• Support M&A activity that is aligned to our purpose.
• Further embed sustainability into our business and 
monitor progress against our non-financial targets.

• Refocus on the Medical Sector strategy, following 

changes to the leadership structure. 

I am pleased to report that we have made good 
progress against all of these priorities, as follows: 

• Appointed Marc Ronchetti as Group Chief Executive 

from 1 April 2023, to succeed Andrew Williams.

• Appointed Steve Gunning as Chief Financial Officer 

in January 2023, in place of Marc. 

• Completed seven purpose-aligned acquisitions 

in the year. 

• Reviewed climate risks and opportunities and 
performance against our non-financial KPIs. 

• Reviewed the work undertaken to estimate 

our Scope 3 emissions.

• Agreed our reporting as aligned to the Taskforce 

for Climate Related Disclosure (TCFD) Framework. 
• Renamed our Medical Sector to Healthcare, to more 
closely align with our purpose and reflect our wider 
growth ambitions.

Corporate governance statement
The Company reports against the Financial Reporting 
Council’s (FRC) UK Corporate Governance Code 2018 
(the Code), which is available at www.frc.org.uk. 

The Board considers that it has applied all Principles, 
and complied with all Provisions of the Code for the 
year ended 31 March 2023, with the exception of 
Provision 38, which requires that pension contribution 
rates for Executive Directors, or payments in lieu, are 
aligned to those available to the wider workforce. As 
reported last year, the Company undertook a review 
of its UK pension provision in 2021 and consulted with 
employees. As a result, the pension offering moved 
from a trust-based plan to a Master Trust arrangement 
which offered members more competitive management 
charges, more options at retirement and improved 
member communications and retirement planning 
tools. We also took this opportunity to improve the 
employee and employer contribution structure which 
meant that all UK employees could receive more for 
lower employee contributions and all employees could 
receive up to 10.5% of their salary as an employer 
contribution. To align with the Code, the Executive 
Directors voluntarily agreed for their cash-in-lieu of 
pension to be reduced to 10.5% of salary from 1 January 
2023, which equalises the pension offering across all 
employees in the UK. Therefore, whilst we were not 
fully compliant for the full financial year, we have been 
compliant for the three month period to 31 March 2023 
and will be fully compliant for the year to 31 March 2024. 

Conclusion
I hope that you will find the information in this Report 
helpful in understanding our approach to governance 
and how we have applied the Principles of the Code. 

We believe that our organisational structure and 
governance framework enables our companies to 
operate effectively and with agility – which means we 
can continue to deliver value through our sustainable 
growth, returns and positive impact for the benefit of 
all of our stakeholders.

Introduction to governance continued

Board changes
We announced in June 2022, that Andrew Williams 
would be retiring as Group Chief Executive on 31 March 
2023. Prior to Andrew’s formal decision to retire, the 
Board, supported by the Nomination Committee, had 
conducted a thorough selection process to identify 
Andrew’s successor as Group Chief Executive. The 
Board were delighted to announce Marc Ronchetti’s 
appointment as CEO Designate and from 1 April 2023, 
as Group Chief Executive. I would like to thank Andrew 
for his tremendous contribution to Halma’s growth 
during his 18-year tenure and congratulate Marc on 
his appointment. 

As part of the fulfilment of the executive succession 
plans, and following a robust selection process led 
by the Nomination Committee, Steve Gunning was 
appointed as Chief Financial Officer on 16 January 
2023. On behalf of the Board, I am delighted to 
welcome Steve to Halma. 

The planning and execution of these succession plans 
have provided a smooth transition and continuity 
in a year of change. As at 31 March 2023 the Board 
comprised seven non-executive Directors and 
four Executive Directors. 

Shareholder engagement
Following the below 80% vote received on our 
Remuneration Report and the below 80% vote 
received on the reappointment of our Remuneration 
Committee Chair, Jo Harlow, we engaged with our 
major shareholders and the proxy agencies to better 
understand the reasons for their votes (if it was against) 
and any comments or concerns that they held on these 
two resolutions. Further details on the Remuneration 
Report vote can be found on page 138 of the 
Remuneration Report but, from my engagement 
with shareholders and proxy agencies on the specific 
objection to the re-election of Jo, the reason that 
a number of investors voted against her re-election 
was simply as a result of her position as Chair of the 
Remuneration Committee, which linked directly to 
their concerns on the Remuneration Report for the 
year ended 31 March 2022. I am confident that our 
engagement – and in particular, an explanation of 
the rationale for the remuneration decisions made in 
2022 which could not refer to the imminent succession 
plans that were to be executed – has addressed these 
concerns. The Board is most appreciative of Jo’s 
leadership of the Committee and engagement with 
shareholders, and unanimously supported all decisions 
that were made. I, along with my fellow Directors, 
have absolutely no concerns on Jo’s performance as 
a Director of the Company or in her role as Chair of 
the Remuneration Committee.

Board Leadership and Company Purpose 
Halma is a purpose-driven company – growing a safer, cleaner, 
healthier future for everyone, every day – and is led by an effective 
and entrepreneurial Board, whose objective is to promote the long-
term success of the Company by generating value for shareholders 
and benefitting our wider stakeholders. The Group achieves this 
through its autonomous, decentralised operating model and 
maintains effective engagement channels with its stakeholders 
to consider their needs and the impact of decisions when realising 
strategic objectives. 

The Board leads by example in promoting the desired culture, 
values and purpose-aligned strategy and has put in place 
policies and practices to support this. 

The Board operates within a framework of prudent and effective 
controls, which complements its autonomous structure. The Board 
annually reviews and approves the Budget and monitors capital 
allocation throughout the year.

Division of Responsibilities 
The Board has clearly defined roles and responsibilities. The Chair,

Corporate Governance Report
The role of the Board and value creation
The Board’s role is to provide entrepreneurial leadership, 
within a framework of prudent and effective controls, 
that promotes the interests of the Company over 
the long term for the benefit of its stakeholders. 
The Board sets the Group’s strategic goals and has 
ultimate responsibility for its management, direction 
and performance. The Company’s Articles of Association 
set out the Board’s powers and the Board has adopted 
a formal schedule of matters reserved solely for its 
decision and certain decision-making and monitoring 
activities are delegated to Board Committees or 
management committees. The full list of matters 
reserved for its decision can be found at 
www.halma.com. 

Halma has a primary duty to generate and preserve 
value over the long-term for its shareholders whilst 
considering its wider stakeholders and positively 
contributing to society. Details of the Company’s 
strategy and business model, together with its 
stakeholder considerations can be found in the 
Strategic Report. The activities of the Board during 
the year are set out on the following pages. 

Resources, governance and control frameworks
As a decentralised organisation, it is critical that 
Halma’s governance and control framework is robust, 
clearly defined, well communicated and operating 
effectively to support the Company in the delivery 
of its strategy. The Board has established three 
principal Committees (Audit Committee; Nomination 
Committee; Remuneration Committee) which review 
and monitor specific areas on behalf of the Board and 
make recommendations for its approval. Each Board 
Committee operates under written terms of reference 
which are approved by the Board and are made 
available at www.halma.com. The Chair of each 
Committee reports to the Board on their activities 
after each meeting and once the minutes have been 
approved by the Committee, they are circulated to 
all Board members. Further information on the 
composition, role and activities of each Committee 
is set out in the respective Committee Reports. 

There are additionally three topic specific committees, 
typically chaired by the Group Chief Executive, to which 
it has delegated certain powers to negotiate, review 
and administer matters (Share Plans Committee; 
Bank Guarantees and Facilities Committee; Acquisitions 
and Disposals Committee) and three management 
committees (Executive Board; Sustainability 
Management committee; Investment committee) 
which have been established to review and make 
decisions on strategic and operational matters. 

Strategic 
Report

Governance

Financial 
Statements

Other 
Information

The Board sets the Company’s strategy, the execution 
of which is delegated to the Executive Board, chaired 
by the Group Chief Executive, which monitors progress 
against the Group’s strategic objectives and reviews 
operational and business performance. A summary of 
the responsibilities of the Board, each Board Committee 
and for each management committee is set out on 
page 110.

The foundation of our business model is the autonomy 
that our businesses enjoy. To support this autonomy, 
while retaining oversight and control from a Group 
perspective, companies must comply with Halma’s 
suite of financial and non-financial policies and 
procedures and provide confirmation of compliance 
with key controls half yearly. The Group’s policies set 
out our requirements in the areas of financial reporting 
and internal control, health and safety, ethics, human 
resources, IT, data privacy, and legal and compliance. 
These policies are made available to all employees via 
a dedicated SharePoint site. 

An authority matrix sets out the matters that are 
reserved for decision by the Board, those that can be 
approved by the Group Chief Executive and the financial 
authority that has been delegated to Executive Board 
members, the Divisional Chief Executives (DCEs) and 
to company managing directors. This approach ensures 
that companies have a clear framework within which 
they can operate and balances autonomy with the 
need for oversight and control. 

Each company in the Group has its own board of 
directors which meets regularly to fulfil its legal duties 
and to maintain operational and financial management 
of the company’s affairs. Each DCE chairs the company 
board in their subsector portfolio and meets with the 
Executive Board at least three times per year. The 
DCEs also provide a written report on the financial 
and business performance, including areas such as 
talent, culture, diversity and sustainability, to the 
Executive Board members and Halma’s Chair on a 
regular basis.

The Sector Chief Executives (SCEs) hold regular sector 
board meetings, attended by the sector’s DCEs and 
finance, legal, talent and M&A leads, which provide 
a valuable forum for review of sector wide strategy, 
financial and operational performance, talent and 
culture, diversity, sustainability, M&A, and legal 
and compliance. The governance structure of our 
companies, sectors and Board is set out on page 3.

How the Board supports our companies through our Growth Enablers
The Board supports the evolution of Halma’s growth strategy and the development of its Growth Enablers, 
which help to allocate human and capital resources, to ensure that our sectors and companies continue 
to invest organically and through acquisition to deliver sustainable growth over the long term.

Mergers and 
Acquisitions (M&A)

• The Board sets a clear strategy which includes a significant growth element 

being delivered through standalone M&A and bolt-on acquisitions to 
our companies. 

• Through the annual Budget process, key resources, both in terms of people 

and financing, are made available by the Board to ensure that we can 
deliver on this strategic priority. 

• The M&A pipeline is reviewed at each Board meeting and all material 

acquisitions (those with a maximum consideration in excess of £10m) are 
subject to its approval. Prior to approval, the Board will review the proposed 
value creation strategies and, post-acquisition, it receives insight on the 
financial and operational performance of newly acquired businesses.

International 
Expansion

• All major changes, material financial commitments or new business 
developments – such as significant expansion into a new territory – 
are considered by the Board and are matters reserved for its decision.

Talent and 
Culture

Finance, 
Legal and Risk

• The Board receives regular updates from Jennifer Ward, Group Talent, Culture 
and Communications Director on areas including the talent pipeline, diversity, 
equity and inclusion initiatives and employee engagement. 

• Talent discussions are a key feature at each Nomination Committee meeting 

and monitoring the Group’s culture, diversity, equity and inclusion is an 
important role for the Board.

• The Board has established a clear and robust framework to control financial 
investment, oversee financial performance and reporting, and to manage 
risks and opportunities. It annually assesses risk management and internal 
control systems. 

• The Board has an established legal and compliance framework to enable 
companies to maintain their autonomy and agility while leveraging the 
scale of Halma to get consistent, quality advice at competitive rates 
through a panel of preferred external law firms.

Digital Growth

• The Board takes a close interest in Halma’s desire to expand its digital 
capability and supports R&D within our companies through Board 
presentations and non-executive Director interactions with management. 
Our companies can leverage the skills and experience from our non-executive 
Directors with digital expertise.

Innovation  
Network

• The Board share their deep and diverse knowledge and experience with senior 
management and company personnel throughout the year, through both 
formal and informal events and interaction – enabling our companies to 
leverage the breadth of their network and obtain support, guidance and 
contacts in areas which are new to them.

Strat Comms 
and Brand

Strategic 
Communications 
and Brand

• A key focus in the Board’s Budget approval process is to allocate capital to 

resource the central and sector teams to support our companies in developing 
market-leading positions by connecting with customers through their brand, 
marketing, product positioning and the effective use of all media channels.

Strategy 
and growth 

In June 2022, we announced that after 18 years of 
outstanding leadership, Andrew Williams would retire 
as Group Chief Executive on 31 March 2023. Supported 
by the Nomination Committee, the Board executed 
its succession plans and, following a rigorous selection 
process, appointed Marc Ronchetti as CEO Designate 
and ultimately as Group Chief Executive from 1 April 
2023. During the appointment process the Board 
considered factors such as alignment with Group 
culture and the evolution of Halma’s Sustainable 
Growth Model, as well as the impact on employees, 
investors and wider stakeholders.

The Board reviewed and considered significant 
acquisition opportunities (those with a consideration 
of over £10m) throughout the year, resulting in the 
successful completion of five acquisitions, namely 
FirePro, Thermocable, WEETECH, IZI Medical and Deep 
Trekker, details of which can be found in the Strategic 
Report. A further two acquisitions completed during 
the year, which did not require Board approval. The 
Board assessed the alignment of each target acquisition 
with the Group’s purpose and strategy and, following 
approval and completion, will continue to monitor 
the integration of these companies into the Group. 

The Board sets and approves its priorities at the start 
of each financial year. The Board’s priorities for 2023 
included M&A, talent, sustainability, investment in 
R&D and infrastructure. These priorities are driven by 
the Executive Board across all sectors and functional 
areas and the Board monitors their progress at 
each Board meeting. 

In September 2022, the Directors attended the 
Company’s annual strategy meeting, which brings 
together the Board and Executive Board to undertake 
an in-depth review of Company strategy, considering 
both past performance, future trends and opportunities, 
as well as macroeconomic and geopolitical influences. 

To enable an orderly transition from the role of 
Chief Financial Officer to Group Chief Executive, 
Steve Gunning was appointed in January 2023 
as Chief Financial Officer. Further details of the 
appointment and induction process can be found 
in the Nomination Committee Report. 

The Directors attended the Accelerate Halma 
conference in October 2022, which was held in 
person for the first time since the COVID pandemic. 
The conference brought together our top 350 leaders, 
under the theme of “connected for growth”. The event 
showcased our companies and provided opportunities 
for our companies to understand our business model, 
connect with other companies, leverage skills from 
other leaders and explore challenges and 
opportunities together. 

Additionally, during the year, and as an output to 
the 2022 Board evaluation, a targeted process to 
facilitate the way in which our companies can access 
and leverage the specialist skills of the non-executive 
Directors was developed and implemented. This further 
enhances the role the Board plays in supporting the 
Innovation Network Growth Enabler.

Risk, legal 
and finance  

The Board received regular reports on risk, finance and 
legal matters throughout the year and, following the 
appointment of the Director of Risk & Compliance, 
and the subsequent separation of the Internal Audit 
and Risk functions, closely monitored the evolution of 
these responsibilities. 

The Board received several risk updates and deep dives 
throughout the year particularly in light of the current 
geopolitical and macroeconomic environment, see page 
89. Development of our Risk and Compliance function, 
as well as details of our Internal Audit activities can be 
found on page 134. 

In discharging its duty to ensure adequate resources are 
in place, the Board reviewed and approved the annual 
Budget for 2024, and monitored progress against the 
2023 Budget, ensuring capital allocation remained 
appropriate against our strategic priorities. 

Governance 
and 
stakeholders

The Board received regular updates on governance 
practices and approved matters such as the Group’s 
annual Modern Slavery Act statement, as well as 
financial matters such as the Group’s going concern 
and viability statement during the year. The Board 
reviewed and approved a refreshed Code of Conduct 
“Just be a good person” in March 2023, which is being 
rolled-out across the Group. 

The Board conducted its annual Board and Committee 
evaluations by way of internal questionnaires and 
discussed outputs and agreed actions for the year 
ahead, whilst monitoring progress against actions 
identified in the prior year. Full details of the Board 
evaluation can be found in the Nomination Committee 
Report and the Committee evaluations are covered 
in their respective Reports. Additionally the Board’s 
independence and conflicts of interest were 
considered and approved in the year. 

The Board places great importance on its relationships 
and interactions with its various stakeholders, as 
detailed on page 56. Board members held numerous 
engagement sessions with shareholders during the 
year and, having considered internal and external 
factors and implications, has recommended a final 
dividend for approval by shareholders at the Annual 
General Meeting.

Company purpose, values and culture 
Our strategy is powered by our purpose of growing a 
safer, cleaner, healthier future for everyone, every day 
and is focused on acquiring and growing businesses 
in global niche markets, in the areas of safety, health 
and the environment (further details are set out in 
the Strategic Report). 

Our corporate culture is an essential component of 
our strategy and is embedded within Halma’s DNA 
through our cultural and organisational genes. Our 
inclusive culture across our business brings competitive 
advantage to the Group and is encapsulated within 
our Talent & Culture Growth Enabler. It is vital that 
we protect the unique cultural genes that we have 
in order to grow our business sustainably and deliver 
on our purpose (see page 21 for more information on 
Halma’s DNA and cultural and organisational genes). 

It is essential that the Board and executive management 
act in a constructive and respectful manner, exhibiting 
the tone that we expect across our Group. We consider 
that this culture promotes good governance across our 
companies and empowers people to make good and 
ethical business decisions.

Establishing and promoting culture
The Board ensures that the Company’s purpose and 
DNA are aligned to its culture and strategic objectives. 
Our employees are key to delivering our success and 
by fostering a collaborative and inclusive culture our 
people are unified by our purpose and aspire to 
deliver our strategic ambitions. Our positive culture 
is demonstrated through the 76% overall employee 
engagement score achieved from our annual 
engagement survey this year and the strong 
leadership and talent at Halma. 

Our robust risk and governance framework provides a 
base from which our culture can be embedded across 
all levels of our business and the Board periodically 
reviews workforce policies and our Code of Conduct. 

Our Code of Conduct is underpinned by our culture 
and stipulates the expected behaviours and corporate 
culture that we require all employees to display. It 
provides a plain language summary on anti-bribery 
and corruption, insider dealing, conflicts of interest, 
modern slavery and human trafficking. It also sets 
out information on how employees can raise concerns 
via management or the independent third party 
confidential reporting service, operated by NavexGlobal. 
Halma’s Code of Conduct must be signed by every 
employee when they join the company and signed again 
periodically thereafter. We recently refreshed our Code 
of Conduct, which was approved by the Board in March 
2023, and is being rolled-out. The Code of Conduct is 
available from our website at www.halma.com.

The Board takes health and safety matters very 
seriously and accident statistics are reported to the 
Board at each meeting. This enables the Board to 
assess the effectiveness of health and safety practices 
and behaviours within the Group. Health and safety 
is one of our non-financial key performance indicators 
(see page 31 for more information). The Board approved 
a revised Health and Safety Policy, applicable to both 
the Group and our companies in the year under review, 
which is currently being rolled-out. The Directors made 
a number of business site visits during the year, which 
provides them with a first-hand experience of the 
workplace environment and culture, particularly around 
health and safety. Directors report their observations 
from all site visits to the Board and the relevant Sector 
Chief Executive and Divisional Chief Executive.

Company site visits

Annual employee 
engagement survey

Throughout the year our executive and non-executive Directors 
have undertaken a total of 65 site visits to our companies, which 
have provided invaluable insight into how our culture permeates 
throughout our decentralised, autonomous structure. Directors 
engaged with employees on matters such as executive and wider 
workforce remuneration, company culture, purpose, health and 
safety and diversity, equity and inclusion, and provided feedback 
to the Board and management following each visit. 

In October 2022 we held our first in-person Accelerate Halma 
conference since the COVID pandemic. The event provided 
an opportunity for our non-executive Directors to interact with 
colleagues in an informal setting, which included a non-executive 
Director hosted breakfast with company-wide employees. 
Read more on page 58.

The Group’s annual engagement survey results are a good 
indicator of sentiment across the Group and provide insights 
at a company and Group function level. A summary of 
the survey results is reviewed by the Board and areas for 
improvement discussed. The results are shared and focus 
sessions with employees are held to discuss the results and 
gather feedback on areas for improvement - which helps 
to shape and drive company/function specific action 
plans. Employee engagement is one of our non-financial key 
performance indicators (see page 30 for more information).

We developed a non-executive 
Director company visit guidance 
document, which sets out areas 
which Directors might engage 
on during their visit. This was 
implemented and embedded 
successfully during the year and 
provided a useful framework 
and objective to each site visit. 

We were pleased to achieve a 
76% overall engagement score 
in 2023. Read more on the 
outcomes of our employee 
engagement survey on page 66.

Board, Committee 
and strategy meetings 

The Board receives reports throughout the year on whistleblowing, 
talent and retention, employee engagement survey results, health 
and safety matters as well inviting senior employees to present at 
the Board or attend events with the Directors, all of which provide 
insights into employee sentiment and culture. 

The Board kept under review 
talent and retention, employee 
engagement, and concerns of 
the workforce during the year.

Whistleblowing

Policies and practices

Investing in and 
rewarding employees

The Board has put in place procedures for employees to confidentially 
raise matters of concern, either with management or through our 
dedicated confidential reporting hotline. All workforce concerns 
that have been raised are reviewed at each Board meeting, 
including updates on previous investigations and the action 
that has been taken where reports are founded.

The Board have continued to 
monitor all workforce concerns 
raised throughout the year, 
which provide useful insights 
into the culture across the Group.

Our workforce policies and Code of Conduct are underpinned by 
our values and culture. Each of our employees is required to read 
and sign the Code of Conduct upon joining and to adhere to our 
workforce policies. The Board periodically reviews these policies to 
ensure they remain appropriate and aligned with our purpose, 
values and culture. 

The Remuneration Committee regularly considers wider workforce 
remuneration, including gender pay gap data across the UK and 
the US. A particular focus has been on how our companies are 
supporting employees during the cost-of-living crisis (see further 
details in the Remuneration Report).

Our employee share schemes and bonus/profit sharing plans 
are designed to benefit the wider workforce and incentivise 
our employees to contribute to the success and performance 
of the Company. 

Non-executive Directors engage with employees on areas 
of executive remuneration at company visits, and continue 
to offer employees the opportunity to discuss remuneration 
matters further. Feedback from such visits is reported to 
the Board for discussion. 

During the year the Board 
approved refreshed policies, 
including the Code of Conduct 
and Health and Safety Policy. 

The Board received updates 
on initiatives put in place locally 
to assist employees in the cost 
of living crisis and on the 
implementation of the UK 
Real Living Wage across our 
UK companies.

Non-executive Directors engaged 
with employees during the year, 
on remuneration and other 
matters, through site visits 
and at the Accelerate 
Halma conference.

Engagement with employees
The Code sets out three prescribed ways in which 
the Board should engage with its workforce, or, where 
one of these methods is not adopted, an explanation 
must be provided on the alternative engagement 
methods used and the reasons for adopting that 
approach. Due to the Company’s decentralised 
operating model and the geographic spread of 
our companies, we have implemented alternative 
engagement methods, which we believe are more 
fitting, and effective, for our structure and culture – 
as outlined below. 

The Board utilises a number of different methods 
of engagement, both directly and indirectly, with 
employees to foster and promote a two-way dialogue 
and to provide a critical means of monitoring culture, 
as set out below. 

There are frequent opportunities for the employee voice 
to be relayed to the Board via company management, 
the annual engagement survey, through site visits, 
company events and reporting of workforce 
concerns raised via the confidential reporting 
service with NavexGlobal. 

In addition, we consider that engagement by the local 
company board with their own workforce, as well as the 
engagement by the Board through these mechanisms, 
provides an effective platform for clear and open 
communication with our global employee base. 
To support this, we have also put in place reporting 
mechanisms such that concerns and feedback raised 
at the company level is fed back to the Board. 

The Board strongly believes that its mechanisms 
for engaging with our employees are appropriate 
for our decentralised structure and are an effective 
means of bilateral engagement with our colleagues. 

Engagement with other stakeholders
The Board considers its investors, debt holders 
and other stakeholder groups in its decision-making 
and our interaction with key stakeholders is set 
out on pages 56 to 62 of the Strategic Report.

Our employee engagement framework

Board
The Board employs both direct and indirect methods of engagement with 
employees, which include company site visits, attending employee events such as 
Accelerate conference, DCE/company chair reports, presentations and reports to the 
Board on matters such as workforce concerns and the employee engagement survey, 
and regular updates from the Group Talent, Culture and Communications Director. 

Executive Board and Sector Chief Executives (SCE)
The SCEs are Executive Board members with operational responsibility 
for all of our companies. They provide a vital link between the 
Board and our companies, by ensuring that there are close 
channels of communication.

Halma companies and Divisional Chief Executives (DCE)
The DCEs chair their respective sub-sector company boards and meet with the 
Executive Board at least three times per year and with the Board annually. 
This facilitates regular dialogue on employee-related matters.

Employees
Through our established communication channels our employees 
are able to effectively communicate with both their local company 
board as well as directly and indirectly with the Board.

Non-executive  
Director site visit 

In June 2022, our Senior Independent Director, 
Tony Rice, visited Ramtech, based in Nottingham. 
Ramtech joined the Group in August 2021 and sits 
within the Safety Sector as a provider of wireless 
solutions designed to save lives, protect assets 
and gain insight. 

Hosted by the Ramtech board of directors, Tony 
received a tour of the offices, where he met with 
colleagues, and gained insight into the day-to-
day operations and culture of the business. 

Tony received presentations on growth, product 
innovation and operations, following which he 
facilitated a roundtable discussion, comprised 
of a group of employees across HR, marketing, 
engineering, logistics and customer services. The 
group were keen to provide background to their 
roles and life at Ramtech, and discuss wide-ranging 
matters including the benefits of becoming part 
of the Halma Group. Discussions were positive and 
highlighted the alignment of vision, values, purpose 
and culture between Ramtech and Halma, and, 
as a recently acquired business, provided employees 
with further background to Halma and how it can 
offer support. 

As is our usual process, following the event Tony 
reported back to the Board on his visit to Ramtech 
and noted that employees had been welcoming 
and engaging and that the visit had presented an 
excellent opportunity to experience first-hand the 
cultural fit with Halma and a better understanding 
of the business.

  Halma plc |  Annual Report and Accounts 2023

Independence and objective judgement
For the year ended 31 March 2023, the Board was 
composed of 11 Directors, each bringing a variety of 
skills, knowledge and experience, in addition to diverse 
thinking. With four Executive Directors and seven 
non-executive Directors (including the Chair), there 
is a strong independent element to Halma’s Board 
which ensures that the balance of power rests with 
the non-executive members of the Board. 

Dame Louise Makin was independent on appointment 
as a non-executive Director in February 2021 and the 
Board considers that she retains objective judgement. 
To facilitate effective debate, the Chair ensures that no 
Director or group of Directors dominate Board meeting 
discussions and that the voice of all Directors is heard 
and respected. Halma’s culture of openness and 
transparency is apparent in how the Board members 
interact individually and collectively. The Executives 
genuinely value the insight, views and challenge that 
the non-executive Directors bring and the transparent 
reporting by the Executives ensures that all stakeholder 
interests can be considered and well-informed, 
collaborative decisions made. 

The Board has reviewed the independence of each 
non-executive Director and, following an assessment 
of any relationships or circumstances which are likely 
to affect a Director’s judgement, consider each to be 
independent for the year ended 31 March 2023. While 
non-executive Directors are not required to hold shares 
in the Company, the Board believes that any Halma 
shares held serve to align their interests with those of 
shareholders and do not interfere with their independence. 
Tony Rice was appointed Senior Independent Director in 
July 2015 and is available as an alternative channel of 
communication for shareholders, independent from 
executive management and the Chair.

Report

Time commitment 
Director availability and time commitment to the 
Company is essential for a properly functioning Board 
and no issues have been experienced during the year. 
In addition to the scheduled and ad hoc Board and 
Committee meetings, Directors also attend the Annual 
General Meeting and the annual strategy meeting. 
Non-executive Directors are also encouraged to attend 
our Accelerate conference and undertake company site 
visits, both of which our Executive Directors attend. The 
Board must approve all significant external appointments 
prior to any Director accepting the position. Our 
appointments policy permits Executive Directors to 
accept one external appointment, provided that it is 
beneficial to the Company and the development of the 
individual. The Board must be satisfied that it does not 
present a conflict of interest with the Group’s activities 
or require a significant time commitment which could 
interfere with the performance of their executive duties. 

For non-executive Directors, the number of external 
directorships is an important consideration when 
recruiting and a preferred candidate must reassure 
the Nomination Committee that they can allocate 
sufficient time to the role (around 20 days per annum 
is anticipated plus additional time if they Chair 
a Committee) before they are recommended 
for appointment.

Prior to the Board’s approval of an additional role, an 
assessment is made of the combined time commitment 
required by their existing roles plus that required in the 
new role. If there is any concern over the time available 
to fulfil their role at Halma, the Board would not approve 
the appointment. However, where Directors are rotating 
off or rebalancing their portfolio of roles, consideration 
will be made of the sequence and timing of the roles 
and a pragmatic approach is taken (as opposed to an 
absolute numerical limit) in respect of any potential 
over-boarding concerns, whether temporary or otherwise. 
All Directors are subject to an annual review, at which 
time commitment and their personal contribution is a 
key focus.

Activities during the year
• Reviewing the internal and external talent pipeline as 
part of the Committee’s regular succession planning 
activities at Board and Executive Board level, with a 
key focus on Group Chief Executive and Chief Financial 
Officer succession. 

• Following a thorough selection process, recommending

Board and Executive Board Composition 
The Board comprises an independent Chair, six non-
executive Directors and four Executive Directors, each 
of whom sit on the Executive Board. There is a strong 
independent element to the Board which ensures that 
the balance of power rests with the non-executive 

Board – skills and experience

members of the Board and each Board member brings 
a variety of skills, knowledge and experience, in addition 
to diverse thinking. The Committee regularly reviews 
the balance of skills, experience and knowledge on the 
Board and its Committees – along with the diversity that 
each member brings – in order to identify any gaps or 
new skills and experience that would benefit the Group, 
which helps inform Board succession planning.

The matrix below sets out the core skills and experience 
that each Director has and also identifies where 
particular Directors are considered to have expertise 
in certain areas. 

The Executive Board comprises the four Executive 
Directors plus seven other executives who cover a range 
of strategic, operational, financial and technical areas. 

Further background on the skills and experience of the 
Board and Executive Board is set out in the biographies 
on pages 106 to 109 and full biographies are available 
on our website at www.halma.com.

Roy Twite and Tony Rice will have served on the 
Board for nine years this year (on 24 July and 8 August 
respectively) but to assist the Company, and ensure 
orderly Director succession, they will seek re-election 
as non-executive Directors for a final term at the 2023 
AGM. It is anticipated that Tony will step down before, 
and Roy will step down at, the 2024 AGM. Having 
considered the factors which could impair their 
independence, the Board considers that they will both 
remain independent during the period up to July 2024.

Board and Executive Board diversity
Embracing diversity, in all its forms, enables individuals 
to share their own perspective, which promotes 
inclusivity and supports good decision-making by the 
Board and Executive Board. The Board recognises the 
many benefits of building a diverse leadership team 
and the tables below set out gender, ethnic and age 
diversity of the Board and Executive Board at the date 
of this Report.

Our Board Diversity Policy was updated in March 2022 
to reflect the new targets set by the FTSE Women 
Leaders Review on gender diversity. The Policy also 
affirms our commitments, on ethnic diversity, as a 
signatory to the Change the Race Ratio. Halma has 
maintained at least one ethnically diverse Director on 
the Board since 2011, which is prior to the publication 
of the Parker Review’s original report in October 2017. 
We took the opportunity in our March 2022 Policy to 
go beyond the Parker Review recommendation, by 
committing to maintain our current composition 
of two ethnically diverse Directors on the Board.

The Committee is supportive of the new FCA Listing Rules 
and amendments to the Disclosure and Transparency 
Rules, which came into effect for accounting periods 
starting on or after 1 April 2022 and is pleased to report 
that during the financial year ended 31 March 2023 and 
up to the date of this Report, the Board had met the 
three targets required under Listing Rule 9.8.6 R (9) as:

• at least 40% of the individuals on the Board 

are women; 

• the Chair is a women; and 
• at least one individual on the Board is from a minority 

ethnic background. 

The Company has collected the diversity data used for 
these purposes from each individual on a voluntary basis.

In March 2023, the Parker Review published an update 
report entitled “Improving Ethnic Diversity in UK 
Business” and have requested that Boards of FTSE 350 
companies set their own target, by December 2023, 
for the percentage of their senior management group 
who self-identify as being in an ethnic minority. The 
Board will be considering an appropriate target with 
management over the coming months and will publish a 
target by the end of 2023 and will report on our progress 
from 2024 through to the target date in December 2027.

Board and Committee Diversity Policy
Halma is committed to building a diverse and 
inclusive culture throughout the Group. Diversity, 
Equity and Inclusion is one of our sustainability key 
focus areas as we believe it benefits the global 
economy and creates a fairer future for everyone, 
every day. The benefits of diversity across all levels 
of the organisation are clear and the unique culture 
that each of our businesses bring – through innate 
differences in our people – is the foundation for 
our success. Creating inclusive environments, 
where everyone has equal access, opportunity 
and treatment and can bring their full self to work, 
is fundamental to accelerating our growth and 
achieving our purpose.

The Board is committed that its composition, 
and that of each Committee, should cover a 
range of factors, such as gender, ethnicity, age, 

sexual orientation, disability and socio-economic 
background. The Board has agreed the following 
commitments in relation to gender and ethnicity:

• to maintain gender balance at Board, Committee 

and Executive Board level by ensuring that 
representation of both men and women is 
at or above a minimum 40% threshold; 
• by 31 December 2025, ensure a minimum 

representation of men or women one level below 
the Executive Board is at or above a 40% threshold;
• to have at least one woman in the Chair or Senior 

Independent Director role and/or one woman in the 
Group Chief Executive or Chief Financial Officer role;
• to maintain at least two ethnically diverse Directors 

on the Board and Committees; and

• as a signatory to Change the Race Ratio, to increase 
racial and ethnic diversity at senior leadership level.

Board appointment process
The Board has an established approach for identifying 
and evaluating suitable candidates for Board positions, 
which was utilised most recently for the appointment of 
Marc Ronchetti for the role of Group Chief Executive and 
for Steve Gunning as Chief Financial Officer. The search 
for new non-executive Directors also follows the 
approach described below.

Prior to the Committee making a recommendation to 
the Board for a Director appointment, it undertakes 
the following steps:

• Agrees the skills, experience and knowledge required 

for, and complementary to, the role.

• Approves the role specification.
• Selects an independent global executive search firm, 

which understands Halma’s business model and 
culture, to prepare a long list of diverse external 
candidates and, for executive roles where there are 
internal candidates that have been identified through 
the Committee’s succession planning, to benchmark 
those candidates. For the year ended 31 March 2023, 
the Committee used the services of executive search 
consultancy, Lygon Group – who are not connected to 
the Company or any Halma Director – to benchmark 
the internal candidates identified for the Group Chief 
Executive role and to source external candidates for 
the Chief Financial Officer role.

• Reviews the long list of candidate profiles and, based 
on insight derived internally or from the search firm, 
creates a shortlist of diverse candidates for interview.
•  For non-executive positions, interviews are held with 
members of the Committee (including the Chair), 
the Group Chief Executive and the Group Talent, 
Culture and Communications Director. For executive 
positions, the Chair and non-executive Directors lead 
the interview process and seek input from other 
executives, as appropriate.

• The Committee members meet to share their feedback 
on each candidate and will compare their assessment 
against the role criteria, along with any reference 
information provided by the search firm. Maintaining 
a focus on gender and ethnic diversity, while ensuring 
that other elements of diversity are not overlooked, 
remains an important factor for the Committee. 
Where elements of diversity will be lost when certain 
Directors come to the end of their tenure, the 
Committee aims to ensure that it will remain diverse 
or will seek a replacement Director to maintain/
restore that element of diversity to the Board and 
its Committees.

• A preferred candidate is selected by the Committee 

and, following discussion with the candidate, a formal 
decision is taken to recommend their appointment to 
the Board.

•  If the Board approves the recommended appointment, 
then a regulatory news service announcement is issued.

Director induction process
Newly appointed Directors follow a tailored induction 
programme, which includes dedicated time with each 
Board and Executive Board member, the Company 
Secretary, DCEs and functional experts. A bespoke 
schedule of company visits across each of the three 
sectors is arranged for the Director and they are 
encouraged to attend the Accelerate conference 
and other Company events throughout the year. 
The induction aims for Directors to become swiftly 
acquainted with Halma’s strategy, business model, 
DNA (cultural and organisational genes) and 
governance structure prior to them building their 
understanding of each sector and our companies. 
In addition, a briefing on statutory duties and listed 
company regulation is provided to new Directors 
and updated at least annually and presented at 
the Board for the benefit of all Directors.

Induction of Marc Ronchetti  
as Group Chief Executive

Being Halma’s Chief Financial Officer since July 2018, 
Marc’s understanding of the Group, its culture and 
strategy was already well embedded – as were his 
relationships with colleagues, external advisers 
and significant shareholders. Therefore, the skills 
and knowledge required for his transition into his first 
CEO role required a tailored approach to his induction. 
Importantly, the programme focused on meeting 
and learning from a number of key internal and 
external stakeholders:

Halma company colleagues: in the period June 2022 
to April 2023, Marc visited over 50% of our companies 
across all three sectors, with the remaining companies 
scheduled through the year to 31 March 2024. These 
visits enabled Marc to not only discuss the business 
and strategy with the local board but also meet a 
wider group of colleagues who work daily to fulfil 
our purpose. 

Group and sector colleagues: a critical element of 
Marc’s induction was to shadow Andrew Williams 
for 10 months to leverage his 18 years of experience 
as Halma’s Group Chief Executive. Marc had regular 
one-to-one meetings with the Chair, Company 
Secretary, Executive Board members and Divisional 
Chief Executives which have given him greater insight 
into the role that each play in the Group and enabled 
him to develop deeper relationships with the senior 
leadership team. Marc attends the Group’s hybrid town 
hall meetings, where Halma colleagues – from the UK, 
the US, India and China – are updated on Company 
news, recognise individual and team achievements and 
have the opportunity to ask questions or share news.

Advisers and shareholders: while Marc had 
established relationships with these stakeholders, 
the focus of discussions and meetings were in 
the context of his leadership of the Group.

Network: a key element of Marc’s professional 
development was in the form of a residential executive 
programme at Stanford Graduate School of Business. 
This not only provided insights from the academics 
and industry speakers in areas such as leadership, 
accountability for results, and purpose and diversity 
but the delegates themselves comprised of a diverse 
and global network of executive leaders from which 
to learn and share experiences.

The structure and breadth of my induction programme  
has enabled me to transition seamlessly from Chief Financial 
Officer into the Group Chief Executive role – while it was  
an intense programme, it was incredibly rewarding and  
struck the right balance for me to learn from others,  
while permitting time and space for me to gather  
my own thoughts and ideas.

2023 Committee evaluation
The Committee’s own evaluation for the year ended 
31 March 2023 concluded that: 

• The size and structure of the Committee, along 

The Chair reviews the training and development needs 
of the Board, and for each Director, at least annually. 

with the frequency and duration of the meetings 
was appropriate.

Annual Board and Committee evaluations
The Committee reviews the process and output from 
the annual Board and Committee evaluations. The 
formal evaluation process involves a review of the 
performance of each Director through individual 
meetings held with the Chair and for the Chair, an 
appraisal is undertaken by the non-executive Directors 
collectively and fed back via the Senior Independent 
Director. The Board undertakes an evaluation of its 
own performance and effectiveness, with the findings 
and proposed actions being presented at the Board 
by the Chair. 

Each Committee undertakes its own evaluation and 
the findings and proposed actions are formally reviewed 
at the relevant Committee meeting. Progress against 
agreed actions is monitored by the Company Secretary 
throughout the year and a formal review is undertaken 
ahead of the next evaluation cycle, to ensure that the 
actions have been, or will be, appropriately closed out. 
The results from the Audit Committee and Remuneration 
Committee evaluations are discussed in the respective 
Committee Reports and the results from the 
Committee’s own evaluation are set out below.

Evaluation type
The Committee normally utilises an external evaluator 
on a triennial basis and the Chair, with the support of 
the Company Secretary, formulates a bespoke internal 
questionnaire in the two years in between. The last 
externally-facilitated evaluation was undertaken by 
Independent Audit in 2021 and an internal evaluation 
was undertaken for 2022 and 2023. The internal 
evaluation exercise is thorough and allows directed 
questions to be asked on areas particularly relevant 
to Halma at that time or on topics that have been 
raised during the year – examples of topics covered 
over recent years include Board succession, Boardroom 
dynamics, strategic progress in specific areas and the 
level of challenge and support that has been provided 
by the non-executive Directors. These questions are 
supplemented by standing governance questions 
on Board and Committee structure, Director skills, 
experience and diversity, Board and Committee 
effectiveness, strategy and risk. For the year ending 
31 March 2024, an externally-facilitated evaluation 
will be carried out and the results will be reported in 
next year’s Report.

• The papers and presentations were of high quality.
• Meetings are chaired well. 
• Overall the Committee was operating effectively, 
with recognition that the Group Chief Executive 
and Chief Financial Officer succession plans had 
been well planned and well executed.

2023 Board evaluation
The Board’s 2023 evaluation questionnaire confirmed 
that the Directors believe that: 

• The Board is operating effectively. 
• The papers are clear and of a high standard. 
• The Board has healthy debates which lead to good 

decision-making.

• Strong relationships have been formed amongst 
the Board members, while independence of the  
non-executives from management is maintained.

The main areas for focus over the coming year and 
the proposed actions agreed are as follows:

• Rotational presentations from the Sector Chief 

Executives will include more coverage on evolving and 
potentially disruptive technology and business models, 
in addition to the regular sector strategy update and 
review of end-market trends.

• Insight on mega trends and the competitive landscape 
in which our companies are operating will be topics for 
fuller consideration at our annual strategy meeting.
• Following the success of the non-executive Director 

and the Divisional Chief Executives interactions over the 
past year, further opportunities for senior management 
to gain exposure to the Directors will be sought.

• M&A proposals will include a summary of the Executive 
Board’s appraisal of the opportunity, to provide further 
context to the Board, and additional information on 
the top M&A pipeline targets will provided at each 
Board meeting.

Following the annual evaluation, and the individual 
performance reviews undertaken by the Chair, all 
Directors that are standing for election or re-election 
are considered to be effective in their role, hold recent 
and relevant experience applicable for Halma’s business 
and they each continue to add value and demonstrate 
commitment to their role. Accordingly, the Board is 
recommending to shareholders the election or re-
election of the Directors standing at the 2023 AGM.

Committee composition and appointment
The Committee comprises six independent non-executive 
Directors. Carole Cran is Chair of the Committee 
and≈continues to have recent and relevant financial 
experience and competence in accounting, 
see page 107 for her biography. 

Only Committee members are entitled to attend 
meetings, although the Committee Chair invites 
the Board Chair, Executive Directors, Group Financial 
Controller, Group General Counsel & Chief Sustainability 
Officer, Director of Internal Audit & Assurance and 
representatives from the external Auditor to regularly 
attend meetings. Subject matter experts, including 
on Risk, Tax, Treasury Sustainability and Sector Chief 
Executives’ and Financial Officers’ are invited to present 
on a cyclical basis to keep the Committee updated.

Appointments to the Committee are made by the 
Board and the remuneration of the Committee 
Chair reflects the additional responsibilities and 
time commitment required in the role. As part of the 
induction process for new members of the Committee, 
they will meet separately with key individuals – including 
the Committee Chair, the Chief Financial Officer, the 
Director of Internal Audit & Assurance and the external 
Auditor. While each non-executive Director will largely 
manage their own continuing development, the 
Committee receives relevant updates throughout 
the year including from the external Auditor and other 
professional advisers on matters relevant to financial 
reporting, technical accounting and governance, 
internal control, tax, audit and risk, and may 
request additional information, as required. 

The Committee as a whole has competence relevant 
to the Group, with each member bringing valuable 

experience, diversity of thought and independent 
judgement. Biographies for each member of the 
Committee are set out on pages 106 and 107.

Governance
The Committee, and independently the Committee 
Chair, regularly meets with the Director of Internal Audit 
& Assurance and separately with the external Auditor, 
without any Executive Directors present. The Committee 
Chair maintains regular contact with management, 
particularly the Chief Financial Officer, Group Financial 
Controller and the Company Secretary.

All members of the Committee further their internal 
network and knowledge of the companies through 
company visits, corporate events and the 
Accelerate conference.

The Committee Chair sets the forward agenda for the 
year but also allows for flexibility in the timing and the 
schedule to ensure that new or unforeseen areas can 
be appropriately reviewed. The agenda and meeting 
papers are circulated in a timely manner, in 
accordance with the terms of reference.

The Committee Chair reports to the Board after each 
meeting on the key matters discussed. Minutes are 
circulated to all Board members and the external Auditor 
once they have been approved by the Committee. 
Internal Audit reports that identify any significant control 
or compliance weakness, or other risk that requires 
immediate management attention, are circulated to the 
Committee via the Company Secretary when the report 
is issued. At the same time, commentary from the Chief 
Financial Officer and Divisional Chief Executive on the 
background to the weakness, any mitigating controls 
and the actions being taken to address the findings is 
shared with Committee members.

Activities during the year
The Committee has a wide-ranging remit, covering reviewing and monitoring the integrity of the financial 
statements and other financial information, internal controls and risk management, the external and internal 
audit process and compliance with laws, regulations and ethical codes of practice. The Committee discharged 
its duties under its Terms of Reference for the year and key activities included: 

• Reviewing the Half Year Report and Annual Report 
and Accounts and considering the key accounting 
judgements and estimates that affect the 
application of the policies and reported values 
and approving the Group’s going concern and 
viability statements.

Financial statements and significant 
accounting matters 
During the year, and prior to the publication of the 
Group’s results for the Half Year ended 30 September 
2022 and the Full Year ended 31 March 2023, the 
Committee considered the significant risks and 
material issues, judgements and estimates made 
in relation to the Group’s financial statements. 

These issues were discussed with management 
at various stages during the year and during the 
preparation and finalisation of the financial statements. 
After reviewing the presentations and reports from 
management, the Committee is satisfied that the 
financial statements appropriately address the critical 
accounting judgements and key estimates, set out 
below, both in respect of the amounts reported and the 
disclosures made. The Committee is also satisfied that 
the significant assumptions used for determining the 
value of assets and liabilities have been appropriately 
scrutinised, challenged and are sufficiently robust. The 
Committee has discussed these issues with the Auditor 
during the audit planning process and at the finalisation 
of the year-end audit and is satisfied that its conclusions 
are in line with those drawn by the Auditor in relation to 
these issues.

Audit Committee Report continued

Committee evaluation
An evaluation of the Committee’s own effectiveness is 
undertaken each year and the findings are reported 
to the Board. In 2023, this evaluation took the form 
of a tailored internal questionnaire. The feedback was 
provided to the Committee Chair and a summary of 
the output and proposed actions is reviewed by the 
Committee. The 2023 evaluation demonstrated 
that the Committee is working effectively and the 
Committee members considered it to be exercising 
good oversight of the reporting environment and 
effectively supporting and overseeing the work of 
the internal and external auditors. Some areas for 
improvement were identified which the Committee 
Chair discussed with the Chair, Group Chief Executive, 
Chief Financial Officer and the external Auditor to 
form a collective view on how best to address these 
points. A proposal was presented at the June 2023 
Committee meeting and the actions to address each 
area were agreed. These included reviewing additional 
training areas required in relation to the Committee’s 
ongoing role in the changing regulatory landscape.

Financial Reporting Council review of 2021/22 
Annual Report and Accounts
In November 2022, the Company received a letter from 
the Financial Reporting Council (FRC) in connection with 
their review of the Halma Annual Report and Accounts 
for the year ended 31 March 2022. The Committee were 
pleased to note that the FRC had no questions arising 
from their review of this Report, and that they had 
two areas of observation for consideration in our 2023 
Annual Report and Accounts, relating to TCFD Scope 3 
emissions disclosures and share-based payments 
disclosures. Each of these observational areas have 
been addressed in this Report. We have acknowledged 
and thanked the FRC for their observations.

Significant risks and material issues, 
judgements and estimates

Value of goodwill, due to the 
significance of the amounts 
recorded on the Consolidated 
Balance Sheet, and the 
judgements and estimates 
involved in assessing goodwill 
for impairment.

How the Committee addressed each area and conclusion

• Focusing on, monitoring regularly, and constructively challenging the reasonableness 
of the assumptions used in impairment calculations by management, in particular 
discount rates, growth rates, the level of aggregation of individual cash generating 
units (CGUs) and methodology applied.

• Considering the appropriateness and reasonableness of stated judgements 

and conclusions included in the disclosures in note 11 to the Accounts.

• In particular, during the year, considering the CGU groups to which the Group’s 

seven acquisitions were attributed, the treatment of inflation within assumptions 
given the significant increase seen and assessing the reasonable of sensitivities 
applied and considered to be reasonably possible. 

Carrying value of acquired 
intangibles across the Group 
and the adequacy of future 
cash flows.

• Focusing on and challenging the assessment of the presence of impairment 

indicators that warrant an impairment test of an asset. 

• Constructively challenging the reasonableness of assumptions used in impairment 

calculations by management, in particular discount rates and asset specific 
growth rates.

Risk that acquisitions are 
not accounted for correctly 
in line with IFRS 3 “Business 
combinations”. 

Valuation of contingent 
consideration arising on 
acquisitions in current and 
prior periods.

Judgements and estimates 
involved in valuing defined 
benefit pension plans.

• Challenging the appropriateness of assumptions used in determining the 

fair value of the acquired intangible assets and residual goodwill identified, 
and the reasonableness of the disclosures included in note 25 to the Accounts. 

• The fair value of acquired intangible assets and carrying values arising on the 

seven acquisitions in the year, particularly in relation to the acquisitions of FirePro, 
WEETECH, IZI Medical and Deep Trekker.

• Assessing treatments of contingent consideration payment arrangements against 

the requirements of IFRS 3 and IFRS 13.

• Considering assumptions made around forecasts used in calculations. 
• In particular, at 31 March 2023, the treatment and valuation of the contingent 
consideration provisions in relation to Visiometrics, IZI Medical and Infinite Leap.

• Assessing the assumptions in determining pension obligations, particularly given 
market volatility, and determining whether key assumptions were reasonable, 
particularly the assumptions around mortality, discount rate and inflation that 
are most material to the Group’s plans and resulted in retirement benefit assets 
being recognised for the Group at 31 March 2023.

• The recognition of the plan surpluses in accordance with IFRIC 14. 

Compliance risks with existing 
and evolving tax legislation, 
and judgements around 
uncertain tax positions 
including the recoverability 
of the tax receivable balances.

• Assessing the position taken with regards to tax judgements.
• The judgements around the carrying value of tax provisions and uncertainties, 
in particular, the potential impact on the Group of the European Commission’s 
decision against the UK Government relating to the UK Controlled Foreign 
Company partial exemption being illegal State Aid.

• Understanding the evolving BEPS Pillar 2 and UK Transfer Pricing legislation 

and the likely compliance impact on the Group.

Carrying value of investments 
(Company only).

• Constructively challenging the reasonableness of the assumptions used in 
impairment calculations by management, in particular discount rates and 
future cashflows.

Group and any impact to 
future viability.

• The evidence supporting the going concern basis of accounts preparation, 
the Viability Statement and the risk management and internal control 
disclosure requirements.

Financial Disclosures (TCFD) 

• The work undertaken to continue to assess and manage the climate-related 

risks and opportunities for the Group and the associated reporting in accordance 
with the TCFD framework

In addition, the Committee considered the presence of any significant product failures in the period that would 
warrant the inclusion of a significant warranty provision, and assessed the capitalisation and carrying value of 
Capitalised Development Costs in line with the accounting policy and standards.

Audit Committee Report continued

External Auditor
The external Auditor is appointed to give an opinion 
on the Group and Company financial statements. 
The audit includes the review and testing of the data 
contained in the financial statements to the extent, 
and materiality level necessary for expressing an audit 
opinion as to whether they present a true and fair 
view of the Group and parent company affairs as 
at 31 March 2023.

Whilst the Committee remains satisfied that PwC 
are effective and independent, the next external audit 
tender will occur in 2026, with a recommendation put 
to shareholders at the 2027 AGM. The proposed tender 
date is in the best interests of shareholders and the 
Company as PwC has a detailed knowledge of our 
business, an understanding of our industry and 
continues to demonstrate that it has the necessary 
expertise and capability to undertake the audit. 

The Committee monitors the effectiveness of the 
external Auditor throughout the year and annually 
conducts an evaluation of the external audit, by way 
of a tailored online questionnaire, further details are set 
out on page 133. The assessment highlighted no major 
concerns and the insights from the questionnaires have 
been discussed both internally and with PwC, to assist 
with the planning of future work. The Committee 
concluded that it was satisfied with the auditor’s 
performance in discharging the Full Year audit and 
the Half Year review; the independence and objectivity 
of the auditor; the robustness of the audit process, 
including how the auditor demonstrated professional 
scepticism and challenged managements assumptions 
and the quality of service and delivery of the audit. 
Accordingly, the Committee recommends that PwC 
are reappointed as Auditor at the 2023 Annual 
General Meeting (AGM). 

Audit tendering
The Committee has primary responsibility for 
recommending to the Board the appointment or 
reappointment of the external Auditor before it is 
put to shareholders at the AGM. The Committee will, 
at the appropriate time, lead the audit tender process. 
This process will be carried out at least every 10 years 
and, unless it is undertaken earlier, it is the Committee’s 
policy to consider whether a tender is appropriate every 
five years – to coincide with the change in Senior 
Statutory Auditor.

Following a tender process, PwC were appointed Auditor 
to the Company at the AGM in 2017. In accordance with 
our Auditor Independence Policy, which requires us to 
change our audit partner every five years, Christopher 
Richmond was appointed Senior Statutory Auditor for 
the financial period commencing 1 April 2022. 

In 2021, prior to any decision on the rotation of the 
Senior Statutory Auditor, the Committee considered 
the possibility of re-tendering the external audit 
function and concluded that it was satisfied that PwC 
was effective and remained independent in accordance 
with our Auditor Independence Policy and the FRC’s 
Ethical Standard, and that a tender process was not 
appropriate at that time. 

132 

  Halma plc |  Annual Report and Accounts 2023

Statement of compliance
The Company confirms that it complied throughout 
the year with the provisions of the Competition and 
Markets Authority’s Statutory Audit Services for Large 
Companies Market Investigation (Mandatory Use of 
Competitive Tender Processes and Audit Committee 
Responsibilities) Order 2014.

Auditor objectivity and independence  
(including non-audit fees)
The Group has adopted a Policy on “Auditor 
Independence and Services provided by the External 
Auditor” which sets out the limited services that the 
external Auditor can provide to Group companies, 
which do not conflict with the Auditor’s independence. 
The Policy was updated in 2020 to align with the FRC’s 
revised Ethical Standard which applied from March 2020. 
The Committee continues to monitor changes in 
legislation related to auditor independence and 
objectivity and annually reviews the Policy. 

In addition to Halma’s Policy, the Auditor runs its own 
independence and compliance checks, prior to accepting 
any engagement, to ensure that all non-audit work is 
compliant with the Ethical Standard in force and that 
there is no conflict of interest. 

During the year, three pieces of permitted audit-related 
services work (in addition to the Half Year review) were 
undertaken by PwC. These were in respect of a liquidity 
test pertaining to a dividend distribution in Belgium, 
which must be performed by an auditor, an annual tax 
audit in India, which is a statutory requirement, and a 
required audit for HWM-Water Limited relating to its 
Queens Innovation Award, with total fees of c.£12,000. 
It was deemed appropriate to use PwC in respect of 
these three items of work given their understanding 
of the business and involvement in the Group audit. 
Additionally, PwC provided access to their technical 
guidance toolkit, for a total fee of c.£1,000. All work 
was pre-approved by the Committee Chair and 
reported to the Committee in accordance with  
our Policy.

The audit fees payable to PwC for the year ended 
31 March 2023 were £2.5m (2022: £2.1m) and permitted 
audit-related service fees were £0.1m (2022: £0.1m). 
Other non-audit services totalled less than £0.1m 
in both the current and preceding year. The total of 
audit related and non-audit related services for the 
year totalled c.6% of three year average audit fees, 
significantly below the limit of 70% required by 
the Policy.

Other 
Information

• Interaction with Auditor – the Committee Chair, the 
Chief Financial Officer and management have regular 
communication with the Auditor throughout the year 
and are able to raise issues and discuss key deliverables 
as the year progresses. The Committee recognises that 
PwC have appropriately challenged management on 
key judgements and estimates throughout the year, 
as detailed in the significant risks and material issues, 
judgements and estimates table above. 

• Audit tender and rotation – in accordance with our 
Auditor Independence Policy, the Committee reviews 
the appropriateness of tendering the external audit 
function every five years and, in conjunction with this, 
will rotate statutory audit partner at least every five 
years, the most recent rotation of which took place in 
2022, with a new audit partner in place for FY23. 
• Annual internal effectiveness survey – a tailored 
on-line questionnaire is circulated and completed by 
Committee members, other senior management and 
company CFO’s who are engaged in the audit process, 
the outcomes of which are reported to the Committee 
and the Board. A summary of the process and key 
findings is set out below.

Evaluation of the effectiveness and  
quality of the External Auditor
The effectiveness of the External Auditor is monitored 
throughout the year, including through: 

• FRC’s Audit Quality Inspection and Supervision 

report 2021/22 – the Committee reviewed the results 
of the FRC’s Audit Quality Inspection and Supervision 
report 2021/22 during the year and noted an 
improvement on rating from the prior year and that 
good practice in respect of professional scepticism, 
high quality reporting and audit documentation 
had been highlighted. 

• Progress against audit plan and strategy – the 
Committee continually evaluated and monitored 
progress against the agreed audit plan and strategy 
and any issues or reasons for variation from the plan 
were identified, discussed and agreed with the Auditor. 
Additionally, the Committee reviewed, benchmarked 
and latterly agreed to the auditors fees for the year 
under review, which had primarily increased due to 
the additional requirements under the revised auditing 
standard ISA315 and inflationary increases. 

• Auditor reports to the Committee – through PwC’s 
formal reports to the Committee at each meeting the 
Committee track and consider the work undertaken 
by the Auditor during the year.

controls) and monitors its effectiveness, reporting back 
to the Board, who has ultimate responsibility to the 
shareholders for the Group’s system of internal control 
and risk management. While not providing absolute 
assurance against material misstatements or loss, this 
system is designed to identify and manage those risks 
that could adversely impact the achievement of the 
Group’s objectives. The Group’s risk management 
structure and process is detailed on pages 88 and 89. 
The Group’s emerging risks are detailed on page 90 
and the principal risks and uncertainties are 
detailed on pages 91 to 97.

The Committee regularly reviews the ongoing process 
in place for identifying, evaluating and managing the 
emerging and principal risks faced by the Group and 
for determining the nature and extent of the risks it is 
willing to take in achieving its strategic priorities. This 
risk framework is in accordance with the Guidance 
on Risk Management, Internal Control and Related 
Financial and Business Reporting. 

Our governance model was strengthened in 2022, 
with the appointment of a new Director of Risk & 
Compliance, separating the Risk and Internal Audit 
functions and enhancing the assurance framework. 
This enhancement of our risk management and 
internal controls framework will allow each function 
to continue to evolve and strengthen. 

Regular reporting to the Committee by the Director of 
Internal Audit & Assurance, as well as findings of internal 
audits by circulation between meetings, ensures that 
there is a good understanding of any non-compliance 
that arises and the swift action being taken to close any 
gaps. The Group’s external Auditor, PwC, has audited 
the financial statements and has reviewed the financial 
control framework to the extent considered necessary 
to support the audit report.

The Committee is satisfied that the risk management 
and internal control framework remains robust and 
effective, while still allowing autonomous and agile 
decision-making which is essential to Halma’s 
decentralised structure and an integral part of Halma’s 
growth strategy. No significant failings or weaknesses 
have been identified in the internal controls. 

Whistleblowing 
The Committee has responsibility for reviewing the 
adequacy and security of the Group’s arrangements 
for employees and contractors to raise concerns about 
possible improprieties in financial reporting, fraud or 
other financial or ethical misconduct.

  Halma plc |  Annual Report and Accounts 2023

Halma has appointed an external third-party provider, 
NavexGlobal, to operate a confidential, multilingual, 
telephone and web reporting service, 24/7, through 
which concerns can be raised. Further details are set 
out in the non-financial information statement on 
page 99.

The Director of Risk & Compliance receives and reviews 
all reports to ensure that they are appropriately 
investigated and all allegations of fraud or financial 
misconduct are reported to the Committee. In line 
with many listed companies, most matters reported 
through the NavexGlobal service relate to personnel/
HR matters and, while these are not areas for review by 
the Committee, such matters are duly investigated in 
the same manner and reported directly to the Board 
in its role of monitoring culture and workforce concerns.

Following a review during the year, the Committee 
is satisfied with the adequacy and security of the 
arrangements in place for concerns to be raised.

Climate-related disclosures
The Committee has overall responsibility for approving 
the disclosures made under the climate-related Listing 
Rule 9.8.6R(8). The Committee has continued to receive 
updates throughout the year on progress made against 
reporting on the climate-related disclosures. These are 
consistent with the TCFD recommendations and the 11 
recommended disclosures under TCFD, as required by 
the Listing Rules.

Internal Audit
The Internal Audit & Assurance function comprises the 
Director of Internal Audit & Assurance and five audit 
managers – two based in the UK, two in the US and one 
in China. External co-source is also utilised for certain 
specialist areas as required, such as Cyber risk. A risk-
based audit work plan is agreed by the Committee 
annually and takes account of the rotational visits 
undertaken by the external Auditor under their audit 
programme. Progress against the work plan is reviewed 
at each Committee meeting, in order that any changes 
in priorities or resourcing can be discussed and agreed. 
Pulse checks were successfully introduced as part of 
the 2022/23 annual audit plan to provide an additional 
assurance snapshot. These are shorter verbal assurance 
touchpoints that take place mid-way between full 
audits. Pulse checks are also used for companies 
acquired and are performed six months after the 
date of acquisition to check progress, followed by a 
full audit at 12 months.

The Committee has oversight of the Internal Audit & 
Assurance budget and resources available and it has 
satisfied itself that the Internal Audit & Assurance 
function has the appropriate level of resources and 
funds available to undertake its role. All Internal 
Audit reports are issued to management and the 
external Auditor.

Evaluation of the effectiveness and quality of the 
Internal Audit function
The effectiveness of the Internal Audit function is 
monitored throughout the year, including through: 

• Progress against the Internal Audit plan – the 

Committee review and discuss progress made against 
an agreed Internal Audit action plan at each meeting.

Internal audit evaluation process and outcome

• Internal Audit reports to the Committee – 
Internal Audit reports are presented at each 
Committee meeting for review and discussion. 

• Annual review of the Internal Audit & Assurance 

charter – the Committee annually review and approve 
changes to the Internal Audit & Assurance charter. 
• Annual internal effectiveness survey – a tailored 
on-line questionnaire is circulated and completed by 
Committee members and other senior management 
who are engaged in the audit process, the outcomes 
of which are reported to the Committee and the Board. 
A summary of the process and key findings is set 
out below.

Bespoke questionnaire covering

Questionnaire completed by

• The functions’ position and reporting lines.
• Internal audit scope and its relevance to 

our business.
• Audit approach.
• Quality of the team.
• Reliability and quality of reporting.
• Use of technology and communication.

• Board members.
• Executive Board members.
• Sector CFOs.
• Group Financial Controller.
• Managing Director for Halma IT.
• Divisional Chief Executives.
• Company Secretary.
• PwC Audit Partner.

Results

Outcome

• The responses from the questionnaire are 
collated centrally and a summary of the 
findings is provided to the Committee to 
consider the overall effectiveness of the 
function and any action required.

• Following a review by the Committee of the 

output from the 2023 questionnaires and direct 
feedback from the Chief Financial Officer and 
the Chair, the Committee concluded that the 
quality, experience and expertise of the 
Internal Audit function is effective.

Fair, balanced and understandable
To ensure that the report and accounts are fair, 
balanced and understandable, the Committee considers 
the output from a series of focused exercises that take 
place during the Annual Report and Accounts production 
process. These can be summarised as follows:

• A qualitative review, performed by the Group’s Finance 
and Secretarial functions, of disclosures and a review of 
internal consistency throughout the Annual Report and 
Accounts. This review assesses the Annual Report and 
Accounts against objective criteria drawn up for each 
component of the requirement (individual criteria that 
indicate ‘fairness’, ‘balance’ and ‘understandability’ as 
well as criteria that overlap two or more components).
• A risk comparison review which assesses the consistency 
of the presentation of risks and significant judgements 
throughout the main areas of risk disclosure in the 
Annual Report and Accounts.

• A formal review of all Board and Committee meeting 
minutes by the Company Secretary to ensure that all 
significant issues are appropriately reflected and 
given due prominence in narrative reporting.

• Availability to the Committee of the key working 

papers and results for each of the significant issues 
and judgements considered by the Committee in 
the period.

The Directors’ statement on a fair, balanced and 
understandable Annual Report and Accounts is set 
out on page 168.

Other 
Information

On behalf of the Board, I am pleased to present our 
Directors’ Remuneration Report for the year ended 
31 March 2023. This statement sets out the work of 
the Committee during the year and provides context 
for the decisions taken.

The context of remuneration in 2023
Our performance 
Our Sustainable Growth Model (delivering sustainable 
growth, consistently high returns and positive impact) 
and in particular our DNA (combination of our 
decentralised organisational model and culture), 
continue to be critical in delivering our strong 
performance, as Halma reports its 20th consecutive 
year of profit growth, delivering 44 consecutive years 
of dividend per share growth of 5% or more. 

Over the last year, we delivered continued high returns 
and strong growth. Revenue and adjusted profit grew 
by 21% and 14% respectively and Adjusted earnings per 
share increased by 17%. Return on Sales of 19.5% was 
within our KPI target range of 18-22% and Return on 
Total Invested Capital (ROTIC) of 14.8% remained well 
above our Weighted Average Cost of Capital estimated 
at 8.9%. Our total shareholder return has continued to 
outperform the FTSE 100 index, with an investment of 
£100 in Halma shares on 28 March 2013 worth £485.6 
on 31 March 2023, compared to £174.1 for a similar 
investment in the FTSE 100 index.

These results have been delivered despite challenging 
markets, the continuing conflict in Ukraine and the 
resulting energy crisis, demonstrating the resilience 
of the Halma business model.

Our people 
Halma’s people remain its most important asset and we 
continue to believe that our people should be rewarded 
appropriately. The Committee reviews various aspects 
of the wider workforce’s remuneration and considers 
such information when determining the approach to 
executive pay. Many Halma employees have been, and 
continue to be, impacted by inflationary pressures and 
the cost-of-living crisis and we are proud of the support 
that Halma companies have given their employees 
during this time. Halma also continues to pay the Real 
Living Wage across its UK operations and this will be the 
third year that we have published details of our mean 
gender pay gap for the employees across two of our 
largest regions (the UK and the USA), with a reduction 
to 18.7% from 20% disclosed last year. Examples of cost 
of living support and details of Halma’s mean gender 
pay gap can be found on pages 66 to 71 in the section 
on Our people and culture.

As part of the Committee’s commitment to workforce 
engagement, my non-executive Director colleagues and 
I held sessions with a cross-section of employees on site 
visits to some of our companies. A breakfast meeting 
was also held with select employees at Accelerate 
Halma, our group-wide leadership conference, held in 
October 2022. At these sessions we had productive 
conversations on the role of the Remuneration 

Committee, executive and employee remuneration 
and a range of other topics including job satisfaction 
and company culture. Employees were candid and 
constructive in their views which gave us insight into 
the effectiveness of Halma’s approach to remuneration 
and employee satisfaction.

Remuneration outcomes for 2023
Bonus 
Bonuses for 2023 were based on three metrics below: 

• Economic Value Added (EVA) – Performance against 
a weighted average target of EVA for the past three 
years, representing 90% of overall bonus opportunity.
• Diversity, Equity and Inclusion (DEI) – Gender balance 

on the boards of individual Halma companies, 
representing 5% of overall bonus opportunity.

• Climate Change – Annual improvement in 

energy productivity (Revenue / energy consumed), 
representing 5% of overall bonus opportunity.

The Committee considered the targets to be demanding, 
appropriate and material to stakeholder value-creation. 
The formulaic outcomes across all three metrics are set 
out below, with one third of the total payout deferred 
into shares which will become available after two years:

outcome for CEO

EVA 
(90%)

DEI
(5%)

Climate
Change
(5%)

Total

 71.8%

0%

100%

69.7%

The Committee believes that the EVA formulaic 
outcome was appropriate and payout reflects the 
robust performance of the business through the 
previous three years. The Committee also reviewed the 
Climate Change outcome carefully and we are satisfied 
that Halma’s underlying performance justifies the 
payout in respect of this metric. There will be no payout 
in respect of DEI. You will find further details of all the 
performance metrics on page 145 of the report.

Executive Share Plan (ESP)
For the 2020 ESP award, the two performance metrics, 
measured over a three-year period are:

• Growth in Adjusted earnings per share (EPS), 

with a 50% weighting.

• Average Return on Total Invested Capital (ROTIC), 

with a 50% weighting.

The targets were set to reflect the impact of the COVID 
pandemic and details can be found on page 146.

The three-year performance for average ROTIC (14.67%) 
and Adjusted EPS growth over the three-year period 
(10.16%) have been strong and are reflected in 
94.79% vesting.

Remuneration Committee Report continued

The Committee reviewed the topic of windfall gains for 
the 2020 grant and it determined that as a result of the 
share price increase at the time of grant, there was no 
windfall gain concern. It was therefore the view of the 
Committee that the formulaic vesting should proceed 
without any adjustments. 

As has been highlighted since the 2020 grant, the 
Committee considers the targets for this award to 
be stretching.

In line with the 2018 Corporate Governance Code 
(Code), the Committee reviewed the outcomes of the 
individual incentive plans (annual bonus and ESP) as well 
as the overall levels of remuneration to ensure that they 
remained consistent with the underlying performance of 
the business. The Committee is satisfied that the total 
remuneration received by Executive Directors in respect 
of the year ended 31 March 2023 is a fair reflection of 
performance over the period and no use of discretion 
is warranted. 

Pension
The maximum employer pension contribution rate for 
UK employees is 10.5% of salary, along with a generous 
contribution structure that encourages our employees – 
especially our lowest paid – to save for their retirement. 
In line with prior commitments made by the Company, 
company pension contributions for the Executive 
Directors were reduced on 31 December 2022 to align 
with the UK wider workforce rate of 10.5% of salary. 

Executive Director changes
Andrew Williams stepped down as Group Chief 
Executive on 31 March 2023. He will retire and step down 
from the Board on 30 June and will continue to be paid 
in line with the Remuneration Policy until his retirement. 
On this basis, Andrew remains eligible to receive a bonus 
payable in June 2023, in respect of the 2023 financial 
year, that has just concluded. No bonus will be accrued 
or paid for the 2024 financial year and he will not receive 
an ESP award in June 2023. Further details of Andrew’s 
leaving arrangements are set out on page 144. 

Marc Ronchetti began his role as CEO Designate on 
16 June 2022 and became Group Chief Executive 
effective 1 April 2023 with a salary of £900,000. The 
Committee’s decision on salary reflected that Marc’s 
total remuneration for the next few financial years will 
be substantially lower than Andrew Williams, had 
Andrew remained in post, assuming the same level of 
performance. This is the case as Marc’s inflight share 
awards and deferred bonus shares are lower and 
reflective of his previous Chief Financial Officer role. 
Marc will also not be eligible to receive a salary increase 
until June 2024. The Committee’s decision was discussed 
with shareholders as part of the consultations outlined 
below. They agreed the package was not excessive and 
no concerns were raised. You can find details of his 
package on pages 148 and 149. 

Steve Gunning began employment with Halma 
on 16 January 2023 as Chief Financial Officer 
and he received an ESP award in February 2023.

  Halma plc |  Annual Report and Accounts 2023

Steve’s package is set out on page 144. His annual bonus 
and ESP opportunity are in line with our Policy, with the 
annual bonus for 2023 pro-rated to reflect his period 
of employment.

Chair and non-executive Director Fees
The Committee carried out a benchmarking review of 
the Chair’s fees and the Committee was unanimous in 
approving an inflationary increase of 3.2% and you will 
find details of this on page 149. 

Following a review, the Board agreed to leave the fees 
for the non-executive Directors unchanged and you will 
find more details of this on page 149. The next review will 
be carried out in late 2023 and any change effective 
from 1 January 2024. 

Shareholder engagement
At the July 2022 Annual General Meeting (AGM), 67.14% 
of shareholders voted in support of the Remuneration 
Report resolution. In accordance with Code requirements, 
as more than 20% of votes were cast against the Board 
recommendation for this resolution, an interim update 
was announced and we consulted with our shareholders 
to understand the reasons behind the voting outcome. 
I set out below further key points on that shareholder 
consultation process:

• After the AGM, we wrote to shareholders representing 
over 55% of issued share capital to understand their 
perspectives on the AGM outcome. We met shareholders 
representing circa 30% of the share capital. The 
shareholders we met represented a cross-section 
of investors – diverse by voting outcomes, size of 
shareholding, geography and investor type (index funds 
vs active managers), including a good number of ESG 
focused funds. We are pleased that we saw a mix that 
is broadly reflective of the types of holdings on our 
wider register. 

• At these meetings, we outlined Halma’s continuing 
strong profit and valuation growth over the past 
twenty years. We explained that succession risk was 
an important part of the rationale for the variable pay 
reset in the 2021 policy and salary reset implemented 
over two years, in 2021 and 2022. We also shared details 
of how the Committee’s decision-making, leading up to 
the 2022 salary increase implementation, was informed 
by the Executive Director succession planning process. 
Specifically, the decisions made supported the 
Committee’s need to ensure that Halma had the 

Strategic 
Report

Governance

Financial 
Statements

Information

necessary remuneration tools to recruit in the external 
market and the urgency of this goal was not disclosable 
to shareholders at the time.

• We discussed the use of the FTSE 100 (excluding 

financial services) as the appropriate benchmark for 
establishing a competitive pay offering. We highlighted 
the difficulty of defining a specific comparator group 
that would cover the Safety, Environmental & Analysis 
and Healthcare sectors in which Halma competes for 
business and talent. Positioning Halma Executive 
Director remuneration at the median of the FTSE 100 
(excluding financial services) continues to ensure Halma 
maintains the level of pay that supports the current 
talent retention needs as well as the company’s current 
size and future growth ambitions. 

• The outcome of having achieved market alignment on 
pay in 2022 was that Halma was able to hire Steve 
Gunning, an experienced FTSE 100 CFO to replace the 
Chief Financial Officer role vacated by Marc Ronchetti. 
Improving the competitiveness of executive pay was a 
major factor in being able to execute an effective 
Group Chief Executive and Chief Financial Officer 
transition plan. The details of the remuneration of our 
Group Chief Executive and Chief Financial Officer were 
shared with shareholders. We highlighted that these 
individuals would not receive salary increases in the 
2024 financial year, with their next review effective 
1 June 2024 (see table to the right), demonstrating 
Halma’s return to restraint following the remuneration 
reset. We also flagged that Marc’s total remuneration 
for the next few financial years will be substantially 
lower than Andrew Williams, had Andrew remained 
in post, assuming the same level of performance. 
Shareholders acknowledged that the remuneration 
packages were competitive but not excessive and 
appreciated the Company’s commitment to return to 
restraint. No further concerns or suggested changes 
were raised in relation to this.

• We had open and constructive conversations with 

shareholders on the voting outcome. The shareholders 
we spoke to were able to appreciate that succession risk 
was best addressed by the two-year phased approach 
we adopted to salary changes. The feedback received 
was that the rationale was better understood and 
shareholders were appreciative of the additional 
context the Committee was able to provide in relation 
to the Group Chief Executive succession process, 
understanding that it was not possible to communicate 
this to shareholders until the Group Chief Executive 
succession was publicly announced in June 2022. 

Remuneration arrangements for 2024
Salary
In line with our historically conservative approach to 
remuneration and the timings of appointments, salaries 
for our Group Chief Executive and Chief Financial Officer 
will remain unchanged through the 2024 financial year. 
A salary increase of 3% has been awarded to our Group 
Talent, Culture and Communications Director, which is 
lower than the average wider workforce increase.

Annual Bonus 
Financial metrics – Halma is focused on sustaining 
our companies’ growth and returns over the longer 
term, while delivering strong performance in the 
shorter term. As such, we will continue to use EVA as 
the performance metric for the annual bonus as it is 
aligned with our business model. This will represent 
90% of the overall bonus opportunity.

Non-financial metrics – Positive impact is at the 
heart of our business model and this is why we will 
also continue to use Climate Change and DEI as non-
financial metrics, each representing 5% of the overall 
bonus opportunity. 

The Policy provides flexibility to include non-financial 
measures in both the ESP and the annual bonus, with up 
to 20% of the overall opportunity available to be utilised 
for non-financial measures. Reflecting the continuing 
development of our sustainability approach, we have 
chosen to maintain the 10% weighting on these non-
financial metrics and we will continue to review this 
over the financial year. 

ESP
The 2024 ESP share awards will be granted as normal, 
using Adjusted EPS growth and ROTIC as the performance 
metrics based on stretching performance conditions. 

We will continue to review whether sustainability-linked 
remuneration can be extended to the ESP over time. 

Closing remarks
The Committee’s performance was assessed as part 
of the annual Committee evaluation. I am pleased to 
report that the Committee is regarded as operating 
effectively and that the Board takes assurance from 
the quality of the Committee’s work.

In closing, I would like to thank the Committee for its 
work and support during the year and our shareholders 
for the level and quality of engagement over this last 
year. Thanks also to our executive team for their decisive 
leadership and continued efforts to deliver exceptional 
value to our stakeholders. As Andrew retires on 30 June, 
I would like to thank him for the invaluable support 
he provided in my role as Committee Chair. He will 
be greatly missed and I wish him the very best for 
the future.

I hope that you find this report helpful and look forward 
to your support of the Remuneration Report resolution 
at the AGM.

5  ESP: Figures relate to awards vesting based on performance to the years ended 31 March 2023 and 2022. For the award vesting for the year ended 31 March 2023,

of 2156p. For the award vesting for the year ended 31 March 2022, these figures have been revised from last year’s report to reflect the actual share price on the 
vesting date of 2011p. Table shows total vestings and dividend equivalents in 2023 and 2022 respectively for: Andrew - £37,349 and £20,477, Marc - £20,707 and

from the Board on 30 June 2023 (“Retirement Date”). On this basis and in accordance with his service agreement, 
Andrew Williams will continue to be paid in line with the Remuneration Policy until his retirement and he will:

• continue to be paid a salary of £900,000 until Retirement Date.
• remain eligible to receive a bonus payable in June 2023, in respect of the 2023 financial year, that has just

• not be paid a bonus for the 2024 financial year. 
• not receive an ESP award in June 2023.

Incentive outcomes for 2023 (audited) 
Annual bonus in respect of 2023
In 2023, the maximum bonus opportunity for the Group Chief Executive was 200% and 180% of salary for the CEO 
Designate, Chief Financial Officer and the Group Talent, Culture and Communications Director. 

Annual bonus for all Executive Directors was linked to performance based on the three metrics below: 

• Economic Value Added (EVA) – Performance against a weighted average target of EVA for the past three years, 

representing 90% of overall bonus opportunity.

• Diversity, Equity and Inclusion (DEI) – Gender balance on the boards of Halma companies, representing 5% of overall 

bonus opportunity.

• Climate Change – Annual improvement in energy productivity (Revenue / energy consumed), representing 5% of 

overall bonus opportunity.

The Committee felt that the targets were demanding, appropriate and material to stakeholder value. 

Operating company directors and other sector and central senior management participate in bonus arrangements 
similar to those established for senior executives.

EVA calculation:
Bonuses for the Executive Directors are calculated based on Group profit exceeding a target calculated from the 
profits for the three preceding financial years after charging a cost of capital, including on the cost of acquisitions. 
As the EVA for each year is utilised for a further three years in the comparator calculations, Executives must 
consider the medium-term interests of the Group otherwise there is the potential for an adverse impact on 
their capacity to earn a bonus.

Profit for 
each year at 
constant currency

Minus a 
charge on cost 
of acquisition

Minus a 
charge on working 
capital

Equals the EVA 
for each year

DEI and Climate Change:
The DEI target is based on progress towards our goal of reaching female representation on the boards of Halma 
companies of at least 40% by 31 March 2024. In 2023, maximum payout of 5% of bonus opportunity could have 
been achieved with a gender balance figure of 33% or above and nil payout with a figure lower than 33%.

The Climate Change target is based on achieving a stretching range of annual improvement in Energy Productivity. 
in 2023, there was a straight line payout between the minimum threshold of 4% (our published target) up to a 
maximum threshold of 7%.

Details of both of our non-financial targets for the 2023 financial year are set out in the tables below:

Deferred bonus awards will be granted under the ESP in June 2023. These awards will not be subject to any further 
performance conditions and will ordinarily vest in full on the second anniversary of the date of grant. Full details 
will be provided in next year’s Annual Remuneration Report.

Executive Share Plan (ESP): 2020 Awards (vesting at the end of the year to 31 March 2023)
In July 2020, the Executive Directors received awards of performance shares under the ESP. The performance targets 
for these ESP awards were set to reflect the impact of the COVID pandemic on business forecasts at the time of 
grant and are set out below. The vesting criteria are 50% EPS-related and 50% ROTIC-related.

Performance conditions for these awards are as follows:

Vested awards are net settled, with the appropriate reduction in shares made to cover the employee tax and social 
security liability at vesting. Awards normally lapse if they do not vest on the third anniversary of their award. These 
awards are subject to a two-year post-vesting holding period. Dividend equivalents accrue over the vesting period 
and are paid in cash at the end of the vesting period, and only on those shares that vest. 

In line with regulations, the values disclosed above and in the single total figure of remuneration table on page 143 
capture the number of interests vesting for performance to 31 March 2023. As the market price on the date of 
vesting is unknown at the time of reporting, the values are estimated using the average market value over the 
three-month period to 31 March 2023 of 2156p. The actual values at vesting will be trued-up in the next Annual 
Remuneration Report.

Implementation of the Policy for the year to 31 March 2024
Base Salary, effective 1 June 2023
In line with our historically conservative approach to remuneration, salaries for our Group Chief Executive and 
Chief Financial Officer will remain unchanged through the 2024 financial year, with next salary reviews carried out 
with effect from 1 June 2024. A salary increase of 3% (lower than the wider workforce increase) has been awarded 
to our Group Talent, Culture and Communications Director.

Andrew Williams retires and steps down from the Board on 30 June 2023.

Remuneration arrangements for Marc Ronchetti
Marc Ronchetti began his role as CEO Designate on 16 June 2022 on a salary of £700,000 and prior to that he was 
on a salary of £574,000 as Chief Financial Officer. On 1 April 2023, he became Group Chief Executive on a salary 
of £900,000 and he will not be eligible for a salary increase until June 2024. 

The Committee’s decision on salary reflected the fact that Marc’s total remuneration for the next few financial 
years will be substantially lower than Andrew Williams, had he remained in post, assuming the same level of 
performance. Marc’s remuneration was discussed with shareholders as part of consultation. They agreed the 
package was not excessive and no concerns were raised.

The maximum employer pension contribution rate for UK employees is 10.5% of salary, along with a generous 
contribution structure, benefiting our lowest paid the most. 

Pension cash supplements for Executive Directors will be 10.5% of salary in line with the maximum rate offered 
to UK employees.

Annual bonus
The maximum annual bonus opportunity for 2024 is 200% of salary for the Group Chief Executive and 180% of 
salary for the other Executive Directors. One third of the bonus earned will be deferred into a share award which 
vests in full after two years. Bonus payments will be subject to malus and clawback during a period of three years 
from the date of payment.

Bonuses for 2024 will be based on EVA performance against a weighted average target of EVA for the past three 
years. We will also continue to use the two non-financial targets on Diversity, Equity and Inclusion (DEI) and Climate 
Change. The weightings for EVA performance, DEI and Climate Change will be 90%, 5% and 5% respectively.

For DEI, we remain committed to our stretch target of achieving at least 40% gender balance on our company 
boards by March 2024 and you can find more details on this on pages 67.

The Climate Change target is based on achieving a stretching range of Energy Productivity improvement, linked 
to our published target of 4% straight line annual improvement from the 2022 financial year. The target requires 
progress to be made from the 2023 result. Further details can be found on pages 78 and 79 of the Sustainability 
section and page 87 of the TCFD Statement.

As financial targets are commercially sensitive, they are not disclosed at this time but will be in next year’s 
Annual Report on Remuneration.

The Remuneration Committee must be satisfied that Halma’s underlying performance over the financial year 
justifies the payout. When making this judgement the Committee has scope to consider such factors as it deems 
relevant. The Committee believes that this approach will ensure fairness to both shareholders and participants.

The performance share awards will be subject to an Adjusted EPS growth performance target for 50% of the award 
and a ROTIC target for 50% of the award measured over the three financial years 2023, 2024 and 2025. In line with 
the current accounting treatment for Software as a Service (SaaS) investments under IAS 38, we will include the

Chair and non-executive Director fees
A review of the non-executive Directors’ fees was carried out in January 2023 and the Board made a decision not to 
make any changes. A market review was carried out in respect of our Chair’s fee, which was subsequently increased 
with effect from January 2023. Fees are subject to an annual review in January.

Option A was chosen again this year as it is the most statistically accurate method, considered best practice by the 
Government, in line with shareholder expectations and is directly comparable to the Chief Executive’s remuneration. 
This method requires calculation of pay and benefits for all UK employees using the same methodology that is used 
to calculate the Group Chief Executive’s single figure per the table on page 143.

Commentary
We are satisfied that the median pay ratio reported this year is consistent with our wider pay, reward and 
progression policies for employees. 

The Group Chief Executive is remunerated predominantly on performance-related elements (bonus and share awards), 
based on the delivery of strong returns. Compared to last year, the Chief Executive’s single figure has increased as a 
result of the higher base salary and vesting percentage for the 2020 award, compared to the 2019 award. However, 
this increase has been partially offset by the lower bonus outturn. In contrast, there has been a higher increase of 
employee total pay at the 25th, 50th and 75th percentiles, resulting in lower Group Chief Executive pay ratio figures 
for the year, compared to last year.

Directors’ pensions (audited)
Andrew Williams is the only UK Executive Director who is a deferred member of the defined benefit section of the 
Halma Group Pension Plan. This benefit is a funded final salary occupational pension plan registered with HMRC, 
providing a maximum pension of two thirds of final pensionable salary after 25 or more years’ service at normal 
pension age (60). 

Up to 5 April 2006, final pensionable salary was the greatest salary of the last three complete tax years immediately 
before retirement or leaving service. From 6 April 2011, final pensionable salary was capped at £139,185 and is 
increased annually thereafter by the increase in CPI (£174,586 for 2023). 

Bonuses and other fluctuating emoluments and benefits-in-kind are not pensionable nor subject to any pension 
supplement. The Plan also provides a pension in the event of early retirement through ill-health and a dependant’s 
pension of one-half of the member’s prospective pension. 

Early retirement pensions, currently possible from age 55 with the consent of the Company and the trustees of 
the Plan, are subject to actuarial reduction. Pensions in payment increase by 3% per annum for service up to 
5 April 1997, by price inflation (subject to a maximum of 5%) through to 31 March 2007 and 3% thereafter.

The Company closed the Defined Benefit section to future accrual with effect from 1 December 2014 and, in 
April 2014, Andrew Williams chose to cease future service accrual in the Plan in return for a pension supplement 
on his base salary. This supplement was equivalent to a 20% employer contribution plus an additional 6% 
compensatory payment, in line with the enhanced contribution rate offered to other members who were 
in the Defined Benefit section when future accrual was ceased. 

Marc Ronchetti and Jennifer Ward were not members of the Defined Benefit section but are entitled to join the 
Defined Contribution section of the plan. However, until 31 December 2022, due to annual allowance and lifetime 
allowance restrictions, both Jennifer and Marc opted to receive a pension supplement of 18.7% of salary, in lieu 
of the 20% employer contribution that the Company would otherwise pay into their pension.

With effect from 1 January 2023, Executive Directors’ voluntarily lowered their pension supplements to 10.5% 
of salary. 

Steve Gunning, our new Chief Financial Officer is entitled to join the Defined Contribution section of the plan 
but due to lifetime allowance restrictions, he receives a cash-in-lieu pension contribution of 10.5% of salary.

Andrew Williams accrued benefits under the Company’s defined benefit pension plan during the year as follows.

Pay-for-performance
The 10-year graph on the next page shows the Company’s Total Shareholder Return (TSR) performance over the 
10 years to 31 March 2023 as compared to the FTSE 100 index. Over the period indicated, the Company’s TSR was 
386% compared with 74% for the FTSE 100. The table below the graph details the Group Chief Executive’s single 
figure remuneration and actual variable pay outcomes over the same period. 

The FTSE 100 has been selected because the Company believes that the constituent companies of this index are the 
most appropriate for this comparison as they are affected by similar commercial and economic factors to Halma.

The SIP shares are held in trust and become the employee’s, subject to the rules of the plan, after three years. There 
are tax benefits for retaining the shares in the trust for at least five years from award date. Steve Gunning joined 
Halma on 16 January 2023 and will be due SIP shares with effect from 1 October 2023.

There have been no variations to the terms and conditions for share awards during the financial year.

Share Ownership Guidelines
Executive Directors are expected to build a holding in the Company’s shares to a minimum value broadly equivalent 
to their ESP award maximum opportunity: 300% for Group Chief Executive, 250% for Group Chief Financial Officer 
and 200% for other Executive Directors. In addition, Executive Directors are required to hold shares after cessation 
of employment. The requirement is to hold shares to the value of the share ownership guidelines or actual 
shareholding (if lower) for a period of two years post cessation of employment.

The Executive Directors, excluding Marc Ronchetti and Steve Gunning each meet the Share Ownership Guideline 
of holding Company shares to the value of their award sizes. Until such time as this threshold is achieved, Steve 
and Marc are required to retain no less than 50% of the net of tax value of any vested conditional share or deferred 
share awards. There are no other non-beneficial interests of Directors. There were no changes in Directors’ interests 
from 1 April 2023 to 15 June 2023.

Consideration of conditions elsewhere in the Group
The Committee considers the remuneration and employment conditions elsewhere in the Group when determining 
remuneration for Executive Directors. In addition to the employee engagement detailed on page 66, we have 
established a mean gender pay gap figure for our UK and US companies and the CEO pay ratio is available to 
employees. As part of Committee/workforce engagement, our non-executive Directors held sessions with a cross-
section of employees on site visits to our companies. A breakfast meeting was also held with selected employees 
at Accelerate Halma, our group-wide leadership conference, held in October 2022. At these sessions there were 
productive conversations on the role of Remuneration Committee, executive and employee remuneration and a 
range of other topics including job satisfaction and company culture. 

Consideration of shareholder views
When determining remuneration, the Committee takes into account the views of our shareholders and ‘best practice’ 
guidelines set by shareholder representative bodies.

The Committee actively engaged with shareholders to understand the reasons behind our 2022 AGM voting 
outcomes. Letters were sent to our major shareholders, proxy agencies and shareholder organisations. Meetings 
were held with the shareholders representing circa 30% of share capital. A meeting was also held with Glass Lewis. 
See pages 138 and 139 for further details on these discussions.

The Remuneration Committee also seeks ongoing advice from its external advisers on wider shareholder views, 
to ensure that it is kept up to date with any changes in market practice and shareholder sentiment.

Directors’ Remuneration Policy

This section of the Report sets out our Policy in detail. The current Policy for Executive Directors came into effect 
from 22 July 2021, the date of the 2021 AGM and remains unchanged. The Committee intends that the Policy will 
operate for three years.

Principles underpinning our Policy
These principles are:

• A strong pay for performance culture, focusing on the long-term success of the organisation and the alignment 

to business strategy.

• A balance of focus on growth and returns ensuring the creation of shareholder value.
• A dedication to attracting, retaining and motivating the right quality of talent, acknowledging the Halma DNA.
• A focus on being a good corporate citizen in line with our culture, the 2018 Corporate Governance code and market 

best practice.

Policy Review Focus Areas
The areas which the Committee focused on in respect of the 2021 Policy review were:

Shareholder 
alignment
•  Increase to shareholding 
guidelines aligned to 
the increase in 
incentive quantum.

•  Introduction of a two-year 

post-cessation shareholding 
requirement and enhanced 
Malus and Clawback terms.

Pension 

Sustainability 

Quantum reset 

•  Benefit improvement for 

UK employees.

•  Alignment of Executive 
Director offering to the 
wider workforce.

•  No immediate change in 
performance metrics.

•  Flexibility incorporated into 
the Annual Bonus and ESP

the future.

•  Ensuring robust 

succession planning.
•  Addressing compression 
and retention issues.

How the Policy addresses the factors set out in provision 40 of the 2018 UK Corporate Governance Code
The table below shows how the Policy addresses each of the factors set out in provision 40 of the 2018 UK Corporate 
Governance Code. 

Clarity

Simplicity

We ensure pay for performance and our policy is designed to be logical and transparent. We believe this is clearly 
communicated to and understood by our stakeholders and participants.

Remuneration for Executive Directors is comprised of distinct elements: fixed pay, annual bonus award and the 
long-term incentive award.

Risk

A number of features within the Remuneration Policy exist to manage different kinds of risks; these include: 

•  Malus and clawback provisions operating across all incentive plans.
•  The introduction of a post-cessation shareholding requirement.
•  Deferral of remuneration and holding periods.
•  Remuneration Committee discretion to override formulaic outturns to ensure incentive pay-outs reflect 

underlying business performance and shareholder experience.

•  Limits on awards specified within the policy and plan rules.

Predictability

Target ranges and potential maximum payments under each element of remuneration are disclosed. 

The Committee regularly reviews the performance of the inflight awards, so it understands the likely outcomes.

Proportionality

The Committee believes that poor performance should not be rewarded. Therefore, a significant portion of 
remuneration is performance based and requires achievement against challenging performance targets.

Alignment 
to Culture

Our business is performance orientated and our remuneration structure is appropriately aligned to our culture, 
with performance measures for variable awards being aligned to the Company’s wider strategy.

The Remuneration Policy table
The table below summarises the key components of the Policy:

Fixed Pay: Salary

Purpose and link 
to strategy

A fair, fixed remuneration reflecting the size and scope of the executive’s responsibilities which attracts 
and retains high calibre talent necessary for the delivery of the Group’s strategy.

Operation

Reviewed annually or following a material change in responsibilities. Salary is benchmarked to market median 
levels periodically against appropriate comparators of a similar size and operating in a similar sector and is 
linked to individual performance and contribution.

Maximum  
Opportunity

Salary is the only element of remuneration that is pensionable.

Base salary increases will be applied in line with the outcome of annual reviews (normally with effect from 
1 June). Salaries for the financial year under review (and the following year) are disclosed in the Annual Report 
on Remuneration. Salary increases for Executive Directors will not normally exceed the average of the wider 
employee population other than in exceptional circumstances. Where increases are awarded in excess of the 
wider employee population, for example where there is a material change in the responsibility, size or complexity 
of the role, the Committee will provide the rationale in the relevant year’s Annual Report on Remuneration.

Performance metrics Not Applicable.

Fixed Pay: Benefits

Purpose and link  
to strategy

Operation

To provide benefits that are competitive within the relevant market.

Benefits are appropriate to the location of the Director and typically comprise (but are not limited to) 
a company car, life insurance, permanent disability insurance, private medical insurance, relocation 
and tax advice for international assignments.

Maximum  
Opportunity

Benefits may vary by role, and the level is determined to be appropriate for the role and circumstances of 
each individual Director. The maximum value will equate to the reasonable market cost of such benefits.

The Committee retains the discretion to approve a higher cost of benefits in exceptional circumstances 
(eg. relocation expenses or an expatriation allowance on recruitment, etc) or in circumstances where 
factors outside the Company’s control have changed materially (eg market increases in insurance costs).

The rationale behind the exercise of such discretion will be provided in the relevant year’s Annual Report 
on Remuneration.

Performance metrics Not Applicable.

Fixed Pay: Pension

Purpose and link  
to strategy

To provide competitive post-retirement benefits, or the cash allowance equivalent, to provide the 
opportunity for executives to save for their retirement.

Operation

Executive Directors participate in a Group Defined Contribution pension plan.

Maximum  
Opportunity

Cash supplements in lieu of Company pension contributions may be made to some individuals at a level 
dependent upon seniority and length of service. Cash supplements may be reduced to reflect the additional 
employer social costs thereon. To the extent the pension contributions exceed the local tax allowance, the 
contributions may be paid to the executive, subject to taxes and social charges.

Some executives are deferred members of the Group Defined Benefit pension plan, which closed to future 
accrual in December 2014

Defined Contribution: maximum contribution of 10.5%.

Cash supplement: Halma contributes up to 10.5% of salary. Defined Contribution/Money Purchase members 
whose contributions exceed the local tax allowance are paid the excess contributions, on pensionable salary, 
as a cash supplement, net of employer social costs.

Defined benefit: now closed to future accrual, but provides a maximum pension equivalent to two thirds of 
final pensionable salary, up to a CPI-indexed cap: £169,337 for 2022 and £174,586 for 2023.

Performance metrics Not Applicable.

Directors’ Remuneration Policy continued

Annual Bonus

Purpose and link  
to strategy

To incentivise and focus management on the achievement of objective annual targets which are set to 
support the short to medium-term strategy of the Group.

Operation

The structure of the Annual Bonus is reviewed at the start of the year to ensure that the performance measures 
and their weightings remain appropriately aligned with the Group’s strategy and are sufficiently challenging.

Performance targets are calibrated and set at the start of the year, with reference to a range of relevant 
reference points including the annual budget agreed by the Board. At the end of the year, the Committee 
determines the extent to which these targets have been achieved.

Payment of one third of any bonus is in the form of an award of shares that is deferred for two years.

Dividend equivalents accrue over the vesting period. Dividend equivalents are paid in cash or shares at the 
end of the vesting period.

Deferral into shares provides a link to the long-term strategy of the Group and enhances the retentiveness of 
the policy. A recovery and withholding provision enables the Company to recoup overpayments either through 
withholding future remuneration or requiring the executive to repay the requisite amount in the event of 
misstatement, error or misconduct; serious reputational damage to the business by the individual; and/or 
a breach of the company code of conduct.

Maximum  
Opportunity

Maximum opportunity: 200% of salary for Group CEO, 180% for other Executive Directors. Bonus payable 
at threshold: 0% of salary.

The Committee can exercise discretion to override the formulaic bonus outcome within the limits of the scheme 
where it believes the outcome is not truly reflective of performance and to ensure fairness to both shareholders 
and participants.

Performance metrics The bonus is based on the achievement of financial performance targets, including Economic Value Added 

(EVA). Other financial measures may supplement EVA at the discretion of the Committee.

Such financial measures must comprise at least 80% of the overall bonus opportunity.

The balance of 20% may be utilised, at the Committee’s discretion, to support non-financial, but measurable, 
strategic growth priorities.

Long Term incentive: Executive Share Plan (ESP)

Purpose and link  
to strategy

Operation

To incentivise executives to achieve superior returns to shareholders over a three-year period rewarding 
them for sustained performance against challenging long-term targets; to retain key individuals and align 
interests with shareholders, reflecting the sustainability of the business model over the long term and the 
creation of shareholder value.

Executive Directors are granted annual awards over Halma plc shares or a cash equivalent where required by 
regulations as determined by the Committee; awards vest after a period of at least three years based on 
Group performance.

Dividend equivalents accrue over the vesting period. Dividend equivalents are paid in cash or shares at the end 
of the vesting period, and only on those shares which vest.

A recovery and withholding provision enables the Company to recoup overpayments either through withholding 
future remuneration or requiring the executive to repay the requisite amount in the event of misstatement, error 
or misconduct; serious reputational damage to the business by the individual; and/or a breach of the company 
code of conduct.

A mandatory two-year holding period applies for awards granted after the 2018 AGM.

Maximum  
Opportunity

Maximum opportunity: Up to 300% of salary for Group CEO, 250% of salary for Group CFO and 200% of salary 
for other Executive Directors.

The Committee can exercise discretion to override the formulaic ESP outcome within the limits of the scheme 
where it believes the outcome is not truly reflective of performance and to ensure fairness to both shareholders 
and participants and will ensure formulaic outturns do not result in windfall gains.

Threshold performance will result in the vesting of 25% of the maximum award

Performance metrics Vesting of performance share awards is subject to continued employment and the Company’s performance 

over a three-year performance period.

Financial measures must comprise at least 80% of the overall ESP opportunity.

The balance of 20% may be utilised, at the Committee’s discretion, to support non-financial, but measurable, 
strategic growth priorities.

Share Incentive Plan (SIP)

Purpose and link  
to strategy

Operation

Maximum  
Opportunity

To encourage share ownership across all UK-based employees using HMRC-approved schemes

The SIP is an HMRC-approved arrangement. It entitles all eligible UK-based employees to receive Halma shares 
in a potentially tax advantageous manner.

Participation limits are in line with those set by HMRC from time to time.

Performance metrics Not applicable.

Share Ownership Guideline

Purpose and link  
to strategy

Operation

Align Executive Directors’ interests with those of long-term interests of shareholders.

Executive Directors are expected to build a holding in the Company’s shares to a minimum value broadly 
equivalent to their ESP award maximum opportunity: 300% for CEO, 250% for CFO and 200% for other 
Executive Directors.

In addition, Executive Directors required to hold shares after cessation of employment. The requirement is 
to hold shares to the value of the share ownership guidelines or actual shareholding (if lower) for a period 
of two years post cessation of employment.

Maximum  
Opportunity

Progress towards the share ownership guideline is monitored on an annual basis.

No maximum holding but requirement to build to minimum value.

Performance metrics Not applicable.

Notes to the Policy Table
Differences in remuneration for employees
The remuneration policy for the Executive Directors is more heavily weighted towards variable and share-based 
pay than for other employees, to make a greater part of their pay conditional on the successful delivery of business 
strategy. This aims to create a clear link between the value created for shareholders and the remuneration received 
by the Executive Directors.

However, the pension arrangements for the current Executive Directors are currently in the process of being aligned 
on the same terms as those offered to eligible UK employees. All UK-based employees have the opportunity to 
participate in the Share Incentive Plan.

Payments from Existing Awards
The Committee will honour any commitment entered into, and Executive Directors will be eligible to receive payment 
from any award made, prior to the approval and implementation of the Policy. Details of these awards are disclosed 
in the Annual Report on Remuneration.

Selection of Performance Measures
The performance measures used in Halma’s executive incentives have been selected to ensure incentives are 
challenging and reinforce the Group’s strategy and align executive interests closely with those of our shareholders.

In the annual bonus, the use of EVA, in summary, profit less a charge for capital employed (definition is provided 
on page 145) reinforces the Group’s business objective to double every five years through a mix of acquisitions 
and organic growth. Profit is a function of the extent to which the Company has achieved both its organic 
growth target and its success in identifying appropriate acquisition targets in current and past years. Ensuring 
that the cost of funding acquisitions is reflected in the bonus model means that executives share the benefit 
of an acquisition that outperforms expectations, but equally bear the cost of overpaying for an acquisition. 
Good or poor management of working capital is also reflected in the calculation of EVA.

Positive impact is at the heart of our business model and this is why we include Diversity, Equity and Inclusion and 
Climate Change as non-financial metrics in our annual bonus. Following our success in increasing gender diversity 
at the Halma and Executive Boards, our current focus is on increasing gender diversity on our company boards. 
Action on climate change is an important part of us delivering on our purpose to grow a safer, cleaner, healthier 
future for everyone, every day and reducing our own emissions is a key priority for us, with year-on-year 
improvement in energy productivity as our target. 

In the ESP, EPS provides a disciplined focus on increasing profitability and thereby provides close shareholder alignment 
through incentivising shareholder value creation, and ROTIC reinforces the focus on capital efficiency and delivery of 
strong returns, thereby further strengthening the alignment of remuneration with the Group strategy.

Directors’ Remuneration Policy continued

Performance targets are set to be stretching yet achievable, considering the Company’s strategic priorities and the 
economic environment in which it operates. Targets are calibrated considering a range of reference points but are 
based primarily on the Group’s strategic plan.

Malus and Clawback
The Committee believes that it is appropriate for all variable pay awards to be subject to provisions that allow it to 
recover any value delivered (or which would otherwise be delivered) in connection with any variable award including 
annual incentive and ESP awards in exceptional circumstances, and where it believes that the value of those 
variable pay awards is no longer appropriate.

Malus provisions apply before payment and clawback provisions are in place following payment of the annual 
bonus (or vesting of any element of annual bonus deferred into an award over shares) or vesting of any ESP award.

The malus and clawback provisions can be used in certain scenarios. Such scenarios include but are not limited to:

• material misstatement of the Company’s financial accounts;
• a material failure of risk management by the Company or any Group company;
• an error in calculation of any awards based on false or misleading information;
• gross misconduct by the relevant participant; and
• any action or omission on the part of a participant resulting in serious reputational damage to the Company, 
any member of the Group; a serious breach or non-observance of any code of conduct, policy or procedure 
operated by the Group.

Illustrations of the application of the Policy
The following charts provide an estimate of the potential future rewards for Executive Directors, and the 
potential split between different elements of pay, under three different performance scenarios: “Fixed”,  
“On-target” and “Maximum”.

Andrew Williams retires and steps down from the Board on 30 June 2023 and as such his future rewards are not 
included in the charts below.

Potential reward opportunities are based on the Policy, applied to salaries as at 1 June 2023. The projected values 
exclude the impact of any share price movements and dividend equivalents.

The “Fixed” scenario shows base salary, pension and benefits only.

The “On-target” scenario shows fixed remuneration as above, plus a target level of 50% of the maximum under 
the annual bonus and vesting of 50% of a single year’s award under the ESP.

The “Maximum” scenario reflects fixed remuneration, plus maximum level of annual bonus and ESP awards.

Impact of share price
Long-term incentive awards in the ESP are granted in shares and as such the value can vary significantly depending

External appointments
In the case of appointing a new Executive Director, the Committee may make use of any of the existing elements of 
remuneration, as follows:

Component

Approach

Salary

The base salaries of new appointees will be determined by reference to relevant market data, experience and skills of the 
individual, internal relativities and the current salary of any incumbent in the same role.
Where a new appointee has an initial base salary set below market, the Committee may make phased increases over a 
period of several years to achieve the desired position, subject to the individual’s development and performance in the role.

Benefits New appointees will be eligible to receive benefits in line with the current Policy, as well as expatriation allowances 

and any necessary expenses relating to an executive’s relocation on appointment.

Pension

New appointees will be eligible to participate in the Company’s defined contribution/money purchase arrangements, 
receive a cash supplement or local equivalent.

Annual 
bonus

The scheme as described in the Policy Table will apply to new appointees with the relevant maximum being pro-rated to 
reflect the proportion of the year employed.

ESP

SIP

New appointees will be granted performance awards under the ESP on the same terms as other executives, as described 
in the Policy Table.

New appointees in the UK will be eligible to participate on identical terms to other employees.

In addition to the elements of remuneration set out in the Policy Table, in exceptional circumstances the 
Committee may consider it appropriate to grant an incentive award under a different structure in order to 
facilitate the recruitment of an individual or to replace incentive arrangements forfeited on leaving a previous 
employer. In making such awards, the Committee will look to replicate the arrangements being forfeited as 
closely as possible and in doing so consider relevant factors including any performance conditions attached 
to these awards, the payment mechanism, expected value and the remaining vesting period of these awards.

Internal Appointments
Remuneration for new Executive Directors appointed by way of internal promotion will similarly be determined in 
line with the policy for external appointees, as detailed above. Where an individual has contractual commitments 
made prior to their promotion to the Board, the Company will continue to honour those commitments. Incentive 
opportunities for employees below Board level are generally no higher than for Executive Directors, and incentive 
measures vary to ensure they are appropriate.

Executive Director service contracts and exit payment policies
It is the Company’s policy that Executive Directors should have contracts with an indefinite term providing 
for a maximum of one year’s notice. The details of the Directors’ contracts are summarised in the table below. 
Contracts will be available for inspection at the AGM and throughout the year at the Company’s registered office.

The Company’s policy is to limit payments on cessation to pre-established contractual arrangements. In the event 
that the employment of an Executive Director is terminated, any amount payable will be determined in accordance 
with the terms of the service contract between the Company and the employee, as well as the rules of any incentive 
plans. No predetermined amount is provided for in the Directors’ contracts. The UK Executive Director contracts 
enable the Company to pay up to one year’s salary in lieu of notice, with no contractual entitlement to any other 
benefits, and, under the rules, the Remuneration Committee may determine the individual’s leaving status for 
share plan vesting purposes.

If the financial year end has passed, any bonus earned is payable to the individual.

External directorships
The Committee acknowledges that Executive Directors may be invited to become independent non-executive 
Directors of other listed companies which have no business relationship with the Company and that these roles 
can broaden their experience and knowledge to Halma’s benefit.

Executive Directors are permitted to accept one such appointment with the prior approval of the Chair. Approval 
will only be given where the appointment does not present a conflict of interest with the Group’s activities and the 
wider exposure gained will be beneficial to the development of the individual. Where fees are payable in respect of 
such appointments, these are retained by the Executive Director.

Fees are normally reviewed annually. Increases are typically effective from 1 January.
The fee paid to the Chair is determined by the Committee and fees to non-executive Directors are determined 
by the Board. The fees are calculated by reference to market levels and take account of the time commitment 
and the responsibilities of the non-executive Directors.
These fees are the sole element of non-executive remuneration and they are not eligible for participation in

Directors’ Report

The Directors present their report on the affairs of 
the Company, together with the audited financial 
statements and Independent Auditors’ Report, for 
the year ended 31 March 2023.

Activities
The Company’s principal activity is to act as a holding 
company. The Company is incorporated and domiciled 
in England and Wales. A list of its subsidiary companies 
is set out on pages 245 to 250. Subsidiaries of the 
Company have established branches in a number of 
different countries in which they operate. As permitted 
under section 414C (11) of the Companies Act 2006, 
the information set out below, which forms part of this 
Directors’ Report and is incorporated by reference, can 
be located in the Strategic Report on pages 2 to 102:

• Future developments in the Group’s business.
• Activities of the Group in the field of research 

and development.

• Environmental matters, including greenhouse 

gas emissions.

Dividends
The Directors’ recommend a final dividend of 12.34p per 
share and, if approved, the dividend will be paid on 
18 August 2023 to ordinary shareholders on the register 
at the close of business on 14 July 2023. Together with 
the interim dividend of 7.86p per share already paid, this 
will make a total dividend of 20.20p (2022: 18.88p) per 
share for the financial year.

Political donations
In-line with our Group Anti-Bribery and Corruption 
Policy, the Group did not make any political donations 
or incur any political expenditure during the year.

Directors and Directors’ interests
The Directors of the Company as at the date of this 
Report, together with their biographical details, are 
shown on pages 106 and 107. The Remuneration Report 
on page 153 provides details of the interests of each 
Director in the shares of the Company.

Liability insurance and indemnities
The Company has agreed to indemnify, to the extent 
permitted by law, each of the Company’s Directors 
against any liability incurred in respect of acts or 
omissions arising in the course of their office. Each 
Director is covered by appropriate Directors’ and 
Officers’ liability insurance, at the Company’s expense.

Financial risk management objectives and policies 
Disclosures relating to financial risk management 
objectives and policies are set out in note 27 to the 
financial statements and along with exposures relating 
to price risk, credit risk, liquidity risk and cash flow risk.

  Halma plc |  Annual Report and Accounts 2023

Share capital and capital structure
Details of the share capital, together with details of the 
movements in the share capital during the year, are 
shown in note 23 to the accounts. The Company has 
one class of ordinary shares which carry no right to 
fixed income. Each share carries the right to one vote 
at general meetings of the Company.

There are no other classes of share capital. There are no 
specific restrictions on the size of a holding nor on the 
transfer of shares, with both governed by the general 
provisions of the Company’s Articles of Association and 
prevailing legislation. No person has any special rights of 
control over the Company’s share capital and all issued 
shares are fully paid.

Rights and obligations of ordinary shares
Holders of ordinary shares are entitled to attend and 
speak at general meetings of the Company and to 
appoint one or more proxies or, if the holder of shares 
is a corporation, one or more corporate representatives. 
On a show of hands, each holder of ordinary shares who 
(being an individual) is present in person or (being a 
corporation) is present by a duly appointed corporate 
representative, not themselves being a member, shall 
have one vote, as shall proxies (unless they are 
appointed by more than one holder, in which case 
they may vote both for and against the resolution in 
accordance with the holders’ instructions). On a poll, 
every holder of ordinary shares present in person or by 
proxy shall have one vote for every share of which they 
are the holder.

Electronic and paper proxy appointments and voting 
instructions must be received not later than 48 hours 
before the meeting.

A holder of ordinary shares can lose the entitlement to 
vote at general meetings where that holder has been 
served with a disclosure notice and has failed to provide 
the Company with information concerning interests held 
in those shares. Except as set out above and as permitted 
under applicable statutes, there are no limitations on 
voting rights of holders of a given percentage, number 
of votes or deadlines for exercising voting rights.

The Company has established an Employee Benefit Trust 
and the trustee has waived its right to vote and its right 
to all dividends.

Restrictions on transfer of shares
The Directors may refuse to register a transfer of a 
certificated share that is not fully paid, provided that 
the refusal does not prevent dealings in shares in the 
Company from taking place on an open and proper 
basis or, where the Company has a lien over that share. 
The Directors may also refuse to register a transfer of a 
certificated share unless the instrument of transfer is: 
(i) lodged, duly stamped (if necessary), at the registered 
office of the Company or any other place as the Board 
may decide accompanied by the certificate for the 
share(s) to be transferred and/or such other evidence as 
the Directors may reasonably require to show the right

of the transferor to make the transfer; (ii) in respect of 
only one class of shares; (iii) in favour of a person who 
is not a minor, infant, bankrupt or a person of unsound 
mind; or (iv) in favour of not more than four 
persons jointly.

Transfers of uncertificated shares must be carried out 
using CREST and the Directors can refuse to register a 
transfer of an uncertificated share in accordance with 
the regulations governing the operation of CREST.

There are no other restrictions on the transfer of 
ordinary shares in the Company except certain 
restrictions which may from time to time be imposed 
by laws and regulations (for example insider trading 
laws); or where a shareholder with at least a 0.25% 
interest in the Company’s certificated shares has been 
served with a disclosure notice and has failed to provide 
the Company with information concerning interests 
in those shares. The Directors are not aware of any 
agreements between holders of the Company’s shares 
that may result in restrictions on the transfer of 
securities or on voting rights.

Employees
An overview of the Board’s engagement with employees 
along with the mechanisms for sharing information and 
taking account of their views in decision making are 
included on page 56 of the Strategic Report and page 
118 of the Governance Report. Aligning the interests of 
employees in the Company’s performance is achieved 
through a variety of share and bonus schemes.

The Company gives full and fair consideration to 
applications of employment from disabled people. 
Training, career development and promotion 
opportunities are equally applied for all our employees, 
regardless of disability. In the event of an existing 
employee becoming disabled, every effort will be 
made to ensure that their employment with the Group 
continues and that appropriate support is provided.

Halma has a group-wide diversity and inclusion policy 
which sets out our commitment that all candidates are 
considered fairly, regardless of their gender, race, age, 
sexual orientation, professional or academic background 
and it is our practice to ensure that there is a diverse 
selection of candidates before we commence the 
assessment process. While appointments are ultimately 
based on merit – taking account of an individual’s 
relevant skills and experience for the role – we recognise 
the strong benefits that a diverse workforce brings. 
Accordingly, we require recruiters to make diversity a 
priority in their selection of potential candidates, which 
ensures that we factor diversity and inclusion into our 
process at the outset.

The work that Halma is doing to improve diversity across 
the Group, along with our open and inclusive culture 
ensures that all candidates are fairly considered for each 
role. Last year, we included a DEI target within executive 
remuneration to further align our drive for a diverse and 
inclusive culture throughout the Group. Our Talent and 

Culture Growth Enabler embodies the importance of DEI 
to Halma’s sustainable growth strategy – see page 31 
and page 66 for more information.

Stakeholder engagement
A description of how the Directors have had regard to 
the need to foster the Company’s business relationships 
with suppliers, customers and others, and the effect of 
Director engagement with our stakeholders, is set out 
on pages 56 to 62. Examples of how the Directors had 
regard to stakeholder interests when making principal 
decisions during the year are set out on pages 64 to 65. 

Appointment and removal of Directors
With regard to the appointment and replacement of 
Directors, the Company is governed by its Articles of 
Association, the UK Corporate Governance Code, the 
Companies Act and related legislation. Directors can 
be appointed by the Company by ordinary resolution 
at a general meeting or by the Board. If a Director is 
appointed by the Board, such a Director will hold office 
until the next Annual General Meeting (AGM) and 
shall then be eligible for election at that meeting. In 
accordance with the Articles of Association and UK 
Corporate Governance Code, each of the Directors, 
being eligible, will offer themselves for election or 
re-election at this year’s AGM. The Company can 
remove a Director from office, including by passing a 
special resolution or by notice being given by all the 
other Directors. The Articles themselves may be 
amended by special resolution of the shareholders.

Powers of Directors
The powers of Directors are set out in the Articles of 
Association and a full list of the matters reserved for 
decision by the Board can be found on our website, 
www.halma.com.

Contracts of significance and change of control 
There are a number of agreements that take effect, 
alter or terminate upon a change of control of the 
Company, principally bank loan agreements, private 
placement debt and employee share plans.

There are two significant agreements, in terms of the 
likely impact on the business of the Group as a whole, 
containing such provisions:

• The £550m syndicated Revolving Credit Facility which, if 
after 30 days of a change of control notice to the loan 
agent, can result in 30 days’ notice being given to the 
Company by any Lender, for all amounts outstanding 
to that Lender, to be immediately due and payable, at 
which time the commitment of that Lender will be 
cancelled. If all of the Lenders give this notice the whole 
facility would be cancelled.

• The US$430m US Private Placement Note Purchase 
Agreement under which, in the event of a change of 
control, the Company is required (within 10 days of a 
change of control) to make an offer to the holders 
of the US Private Placement notes to prepay the 
principal amount of the notes together with 
interest accrued.

Director’s Report continued

The Group has contractual arrangements with a wide 
range of suppliers. The Group is not unduly dependent 
upon contractual arrangements with any particular 
customer. While the loss or disruption to certain of 
these arrangements could temporarily affect the 
Group’s business, none are considered to be essential.

The Company’s share plans contain provisions as a result 
of which awards may vest and become exercisable on a 
change of control of the Company in accordance with 
the rules of the plans.

There are no agreements between the Company, its 
Directors or employees that provide for compensation 
for loss of office or employment that occurs because 
of a takeover bid.

Allotment authority
Under the Companies Act 2006 the Directors may only 
allot shares if authorised by shareholders to do so. At 
the AGM an ordinary resolution will be proposed which, 
if passed, will authorise the Directors to allot and issue 
shares up to an aggregate nominal value of £12,500,000 
(up to 125,000,000 for ordinary shares of 10p each), 
being just less than one third of the issued share 
capital of the Company (excluding treasury shares) 
as at 15 June 2023 (the latest practicable date prior 
to the publication of the Notice of Meeting).

In accordance with the Directors’ stated intention to 
seek annual renewal, the authority will expire at the 
earlier of the conclusion of the AGM of the Company 
in 2024 and 30 September 2024.

Passing this resolution will give the Directors flexibility 
to act in the best interests of shareholders, when 
opportunities arise, by issuing new shares. As at 
15 June 2023, the Company had 379,645,332 
ordinary shares of 10p each in issue.

The Companies Act 2006 also requires that, if the 
Company issues new shares for cash or sells any treasury 
shares, it must first offer them to existing shareholders 
in proportion to their current holdings. At the AGM a 
special resolution will be proposed which, if passed, 
will authorise the Directors to issue a limited number 
of shares for cash and/or sell treasury shares without 
offering them to shareholders first.

The authority is for an aggregate nominal amount of 
up to 10% of the aggregate nominal value of the issued 
share capital of the Company as at 15 June 2023 of 
£3,780,000. The resolution will also modify statutory 
pre-emption rights to deal with legal, regulatory or 
practical problems that may arise on a rights issue or 
other pre-emptive offer or issue. The authority will expire 
at the same time as the resolution conferring authority 
on the Directors to allot shares. The Directors consider 
this authority necessary in order to give them flexibility 
to deal with opportunities as they arise, subject to the 
restrictions contained in the resolution. There are no 
present plans to issue shares.

Purchase of the Company’s own shares
The Company was authorised at the 2022 AGM to 
purchase up to 37,900,000 of its own 10p ordinary shares 
in the market. This authority expires at the earlier of the 
conclusion of the AGM of the Company in 2023 and 
30 September 2023. The Company did not purchase any 
of its own shares under this authority during the year. In 
accordance with the Directors’ stated intention to seek 
annual renewal a special resolution will be proposed at 
the AGM to renew this authority until the earlier of the 
end of the Company’s 2024 AGM and 30 September 
2024, in respect of up to 37,900,000 ordinary shares, 
which is approximately 10% of the Company’s issued 
share capital as at 15 June 2023.

Annual General Meeting
The Company’s AGM will be held on 20 July 2023.

The Notice of Meeting, together with an explanation of 
the proposed resolutions, is enclosed with this Annual 
Report and Accounts and is also available on the 
Company’s website at www.halma.com.

Independent auditors
Each of the persons who is a Director at the date 
of approval of this Annual Report and Accounts 
confirms that:

• So far as the Director is aware, there is no relevant 
audit information of which the Company’s Auditor 
is unaware.

• The Director has taken all the steps that he/she ought 
to have taken as a director in order to make himself/
herself aware of any relevant audit information and to 
establish that the Company’s Auditor is aware of that 
information.

This confirmation is given and should be interpreted in 
accordance with the provisions of Section 418 of the 
Companies Act 2006.

PricewaterhouseCoopers LLP (PwC) has expressed its 
willingness to continue in office as Independent Auditor 
and a resolution to appoint PwC will be proposed at the 
forthcoming AGM.

Our financial position remains robust with 
committed facilities at the balance sheet date 
totalling approximately £931m which includes a 
£550m Revolving Credit Facility (RCF). The undrawn 
committed facilities as at 31st March 2023 amounted

now matures in May 2028, the first of two one-year 
extension options having been exercised post year-end. 
During May 2022, the Group also entered into a new 
Note Purchase Agreement which provided access to 
loan notes totalling £330m, which were drawn in various 
currencies in July 2022. The financial covenants across 
the facilities are for leverage (net debt/adjusted EBITDA) 
of not more than three and a half times and for 
adjusted interest cover of not less than four times

Going concern statement
The Group’s business activities, together with the 
main trends and factors likely to affect its future 
development, performance and position, and the 
financial position of the Group as at 31 March 2023, 
its cash flows, liquidity position and borrowing facilities 
are set out in the Strategic Report. In addition, note 27 
contains further information concerning the security, 
currency, interest rates and maturity of the 
Group’s borrowings.

The financial statements have been prepared on a going 
concern basis. In adopting the going concern basis the 
Directors have considered all of the above factors, 
including potential scenarios and its principal risks set 
out on page 91 to 97. Under the potential scenarios 
considered, which includes a severe but plausible 
downside scenario, the Group remains within its debt 
facilities and the attached financial covenants for the 
foreseeable future and the Directors therefore believe, 
at the time of approving the financial statements, that 
the Company is well placed to manage its business risks 
successfully and remains a going concern. The key facts 
and assumptions in reaching this determination are 
summarised below.

The base case scenario has been prepared using 
forecasts from each operating company as well as 
cash outflows on acquisitions in line with pre COVID 
pandemic levels. In addition, a severe but plausible 
downside scenario has been modelled showing a 
decline in trading for the year ending 31 March 2024. 
This reduction in trading could be caused by events 
such as a significant resurgence in the COVID pandemic 
lockdowns beyond China or continued macroeconomic 
volatility leading to further inflation and interest rate 
increases. In mitigating the impacts of the downside 
scenario there are actions that can be taken which are 
entirely discretionary to the business such as reducing 
acquisition spend and dividend growth rates. In addition, 
the Group has demonstrated strong resilience and 
flexibility to manage its overheads and adapt its supply 
chains during the COVID pandemic and more recent 
global economic uncertainty.

Neither the base case nor severe but plausible downside 
scenarios result in a breach of the Group’s available debt 
facilities or the attached covenants and, accordingly, 
the Directors believe there is no material uncertainty 
in the use of the going concern assumption and, 
therefore, deem it appropriate to continue to adopt 
the going concern basis of accounting for at least 
the next 12-month period.

Statement of directors’ responsibilities in respect of the 
financial statements

The directors are responsible for preparing the Annual 
Report and the financial statements in accordance with 
applicable law and regulation.

Company law requires the directors to prepare financial 
statements for each financial year. Under that law the 
directors have prepared the Group financial statements 
in accordance with UK-adopted international accounting 
standards and the company financial statements in 
accordance with United Kingdom Generally Accepted 
Accounting Practice (United Kingdom Accounting 
Standards, comprising FRS 101 “Reduced Disclosure 
Framework”, and applicable law).

Under company law, directors must not approve the 
financial statements unless they are satisfied that they 
give a true and fair view of the state of affairs of the 
Group and company and of the profit or loss of the 
Group for that period. In preparing the financial 
statements, the directors are required to:

• select suitable accounting policies and then apply 

them consistently;

• state whether applicable UK-adopted international 

accounting standards have been followed for the Group 
financial statements and United Kingdom Accounting 
Standards, comprising FRS 101 have been followed for 
the company financial statements, subject to any 
material departures disclosed and explained in the 
financial statements;

Directors’ confirmations
The directors consider that the Annual Report and 
accounts, taken as a whole, is fair, balanced and 
understandable and provides the information necessary 
for shareholders to assess the Group’s and company’s 
position and performance, business model and strategy.

Each of the directors, whose names and functions 
are listed on pages 106 and 107 confirm that, to the best 
of their knowledge:

• the Group financial statements, which have been 

prepared in accordance with UK-adopted international 
accounting standards, give a true and fair view of the 
assets, liabilities, financial position and profit of 
the Group;

• the company financial statements, which have 

been prepared in accordance with United Kingdom 
Accounting Standards, comprising FRS 101, give a 
true and fair view of the assets, liabilities and financial 
position of the company; and

• the Strategic Report and the Directors’ Report includes 
a fair review of the development and performance 
of the business and the position of the Group and 
company, together with a description of the principal 
risks and uncertainties that it faces.

In the case of each director in office at the date the 
directors’ report is approved:

• make judgements and accounting estimates that are 

• so far as the director is aware, there is no relevant 

reasonable and prudent; and

• prepare the financial statements on the going concern 
basis unless it is inappropriate to presume that the 
Group and company will continue in business.

The directors are responsible for safeguarding the 
assets of the Group and company and hence for taking 
reasonable steps for the prevention and detection of 
fraud and other irregularities.

The directors are also responsible for keeping adequate 
accounting records that are sufficient to show and 
explain the Group’s and company’s transactions and 
disclose with reasonable accuracy at any time the 
financial position of the Group and company and 
enable them to ensure that the financial statements 
and the Directors’ Remuneration Report comply with 
the Companies Act 2006.

The directors are responsible for the maintenance 
and integrity of the company’s website. Legislation 
in the United Kingdom governing the preparation 
and dissemination of financial statements may 
differ from legislation in other jurisdictions.

audit information of which the Group’s and 
company’s auditors are unaware;

• they have taken all the steps that they ought to have 
taken as a director in order to make themselves aware 
of any relevant audit information and to establish that 
the Group’s and company’s auditors are aware of that 
information; and

• the financial statements on pages 169 to 255 were 
approved by the Board of Directors on 15 June 2023 
and signed on its behalf by Marc Ronchetti and 
Steve Gunning.

Independent auditors’ report to the members of Halma plc

Basis for opinion
We conducted our audit in accordance with International 
Standards on Auditing (UK) (“ISAs (UK)”) and applicable law. 
Our responsibilities under ISAs (UK) are further described in the 
Auditors’ responsibilities for the audit of the financial statements 
section of our report. We believe that the audit evidence we have 
obtained is sufficient and appropriate to provide a basis for our 
opinion.

Independence
We remained independent of the group in accordance with the 
ethical requirements that are relevant to our audit of the financial 
statements in the UK, which includes the FRC’s Ethical Standard, 
as applicable to listed public interest entities, and we have fulfilled 
our other ethical responsibilities in accordance with these 
requirements. 

To the best of our knowledge and belief, we declare that non-audit 
services prohibited by the FRC’s Ethical Standard were not provided.

Other than those disclosed in note 6 to the financial statements, 
we have provided no non-audit services to the company or its 
controlled undertakings in the period under audit.

Report on the audit of the financial statements
Opinion
In our opinion:

•  Halma plc’s group financial statements and company financial 
statements (the “financial statements”) give a true and fair 
view of the state of the group’s and of the company’s affairs 
as at 31 March 2023 and of the group’s profit and the group’s 
cash flows for the year then ended;

•  the group financial statements have been properly prepared 
in accordance with UK-adopted international accounting 
standards as applied in accordance with the provisions 
of the Companies Act 2006;

•  the company financial statements have been properly 

prepared in accordance with United Kingdom Generally 
Accepted Accounting Practice (United Kingdom Accounting 
Standards, including FRS 101 “Reduced Disclosure Framework”, 
and applicable law); and

•  the financial statements have been prepared in accordance 

with the requirements of the Companies Act 2006.

We have audited the financial statements, included within 
the Annual Report and Accounts (the “Annual Report”), which 
comprise: the Consolidated and Company Balance Sheets as 
at 31 March 2023; the Consolidated Income Statement and 
Consolidated Statement of Comprehensive Income and 
Expenditure, the Consolidated Cash Flow Statement, and the 
Consolidated and Company Statement of Changes in Equity 
for the year then ended; the accounting policies; and the 
notes to the financial statements.

Our opinion is consistent with our reporting to the 
Audit Committee.

Our audit approach
Overview

Audit Scope
•  There were no individually significant components within the Group;
•  We performed full scope audit procedures over 31 components;
•  We performed specified procedures over all material balances for 14 components; and
•  We performed risk based procedures over specific financial statement line items for 16 components.
•  This provided coverage of 69% revenue, 72% profit before tax, and 87% net assets.

Key audit matters
•  Acquisition accounting – valuation of acquired intangibles (group)
•  Assessment of impairment of goodwill and other intangible assets (group)
•  Impairment of investments and recoverability of intercompany receivables (parent)

Materiality
•  Overall group materiality: £18,060,000 (FY22: £15,800,000) based on 5% of profit before tax and before adjustments.
•  Overall company materiality: £16,200,000 (FY22: £13,400,000) based on 1% of total assets.
•  Performance materiality: £13,540,000 (FY22: £11,850,000) (group) and £12,100,000 (FY22: £10,050,000) (company).

The scope of our audit
As part of designing our audit, we determined materiality 
and assessed the risks of material misstatement in the 
financial statements.

Key audit matters
Key audit matters are those matters that, in the auditors’ 
professional judgement, were of most significance in the audit 
of the financial statements of the current period and include the 
most significant assessed risks of material misstatement 
(whether or not due to fraud) identified by the auditors, 

including those which had the greatest effect on: the overall 
audit strategy; the allocation of resources in the audit; and 
directing the efforts of the engagement team. These matters, 
and any comments we make on the results of our procedures 
thereon, were addressed in the context of our audit of the 
financial statements as a whole, and in forming our opinion 
thereon, and we do not provide a separate opinion on 
these matters.

This is not a complete list of all risks identified by our audit. 

The key audit matters below are consistent with last year.

  Halma plc |  Annual Report and Accounts 2023

Key audit matter
Acquisition accounting – valuation of acquired 
intangibles (group)
Refer to Accounting Policies and note 25 for management 
disclosures of the relevant judgements and estimates.

During the year ended 31 March 2023, the Group completed 
seven business acquisitions with a combined total consideration 
of £328.8m. Acquired intangibles recognised in these transactions 
totalled £192.2m, with goodwill totalling £180.0m also being 
recognised. There is a risk of material misstatement to the 
financial statements from the application of IFRS 3 ‘Business 
combinations’, and the related valuation of the assets acquired, 
the liabilities assumed, and the consideration paid, including 
contingent consideration. The risk of material misstatement is 
inherently higher for the acquired intangible assets as a result of 
the methodology and assumptions used in the valuation. 

Management engaged third party valuation experts to assist 
them in the valuation of acquired intangible assets for the five 
largest acquisitions during the year. The total estimated 
consideration including contingent consideration for the remaining 
two acquisitions was £4.8m in aggregate and therefore does 
not present a material valuation risk. 

The key estimates and assumptions assessed were: the 
completeness of the identified intangible assets which have been 
recognised in the business combinations; the methodology and 
assumptions used in the valuation; and management’s estimate 
of the future forecast cash flows at the respective acquisition date.

How our audit addressed the key audit matter

We focused our audit procedures on the five largest acquisitions 
which in aggregate led to the recognition of acquired intangible 
assets totalling £190.9m and goodwill of £178.0m. In respect of 
these five acquisitions we:

•  Obtained and read key documentation and agreements relating 

to these acquisitions together with the acquisition models, 
internal management due diligence reports and the final 
purchase price allocations performed by management’s experts. 

•  Agreed the appropriateness of the trade names, customer 

relationships and technology recognised as separately identified 
intangible assets in each of these acquisitions where relevant.
•  Performed detailed testing of the opening balance sheet and 

the related fair value adjustments for each acquisition based on 
individually assigned materiality levels, which ranged from £1.0m 
to £2.0m.

•  Used our internal valuation experts to evaluate the methodology 
used by management’s experts and confirmed that appropriate 
income approach techniques had been utilised in valuing the 
identified intangible assets. Our internal valuations experts 
also evaluated the assumptions used by management’s 
experts, including assessing discount rates, royalty rates 
and attrition rates. 

•  Challenged the key assumptions used in these areas and 
performed sensitivity or where rates differed from those 
we might typically use.

•  Examined the detailed acquisition cash flow forecasts and 

confirmed that they reflect the nature of the businesses acquired 
and management’s planned actions as at the acquisition date, 
and that these actions align with those which could foreseeably 
be achieved by another market participant. These were 
compared to historic growth rates and margins and industry 
reports where available.

•  Reviewed the disclosures in the Annual Report, including in 

note 25, and checked that these are consistent with our audit 
work performed and the disclosure requirements of IFRS 3.

Based on the work performed, as summarised above, we 
concluded the Group’s acquisition accounting is materially 
appropriate and the recognised intangible assets have been 
appropriately valued and disclosed.

Key audit matter

How our audit addressed the key audit matter

Assessment of impairment of goodwill and other intangible 
assets (group)
Refer to Accounting Policies for the disclosure of critical 
accounting judgements and estimates around Goodwill and 
acquired intangibles impairment future cash flows, Note 11 – 
Goodwill and Note 12 - Other Intangible Assets of the 
financial statements.

The Group holds significant goodwill and other intangible assets 
balances totalling £1,120.5m (2022: £908.7m) and £472.3m (2022: 
£325.2m) respectively as at 31 March 2023. The valuation of these 
assets is judgemental and there is a risk they may be impaired. 
Under IAS 36 ‘Impairment of Assets’, goodwill must be tested 
for impairment at least annually and finite life intangible assets 
tested to the extent there is any indication that an asset may 
be impaired.

Management has performed an annual impairment review for 
each of the 11 CGU groups, which is the lowest level at which 
goodwill is monitored by the Group. The impairment reviews 
performed by management contain a number of judgements 
and estimates such as the forecast cash flows, growth rates 
and discount rates.

They also include climate change related adjustments, such 
as additional capital expenditure and specific reductions in the 
growth rates where specific industries have been identified which 
have the potential to be adversely impacted by climate change.

A change in the assumptions applied by management across the 
assessment, could result in a material change in the valuation of 
these assets, and as a result there is a risk that goodwill and other 
intangible assets balances are no longer deemed to be recoverable 
and hence should be impaired.

As per management’s impairment model, there is substantial 
headroom in all CGU Groups. The CGU Group with the lowest 
headroom percentage is the Healthcare Assessment CGU group, 
where the assumptions used are more sensitive. We believe there 
is a higher risk of an impairment in this CGU group and hence we 
performed additional procedures to address this risk. For other 
CGU Groups the impairment of goodwill has been assessed as 
a normal audit risk.

Management also assessed whether there are any indications 
that other intangible assets may be impaired. Where such 
indications are identified, management has performed value 
in use calculations to value the recoverable amount of these 
assets and compares them to the carrying amounts. No 
material impairment losses have been recognised as a result of 
this assessment, however some impairment charges have been 
booked for acquired intangibles held in relation to companies 
where future cash flows estimated for the remaining useful 
economic lives of the assets do not support the carrying 
value of the assets at 31 March 2023.

The audit procedures we performed to address the risk around 
the impairment of goodwill and other intangible assets were:

•  Assessed the methodology and approach applied by 

management in performing its impairment reviews, including 
the identification of CGU groups and the allocation of businesses 
and assets into the relevant CGU groups particularly for 
acquisitions within the period, and ensured this is consistent 
with the requirements of IAS 36 ‘Impairment of Assets’;
•  Obtained management’s goodwill annual impairment 

assessment for all 11 CGU groups and ensured the calculations 
were mathematically accurate and the methodology used was 
in line with the requirements of IAS 36 ‘Impairment of Assets’;
•  Tested the underlying data on which the impairment assessment 
is based. We evaluated the year one cash flows and assessed the 
short and long-term growth rates applied to them to determine 
the value in use. In doing so, we compared the cash flow 
forecasts to the latest Board approved budgets and compared 
prior years budgets to actual results, in order to assess the 
accuracy of the forecasting process;

•  Tested management’s climate change assumptions through 
comparison to the strategic report and the TCFD analysis 
including current year baselining of scope 3 emissions;

•  Tested the growth rate assumptions by comparing them to 
management’s strategic plans and previous sector growth 
rates and industry reports where available;

•  Performed sensitivity analysis of key assumptions and applied 

our own independent sensitivities by replacing key assumptions 
with alternative scenarios to ascertain the extent of change in 
those assumptions that, either individually or collectively, would 
be required for the assets to be impaired;

•  For the Healthcare Assessment CGU group, we also used our 

valuation experts to calculate an independent WACC rate and 
long-term growth rate;

•  Tested management’s other intangible assets impairment 
assessment. We evaluated management’s approach and 
ensured that the underlying cash flows within the trigger 
assessment were appropriate and consistent with the 
goodwill models;

•  Where triggers were identified, reviewed managements value 

in use calculations in line with the useful economic lives of those 
assets and performed our own sensitivities based on discussions 
of performance with sector and group management, along with 
external expectations for the markets and industries to which 
other intangibles relate; and

•  Reviewed the adequacy of disclosures made in the financial 

statements and assessed compliance with IAS 36.

Based on our work summarised above, we concluded that the 
goodwill and other intangible assets balances are materially 
appropriately stated at 31 March 2023 and that appropriate 
disclosures have been made in the financial statements.

Key audit matter

How our audit addressed the key audit matter

Impairment of investments and recoverability of intercompany 
receivables (parent)
Refer to Statement of Accounting Policies and Note C5 - Shares in 
Group Companies.

At 31 March 2023, the Company held investments in subsidiaries 
with a carrying value of £576.8m (2022: £453.5m) and intercompany 
receivables of £1,025.6m (2022: £801.2m). There is a risk that the 
recoverable amount of investments held at 31 March 2023 falls 
below their current carrying value. There is also a risk that the 
intercompany receivables balance is not recoverable.

The investment amount consists of the direct ownership of all 
UK subsidiaries in addition to investments in intermediary holding 
companies which then hold direct investments in the Group’s 
foreign subsidiaries.

The realisation of the carrying value of the investment is 
dependent on the future performance of the trading entities 
within the Group. The assessment therefore involves judgement, 
particularly in accurately forecasting future cash flows.

Management initially prepared a trigger assessment to identify 
those with impairment indicators, before preparing a Value in 
Use (VIU) model reflecting the current year profit after tax into 
perpetuity using a group discount rate, and assumptions over 
the long term growth.

The key areas of audit focus were the key assumptions in the 
VIU model including investment specific operating assumptions, 
discount rates and growth rates used to extrapolate risk adjusted 
cash flows beyond the forecast period. Through this assessment 
management concluded that no impairment was required, 
and similarly that no impairment was required in relation to 
intercompany receivables.

How we tailored the audit scope
We tailored the scope of our audit to ensure that we performed 
enough work to be able to give an opinion on the financial 
statements as a whole, taking into account the structure of 
the group and the company, the accounting processes and 
controls, and the industry in which they operate.

The Group is split into three sectors being Safety, Environmental 
& Analysis and Healthcare. Each sector consists of a number 
of businesses spread globally across more than 20 countries. 
The businesses are further disaggregated into 290 reporting 
components within the consolidation.

We did not identify any individually significant components within 
the Group, with no single component providing more than 15% 
of the Group’s external revenue or profit before taxation and 
before adjustments. We determined the most efficient approach 
to scoping was to perform full scope procedures over 30 reporting 
components where statutory audits are already required in the 
UK, Germany, Belgium, Australia, Switzerland, Singapore, China, 
France and Italy. Full scope procedures were also performed in 
relation to the component holding all consolidation adjustments. 
In addition, specified audit procedures were performed over all 
material balances for a further 14 components in the United 
States. Additional audit procedures were performed on specific 
financial statement line items for a further 16 components in 
China, the UK, the United States, Canada, Germany and 
Australia. This approach ensured that appropriate audit coverage 
has been obtained across all financial statement line items.

The audit procedures we performed to address the risk around the 
carrying value of investments in subsidiaries and recoverability of 
intercompany receivables were:

•  Discussed with management the basis of their impairment 
review and, where triggers were identified, the cash flow 
forecasts and terminal value determination;

•  Tested all current year acquisitions and disposals back to the 

supporting documentation and reconciled the closing positions 
from management’s detailed schedules to the financial 
statements at 31 March 2023;

•  Supported by PwC valuations experts, reviewed management’s 

independent discount rate calculation for appropriateness;
•  Evaluated the appropriateness of management’s initial trigger 

assessment and challenged management on the key 
assumptions in the VIU model where this was required;

•  Sensitised management’s assumptions in the VIU model in 

particular around the forecast cash flow growth rates;
•  Compared the total market capitalisation of the Group to 

the carrying value of investments which did not identify any 
impairment triggers; and

•  In respect of intercompany receivables, we compared the net 
assets and future cash flows of the companies to the total 
intercompany receivables to ensure that the total balance 
was recoverable.

Based on the work done, as summarised above, we did not 
identify any material impairments in relation to investment 
balances and intercompany receivables held by the Company 
at 31 March 2023.

Where work was performed by component auditors, we 
determined the appropriate level of involvement we needed 
to have in that audit work to ensure we could conclude that 
sufficient appropriate audit evidence had been obtained for 
the Group financial statements as a whole. We issued written 
instructions to all component auditors and had regular 
communications with them throughout the audit cycle. We 
have held remote meetings with members of each component 
team during the planning phase of our work and reviewed all 
significant matters reported. In addition, the Group Engagement 
Leader visited a number of international and UK based reporting 
components, as well as a senior member of the Group engagement 
team visiting the US during the execution phase of the audit to 
provide additional oversight to the US component teams. Working 
paper reviews have also been performed for all components which 
are individually material to the Group; that is exceeding 5% of the 
Group’s profit before taxation or 3% of the Group’s revenue.

Based on the detailed audit work performed across the Group, 
we have gained coverage of 69% of total revenue, 72% of profit 
before tax, and 87% of net assets.

The impact of climate risk on our audit
As part of our audit we have made enquiries of management to 
understand the process they adopted to assess the extent of the 
potential impact of climate risk on the financial statements and 
support the disclosures made in relation to climate risk within 
the Strategic report, TCFD Report and Sustainability report.

In addition to enquiries with management, we also read 
management’s experts screening report for scope 3 baselining.

We assessed the completeness of management’s climate risk 
assessment by:

•   reading external reporting made by management including 

the Carbon Disclosure Project submissions to ensure 
consistency with climate reporting; and

•  challenging management’s climate impact assessment 

including scope 3 baselining assessments with management’s 
information and analysis.

The Board has made commitments to get to net zero carbon 
emissions on Scope 1 and Scope 2 by 2040.

Management has assessed that there is no material impact on 
the financial reporting judgements and estimates arising from 
their considerations, consistent with previous assessments 
made by the business.

Using our knowledge of the business, we evaluated management’s 
risk assessment, its estimates as set out in Statement of Accounting 
Policies and resulting disclosures where significant. In particular we 
have considered how climate risk would impact the assumptions 
made in the forecasts prepared by management used in their 
impairment analyses, as referenced in the key audit matter in 
relation to the impairment of goodwill and other intangible 
assets above.

We also considered the consistency of the disclosures in relation 
to climate change within the Strategic report, TCFD Report and 
the Sustainability report with the financial statements and our 
knowledge obtained from the audit.

Our procedures did not identify any material impact in the context 
of our audit of the financial statements as a whole, or our key 
audit matters, for the year ended 31 March 2023.

We have involved climate change specialists in reading the 
disclosures made in relation to climate change in the other 
information within the Annual Report, and consider these to 
be materially consistent with the financial statements and our 
knowledge from our audit.

Our responsibility over other information is further described in 
the “Reporting on other information” section of our report. We 
have not been engaged to provide assurance over the accuracy 
of these disclosures.

Materiality
The scope of our audit was influenced by our application of 
materiality. We set certain quantitative thresholds for materiality. 
These, together with qualitative considerations, helped us to 
determine the scope of our audit and the nature, timing and 
extent of our audit procedures on the individual financial 
statement line items and disclosures and in evaluating the 
effect of misstatements, both individually and in aggregate 
on the financial statements as a whole.

Based on our professional judgement, we determined materiality 
for the financial statements as a whole as follows:

Overall materiality

£18,060,000 (FY22: £15,800,000).

£16,200,000 (FY22: £13,400,000).

How we determined it

5% of profit before tax and before adjustments

1% of total assets

Financial statements – group

Financial statements – company

Rationale for benchmark applied

Based on the benchmarks used in the Annual 
Report, profit before tax and before adjustments 
is considered as the primary measure used by 
the shareholders in assessing the underlying 
performance of the Group. This benchmark 
excludes the impact of adjustments in respect 
of amortisation and impairment of acquired 
intangible assets, acquisition items, significant 
restructuring costs and profit or loss on disposal 
of operations.

We believe that a total asset benchmark is 
appropriate given that the Company does not 
generate revenues of its own.

In determining the performance materiality, we considered a 
number of factors – the history of misstatements, risk assessment 
and aggregation risk and the effectiveness of controls – and 
concluded that an amount at the upper end of our normal 
range was appropriate.

We agreed with the Audit Committee that we would report to 
them misstatements identified during our audit above £903,000 
(group audit) (FY22: £790,000) and £903,000 (company audit) 
(FY22: £790,000) as well as misstatements below those amounts 
that, in our view, warranted reporting for qualitative reasons.

For each component in the scope of our group audit, we allocated 
a materiality that is less than our overall group materiality. The 
range of materiality allocated across components was £0.1m 
to £16.2m. Certain components were audited to a local 
statutory audit materiality that was also less than our 
overall group materiality.

We use performance materiality to reduce to an appropriately 
low level the probability that the aggregate of uncorrected 
and undetected misstatements exceeds overall materiality. 
Specifically, we use performance materiality in determining 
the scope of our audit and the nature and extent of our testing 
of account balances, classes of transactions and disclosures, 
for example in determining sample sizes. Our performance 
materiality was 75% (FY22: 75%) of overall materiality, 
amounting to £13,540,000 (FY22: £11,850,000) for the group 
financial statements and £12,100,000 (FY22: £10,050,000) 
for the company financial statements.

Other 
Information

Reporting on other information
The other information comprises all of the information in the 
Annual Report other than the financial statements and our 
auditors’ report thereon. The directors are responsible for the 
other information. Our opinion on the financial statements 
does not cover the other information and, accordingly, we do 
not express an audit opinion or, except to the extent otherwise 
explicitly stated in this report, any form of assurance thereon.

In connection with our audit of the financial statements, our 
responsibility is to read the other information and, in doing so, 
consider whether the other information is materially inconsistent 
with the financial statements or our knowledge obtained in 
the audit, or otherwise appears to be materially misstated. 
If we identify an apparent material inconsistency or material 
misstatement, we are required to perform procedures 
to conclude whether there is a material misstatement of the 
financial statements or a material misstatement of the other 
information. If, based on the work we have performed, we 
conclude that there is a material misstatement of this other 
information, we are required to report that fact. We have 
nothing to report based on these responsibilities.

With respect to the Strategic report and Directors’ Report, we also 
considered whether the disclosures required by the UK Companies 
Act 2006 have been included.

Based on our work undertaken in the course of the audit, the 
Companies Act 2006 requires us also to report certain opinions 
and matters as described below.

Strategic report and Directors’ Report
In our opinion, based on the work undertaken in the course of the 
audit, the information given in the Strategic report and Directors’ 
Report for the year ended 31 March 2023 is consistent with the 
financial statements and has been prepared in accordance 
with applicable legal requirements.

In light of the knowledge and understanding of the group and 
company and their environment obtained in the course of the 
audit, we did not identify any material misstatements in the 
Strategic report and Directors’ Report.

Directors’ Remuneration
In our opinion, the part of the Annual Remuneration Report to 
be audited has been properly prepared in accordance with the 
Companies Act 2006.

Conclusions relating to going concern
Our evaluation of the directors’ assessment of the group’s and the 
company’s ability to continue to adopt the going concern basis of 
accounting included:

•  Testing the appropriateness of the underlying cash flow forecasts 
and performing a retrospective review of actual performance to 
the prior year model;

•  Reviewing the debt agreements to confirm the terms and 

conditions, including covenants. The covenants were consistent 
with those used in management’s going concern assessment;

•  Agreeing borrowings as at 31 March 2023 to third-party 

confirmations and considered the Group’s available financing 
and maturity profile. This supported the Directors’ conclusion 
that sufficient liquidity headroom remained throughout the 
assessment period;

•  Testing the mathematical accuracy of the covenant calculations, 

including confirming that the adjustments recorded to 
determine proforma EBITDA;

•  Reviewing management’s base case and severe but plausible 
downside scenario, ensuring the directors have considered all 
appropriate factors, including the cash flows, the liquidity 
position of the Group, available borrowing facilities, the timing 
of contractual debt repayments and the relevant financial 
and non-financial covenants; and

•  Performing sensitivity analysis to assess the impact of 

movements in significant assumptions on the overall liquidity 
headroom and the banking covenants.

Based on the work we have performed, we have not identified 
any material uncertainties relating to events or conditions that, 
individually or collectively, may cast significant doubt on the 
group’s and the company’s ability to continue as a going concern 
for a period of at least twelve months from when the financial 
statements are authorised for issue.

In auditing the financial statements, we have concluded that 
the directors’ use of the going concern basis of accounting in 
the preparation of the financial statements is appropriate.

However, because not all future events or conditions can be 
predicted, this conclusion is not a guarantee as to the group’s 
and the company’s ability to continue as a going concern.

In relation to the directors’ reporting on how they have applied the 
UK Corporate Governance Code, we have nothing material to add 
or draw attention to in relation to the directors’ statement in the 
financial statements about whether the directors considered it 
appropriate to adopt the going concern basis of accounting.

Our responsibilities and the responsibilities of the directors with 
respect to going concern are described in the relevant sections 
of this report.

Independent auditors’ report to the members of Halma plc continued

Corporate governance statement
The Listing Rules require us to review the directors’ statements in 
relation to going concern, longer-term viability and that part of 
the corporate governance statement relating to the company’s 
compliance with the provisions of the UK Corporate Governance 
Code specified for our review. Our additional responsibilities 
with respect to the corporate governance statement as other 
information are described in the Reporting on other information 
section of this report.

Based on the work undertaken as part of our audit, we have 
concluded that each of the following elements of the corporate 
governance statement is materially consistent with the financial 
statements and our knowledge obtained during the audit, and we 
have nothing material to add or draw attention to in relation to:

•  The directors’ confirmation that they have carried out a robust 

assessment of the emerging and principal risks;

•  The disclosures in the Annual Report that describe those principal 
risks, what procedures are in place to identify emerging risks and 
an explanation of how these are being managed or mitigated;

•  The directors’ statement in the financial statements about 
whether they considered it appropriate to adopt the going 
concern basis of accounting in preparing them, and their 
identification of any material uncertainties to the group’s 
and company’s ability to continue to do so over a period of 
at least twelve months from the date of approval of the 
financial statements;

•  The directors’ explanation as to their assessment of the group’s 
and company’s prospects, the period this assessment covers 
and why the period is appropriate; and

•  The directors’ statement as to whether they have a reasonable 

expectation that the company will be able to continue in 
operation and meet its liabilities as they fall due over the period 
of its assessment, including any related disclosures drawing 
attention to any necessary qualifications or assumptions.

Our review of the directors’ statement regarding the longer-term 
viability of the group and company was substantially less in 
scope than an audit and only consisted of making inquiries and 
considering the directors’ process supporting their statement; 
checking that the statement is in alignment with the relevant 
provisions of the UK Corporate Governance Code; and considering 
whether the statement is consistent with the financial statements 
and our knowledge and understanding of the group and company 
and their environment obtained in the course of the audit.

In addition, based on the work undertaken as part of our audit, 
we have concluded that each of the following elements of the 
corporate governance statement is materially consistent with 
the financial statements and our knowledge obtained during 
the audit:

•  The directors’ statement that they consider the Annual Report, 
taken as a whole, is fair, balanced and understandable, and 
provides the information necessary for the members to assess 
the group’s and company’s position, performance, business 
model and strategy;

•  The section of the Annual Report that describes the review of 

effectiveness of risk management and internal control systems; 
and

•  The section of the Annual Report describing the work of the 

Audit Committee.

We have nothing to report in respect of our responsibility to 
report when the directors’ statement relating to the company’s 
compliance with the Code does not properly disclose a departure 
from a relevant provision of the Code specified under the Listing 
Rules for review by the auditors.

Responsibilities for the financial statements and the audit
Responsibilities of the directors for the financial statements
As explained more fully in the Directors’ responsibilities, the 
directors are responsible for the preparation of the financial 
statements in accordance with the applicable framework and 
for being satisfied that they give a true and fair view. The directors 
are also responsible for such internal control as they determine is 
necessary to enable the preparation of financial statements that 
are free from material misstatement, whether due to fraud 
or error.

In preparing the financial statements, the directors are responsible 
for assessing the group’s and the company’s ability to continue 
as a going concern, disclosing, as applicable, matters related to 
going concern and using the going concern basis of accounting 
unless the directors either intend to liquidate the group or the 
company or to cease operations, or have no realistic alternative 
but to do so.

Auditors’ responsibilities for the audit of the 
financial statements
Our objectives are to obtain reasonable assurance about whether 
the financial statements as a whole are free from material 
misstatement, whether due to fraud or error, and to issue an 
auditors’ report that includes our opinion. Reasonable assurance 
is a high level of assurance, but is not a guarantee that an audit 
conducted in accordance with ISAs (UK) will always detect a 
material misstatement when it exists. Misstatements can arise 
from fraud or error and are considered material if, individually or 
in the aggregate, they could reasonably be expected to influence 
the economic decisions of users taken on the basis of these 
financial statements.

Irregularities, including fraud, are instances of non-compliance 
with laws and regulations. We design procedures in line with our 
responsibilities, outlined above, to detect material misstatements 
in respect of irregularities, including fraud. The extent to which our 
procedures are capable of detecting irregularities, including fraud, 
is detailed below.

176 

  Halma plc |  Annual Report and Accounts 2023

Based on our understanding of the group and industry, we 
identified that the principal risks of non-compliance with laws 
and regulations related to Employment regulation, Health and 
safety regulation, Data Protection regulations, Task Force on 
Climate-Related Financial Disclosures and Streamlined Energy and 
Carbon Reporting (SECR), and we considered the extent to which 
non-compliance might have a material effect on the financial 
statements. We also considered those laws and regulations that 
have a direct impact on the financial statements such as The 
Listing Rules, applicable tax legislation, Pensions legislation, 
The UK Corporate Governance Code 2018, and Companies Act 
2006. We evaluated management’s incentives and opportunities 
for fraudulent manipulation of the financial statements (including 
the risk of override of controls), and determined that the principal 
risks were related to posting inappropriate journal entries, either in 
the underlying books and records or as part of the consolidation 
process, and management bias in accounting estimates. The 
group engagement team shared this risk assessment with the 
component auditors so that they could include appropriate audit 
procedures in response to such risks in their work. Audit procedures 
performed by the group engagement team and/or component 
auditors included:

•  Discussions with management and the Group’s legal team, 
including consideration of known or suspected instances of 
non-compliance with laws and regulations and fraud;
•  Review of selected component auditors’ working papers;
•  Challenging assumptions and judgements made by 

management in their significant accounting judgements and 
estimates that involve considering future events that are 
inherently uncertain or that may be subject to management 
bias. In particular, we focused our work on impairment of 
goodwill and other intangible assets, valuation of acquired 
intangible assets, defined benefit pension liabilities and the 
valuation of contingent consideration;

•  Identifying and testing journal entries, in particular any journal 
entries posted with unusual account combinations or those 
posted by unexpected users; and

•  Testing all material consolidation adjustments to ensure these 

were appropriate in nature and magnitude.

There are inherent limitations in the audit procedures described 
above. We are less likely to become aware of instances of non-
compliance with laws and regulations that are not closely related 
to events and transactions reflected in the financial statements. 
Also, the risk of not detecting a material misstatement due to 
fraud is higher than the risk of not detecting one resulting from 
error, as fraud may involve deliberate concealment by, for 
example, forgery or intentional misrepresentations, or 
through collusion.

Other 
Information

Our audit testing might include testing complete populations of 
certain transactions and balances, possibly using data auditing 
techniques. However, it typically involves selecting a limited 
number of items for testing, rather than testing complete 
populations. We will often seek to target particular items for 
testing based on their size or risk characteristics. In other cases, 
we will use audit sampling to enable us to draw a conclusion 
about the population from which the sample is selected.

A further description of our responsibilities for the audit of 
the financial statements is located on the FRC’s website at: 
www.frc.org.uk/auditorsresponsibilities. This description 
forms part of our auditors’ report.

statements for the year ended 31 March 2018 and subsequent 
financial periods. The period of total uninterrupted engagement is 
6 years, covering the years ended 31 March 2018 to 31 March 2023.

Other matter
In due course, as required by the Financial Conduct Authority 
Disclosure Guidance and Transparency Rule 4.1.14R, these 
financial statements will form part of the ESEF-prepared 
annual financial report filed on the National Storage Mechanism 
of the Financial Conduct Authority in accordance with the ESEF 
Regulatory Technical Standard (‘ESEF RTS’). This auditors’ report 
provides no assurance over whether the annual financial report 
will be prepared using the single electronic format specified in 
the ESEF RTS.

Own shares are ordinary shares in Halma plc purchased by the Company and held to fulfil the Company’s obligations under the Group’s 
share plans. 

The market value of own shares was £42.4m (2022: £29.5m).

The Capital redemption reserve was created on repurchase and cancellation of the Company’s own shares. The Hedging reserve is used 
to record the portion of the cumulative net change in fair value of cash flow hedging instruments that are deemed to be an 
effective hedge.

The Translation reserve is used to record the difference arising from the retranslation of the financial statements of foreign operations, 
offset by net investment hedges with a carrying value of £33.9m (2022: £26.5m). The Other reserves represent the cumulative fair value 
adjustments on equity instruments held at fair value through other comprehensive income.

*  Effective for the year ended 31 March 2022, the share-based payment reserve, which was previously presented in Other reserves has been amalgamated with 

Retained earnings, in the Consolidated Statement of Changes in Equity and the Consolidated Balance Sheet as permitted by IFRS 2. This resulted in the £13.6m 
debit in brought forward Other reserves at 1 April 2021 being transferred to Retained earnings. There is no change in Total equity from this change, nor the amounts 
charged or credited to the reserves during the period, which represents a change in presentational accounting policy only.

Strategic 
Report

Financial 
Statements

Other 
Information

Basis of presentation
The consolidated financial statements of Halma are prepared in accordance with UK-adopted International Accounting Standards 
and with the requirements of the Companies Act 2006 as applicable to companies reporting under those standards.

The principal Group accounting policies are explained below and have been applied consistently throughout the years ended 
31 March 2023 and 31 March 2022, other than those noted below.

The Group accounts have been prepared under the historical cost convention, except as described below under the headings 
‘Derivative financial instruments and hedge accounting’, ‘Financial assets at fair value through other comprehensive income (FVOCI)’, 
‘Pensions’ and ‘Business combinations and goodwill’.

New Standards and Interpretations applied for the first time in the year ended 31 March 2023
The following Standards with an effective date of 1 January 2022, have been adopted without any significant impact on the amounts 
reported in these financial statements:

•  Reference to the Conceptual Framework – Amendments to IFRS 3
•  Property, Plant and Equipment: Proceeds before Intended Use – Amendments to IAS 16
•  Onerous Contracts – Costs of Fulfilling a Contract – Amendments to IAS 37
•  Annual Improvements to IFRS 2018– 2020

New Standards and Interpretations not yet applied
At the date of authorisation of these financial statements, the following Standards and Interpretations that are potentially relevant to 
the Group, and which have not been applied in these financial statements, were in issue but not yet effective (and in some cases had 
not yet been adopted by the UK):

•  IFRS 17 Insurance Contracts
•  Classification of Liabilities as Current or Non-current – Amendments to IAS 1 – Not yet endorsed by the UK
•  Definition of Accounting Estimates – Amendments to IAS 8
•  Disclosure of Accounting Policies – Amendments to IAS 1 and IFRS Practice Statement 2
•  Deferred Tax related to Assets and Liabilities arising from a Single Transaction – Amendments to IAS 12
•  Lease Liability in a Sale and Leaseback – Amendments to IFRS 16
•  Classification of Liabilities as Current or Non-current and Non-current Liabilities with Covenants - Amendments to IAS 1 – 

Not yet endorsed by the UK

•  Amendments to IAS 7 Statement of Cash Flows and IFRS 7 Financial Instruments: Disclosures – Not yet endorsed by the UK
•  Amendments to IAS 12 International Tax Reform Pillar Two Model Rule - Not yet endorsed by the UK

The Directors anticipate that the adoption of these Standards and Interpretations in future periods will have no material impact on the 
financial statements of the Group.

Use of Alternative performance measures (APMs)
In the reporting of the financial information, the Group uses certain measures that are not required under IFRS, the Generally Accepted 
Accounting Principles (GAAP) under which the Group reports. The Directors believe that Return on Total Invested Capital (ROTIC), Return 
on Capital Employed (ROCE), Organic growth at constant currency, Adjusted profit and earnings per share measures, net debt, cash 
conversion and Adjusted operating cash flow provide additional and more consistent measures of underlying performance to 
shareholders by removing items that are not closely related to the Group’s trading or operating cash flows. These and other alternative 
performance measures are used by the Directors for internal performance analysis and incentive compensation arrangements for 
employees. The terms ROTIC, ROCE, organic growth at constant currency and ‘adjusted’ are not defined terms under IFRS and may 
therefore not be comparable with similarly titled measures reported by other companies. They are not intended to be a substitute for, or 
superior to, GAAP measures.

The principal items which are included in adjusting items are set out below in the Group’s accounting policy and in note 1. 
The term ‘adjusted’ refers to the relevant measure being reported for continuing operations excluding adjusting items.

Definitions of the Group’s material alternative performance measures along with reconciliation to their IFRS equivalent measure are 
included in note 3.

Key accounting policies
Below we set out our key accounting policies, with a list of all other accounting policies thereafter.

Going concern
The Group’s business activities, together with the main trends and factors likely to affect its future development, performance and 
position, and the financial position of the Group as at 31 March 2023, its cash flows, liquidity position and borrowing facilities are set out 
in the Strategic Report. In addition, note 27 contains further information concerning the security, currency, interest rates and maturity of 
the Group’s borrowings.

The financial statements have been prepared on a going concern basis. In adopting the going concern basis the Directors have 
considered all of the above factors, including potential scenarios and its principal risks set out on pages 91 to 97. Under the potential 
scenarios considered, which includes a severe but plausible downside scenario, the Group remains within its debt facilities and the 
attached financial covenants for the foreseeable future and the Directors therefore believe, at the time of approving the financial 
statements, that the Company is well placed to manage its business risks successfully and remains a going concern. The key facts and 
assumptions in reaching this determination are summarised below. 

The base case scenario has been prepared using forecasts from each Operating Company as well as cash outflows on acquisitions in line 
with pre COVID pandemic levels. In addition, a severe but plausible downside scenario has been modelled showing a decline in trading 
for the year ending 31 March 2024. 

Halma plc |  Annual Report and Accounts 2023

Accounting Policies continued

Key accounting policies continued
This reduction in trading could be caused by events such as a significant resurgence in the COVID pandemic lockdowns beyond China or 
continued macroeconomic volatility leading to further inflation and interest rate increases. In mitigating the impacts of the downside 
scenario there are actions that can be taken which are entirely discretionary to the business such as reducing acquisition spend and 
dividend growth rates. In addition, the Group has demonstrated strong resilience and flexibility to manage its overheads and adapt 
its supply chains during the COVID pandemic and more recent global economic uncertainty. 

Neither the base case nor severe but plausible downside scenarios result in a breach of the Group’s available debt facilities or the 
attached covenants and, accordingly, the Directors believe there is no material uncertainty in the use of the going concern assumption 
and, therefore, deem it appropriate to continue to adopt the going concern basis of accounting for at least the next 12-month period.

Our financial position remains robust with committed facilities at the balance sheet date totalling approximately £931m which includes 
a £550m Revolving Credit Facility (RCF). The undrawn committed facilities as at 31 March 2023 amounted to £255.7m. In May 2022, 
the RCF was refinanced and now matures in May 2028, the first of two one-year extension options having been exercised post year-end. 
During May 2022, the Group also entered into a new Note Purchase Agreement which provided access to loan notes totalling £330m, 
which were drawn in various currencies in July 2022. The financial covenants across the facilities are for leverage (net debt/adjusted 
EBITDA) of not more than three and a half times and for adjusted interest cover of not less than four times.

Business combinations and goodwill
Business combinations are accounted for using the acquisition method as at the acquisition date, which is the date on which control 
is transferred to the Group. The Group measures goodwill at the acquisition date as:

•  the fair value of the consideration transferred; plus
•  the recognised amount of any non-controlling interests in the acquiree measured at the proportionate share of the value of net 

identifiable assets acquired; plus

•  the fair value of the existing equity interest in the acquiree; less
•  the net recognised amount (generally fair value) of the identifiable assets acquired and liabilities assumed.

Costs related to the acquisition, other than those associated with the issue of debt or equity securities, are expensed as incurred. 
Any contingent consideration payable may be accounted for as either:

a)   Consideration transferred, which is recognised at fair value at the acquisition date. If the contingent purchase consideration is 

classified as equity, it is not remeasured and settlement is accounted for within equity. Otherwise, subsequent changes to the fair 
value of the contingent purchase consideration are recognised in the Consolidated Income Statement; or

b)   Remuneration, which is expensed in the Consolidated Income Statement over the associated period of service. An indicator of such 
treatment includes when payments to employees of the acquired company are contingent on a post-acquisition event, but may be 
automatically forfeited on termination of employment.

For acquisitions between 4 April 2004 (the date from which the financial statements were reported under IFRS) and 2 April 2010, goodwill 
represents the difference between the cost of the acquisition, including acquisition costs and the fair value of the net identifiable assets 
acquired. Goodwill has an indefinite expected useful life and is not amortised, but is tested annually for impairment.

Goodwill is recognised as an intangible asset in the Consolidated Balance Sheet. Goodwill therefore includes non-identified intangible 
assets including business processes, buyer-specific synergies, know-how and workforce-related industry-specific knowledge and 
technical skills. Negative goodwill arising on acquisitions would be recognised directly in the Consolidated Income Statement.

On closure or disposal of an acquired business, goodwill would be taken into account in determining the profit or loss on closure 
or disposal.

As permitted by IFRS 1, the Group elected not to apply IFRS 3 ‘Business Combinations’ to acquisitions prior to 4 April 2004 in its 
consolidated accounts. As a result, the net book value of goodwill recognised as an intangible asset under UK GAAP at 3 April 2004 
was brought forward unadjusted as the cost of goodwill recognised under IFRS at 4 April 2004 subject to impairment testing on that 
date; and goodwill that was written off to reserves prior to 28 March 1998 under UK GAAP will not be taken into account in 
determining the profit or loss on disposal or closure of previously acquired businesses from 4 April 2004 onwards.

Payments for contingent consideration are classified as investing activities within the Consolidated Cash Flow Statement, except for 
amounts paid in excess of that estimated in the acquisition balance sheets which are recognised in the net cash inflow from operating 
activities in the year together with movements in contingent consideration provisions charged/credited to the Consolidated Income 
Statement which is included as a reconciling item between operating profit and cash inflow from operating activities.

Intangible assets
(a) Acquired intangible assets
An intangible resource acquired with a subsidiary undertaking is recognised as an intangible asset if it is separable from the acquired 
business or arises from contractual or legal rights, is expected to generate future economic benefits and its fair value can be measured 
reliably. Acquired intangible assets, comprising trademarks, technology and know-how and customer relationships, are amortised 
through the Consolidated Income Statement on a straight-line basis over their estimated economic lives of between three and 20 years. 
The carrying value of intangible assets is reviewed for impairment if events or changes in circumstances indicate the carrying value may 
not be recoverable.

(b) Product development costs
Research expenditure is charged to the Consolidated Income Statement in the financial year in which it is incurred.

Development expenditure is expensed in the financial year in which it is incurred, unless it relates to the development of a new or 
substantially improved product, is incurred after the technical feasibility and economic viability of the product has been proven and the 
decision to complete the development has been taken, and can be measured reliably. Such expenditure, meeting the recognition criteria 
of IAS 38 ‘Intangible Assets’, is capitalised as an intangible asset in the Consolidated Balance Sheet at cost and is amortised through the 
Consolidated Income Statement on a straight-line basis over its estimated economic life of three years.

Pensions
The Group makes contributions to various pension plans.

For defined benefit plans, the asset or liability recorded in the Consolidated Balance Sheet is the difference between the fair value of 
the plan’s assets and the present value of the defined obligation at that date. The defined benefit obligation is calculated separately 
for each plan on an annual basis by independent actuaries using the projected unit credit method.

Actuarial gains and losses are recognised in full in the period in which they occur and are taken to other comprehensive income.

Current and past service costs, along with the impact of any settlements or curtailments, are charged to the Consolidated Income 
Statement. The net interest expense on pension plans’ liabilities and the expected return on the plans’ assets is recognised within 
finance expense in the Consolidated Income Statement.

Contributions to defined contribution plans are charged to the Consolidated Income Statement in the period the expense relates to.

Impairment of trade and other receivables
The Group assesses on a forward-looking basis the expected credit losses associated with its trade and other receivables carried at 
amortised cost. The impairment methodology applied depends on whether there has been a significant increase in credit risk.

The Group applies the simplified approach permitted by IFRS 9, which requires expected lifetime losses to be recognised from initial 
recognition of the receivables. In order to estimate the expected lifetime losses, the Group categorises its customers into groups with 
similar risk profiles and determines the historic rates of impairment for each of those categories of customer. The Group then adjusts 
the risk profile for each group of customers by using forward looking information, such as the government risk of default for the country 
in which those customers are located, and determines an overall probability of impairment for the total trade and other receivables at 
the balance sheet date.

Critical accounting judgements and key sources of estimation uncertainty
The preparation of Group accounts in conformity with IFRS requires the Directors to make judgements, estimates and assumptions that 
affect the application of policies and reported amounts of assets and liabilities, income and expenses. The estimates and associated 
assumptions are based on historical experiences and various other factors that are believed to be reasonable under the circumstances, 
the results of which form the basis of making judgements about carrying values of assets and liabilities that are not readily apparent 
from other sources. Actual results may differ from these estimates.

In preparing the Consolidated Financial Statements management has considered the impact of climate change, particularly in the 
context of the disclosures included in the Strategic Report and the stated Net Zero ambitions. These considerations did not have a 
material impact on the financial reporting judgements and estimates in the current year. Climate change is not expected to have a 
significant impact on the Group’s going concern assessment as at March 2023 nor the viability of the Group over the next three years.

The following areas of critical accounting judgement and key estimation uncertainty have been identified as having significant risk of 
causing a material adjustment to the carrying amounts of assets and liabilities:

Critical accounting judgements
Goodwill impairment CGU groups
Determining whether goodwill is impaired requires management’s judgement in assessing cash generating unit (CGU) groups to which 
goodwill should be allocated. Management allocates a new acquisition to a CGU group based on which one is expected to benefit most 
from that business combination. The allocation of goodwill to existing CGU groups is generally straightforward and factual, however 
over time as new businesses are acquired and management reporting structures change, management reviews the CGU groups to 
ensure they are still appropriate. Further details are provided in note 11. There have been no changes to the CGU groups in the 
current year.

Recoverability of non-current taxation assets
In the current year, determining the recoverability of tax assets requires management’s judgement in assessing the amounts paid in 
relation to group financing partial exemption applicable to UK controlled foreign companies as a result of the decision by the European 
Commission that this constitutes state aid. Management’s assessment is that this represents a contingent liability and that the £14.7m 
paid to HM Revenue & Customs (HMRC) in previous years, included within non-current assets on the Consolidated Balance Sheet, will 
ultimately be recovered. Further details are provided in note 31.

Key sources of estimation uncertainty
Contingent consideration changes in estimates
Determining the value of contingent consideration recognised as part of the acquisition of a business requires management to estimate 
the expected performance of the acquired business and the amount of contingent consideration that will therefore become payable. 
Initial estimates of expected performance are made by the management responsible for completing the acquisition and form a key 
component of the financial due diligence that takes place prior to completion. Subsequent measurement of contingent consideration 
is based on the Directors’ appraisal of the acquired business’s performance in the post-acquisition period and the agreement of final 
payments. See notes 20 and 27 for details of the changes in estimates made in the year and the sensitivity of contingent consideration 
payables to further changes.

Intangible assets
Intangible assets IFRS 3 (revised) ‘Business Combinations’ requires that goodwill arising on the acquisition of subsidiaries is capitalised 
and included in intangible assets. IFRS 3 (revised) also requires the identification and valuation of other separable intangible assets at 
acquisition. The assumptions involved in valuing these intangible assets require the use of management estimates. 

IAS 38 ‘Intangible Assets’ requires that development costs, arising from the application of research findings or other technical 
knowledge to a plan or design of a new or substantially improved product, are capitalised, subject to certain criteria being met. 
Determining the technical feasibility and estimating the future cash flows generated by the products in development requires the 
use of management estimates.

Critical accounting judgements and key sources of estimation uncertainty continued
The estimates made in relation to both acquired intangible assets and capitalised development costs include identification of relevant 
assets, future growth rates, expected inflation rates and the discount rate used. Management also make estimates of the useful 
economic lives of the intangible assets. Management engages third party specialists to assist with the valuation of acquired intangible 
assets for significant acquisitions. Depending on the nature of the assets the Group uses different valuation methodologies to arrive at 
the fair value including the excess earnings method, the relief from royalty method and the cost savings method. Financial projections 
are based on market participants' expectations and are discounted to their present value using rates of return which reflects the risk of 
the investment and the time value of money. Further details on intangible assets are disclosed in note 12.

Goodwill and acquired intangibles impairment future cash flows
The ‘value in use’ calculation used to test for impairment of goodwill and acquired intangibles involves an estimation of the present 
value of future cash flows. For annual impairment testing of goodwill, the future cash flows of the CGU Group are based on annual 
budgets and forecasts of each relevant CGU, as approved by the Board, to which management’s expectation of market-share and 
long-term growth rates are applied. The present value is then calculated based on management’s estimate of future discount and 
growth rates. The Board reviews these key assumptions (operating assumptions, long-term growth rates, and discount rates) and the 
sensitivity analysis around these. Management believes that there is no reasonably possible change in any of the key assumptions that 
would cause the carrying value of any CGU group to exceed its recoverable amount. Further details are provided in note 11.

Acquired intangibles are assessed each reporting period for any indicators of impairment, both qualitative and quantitative, including as 
a result of our assessments of climate-related risks. If there are deemed to be any indicators of impairment a ‘value in use’ calculation is 
performed over the remaining useful life of the asset to identify if any impairment is needed. Where required, in calculating the ‘value in 
use’, future cash flows are based on annual budgets and forecasts for the relevant business. The present value is then calculated based 
on management’s estimate of future discount and growth rates. The Board and management reviews these key assumptions (operating 
assumptions, growth rates, and discount rates) and the sensitivity analysis around these.

Defined benefit pension plan liabilities
Determining the value of the future defined benefit asset/obligation requires estimation in respect of the assumptions used to calculate 
present values of plan liabilities. The significant assumptions utilised in the calculations are future mortality, discount rate and inflation. 
Management determines these assumptions in consultation with an independent actuary. Details of the estimates made in calculating 
the defined benefit asset/obligation, including sensitivity analysis, are disclosed in note 29.

Other accounting policies 
Basis of consolidation
The Group accounts include the accounts of Halma plc and all of its subsidiary companies made up to 31 March 2023, adjusted to 
eliminate intra-Group transactions, balances, income and expenses. The results of subsidiary companies acquired or disposed are 
included from the month of their acquisition or to the month of their disposal.

Segmental reporting
An operating segment is a distinguishable component of the Group that is engaged in business activities from which it may earn 
revenues and incur expenses, and whose operating results are reviewed regularly by the Chief Operating Decision Maker (the Group 
Chief Executive) to make decisions about resources to be allocated to the segment and assess its performance, and for which discrete 
financial information is available.

Reportable segments are operating segments that either meet the thresholds and conditions set out in IFRS 8 or are considered by the 
Board to be appropriately designated as reportable segments. Segment result represents operating profits and includes an allocation 
of Head Office expenses. Segment result excludes tax and financing items. Segment assets comprise goodwill, other intangible assets, 
property, plant and equipment and Right-of-Use assets (excluding land and buildings), inventories, trade and other receivables.

Segment liabilities comprise trade and other payables, provisions and other payables. Unallocated items represent land and buildings 
(including Right-of-Use assets), corporate and deferred taxation balances, defined benefit plan asset/obligation, contingent purchase 
consideration, all components of net cash/borrowings, lease liabilities and derivative financial instruments.

From 1 April 2022, the Group aligned its organisational structure and financial reporting with its purpose and focus on safety, 
environmental and health markets. The Group now has three main operating and reportable segments (Safety, Environmental & 
Analysis and Healthcare), which are defined by markets rather than product type. Each segment includes businesses with similar 
operating and market characteristics and are consistent with the internal reporting as reviewed by the Group Chief Executive.

Revenue
The Group’s revenue streams are the sale of goods and services in the specialist safety, environmental technologies and health markets. 
The revenue streams are disaggregated into three sectors, that serve like markets. Those sectors are Safety, Environmental & Analysis 
and Healthcare.

Revenue is recognised at the point of the transfer of control over promised goods or services to customers in an amount that reflects the 
amount of consideration specified in a contract with a customer, to which the Group expects to be entitled in exchange for those goods 
or services.

It is the Group’s judgement that in the majority of sales there is no contract until such time as the Operating Company satisfies its 
performance obligation, at which point the contract becomes the Operating Company’s terms and conditions resulting from the 
supplier’s purchase order. Where there are Master Supply Arrangements, these are typically framework agreements and do not contain 
clauses that would result in a contract forming under IFRS 15 until a Purchase Order is issued by the customer.

Revenue represents sales, net of estimates for variable consideration, including rights to returns, and discounts, and excluding value 
added tax and other sales related taxes. The amount of variable consideration is not considered to be material to the Group as a whole. 
The transaction price is allocated to each performance obligation on a relative standalone selling price basis.

Performance obligations are unbundled in each contractual arrangement if they are distinct from one another. There is judgement 
in identifying distinct performance obligations where the product could be determined to be a system, or where a combination of 
products and services are provided together. For the majority of the Group’s activities the performance obligation is judged to be 
the component product or service rather than the system or combined products and services. The contract price is allocated to 
the distinct performance obligations based on the relative standalone selling prices of the goods or services.

The way in which the Group satisfies its performance obligations varies by business and may be on shipment, delivery, as services 
are rendered or on completion of services depending on the nature of product and service and terms of the contract which govern 
how control passes to the customer. Revenue is recognised at a point in time or over time as appropriate.

Where the Group offers warranties that are of a service nature, revenue is recognised in relation to these performance obligations 
over time as the services are rendered. In our judgement we believe the associated performance obligations accrue evenly across 
the contractual term and therefore revenue is recognised on a pro-rated basis over the length of the service period.

In a small number of instances across the Group, products have been determined to be bespoke in nature, with no alternative use. 
Where there is also an enforceable right to payment for work completed, the criteria for recognising revenue over time have been 
deemed to have been met. Revenue is recognised on an input basis as work progresses. Progress is measured with reference to the 
actual cost incurred as a proportion of the total costs expected to be incurred under the contract. This is not a significant part of the 
Group’s business as for the most part, where goods are bespoke in nature, it is the Group’s judgement that the product can be broken 
down to standard component parts with little additional cost and therefore has an alternate use, or there is no enforceable right to 
payment for work performed. In these cases, the judgement is made that the requirements for recognising revenue over time are not 
met and revenue is recognised when control of the finished product passes to the customer.

The Group applies the practical expedient in IFRS 15 (paragraph 63) and does not adjust the promised amount of consideration for 
the effects of a significant financing component if the Group expects, at contract inception, that the period between the transfer 
of a promised good or service to a customer and when the customer pays for that good or service will be one year or less.

Operating profit
Operating profit is presented net of direct production costs, production overheads, selling costs, distribution costs and administrative 
expenditure (see note 6). Operating profit is stated after charging restructuring costs but before the share of results of associates, 
profit or loss on disposal of operations, finance income and finance costs.

Adjusting items
When items of income or expense are material and they are relevant to an understanding of the entity’s financial performance, 
they are disclosed separately within the financial statements. This provides additional and more consistent measures of underlying 
performance to shareholders by removing items that are not closely related to the Group’s trading or operating cash flows. Such 
adjusting items include costs or reversals arising from acquisitions or disposals of businesses, including acquisition costs, creation or 
reversals of provisions related to changes in estimates for contingent consideration on acquisition, amortisation and impairment of 
acquired intangible assets, and other significant one-off items that may arise.

Deferred government grant income
Government grant income that is linked to capital expenditure is deferred to the Consolidated Balance Sheet and credited to the 
Consolidated Income Statement over the life of the related asset. In addition, the Group claims research and development expenditure 
credits arising on qualifying expenditure and shows these ‘above the line’ in operating profit. Where the credits arise on expenditure that 
is capitalised as part of internally generated capitalised development costs, the income is deferred to the Consolidated Balance Sheet 
and credited to the Consolidated Income Statement over the life of the related asset in line with the policy stated above.

Finance income and expenses
The Group recognises interest income or expense using the effective interest rate method. Finance income and finance costs include:

•  Interest payable on loans, borrowings and lease obligations.
•  Net interest charge on pension plan liabilities.
•  Amortisation of finance costs.
•  Interest receivable in respect of cash and cash equivalents.
•  Unwinding of the discount on provisions.
•  Fair value movements on derivative financial instruments.

The Group has classified interest income and expenses within financing activities in the Consolidated Cash Flow Statement.

Taxation
Taxation comprises current and deferred tax. Tax is recognised in the Consolidated Income Statement except to the extent that it relates 
to items recognised directly in Total equity, in which case it too is recognised in Total equity. Current tax is the expected tax payable on 
the taxable income for the year, using tax rates enacted or substantively enacted at the balance sheet date, along with any adjustment 
to tax payable in respect of previous years. Taxable profit differs from net profit as reported in the Consolidated Income Statement 
because it excludes items that are never taxable or deductible.

Deferred tax is provided on temporary differences between the carrying amounts of assets and liabilities for financial reporting purposes 
and the amounts used for taxation purposes and is accounted for using the balance sheet liability method, apart from the following 
differences which are not provided for: goodwill not deductible for tax purposes; the initial recognition of assets or liabilities that affect 
neither accounting nor taxable profit; and differences relating to investments in subsidiaries to the extent they will probably not reverse 
in the foreseeable future. The amount of deferred tax provided is based on the expected manner of realisation or settlement of the 
carrying amounts of assets and liabilities, using tax rates and laws, which are expected to apply in the year when the liability is settled, 
or the asset is realised. Deferred tax assets are only recognised to the extent that recovery is probable.

Foreign currencies
The Group presents its accounts in Sterling. Transactions in foreign currencies are recorded at the rate of exchange at the date of 
the transaction. Monetary assets and liabilities denominated in foreign currencies at the balance sheet date are reported at the rates 
prevailing at that date. Non-monetary assets and liabilities denominated in foreign currencies are measured in terms of historical costs 
using the exchange rate at the date of the initial transaction. Any gain or loss arising on monetary assets and liabilities from subsequent 
exchange rate movements is included as an exchange gain or loss in the Consolidated Income Statement.

Net assets of overseas subsidiary companies are expressed in Sterling at the rates of exchange ruling at the end of the financial 
year, and trading results and cash flows at the average rates of exchange for the financial year. Goodwill arising on the acquisition of 
a foreign business is treated as an asset of the foreign entity and is translated at the rate of exchange ruling at the end of the financial 
year. Exchange gains or losses arising on these translations are taken to the Translation reserve within Total equity.

In the event that an overseas subsidiary is disposed of or closed, the profit or loss on disposal or closure will be determined after taking 
into account the cumulative translation difference held within the Translation reserve attributable to that subsidiary. As permitted by 
IFRS 1, the Group has elected to deem the translation to be £nil at 4 April 2004. Accordingly, the profit or loss on disposal or closure of 
foreign subsidiaries will not include any currency translation differences which arose before 4 April 2004.

Other intangible assets
(a) Computer software
Computer software that is not integral to an item of property, plant or equipment is recognised separately as an intangible asset and is 
amortised through the Consolidated Income Statement on a straight-line basis from the point at which the asset is ready to use over its 
estimated economic life of between three and five years.

Development costs that are directly attributable to the design and testing of identifiable and unique software products controlled by 
the Group are recognised as intangible assets where the following criteria are met:

•  it is technically feasible to complete the software so that it will be available for use;
•  management intends to complete the software and use or sell it;
•  there is an ability to use or sell the software;
•  it can be demonstrated how the software will generate probable future economic benefits;
•  adequate technical, financial and other resources to complete the development and to use or sell the software are available; and
•  the expenditure attributable to the software during its development can be reliably measured.

Where the Group enters into a SaaS cloud computing arrangement to access software, there are limited cases for capitalisation of 
attributable implementation costs. If the arrangement contains a lease as defined by IFRS 16, lease accounting rules apply including 
capitalisation of directly attributable costs. Alternatively, directly attributable software costs can create an intangible asset if the 
software can be controlled by the entity, either through the option to be run on the entity’s or a third-party’s infrastructure or where 
the development of the software creates customised software that the entity has exclusive rights to.

(b) Other intangibles
Other intangibles are amortised through the Consolidated Income Statement on a straight-line basis over their estimated economic 
lives of between three and ten years.

Property, plant and equipment
Property, plant and equipment is stated at historical cost less provisions for accumulated impairment and accumulated depreciation 
which, with the exception of freehold land which is not depreciated, is provided on a straight-line basis over each asset’s estimated 
economic life. The principal annual rates used for this purpose are:

Freehold property

Leasehold buildings and improvements

Plant, equipment and vehicles

2%

Shorter of 2% or period of lease

8% to 33.3%

Investments in associates
An associate is an entity over which the Group is in a position to exercise significant influence, but not control or joint control, through 
participation in the financial and operating policy decisions of the investee. Significant influence is the power to participate in the 
financial and operating policy decisions of the investee but without control or joint control over those policies.

The results and assets and liabilities of associates are incorporated in these financial statements using the equity method of accounting. 
Investments in associates are carried in the Consolidated Balance Sheet at cost as adjusted by post-acquisition changes in the Group’s 
share of the net assets of the associate, less any impairment in the value of individual investments. Losses of an associate in excess of 
the Group’s interest in that associate (which includes any long-term interests that, in substance, form part of the Group’s net 
investment in the associate) are recognised only to the extent that the Group has incurred legal or constructive obligations or made 
payments on behalf of the associate.

Any excess of the cost of acquisition over the Group’s share of the fair values of the identifiable net assets of the associate at the 
date of acquisition is recognised as goodwill. The goodwill is included within the carrying amount of the investment and is assessed 
for impairment as part of that investment. Any deficiency of the cost of acquisition below the Group’s share of the fair values of the 
identifiable net assets of the associate at the date of acquisition (i.e. discount on acquisition) is credited in profit or loss in the year 
of acquisition.

Where a Group company transacts with an associate of the Group, profits and losses are eliminated to the extent of the Group’s interest 
in the relevant associate. Losses may provide evidence of an impairment of the asset transferred in which case appropriate provisioning 
is made for impairment.

Other 
Information

Other accounting policies continued 
Where the Group disposes of its entire interest in an associate a gain or loss is recognised in the income statement on the difference 
between the amount received on the sale of the associate less the carrying value and costs of disposal.

Financial assets at fair value through other comprehensive income
Financial assets at fair value through other comprehensive income (FVOCI) comprise equity securities which are not held for trading, 
and which the Group has irrevocably elected at initial recognition to recognise as FVOCI. The Group considers this classification relevant 
as these are strategic investments.

Financial assets at FVOCI are adjusted to the fair value of the asset at the balance sheet date with any gain or loss being recognised 
in other comprehensive income and held as part of other reserves. On disposal any gain or loss is recognised in other comprehensive 
income and the cumulative gains or losses are transferred from other reserves to retained earnings.

Impairment of non-current assets
All non-current assets are tested for impairment whenever events or circumstances indicate that their carrying value may be impaired. 
Additionally, goodwill and capitalised development expenditure relating to a product that is not yet in full production are subject to an 
annual impairment test.

An impairment loss is recognised in the Consolidated Income Statement to the extent that an asset’s carrying value exceeds its 
recoverable amount, which represents the higher of the asset’s ‘fair value less costs to dispose’ and its ‘value in use’. An asset’s ‘value 
in use’ represents the present value of the future cash flows expected to be derived from the asset or from the cash generating unit to 
which it relates. The present value is calculated using a pre-tax discount rate that reflects the current market assessment of the time 
value of money and the risks specific to the asset concerned.

Impairment losses recognised in previous periods for an asset other than goodwill are reversed if there has been a change in the 
estimates used to determine the asset’s recoverable amount, but only to the extent that the carrying amount of the asset does 
not exceed its carrying amount had no impairment loss been recognised in previous periods. Such reversals are recognised in the 
Consolidated Income Statement. Impairment losses in respect of goodwill are not reversed.

Inventories
Inventories and work in progress are included at the lower of cost and net realisable value. Cost is calculated either on a ‘first in, first out’ 
or an average cost basis and includes direct materials and the appropriate proportion of production and other overheads considered by 
the Directors to be attributable to bringing the inventories to their location and condition at the year end. Net realisable value represents 
the estimated selling price less all estimated costs to complete and costs to be incurred in marketing, selling and distribution.

Cash and cash equivalents
Cash and cash equivalents comprise cash balances, deposits with an initial maturity of less than three months, and bank overdrafts 
that are repayable on demand.

Contract assets and liabilities
A contract asset is recognised when the Group’s right to consideration is conditional on something other than the passage of time, 
for example the completion of future performance obligations under the terms of the contract with the customer.

In some instances, the Group receives payments from customers based on a billing schedule, as established in the contract, which may 
not match with the pattern of performance under the contract. A contract liability is only recognised on non-cancellable contracts that 
provide unconditional rights to payment from the customer for products and services that the Group has not yet completed providing 
or that it will provide in the near future. Where performance obligations are satisfied ahead of billing then a contract asset will 
be recognised.

Contract assets are recognised within Trade and other receivables and are assessed for impairment on a forward-looking basis using 
the expected lifetime losses approach, as required by IFRS 9 (‘Financial Instruments’).

Costs to obtain or fulfil a contract
The incremental costs of obtaining a contract with a customer are capitalised as an asset if the Group expects to recover them. Costs 
such as sales commissions may be incurred when the Group enters into a new contract. Costs to obtain or fulfil a contract are presented 
in the Consolidated Balance Sheet as assets until the performance obligation to which they relate has been met. These assets are 
amortised on a consistent basis with how the related revenue is recognised.

The Group applies the practical expedient in IFRS 15 (paragraph 94) and recognises incremental costs of obtaining a contract as an 
expense when incurred if the amortisation period of the asset that the Group would otherwise have recognised is one year or less.

Trade payables
Trade payables are non-interest bearing and are stated at amortised cost.

Interest bearing loans and borrowings
Interest bearing loans and borrowings are initially recognised in the Consolidated Balance Sheet at fair value less directly attributable 
transaction costs and are subsequently measured at amortised cost using the effective interest rate method.

Provisions and contingent liabilities
Provisions are recognised when the Group has a present obligation (legal or constructive) as a result of a past event, it is probable that 
the Group will be required to settle that obligation and a reliable estimate can be made of the amount of the obligation.

The amount recognised as a provision is the best estimate of the consideration required to settle the present obligation at the balance 
sheet date, taking into account the risks and uncertainties surrounding the obligation. Where a provision is measured using the cash 
flows estimated to settle the present obligation, its carrying amount is the present value of the cash flows.

When some or all of the economic benefits required to settle a provision are expected to be recovered from a third party, a 
receivable is recognised as an asset if it is virtually certain that reimbursement will be received, and the amount of the receivable 
can be measured reliably.

Accounting Policies continued

Other accounting policies continued 
Contingent liabilities are disclosed where a possible obligation dependent on uncertain future events exists as at the end of the reporting 
period or a present obligation for which payment either cannot be measured or is not considered to be probable is noted. Contingent 
liabilities are not accrued for and no contingent liability is disclosed where the possibility of payment is considered to be remote.

Derivative financial instruments and hedge accounting
The Group enters into derivative financial instruments to manage its exposure to foreign exchange rate risk using forward exchange 
contracts. Further details of derivative financial instruments are disclosed in note 27. The Group continues to apply the requirements 
of IAS 39 for hedge accounting.

Derivative financial instruments are classified as fair value through profit and loss (held for trading) unless they are in a designated 
hedge relationship.

Derivatives are initially recognised at fair value at the date a derivative contract is entered into and are subsequently remeasured to 
their fair value at each balance sheet date. The resulting gain or loss is recognised in the Consolidated Income Statement, unless the 
derivative is designated and effective as a hedging instrument, in which event the timing of the recognition in the Consolidated Income 
Statement depends on the nature of the hedge relationship. The Group designates certain derivatives as hedges of highly probable 
forecast transactions or hedges of foreign currency risk of firm commitments (cash flow hedges), or hedges of net investments in 
foreign operations.

A derivative with a positive fair value is recognised as a financial asset whereas a derivative with a negative fair value is recognised as a 
financial liability. A derivative is presented as a non-current asset or a non-current liability if the remaining maturity of the instrument is 
more than 12 months and it is not expected to be realised or settled within 12 months. Other derivatives are presented as current assets 
or current liabilities.

Cash flow hedge accounting
The Group designates certain hedging instruments as cash flow hedges.

At the inception of the hedge relationship, the entity documents the relationship between the hedging instrument and the hedged item, 
along with its risk management objectives and its strategy for undertaking various hedge transactions. Furthermore, at the inception of 
the hedge and on an ongoing basis, the Group documents whether the hedging instrument has been or is expected to be highly 
effective in offsetting changes in fair values or cash flows of the hedged item.

Note 27 sets out details of the fair values of the derivative instruments used for hedging purposes and the movements in the Hedging 
reserve in equity.

The effective portion of changes in the fair value of derivatives that are designated and qualify as cash flow hedges is recognised in 
other comprehensive income. The gain or loss relating to the ineffective portion as a result of being over hedged is recognised 
immediately in the Consolidated Income Statement.

Amounts previously recognised in other comprehensive income and accumulated in equity are reclassified to the Consolidated Income 
Statement in the periods when the hedged item is recognised in the Consolidated Income Statement. However, when the forecast 
transaction that is hedged results in the recognition of a non-financial asset or a non-financial liability, the gains and losses previously 
accumulated in equity are transferred from equity and included in the initial measurement of the cost of the non-financial asset or 
non-financial liability.

Hedge accounting is discontinued when the Group revokes the hedging relationship, the hedging instrument expires or is sold, 
terminated or exercised, or no longer qualifies for hedge accounting. Any gain or loss recognised in other comprehensive income 
at that time is accumulated in equity and is recognised, when the forecast transaction is ultimately recognised, in the Consolidated 
Income Statement. When a forecast transaction is no longer expected to occur, the gain or loss accumulated in equity is recognised 
immediately in the Consolidated Income Statement.

Net investment hedge accounting
The Group uses foreign currency denominated borrowings as a hedge against the translation exposure on the Group’s net investment 
in overseas companies. Where the hedge is fully effective at hedging, the variability in the net assets of such companies caused by 
changes in exchange rates and the changes in value of the borrowings are recognised in the Consolidated Statement of Comprehensive 
Income and accumulated in the Translation reserve. The ineffective part of any change in value caused by changes in exchange rates is 
recognised in the Consolidated Income Statement.

Leases
The Group assesses at contract inception whether a contract is, or contains, a lease. That is, if the contract conveys the right to 
control the use of an identified asset for a period of time in exchange for consideration. Where the Group determines the contract is, 
or contains a lease, a right-of-use asset and a lease liability is recognised at the lease commencement date.

The lease term is determined from the commencement date of the lease and covers the non-cancellable term. If the Group has 
an extension option, which it considers reasonably certain to exercise, then the lease term will be considered to extend beyond that 
non-cancellable period. If the Group has a termination option, which it considers reasonably certain to exercise, then the lease term will 
be considered to be until the point the termination option will take effect. The Group deem that it is not reasonably certain to exercise 
an extension option or a termination option with an exercise date past the planning horizon of five years.

The right-of-use asset is initially measured at cost, comprising the initial amount of the lease liability plus any initial direct costs 
incurred and an estimate of costs to restore the underlying asset, less any lease incentives received. The right-of-use asset is 
subsequently depreciated using the straight-line method from the commencement date to the end of the lease term unless the 
right-of-use asset is deemed to have a useful life shorter than the lease term. The Group has taken the practical expedient to not 
separate lease and non-lease components and so account for both as a single lease component.

The right-of-use assets are also subject to impairment testing under IAS 36. Refer to the previous section on Impairment of non-current 
assets for further details.

The lease liability is initially measured at the present value of the lease payments that are not paid at the commencement date, 
discounted using the incremental borrowing rate. The lease payments include fixed payments (including in-substance fixed payments) 
less any lease incentives receivable, variable lease payments that depend on an index or a rate, and amounts expected to be paid under 
residual value guarantees. Variable lease payments that depend on an index or a rate, and amounts expected to be paid under residual 
value guarantees are not material to the Group. The lease payments also include the exercise price of a purchase option reasonably 
certain to be exercised by the Group and payments of penalties for terminating the lease, if the lease term reflects the Group exercising 
the option to terminate. Variable lease payments that do not depend on an index or a rate are recognised as expenses (unless they are 
incurred to produce inventories) in the period in which the event or condition that triggers the payment occurs. The lease liability is 
measured at amortised cost using the effective interest method by increasing the carrying amount to reflect interest on the lease 
liability and by reducing the carrying amount to reflect the lease payments made. The lease liability is remeasured when there is a 
change in future lease payments arising from a change in an index or a rate or a change in the Group’s assessment of whether it will 
exercise an extension or termination option. When the lease liability is remeasured, a corresponding adjustment is made to the right-of-
use asset.

Payments associated with short-term leases or low-value assets are recognised on a straight-line basis as an expense in the 
Consolidated Income Statement. Short-term leases are leases with a lease term of 12 months or less. Low-value assets mostly comprise 
of IT equipment and small items of office furniture. Lease payments for short-term leases, low-value assets and variable lease payments 
not included in the measurement of the lease liability are classified as cash flows from operating activities within the Consolidated Cash 
Flow Statement. The Group has classified the principal and interest portions of lease payments within financing activities.

Employee share plans
Share-based incentives are provided to employees under the Group’s share incentive plan, the performance share plan and the executive 
share plan.

(a) Share incentive plan
Awards of shares under the share incentive plan are made to qualifying employees depending on salary and service criteria. The shares 
awarded under this plan are purchased in the market by the plan’s trustees at the time of the award, and are then held in trust for a 
minimum of three years. The costs of this plan are recognised in the Consolidated Income Statement over the three-year vesting period 
of the awards.

(b) Executive share plan
Under the Executive share plan, awards of shares are made to Executive Directors and certain senior employees. Grants under this plan 
are in the form of Performance Awards or Deferred Share Awards.

Performance Awards are subject to non-market-based vesting criteria, and Deferred Share Awards are subject only to continuing service 
of the employee. Share awards are equity-settled. The fair value of the awards at the date of grant, which is estimated to be equal to 
the market value, is charged to the Consolidated Income Statement on a straight-line basis over the vesting period, with appropriate 
adjustments being made during this period to reflect expected and actual forfeitures. The corresponding credit is to Retained earnings 
within Total equity. Effective for the year ended 31 March 2022, the share-based payment reserve, which was previously presented as 
Other reserves has been amalgamated with Retained earnings, in the Consolidated Statement of Changes in Equity and the Consolidated 
Balance Sheet as permitted by IFRS 2. This resulted in the £13.6m debit in brought forward Other reserves at 1 April 2021 being transferred 
to Retained earnings. There is no change in Total equity from this change, nor the amounts charged or credited to the reserves during 
the period, which represents a change in presentational accounting policy only.

(c) Cash-settled
For cash-settled awards, a liability equal to the portion of the services received is recognised at the current fair value determined at each 
balance sheet date.

Dividends
Dividends payable to the Company’s shareholders are recognised as a liability in the period in which the distribution is approved by the 
Company’s shareholders.

Notes to the Accounts

1 Segmental analysis and revenue from contracts with customers 
Sector analysis and disaggregation of revenue 
The Group has three main operating and reportable segments (Safety, Environmental & Analysis and Healthcare), which are defined by 
markets rather than product type. Each segment includes businesses with similar operating and market characteristics. These segments 
are consistent with the internal reporting as reviewed by the Group Chief Executive. 

Nature of goods and services
The following is a description of the principal activities – separated by reportable segments, which are defined by markets rather than 
product type – from which the Group generates its revenue.

Further disaggregation of sector revenue by geography and by the pattern of revenue recognition depicts how economic factors 
affect the timing and uncertainty of the Group’s revenues.

Safety sector generates revenue by providing products that protect people, assets and infrastructure, enabling safe movement 
and enhancing efficiency. The technologies are used in public and commercial spaces and in industrial and logistics operations. 
Markets include: Fire Safety Technologies that protect people and assets from fire; Power Safety Technologies that increase the 
integrity and safety of electrical systems in a range of industries; Industrial Safety Technologies that protect people and assets 
in industrial environments; and Urban Safety Technologies that protect people and assets in urban environments. Products are 
generally sold separately, with contracts typically less than one year in length. Warranties are typically of an assurance nature. 
Revenue is recognised as control passes on delivery or despatch.

Payment is typically due within 60 days of invoice, except where a retention is held for documentation.

Environmental & Analysis generates revenue by providing products and technologies that monitor the environment, that ensure 
the quality and availability of life-critical resources, and analyse materials in a wide range of applications. Markets include: Optical 
Analysis Technologies that provide world-class optical, optoelectronic and spectral imaging systems that use light to analyse materials 
in a wide range of applications; Water Analysis and Treatment Systems to sustainably improve water quality and availability; and 
Environmental Monitoring Technologies that detect hazardous gases and analyse air quality, gases and water to monitor the quality 
of our environment. Products and services are generally sold separately. Warranties are typically of an assurance nature, but some 
companies within the Group offer extended warranties. Depending on the nature of the performance obligation, revenue may be 
recognised as control passes on delivery, despatch or as the service is delivered. Contracts are typically less than one year in length, 
but some companies have contracts where certain service-related performance obligations are delivered over a number of years; 
this can result in contract liabilities where those performance obligations are invoiced ahead of performance.

Payment is typically due within 60 days of invoice.

Healthcare sector generates revenue by providing products and services that help providers improve the care they deliver and enhance 
the quality of patients’ lives. Markets include: Life Sciences technologies and solutions to enable in-vitro diagnostic systems and 
accelerate life-science discoveries and development; Healthcare Assessment & Analytics components, devices and systems that provide 
valuable information and analytics so providers can better understand patient health and make decisions across the continuum of care; 
and Therapeutic Solutions Technologies, materials and solutions that enable treatment across key clinical specialties. Products are 
generally sold separately, and warranties are typically of an assurance nature. Depending on the nature of the performance obligation, 
revenue is recognised as control passes on delivery or despatch or as the service is delivered. Contracts are typically less than one year 
in length, but a limited number of companies have contracts where certain service-related performance obligations are delivered over 
a number of years; this can result in contract liabilities where those performance obligations are invoiced ahead of performance.

Payment is typically due within 60 days of invoice.

Inter-segmental sales are charged at prevailing market prices and have not been disclosed separately by segment as they are not 
considered material. Revenue derived from the rendering of services was £105.4m (2022 re-presented: £81.1m). The 2022 comparative 
has been re-presented to reflect £11.2m of service revenue previously classified as product revenue. All revenue was otherwise derived

Acquisition transaction costs, adjustments to contingent consideration and release of fair value adjustments to inventory (collectively 
‘acquisition items’), amortisation and impairment of acquired intangible assets and profit on disposal of operations are recognised in the 
Consolidated Income Statement. Segment profit, before these acquisition items and the other adjustments, is disclosed separately on 
the previous page as this is the measure reported to the Group Chief Executive for the purpose of allocation of resources and assessment 
of segment performance. These adjustments are analysed as follows:

The transaction costs arose mainly on the acquisitions during the year. In Safety, they related to the acquisition of FirePro (£1.6m), 
WEETECH (£1.0m), Thermocable (£0.4m) and Zonegreen (£0.1m). In Environmental & Analysis, they related to the acquisition of 
Deep Trekker (£0.5m) in the current year and Sewertronics (£0.4m) that was acquired in May 2023. In Healthcare, they related to 
the acquisition of IZI (£1.6m) in the current year, and the acquisition of Visiometrics in a previous year (£0.3m).

The £3.7m adjustment to contingent consideration comprised of a credit of £0.2m in Environmental & Analysis arising from a decrease in 
the estimate of the payables for Orca (£0.2m) and a debit of £3.9m in Healthcare arising from an increase in estimates of the payables 
for Infinite Leap (£2.7m), IZI (£1.4m) and Meditech (£0.3m), partially offset by a decrease in the estimate of the payable for Clayborn Lab 
(£0.3m) and Spreo (£0.2m).

The £3.7m release of fair value adjustments to inventory related to WEETECH (£0.3m) and Thermocable (£0.1m) in Safety; Deep Trekker 
(£0.3m) and International Light Technologies (£0.3m) in Environmental & Analysis; and IZI (£2.7m) in Healthcare. All amounts have been

The transaction costs arose on the acquisitions made in the prior year. In Safety, they related to the acquisition of Ramtech (£0.4m) 
and IBIT (£0.1m). In Environmental & Analysis, they related to the acquisition of Dancutter (£0.3m), Sensitron (£0.4m), Orca (£0.1m), 
Anton (£0.1m), International Light Technologies (£0.2m) in the year and Deep Trekker (£0.5m) that was acquired in April 2022. 
In Healthcare, they related to the acquisition of PeriGen (£1.4m), Infinite Leap (£0.3m), Clayborn Lab (£0.1m), Meditech (£0.1m) 
and RNK (£0.1m) in the year, and the acquisition of Visiometrics in a previous year (£0.1m).

The £4.5m adjustment to contingent consideration comprised of a credit of £0.1m in Environmental & Analysis arising from a decrease 
in the estimate of the payables for Invenio (£0.3m) offset by an increase in the estimate of the payable for Orca (£0.2m) and a credit 
of £4.4m in Healthcare arising from a decrease in estimates of the payables for NovaBone (£1.3m), NeoMedix (£3.0m) and Spreo 
(£0.1m) partially offset by an increase in the estimate of the payable for Infowave (£0.3m) and a credit of £0.3m arising from exchange 
differences on balances denominated in Euros.

The £3.4m release of fair value adjustments to inventory related to Ramtech (£1.3m) in Safety; Dancutter (£0.1m), Orca (£0.6m), 
Sensitron (£0.2m) and International Light Technologies (£0.2m) in Environmental & Analysis; and Meditech (£1.0m) in Healthcare. 
All amounts have been released in relation to Dancutter, Ramtech, Orca and Sensitron.

During the year impairment losses of £8.4m were recognised on Property, plant and equipment and other intangible assets, of 
which £8.0m was recognised in Safety, £0.1m was recognised in Environmental & Analysis and £0.3m was recognised in Healthcare 
(2022: £3.2m comprising £1.0m in Safety, £1.7m in Environmental & Analysis, £0.5m in Healthcare). Impairment losses mainly related 
to acquired intangible assets, due to changes in expected future cash flows, and to capitalised development costs recorded as a result 
of changes in the expected outcome of projects.

No single customer accounts for more than 10% (2022: 10%) of the Group’s revenue.

2 Earnings per share
Basic earnings per share amounts are calculated by dividing the net profit for the year attributable to the equity shareholders of 
the parent by the weighted average number of shares outstanding during the year.

Diluted earnings per share amounts are calculated by dividing the net profit attributable to the equity shareholders of the parent by the 
weighted average number of shares outstanding during the year plus the weighted average number of shares that would be in issue on 
the conversion of all the dilutive potential shares.

The weighted average number of shares used to calculate both basic and diluted earnings per share exclude shares held in the employee 
benefit trust.

Adjusted earnings are calculated as earnings from continuing operations excluding the amortisation and impairment of acquired 
intangible assets; acquisition items; significant restructuring costs, profit or loss on disposal of operations and the associated taxation 
thereon and in the prior year the increase in the UK’s corporation tax rate from 19% to 25%. The Directors consider that adjusted 
earnings, which constitute an alternative performance measure, represent a more consistent measure of underlying performance as 
it excludes amounts not directly linked with trading. A reconciliation of earnings and the effect on basic and diluted earnings per share 
figures is as follows:

Basic earnings per share

Earnings from continuing operations attributable to owners of the parent
Amortisation and impairment of acquired intangible assets (after tax)
Acquisition transaction costs (after tax)
Adjustments to contingent consideration (after tax)
Release of fair value adjustments to inventory (after tax)
Disposal of operations and restructuring (after tax)
Impact of UK tax rate change

Adjusted earnings attributable to owners of the parent

3 Alternative performance measures
The Board uses certain alternative performance measures to help it effectively monitor the performance of the Group. The Directors 
consider that these represent a more consistent measure of underlying performance by removing items that are not closely related to 
the Group’s trading or operating cash flows. These measures include Return on Total Invested Capital (ROTIC), Return on Capital 
Employed (ROCE), Organic growth at constant currency, net debt, Adjusted operating profit, cash conversion and Adjusted operating 
cash flow.

Note 1 provides further analysis of the adjusting items in reaching adjusted profit measures. Net debt is defined as Borrowings plus Lease 
liabilities net of Cash and bank balances, note 26 provides an analysis of net debt for the year.

1  Adjustments include the amortisation and impairment of acquired intangible assets; acquisition items; and significant restructuring costs and profit or loss on 

disposal of operations. Where after-tax measures, these also include the associated taxation on adjusting items. Note 1 provides more information on these items.

2  Includes goodwill amortised prior to 3 April 2004 and goodwill taken to reserves.
3  The ROTIC and ROCE measures are expressed as a percentage of the average of the current and prior year’s Total Invested Capital and Capital Employed 

respectively. Using an average as the denominator is considered to be more representative. The 1 April 2021 Total Invested Capital and Capital Employed balances 
were £1,572.8m and £389.5m respectively.

4  The ROTIC and ROCE measures are calculated as Adjusted profit after tax divided by Average Total Invested Capital and Adjusted operating profit after share of 

results of associates and lease interest divided by Average Capital Employed, respectively.

3 Alternative performance measures continued
Organic growth at constant currency
Organic growth measures the change in revenue and profit from continuing Group operations. This measure equalises the effect of 
acquisitions by:

a.  removing from the year of acquisition their entire revenue and profit before taxation;

b.  in the following year, removing the revenue and profit for the number of months equivalent to the pre-acquisition period in the prior 

year; and

c.  removing from the year prior to acquisition, any revenue generated by sales to the acquired company which would have been 

eliminated on consolidation had the acquired company been owned for that period.

The results of disposals are removed from the prior period reported revenue and profit before taxation.

Constant currency measures the change in revenue and profit excluding the effects of currency movements. The measure restates the 
current year’s revenue and profit at last year’s exchange rates.

Organic growth at constant currency has been calculated for the Group as follows:

*   Adjustments include the amortisation and impairment of acquired intangible assets, acquisition items, significant restructuring costs and profit or loss on disposal 

of operations. Note 3 provides more information on alternative performance measures.

The Group’s future Effective Tax Rate (ETR) will mainly depend on the geographic mix of profits and whether there are any changes to 
tax legislation in the Group’s most significant countries of operations. The Finance Bill 2021 received Royal Assent on 10 June 2021 and 
included the increase in the UK corporation tax rate from 19% to 25% from 1 April 2023.

On 23 March 2023, the UK Government issued further draft legislation applicable to large multinational groups in relation to a new tax 
framework (part of the Organisation for Economic Co-operation and Development (OECD) BEPS initiative), which introduces a global 
minimum effective tax rate of 15% effective for accounting periods beginning on or after 31 December 2023. The Group monitors income 
tax developments in the territories in which it operates, as well as the applicable accounting standards, to understand their potential 
future impacts.

The Group identifies cash generating units (CGUs) at the operating company level as this represents the lowest level at which cash 
inflows are largely independent of other cash inflows. However, often the goodwill which arises as a result of a business acquisition, will 
benefit more than one CGU and so at acquisition, goodwill is allocated to the groups of CGUs that are expected to benefit from that 
business combination.

Where goodwill has been allocated to a cash-generating unit (CGU) group and part of the operation within that group is disposed 
of, the goodwill associated with the disposed operation must be included in the carrying amount when determining the gain or loss 
on disposal. The amount included is measured on the basis of the relative values of the operation disposed of and the portion of the 
CGU group that is retained.

Before recognition of any impairment losses, the carrying amount of goodwill has been allocated to CGU groups as follows:

11 Goodwill continued
Impairment testing
Goodwill values have been tested for impairment by comparing them against the ‘value in use’ in perpetuity of the relevant CGU group. 
The ‘value in use’ calculations were based on projected cash flows, derived from the latest budgets prepared by management and 
strategic plans approved by the Board, discounted at CGU group specific, risk adjusted, discount rates to calculate their net 
present value.

Key assumptions used in ‘value in use’ calculations
The calculation of ‘value in use’ is most sensitive to the following assumptions:

•  CGU specific operating assumptions that are reflected in the budget period for the financial year to March 2024;
•  Discount rates; and
•  Growth rates used to extrapolate risk adjusted cash flows beyond the forecast period.

CGU specific operating assumptions applicable to the forecasted cash flows for the year to March 2024 relate to revenue forecasts, 
expected project outcomes, forecast operating margins and fixed asset and working capital requirements. The relative value ascribed to 
each assumption will vary between CGUs as the forecasts are built up from the underlying operating companies within each CGU group. 
Consideration has been given to inflation and future cash flows reflect expectations for cost and price increases. 

A short-term growth rate is applied to the March 2024 budget to derive the cash flows arising in the years to March 2025 and March 
2026 based on the average growth rate calculated in the relevant sector strategic plan. A long-term rate is applied to these values for 
the year to March 2027 and onwards capped at the weighted average GDP growth rates of the markets into which that CGU group 
sells. Each year the results of ongoing climate and emerging risk reviews are considered and any potential impact of climate change is 
included in the long-term growth rates where relevant. For example, since April 2021, where any CGU group has exposure to customers 
in the oil and gas industry a reduction to the long-term growth rate has been applied. In the year to 31 March 2023, no additional 
changes were made to the long-term growth rates as a result of these reviews. Immaterial additional capital expenditure to meet the 
Group’s emission targets and physical risks have also been factored into future cash flow estimates. No further significant adjustments 
to future cash flows from climate change are expected and therefore have not been recognised in the calculations. 

Discount rates are based on estimations of the assumptions that market participants operating in similar sectors to Halma would make, 
using the Group’s economic profile as a starting point and adjusting appropriately. The methodology for calculating the discount rate 
has not changed year on year and the market economic data sources are consistent with prior years. The Group has calculated the 
discount rate to be 11.43% (2022: 9.22%). Consistent with previous years this is a notional discount rate, calculated using externally 
published global market assumptions. The discount rate, which is pre-tax and based on short-term variables, may differ from the 
Weighted Average Cost of Capital (WACC). Discount rates are adjusted for economic risks that are not already captured in the specific 
operating assumptions for each CGU group. This results in the impairment testing using discount rates ranging from 10.58% to 13.96% 
(2022: 8.33% to 11.85%) across the CGU groups.

Significant CGU groups
CGU groups to which 10% or more of the total goodwill balance is allocated are deemed to be significant. In addition to the operating 
assumptions, the assumptions used to determine ‘value in use’ for these CGU groups are:

Sensitivity to changes in assumptions
The Directors believe that no reasonably possible change in any of the above key assumptions would cause the carrying value of any 
CGU group to exceed its recoverable amount.

In the prior year, OneThird B.V., issued further new shares to external investors that reduced the Group’s ownership from 35.3% to 30.0%. 
There was a gain of £0.0m on disposal. During the year, One Third B.V. issued a £1.6m (US$2.0m) convertible loan note, and the Group 
took up 50% of the issue at £0.8m (US$1.0m). In February 2023, following a further funding round, the loan notes were converted 
increasing the Group’s equity in the associate with ownership increasing to 31%. The Group have committed to participating in a 
future funding round subject to the company meeting certain performance criteria, this will result in the dilution of the 
investment to 29%. 

One Third B.V has its registered office at Almelosestraat 19, 7495 TG Ambt Delden, Netherlands. The Group owns 20,921 preferred

The Group assesses on a forward-looking basis the expected credit losses associated with its trade and other receivables carried at 
amortised cost.

The Group assessed that no provisions or impairments were required in relation to contract assets (2022: £nil).

The fair value of trade and other receivables approximates to book value due to the short-term maturities associated with these items. 
There is no impairment risk identified with regards to other receivables where no amounts are past due.

In some cases, the Group receives payments from customers based on a billing schedule, as established in our contracts. The contract 
assets relate to revenue recognised for performance in advance of scheduled billing and has increased as the Group has provided more 
services ahead of the agreed payment schedules for certain contracts. The contract liability relates to payments received in advance of 
performance under contract and varies based on performance under these contracts.

20 Provisions continued
Contingent purchase consideration
The provision at the beginning of the year comprised £15.2m, of which £13.2m was payable within one year, included amounts based on 
actual results for the final earnout period for Infowave and Invenio. It also included estimates for the final earnout period for 
Visiometrics, for the year ended 31 December 2018, which is subject to final agreement.

The £4.4m additional provision in the year related to revisions to the estimate of Infinite Leap (£2.7m increase), IZI (£1.4m increase) and 
Meditech (£0.3m increase).

The £4.6m utilised during the year related to the third and final earnout period for Infowave (£1.7m) and Invenio (£0.1m), the first and 
final earnout period for Meditech (£0.4m), the first earnout period for Orca (£0.4m) and the second earnout period for Spreo (£0.2m). In 
addition, retention payment amounts were settled for NovaBone (£0.8m), Dancutter (£0.4m), Anton (£0.2m) and Clayborn Lab (£0.4m). 

The £0.7m released during the year related to the revisions to the estimate of Orca (£0.2m reduction), Clayborn Lab (£0.3m reduction) 
and Spreo (£0.2m reduction).

The closing total provision of £16.4m, of which £13.2m is payable within one year, includes amounts based on actual results for the final 
earnout period for IZI, Spreo and for the second earnout period for Infinite Leap. It also includes estimates for the final earnout period for 
Visiometrics, for the year ended 31 December 2018, which is subject to final agreement.

The balance due after more than one year of £3.2m comprises the estimated future earnout for Infinite Leap.

The total contingent purchase consideration payable in future for the existing acquisitions is a minimum of £2.8m with a maximum 
possible payable of £57.6m.

Contingent consideration amounts paid in excess of that estimated in the acquisition balance sheet is included in cash flows from 
operating activities.

The basis for the calculation of each contingent consideration arrangement is set out on page 229 in note 27, including sensitivity of the 
estimation of the liabilities to changes in the assumptions.

Dilapidations
The dilapidations provisions are for the continuing obligations under leases in respect of property dilapidation and reinstatement 
provisions. The provisions comprise the Directors’ best estimates of future payments to restore the fabric of buildings to their original 
condition where it is a condition of the leases, prior to return of the properties.

These commitments cover the period from 2023 to 2036 though they predominantly fall due within five years.

Product warranty
Product warranty provisions reflect commitments made to customers on the sale of goods in the ordinary course of business and 
included within the Group companies’ standard terms and conditions. The warranties represent assurance type warranties within the 
definition of IFRS 15. Warranty commitments cover a period of between one and five years and typically apply for a 12-month period. 
The provision represents the Directors’ best estimate of the Group’s liability based on past experience.

Legal, contractual and other
Legal, contractual and other provisions comprise mainly amounts reserved against open legal and contractual disputes. The Company 
has on occasion been required to take legal or other actions to defend itself against proceedings brought by other parties. Provisions are 
made for the expected costs associated with such matters, based on past experience of similar items and other known factors, taking 
into account professional advice received, and represent Directors’ best estimate of the likely outcome. The timing of utilisation of these 
provisions is frequently uncertain reflecting the complexity of issues and the outcome of various court proceedings and negotiations. 
Contractual and other provisions represent the Directors’ best estimate of the cost of settling future obligations. Unless specific evidence 
exists to the contrary, these reserves are shown as current. 

However, no provision is made for proceedings which have been or might be brought by other parties against Group companies 
unless the Directors, taking into account professional advice received, assess that it is more likely than not that such proceedings 
may be successful.

Management’s assessment of the potential impacts of climate change, as well as the Group’s climate strategy as laid out on pages 72 
to 87, has not resulted in the recognition of any additional provisions or disclosure of any contingent liabilities.

Deferred taxes in the prior year were restated following the increase in the UK corporation tax rate from 19% to 25%, resulting in a £2.6m 
charge to profit and loss, included as an adjusting item.

Certain deferred tax assets and liabilities have been offset. The following is the analysis of the deferred tax balances (after offset) for 
financial reporting purposes:

It is likely that the unremitted earnings of overseas subsidiaries would qualify for the UK dividend exemption such that no UK tax would 
be due upon remitting those earnings to the UK. However, £123.7m (2022: £112.6m) of those earnings may still result in a tax liability, 
principally as a result of the dividend withholding taxes levied by the overseas jurisdictions in which those subsidiaries operate.

22 Deferred tax continued
These deferred tax liabilities of £8.5m (2022: £7.9m) have not been recognised as the Group is able to control the timing of the reversal of 
these temporary differences and it is probable that they will not reverse in the foreseeable future. Temporary differences in connection 
with the interest in associate are insignificant.

At 31 March 2023, deferred tax assets of £0.4m and £4.9m (£2022: £0.4m and £2.5m) in respect of unused capital tax losses and other 
tax losses have not been recognised.

Share incentive plan
Shares awarded under this Plan are purchased in the market by the Plan’s trustees at the time of the award and are held in trust until 
their transfer to qualifying employees; vesting is conditional upon completion of three years’ service. Forfeited shares are reallocated 
in subsequent grants. The costs of providing this Plan are recognised in the Consolidated Income Statement over the three-year 
vesting period.

Executive share plan (ESP)
Under the ESP, in which Executive Directors and certain senior employees participate, deferred share awards are made as either 
performance awards or deferred awards. Performance awards vest after three years based on Earnings Per Share and Return on Total 
Invested Capital (ROTIC) targets, and after two or three years for deferred share awards based on continuing service of the employee 
only. Awards which do not vest lapse on the second or third anniversary of their grant. Shares awarded under this Plan are purchased in 
the market by the Plan’s trustees and are held as own shares until their transfer to qualifying employees. Under the terms of the trust 
deed, Halma is required to provide the trust with the necessary funds to purchase the shares ahead of vesting. Dividends accrue on 
unvested awards and are settled in cash on vesting.

The following table shows the number of deferred shares granted and outstanding at the beginning and end of the reporting period for 
the ESP:

Included in Retained earnings are accumulated credits of £26.9m (2022: £19.2m) representing the provision for the value of unvested 
awards under the Group's equity settled share plans.

The performance shares outstanding at 31 March 2023 had a weighted average remaining contractual life of 18 months (2022: 
16 months). The weighted average share price at the date of exercise of vested shares during the year was 2,265p (2022: 2,705p). 

The fair value of the awards was calculated using an appropriate simulation method, with the inputs below:

24 Share-based payments continued
Cash-settled
Awards under the above plans are normally settled in shares but may be settled in cash at the Board’s discretion or where required by 
local regulations. Cash-settled awards follow the same vesting conditions as the plans under which they are awarded.

Net settlement feature for withholding tax obligations
On vesting, a debit is recognised to Retained earnings at a weighted average cost of the shares purchased and held for this purpose. 
Shares are transferred from own shares to the qualifying employee. The deferred shares granted under the ESP include a net settlement 
feature under which shares are withheld in order to settle the employee's tax obligations. The Group withholds an amount for an 
employee’s tax obligation associated with a share-based payment and transfers that amount in cash to the relevant tax authority 
on the employee’s behalf. 

Where permitted by local regulations, the Group is settling the deferred share grant on a net basis by withholding the number of shares 
with a fair value equal to the monetary value of the employee’s tax obligation and only issuing the remaining shares on completion of 
the vesting period. An amount of £4.5m was withheld and paid to the taxation authority in relation to the deferred shares that vested 
during the year (2022: £7.1m).

25 Acquisitions
In accounting for acquisitions, adjustments are made to the book values of the net assets of the companies acquired to reflect their fair 
values to the Group. Other previously unrecognised assets and liabilities at acquisition are included and accounting policies are aligned 
with those of the Group where appropriate.

During the year ended 31 March 2023, the Group made seven acquisitions namely:

•  Deep Trekker Inc.;
•  IZI Healthcare Products, LLC;
•  WEETECH Holdings GmbH;
•  Certain trade and assets of Rigaku Corporation;
•  Thermocable (Flexible Elements) Limited;
•  Zonegreen 2013 Ltd; and
•  FirePro Group.

Set out on the following pages are summaries of the assets acquired and liabilities assumed and the purchase consideration of:

a)  the total of acquisitions;

b)  Deep Trekker Inc.;

c)  IZI Healthcare Products, LLC;

d) WEETECH Holding GmbH;

e)  Thermocable (Flexible Elements) Limited; 

f)  FirePro Group;

g)  Other acquisitions; and

h)  adjustments arising on prior year acquisitions.

Due to their contractual dates, the fair value of receivables acquired approximate to the gross contractual amounts receivable. The 
amount of gross contractual receivables not expected to be recovered is immaterial.

There are no material contingent liabilities recognised in accordance with paragraph 23 of IFRS 3 (revised). The acquisitions contributed 
£41.0m of revenue and £7.9m of profit after tax for year ended 31 March 2023.

If these acquisitions had been held since the start of the financial year, it is estimated that the Group’s reported revenue and profit after 
tax would have been £51.6m and £14.9m higher respectively.

As at the date of approval of the financial statements, with the exception of Deep Trekker, the accounting for all other current year 
acquisitions is provisional; relating to the finalisation of the valuation of acquired intangible assets, the initial consideration, which is 
subject to agreement of certain contractual adjustments, and certain other provisional balances.

On 13 April 2022, the Group acquired the entire share capital of Deep Trekker Inc. (Deep Trekker) for total consideration £33.8m (C$55.5m), 
which comprised initial cash consideration of £31.9m (C$52.4m) and net cash/debt adjustments and working capital adjustments of 
£1.9m (C$3.1m). The initial consideration reflects a gross purchase price of £36.6m (C$60.0m) less debt acquired of £4.7m (C$7.6m) 
which was settled immediately post-acquisition. There is no contingent consideration payable. 

Deep Trekker, based in Ontario, Canada, is a market-leading manufacturer of remotely operated underwater robots used for inspection, 
surveying, analysis and maintenance. Deep Trekker continues to run under its own management team and has joined the Environmental 
& Analysis sector. 

On acquisition, acquired intangibles were recognised relating to customer related intangibles (£2.8m); trade name (£3.5m) and 
technology related intangibles (£8.6m). The residual goodwill of £21.5m represents: 

a) the technical expertise of the acquired workforce; 

b) the opportunity to leverage this expertise across some of Halma’s businesses through future technologies; and 

c) the ability to exploit the Group’s existing customer base. 

Deep Trekker contributed £15.1m of revenue and £2.1m of profit after tax for the year ended 31 March 2023. If this acquisition had been 
held since the start of the financial year, it is estimated that the Group’s reported revenue and profit after tax would have been £0.3m 
higher and £0.0m higher respectively. 

Acquisition costs totalling £0.5m were recorded in the Consolidated Income Statement. 

The goodwill arising on this acquisition is not expected to be deductible for tax purposes.

On 30 September 2022, the Group acquired the entire share capital of IZI Medical Products, LLC (IZI), for total consideration of £87.5m 
(US$97.4m). The initial consideration of £84.1m comprised a gross price of £137.9m (US$153.5m) less debt acquired of £53.8m (US$59.9m) 
which was settled immediately on acquisition. Other adjustments to consideration reflected adjustments for acquired working capital 
of £1.9m (US$2.1m). For the acquisition the maximum contingent consideration payable was £13.0m (US$14.5m) based on profit-based 
targets for the year ending 31 March 2023, of which £1.5m (US$1.8m) was estimated as the payable at the acquisition date. 

IZI, based in Baltimore, Maryland, USA, is a leading designer, manufacturer and distributor of medical devices used across a range of 
diagnostic and therapeutic procedures. IZI continues to run under its own management team and has joined the Healthcare sector.

On acquisition, acquired intangibles were recognised relating to customer related intangibles (£19.9m); trade names (£2.6m) and 
technology related intangibles (£41.9m). 

The residual goodwill of £64.3m represents: 

a) the technical expertise of the acquired workforce; 

b) the opportunity to leverage this expertise across some of Halma’s businesses through future technologies; and 

c) the ability to exploit the Group’s existing customer base. 

IZI contributed £15.1m of revenue and £3.2m of profit after tax for the year ended 31 March 2023. If this acquisition had been held since 
the start of the financial year, it is estimated that the Group’s reported revenue and profit after tax would have been £14.2m and £2.5m 
higher respectively. 

Acquisition costs totalling £1.6m were recorded in the Consolidated Income Statement. 

The goodwill arising on the IZI acquisition is expected to be deductible for tax purposes.

On 4 October 2022, the Group acquired the entire share capital of WEETECH Holding GmbH (WEETECH), for total consideration of 
£47.0m (€53.8m), which comprised initial cash consideration of £46.1m (€52.8m) and subsequent working capital adjustments of £0.9m 
(€1.0m). The initial consideration of £46.1m reflects a gross purchase price of £50.2m (€57.5m) less debt acquired of £6.6m (€7.6m) 
which was settled immediately post-acquisition plus other debt-like adjustments of £2.5m (€2.9m). There is no contingent 
consideration payable.

WEETECH, headquartered in Wertheim, Germany, designs and manufactures safety-critical electrical testing technology for the 
aviation, rail, automotive and engineering sectors. Its products ensure high and low voltage electric systems remain compliant 
with increasing safety regulation. WEETECH continues to run under its own management team and has joined the Safety sector.

On acquisition, acquired intangibles were recognised relating to customer related intangibles (£10.9m); trade names (£2.1m) and 
technology related intangibles (£4.6m). 

The residual goodwill of £31.6m represents: 

a) the technical expertise of the acquired workforce; 

b) the opportunity to leverage this expertise across some of Halma’s businesses through future technologies; and 

c) the ability to exploit the Group’s existing customer base. 

WEETECH contributed £8.7m of revenue and £1.8m of profit after tax for the year ended 31 March 2023. If this acquisition had been 
held since the start of the financial year, it is estimated that the Group’s reported revenue and profit after tax would have been £9.3m 
and £1.4m higher respectively. 

Acquisition costs totalling £1.0m were recorded in the Consolidated Income Statement. 

The goodwill arising on the WEETECH acquisition is not expected to be deductible for tax purposes.

which comprised the purchase price of £22.0m and net cash/debt adjustments of £0.5m. There is no contingent consideration payable. 

Thermocable, based in Bradford, UK, is a leading developer and manufacturer of Linear Heat Detectors (LHDs). LHDs are temperature 
sensitive cables, installed in areas at risk of overheating and fire, which trigger an alert when they detect a change of temperature. 
Thermocable has joined the Group as part of the Safety sector fire detection business, Apollo.

On acquisition, acquired intangibles were recognised relating to customer related intangibles (£8.7m); trade name (£1.6m) and 
technology related intangibles (£2.7m). The residual goodwill of £9.4m represents: 

a) the technical expertise of the acquired workforce; 

b) the opportunity to leverage this expertise across some of Halma’s businesses through future technologies; and 

c) the ability to exploit the Group’s existing customer base. 

Thermocable contributed £1.3m of revenue and £0.5m of profit after tax for the year ended 31 March 2023. If this acquisition had been 
held since the start of the financial year, it is estimated that the Group’s reported revenue and profit after tax would have been £5.3m 
higher and £1.5m higher respectively.

cash and debt-free purchase price of £132.0m (€150.0m) and other adjustments of £1.2m (€1.3m). There is no contingent consideration 
payable. Directly or through another company acquired, the acquisition comprised the entire share capital of Skyterra Investments Ltd, 
Nisolio Investments Ltd, P.J.K.A Investments Ltd, FirePro Systems Ltd, Celanova Limited and I.D. Infinity Developments Cyprus Ltd. 

FirePro, based in Cyprus, is a leading designer and manufacturer of aerosol-based fire suppression systems. FirePro continues to run 
under its own management team and has joined the Safety sector. 

On acquisition, acquired intangibles were recognised relating to customer related intangibles (£44.9m); trade name (£7.1m) and 
technology related intangibles (£29.0m). The residual goodwill of £51.2m represents: 

a) the technical expertise of the acquired workforce; 

b) the opportunity to leverage this expertise across some of Halma’s businesses through future technologies; and 

c) the ability to exploit the Group’s existing customer base. 

FirePro contributed £0.4m of revenue and £0.1m of profit after tax for the year ended 31 March 2023. If this acquisition had been held 
since the start of the financial year, it is estimated that the Group’s reported revenue and profit after tax would have been £19.8m higher 
and £9.2m higher respectively. 

Acquisition costs totalling £1.6m were recorded in the Consolidated Income Statement.

On 21 November 2022, Ocean Optics Inc., a photonics technology company in the Group’s Environment and Analysis sector, bought the 
assets and IP associated with laser-induced breakdown spectroscopy from Rigaku Analytical Devices Inc., and Rigaku Americas Holding 
Inc., in the United States for consideration of £1.0m (US$1.1m).

On 8 March 2023, the Group acquired the entire share capital of Zonegreen 2013 Ltd and its subsidiary company, Zonegreen Ltd, for total 
cash consideration of £3.8m. Zonegreen, based in Sheffield, is renowned for its Rail Depot Personnel Protection System (DPPS™) and has 
joined the Group company Sentric, within the Safety sector.

In respect of these acquisitions, the excess of the fair value of the consideration paid over the fair value of the assets acquired is 
represented by customer related intangibles of £0.3m; trade name of £0.3m and technology related intangibles of £0.7m; with residual 
goodwill arising of £2.0m. 

These acquisitions contributed £0.4m of revenue and £0.2m of profit after tax cumulatively for the year ended 31 March 2023. If these 
acquisitions had been held since the start of the financial year, it is estimated that the Group’s reported revenue and profit after tax 
would have been £2.7m and £0.3m higher respectively. 

Acquisition costs totalling £0.2m were recorded in administrative expenses in the Consolidated Income Statement. The goodwill arising 
on these acquisitions is not expected to be deductible for tax purposes.

In finalising the acquisition accounting for the prior year acquisition of International Light Technologies Inc., an adjustment of £0.3m was 
made to include a provision for sales tax on pre-acquisition sales. This resulted in an increase in goodwill of £0.3m.

The adjustment is not material and as such the comparative balance sheet was not restated; instead, the adjustments have been made 
through the current year.

27 Financial instruments

Policy
The Group’s treasury policies seek to minimise financial risks and to ensure sufficient liquidity for the Group’s operations and strategic 
plans. No complex derivative financial instruments are used and derivative transactions are only entered into to hedge known exposures, 
and no trading or speculative transactions in financial instruments are undertaken. Where the Group does use financial instruments, 
these are mainly to manage the currency risks arising from normal operations and its financing. Operations are financed mainly through 
retained profits and, in certain geographic locations, bank borrowings. Foreign currency risk is the most significant aspect for the Group 
in the area of financial instruments. It is exposed to a lesser extent to other risks such as interest rate risk and liquidity risk. The Board 
reviews and agrees policies for managing each of these risks and these policies are summarised below. The Group’s policies have 
remained unchanged since the beginning of the financial year.

Details of the significant accounting policies and methods adopted (including the criteria for recognition, the basis of measurement and 
the bases of recognition of income and expenses) for each class of financial asset, financial liability and equity instrument are disclosed 
in the Accounting Policies note.

Capital risk management
The Group manages its capital to ensure that entities in the Group will be able to continue as going concerns while maximising the 
return to stakeholders through the optimisation of the debt and equity balance. The capital structure of the Group consists of debt, 
which includes the borrowings disclosed in note 19 to the Financial statements, cash and cash equivalents and equity attributable to 
equity holders of the parent, comprising issued capital, reserves and retained earnings as disclosed in the Consolidated Statement of 
Changes in Equity.

The Group is not subject to externally imposed capital requirements.

Foreign currency risk
The Group is exposed to foreign currency risk as a consequence of both trading with foreign companies and owning subsidiaries located 
in foreign countries.

The Group earns a significant proportion of its profit in currencies other than Sterling. This gives rise to translational currency risk, where 
the Sterling value of profits earned by the Group’s foreign subsidiaries fluctuates with the strength of Sterling relative to their operating 
(or ‘functional’) currencies. The Group does not hedge this risk, so its reported profit is sensitive to the strength of Sterling, particularly 
against the US Dollar and Euro. The Group also has transactional currency exposures. These arise on sales or purchases by operating 
companies in currencies other than the companies’ operating (or ‘functional’) currency. Significant sales and purchases are matched 
where possible and a proportion of the net exposure is hedged by means of forward foreign currency contracts.

The Group has significant investments in overseas operations in the US and EU, with further investments in Australia, New Zealand, 
Singapore, Switzerland, Brazil, China and India. As a result, the Group’s balance sheet can be affected by movements in these 
jurisdiction’s exchange rates. Where significant and appropriate, currency denominated net assets are hedged by currency borrowings. 
These currency exposures are reviewed regularly.

Interest rate risk
The Group is exposed to interest rate fluctuations on its borrowings and cash deposits. Where bank borrowings are used to finance 
operations they tend to be short-term with floating interest rates. Longer-term funding is provided by the Group’s bank loan facilities 
which are at floating rates, or by the Group’s fixed rate United States Private Placements completed in November 2015 and May 2022.

Surplus funds are placed on short-term fixed rate deposit or in floating rate deposit accounts.

Credit risk
Credit risk is defined as the risk that a counterparty will default on its contractual obligations resulting in financial loss to the Group. 
The Group has adopted a policy of only dealing with creditworthy counterparties as a means of mitigating the risk of financial loss 
from defaults. Credit ratings are supplied by independent agencies where available, and if not available, the Group uses other publicly 
available financial information and its own trading records to rate its major customers. Credit exposure is controlled by counterparty 
limits that are reviewed regularly.

Trade receivables consist of a large number of customers, spread across diverse industries and geographic areas. Ongoing credit 
evaluation is performed on the financial condition of accounts receivable and, where appropriate, credit guarantee insurance cover 
is purchased.

The carrying amount of trade, tax and other receivables, contract assets, derivative financial instruments and cash of £567.9m 
(2022: £474.7m) represents the Group’s maximum exposure to credit risk as no collateral or other credit enhancements are held.

The credit risk on liquid funds and derivative financial instruments is limited because the counterparties are banks with high credit 
ratings assigned by international credit-rating agencies. There have been no changes to the credit ratings of these counterparties in 
the last financial year.

Liquidity risk
The Group has a syndicated multi-currency revolving credit facility of £550m. The facility, in Sterling, US Dollar, Euro, Australian Dollar 
and Swiss Franc, currently runs to May 2027 with two one-year extension options. Since the end of the year, the first one-year extension 
has been exercised, with the subsequent maturity date of May 2028. 

In May 2023, a new United States Private Placement of £330m was completed, and £35m of the November 2015 United States Private 
Placement remains. These facilities are the main sources of long-term funding for the Group with further detail below in the borrowing 
facilities section.

The financial covenants on the facilities at year-end are for leverage (net debt/adjusted EBITDA) of not more than 3.5 times and for 
adjusted interest cover of not less than four times. All covenants have been complied with. 

The Group has a strong cash flow and the funds generated by operating companies are managed regionally based on geographic location.

Funds are placed on deposit with secure, highly-rated banks. For short-term working capital purposes, some operating companies utilise 
local bank overdrafts. These practices allow a balance to be maintained between continuity of funding, security and flexibility.

Currency exposures
Translational exposures
It is estimated, by reference to the Group’s US Dollar and Euro denominated profits, that a one per cent change in the value of the US 
Dollar relative to Sterling would have had a £2.0m (2022: £1.6m) impact on the Group’s reported profit before tax; and a one per cent 
change in the value of the Euro relative to Sterling would have had a £0.5m (2022: £0.4m) impact on the Group’s profit before tax for 
the year ended 31 March 2023.

Transactional exposures
The Group has net foreign currency monetary assets and liabilities that are assets and liabilities not denominated in the functional 
currency of the underlying company. These comprise cash and overdrafts as well as certain trade receivable and payable balances. 
These foreign currency monetary assets and liabilities give rise to the net currency gains and losses recognised in the Consolidated 
Income Statement as a result of movement in exchange rates. The exposures are predominantly US Dollar and Euro. Group policy 
is for a significant portion of foreign currency exposures, including sales and purchases, to be hedged by forward foreign exchange 
contracts in the company in which the transaction is recorded.

Interest rate risk profile
The Group’s financial assets which are subject to interest rate fluctuations comprise interest-bearing cash equivalents which totalled 
£3.0m at 31 March 2023 (2022: £1.4m). These comprised Sterling denominated bank deposits of £1.0m (2022: £0.3m), and Euro, US Dollar 
and Renminbi bank deposits of £2.0m (2022: £1.1m) which earn interest at local market rates. Cash balances of £166.5m (2022: £156.0m) 
earn interest at local market rates.

The financial liabilities which are subject to interest rate fluctuations comprise bank loans and overdrafts which totalled £301.4m at 
31 March 2023 (2022: £253.9m). Bank loans bear interest at floating rates based either on the EURIBOR or risk-free overnight rates of 
the currency in which the liabilities arise plus a margin. Bank overdrafts bear interest at local market rates. Where interest is based on 
EURIBOR rates the fixed period can be up to six months.

The loan notes related to the United States Private Placement attract interest at a weighted average fixed rate of 2.90%.

The Group’s bank loans are revolving credit facilities and the amount and timing of future payments and drawdowns is unknown. It is 
therefore not possible to calculate the interest arising on these loans and we have therefore not disclosed the maturity of the gross cash 
flows (including interest) in relation to these liabilities.

Borrowing facilities
The Group’s principal sources of long-term funding are its unsecured five-year £550m Revolving Credit Facility, its £330m United States 
Private Placement completed in May 2023 and £35m of United States Private Placement completed in November 2015.

The Revolving Credit Facility was refinanced in May 2022 and matures in May 2027 with two one-year extension options. Since the end 
of the year, the first one-year extension has been exercised, with the subsequent maturity date of May 2028.

The United States Private Placement of £330m was completed in May 2022. The unsecured loan notes were drawn on 12 July 2022 as 
£85m, €160m, US$100m and CHF40m at a weighted average fixed interest rate of 2.81%. The loan notes have yearly maturities from 
year four to year ten, with the first tranche of £48m maturing in July 2026. Interest is payable half yearly. Unsecured loan notes of 
£35m drawn on 6 January 2016 at a fixed interest rate of 3.05% remain outstanding and mature in January 2026.

The Group’s undrawn committed facilities available at 31 March 2023 were £249.6m (2022: £297.4m) which matures between two and 
five years.

The Group has an additional short-term unsecured and committed US bank facility of £6.1m maturing in November 2023. The facility 
was undrawn at 31 March 2023.

Other short-term operational funding is provided by cash generated from operations and by local bank overdrafts. These overdraft 
facilities are uncommitted and are generally renewed on an annual or ongoing basis and hence the facilities expire within one year 
or less.

As part of our cash pooling arrangements UK companies have cross-guaranteed net overdraft facilities of £13.2m (2022: £13.2m). Total 
net overdrafts relating to cash pooling as at 31 March 2023 were £nil (2022: £nil). Total overdrafts for the Group as at 31 March 2023 were 
£1.0m (2022: £0.7m).

Fair values of financial assets and financial liabilities
With the exception of the Group’s fixed rate loan notes, there were no significant differences between the book value and fair value 
(as determined by market value) of the Group’s financial assets and liabilities.

The fair value of floating borrowings approximates to the carrying value because interest rates are reset to market rates at intervals of 
less than one year.

The fair value of the Group’s fixed rate loan notes arising from the United States Private Placement completed in May 2022 is estimated 
to be £349.6m. The fair value is estimated by discounting the future contracted cash flow using readily available market data and 
represents a level 2 measurement in the fair value hierarchy under IFRS 7.

The fair value of derivative financial instruments is estimated by discounting the future contracted cash flow, using readily available 
market data, and represents a level 2 measurement in the fair value hierarchy under IFRS 7.

The fair value of equity investments held at fair value through other comprehensive income is based on the latest observable price 
where available. Where there are no recent observable prices, adjustments are made based on qualitative indicators, such as the 
financial performance of the entity, performance against operational milestones and future outlook. This represents a level 
3 measurement in the fair value hierarchy under IFRS 7.

The fair value of deferred contingent consideration arising on acquisitions is calculated by estimating the possible future cash flows for 
the acquired company identified as best, base and worst-case scenarios, using probability weightings of 25%, 50% and 25% respectively. 
These scenarios are based on management’s knowledge of the business and how the current economic environment is likely to impact 
it. The relevant future cash flows are dependent on the specific terms of the sale and purchase agreement.

Those terms are as follows:

•  Spreo – Based on 30% of qualifying healthcare revenue for the 18-month period from 1 April 2022 to 30 September 2023 up to a 

maximum earnout of US$2.0m (£1.6m).

•  Orca – For the periods ending 31 March 2023 and 31 March 2024 based on 3 times multiple of EBIT above the higher of the target 

threshold of €0.9m (£0.8m) or prior year EBIT. Subject to a maximum overall earnout of €2.5m (£2.1m).

•  Clayborn Lab –For the year ended 30 September 2023 equal to revenue in excess of the higher of an annual revenue target of US$3.5m 

(£2.7m) or the prior period revenue, subject to a maximum of US$1.0m (£0.8m).

•  IZI – Based on 14 times multiple of EBIT between the minimum threshold of US$11.0m (£8.9m) and the maximum threshold of US$12.0m 

(£9.7m) for the period ending 31 March 2023. Subject to a maximum overall earnout of US$14.5m (£11.7m).

•  Infinite Leap – Based on a split of the business between Enterprise Solutions and Prompt Health. For Enterprise Solutions for the year 

ended 30 September 2023 based on 4 times multiple of gross margin above the higher of a target threshold of US$6.1m or the prior year 
gross margin, subject to a maximum of US$6.0m. For Prompt Health for the year ended 30 September 2023 based on 2.3 times 
multiple of gross margin from recurring revenue above the higher of a target threshold of US$4.3m or the prior year gross margin, 
subject to a maximum of US$7.5m. For Prompt Health for the year ended 30 September 2024 based on 2 times multiple of gross margin 
from recurring revenue above the prior year gross margin subject to a maximum of US$4.0m.

This calculation represents a level 3 measurement in the fair value hierarchy under IFRS 7. The fair value is sensitive to the weighting 
assigned to the expected future cash flows. For those earnouts where the payable is based on expectations of future cash flows, a 
change in weighting of 10 percentage points towards the best-case scenario would result in an increase in the estimate of future cash

Classification of financial assets and liabilities
All financial assets and liabilities, with the exception of financial assets at fair value through other comprehensive income, derivatives 
and contingent purchase consideration, are classified as amortised cost for accounting purposes.

Derivatives in a hedging relationship are classified as cash flow hedging instruments. Derivatives not in a hedging relationship are 
classified as fair value through profit or loss.

Contingent purchase consideration is classified as fair value through profit or loss.

Hedging
The Group’s policy is to hedge significant sales and purchases denominated in foreign currency using forward currency contracts. 
These instruments are initially recognised at fair value, which is typically £nil, and subsequent changes in fair value are taken to the 
Consolidated Income Statement, unless hedge accounted.

The following table details the foreign currency contracts outstanding as at the year end, which mostly mature within one year and, 
therefore, the cash flows and resulting effect on profit and loss are expected to occur within the next 12 months:

The fair values of the forward contracts are disclosed as a £1.5m (2022: £0.7m) asset and £0.9m (2022: £0.9m) liability in the Consolidated 
Balance Sheet. Of the £6.7m (2022: £3.4m) of open contracts for other currencies not in a designated cash flow hedge £5.0m (2022: £nil) 
relates to a Swiss Franc contract for expected repayment of intercompany loan balances.

Any movements in the fair values of the contracts in a designated cash flow hedge are recognised in equity until the hedged transaction

Hedge effectiveness is determined at the inception of the hedge relationship, and through periodic prospective effectiveness 
assessments to ensure that an economic relationship exists between the hedged item and hedging instrument.

There was no ineffectiveness arising with regards to net investment hedges or forward contracts in a designated cash flow hedge.

The foreign currency forwards are denominated in the same currency as the highly probable future transactions. With the exception 
of currency exposures, the disclosures in this note exclude short-term receivables and payables. 

Market risk
The Group’s activities expose it primarily to the financial risks of changes in foreign currency exchange rates. The Group enters into 
financial instruments to manage its exposure to foreign currency risk, including:

•  forward foreign exchange contracts to hedge the exchange rate risk arising on the export of goods to and from the USA, Mainland 

Europe and the UK; and

•  foreign exchange loans to hedge the exchange rate risk arising on translation of the Group’s investment in foreign operations which 

have the Euro, US Dollar, Australian Dollar and Swiss Franc as their functional currencies.

Bank loans and loan notes with a carrying value set out in the table on page 228 as well as non-GBP intercompany loans are used as 
net investment hedges for foreign currency net assets with carrying value of €323.4m (2022: €105.0m), US$200.0m (2022: US$196.5m), 
CHF75.0m (2022: CHF22.1m) and NZ$11.7m (2022: NZ$11.3m). The hedging ratio was 1:1. The change in the carrying value of the 
borrowings that was recognised in other comprehensive income was a loss of £7.4m (2022: loss of £8.6m).

Market risk exposures are measured using sensitivity analysis as described below.

There has been no change to the Group’s exposure to market risks or in the manner in which these risks are managed and measured.

Foreign currency sensitivity analysis
The Group is mainly exposed to the currency of the US (US Dollar) and the currency of Mainland Europe (Euro).

The carrying amount of the Group’s US Dollar and Euro denominated monetary assets and monetary liabilities at the reporting date are 
as follows:

The profit sensitivity arises mainly from the translation of overseas profits earned during the year. 10% is the sensitivity rate which 
management assesses to be a reasonably possible change in foreign exchange rates. The Group’s profit sensitivity has increased against 
the US Dollar because more of the Group’s profits is earned in this currency.

Extension options
Some leases of buildings contain extension options exercisable by the Group before the end of the non-cancellable contract period. 
Where practical, the Group seeks to include extension options in new leases to provide operational flexibility. The extension options held 
are exercisable only by the Group and not the lessors. For extension options exercisable within five years of commencement the Group 
assesses at lease commencement whether it is reasonably certain to exercise the extension options. For options that are exercisable 
more than five years from commencement the Group assesses whether it is reasonably certain to exercise the option when this option 
becomes exercisable within five years. The Group will also reassess whether it is reasonably certain to exercise the option where there 
is a significant event or change in circumstances within its control.

As at 31 March 2023, potential future cash outflows of £12.6m (undiscounted) (2022 restated: £13.7m) have not been included in the 
lease liability because it is not reasonably certain that the leases will be extended. During the current year the financial effect of revising 
lease terms to reflect the exercising of extension and termination options was an increase in recognised lease liabilities and right-of-use 
assets of £0.0m (2022: £0.1m). No other lease modifications occurred during the year.

The future cash outflows relating to leases that have not yet commenced are £0.7m (2022: £0.0m).

29 Retirement benefits
Group companies operate both defined benefit and defined contribution pension plans. The Halma Group Pension Plan and the Apollo 
Pension and Life Assurance Plan (both UK) have defined benefit sections with assets held in separate trustee administered funds. Both 
of these sections had already closed to new entrants in 2002/03 and closed to future benefit accruals from December 2014. From that 
date, the former defined benefit members could join the defined contribution section within the Halma Group Pension Plan (which has 
now been superseded by a defined contribution Master Trust with Aegon).

Overseas subsidiaries have adopted mainly defined contribution plans, with the exception of small defined benefit plans in the Swiss 
entities of Medicel AG and Robutec AG.

Total pension costs of £18.2m (2022: £14.2m) recognised in employee costs (note 7), comprise £17.7m (2022: £13.7m) related to defined 
contribution plans and £0.5m (2022: £0.5m) related to defined benefit plans, including administration expenses of £nil (2022: £nil).

Defined contribution plans
The amount charged to the Consolidated Income Statement in respect of defined contribution plans was £17.7m (2022: £13.7m) and 
represents contributions payable to these plans by the Group at rates specified in the rules of the plans. The assets of the plans are 
held separately from those of the Group in funds under the control of asset managers or trustees. 

Defined benefit plans
The Group’s significant defined benefit plans were for qualifying employees of its UK subsidiaries. Under the plans, members are entitled 
to retirement benefits of up to two-thirds of final pensionable salary on attainment of a retirement age of 60, for former members 
of the Executive Board, and 65, for all other qualifying employee members. No other post-retirement benefits are provided. The plans 
are funded plans.

The most recent actuarial valuation of the Halma Group Pension Plan was carried out for the Trustees of the Plan as at 30 November 
2020 by Mr M Whitcombe, Fellow of the Institute and Faculty of Actuaries, of Mercer Limited. The present value of the liabilities was 
measured using the Projected Unit method. This method is an accrued benefits valuation method in which the plan liabilities include 
an allowance for projected earnings.

The most recent actuarial valuation of the Apollo Pension and Life Assurance Plan was carried out for the Trustees of the Plan as at 
1 April 2021 by Mr M Whitcombe, Fellow of the Institute and Faculty of Actuaries, also of Mercer Limited. The same Projected Unit 
method was used.

The plans’ triennial actuarial valuation reviews, rather than the accounting basis, are used to evaluate the level of any cash payments 
into the plan. Based on these valuations, the Trustees of the UK plans, having consulted with the Group, agreed past service deficit 
recovery payments to be made for the immediate future with the objective of funding the plans in excess of the Technical Provisions 
valuation. During the year ended 31 March 2023, the aggregate payments made since the last triennial actuarial valuation, coupled 
with the performance of the plan assets and movement in the liabilities resulted in the Halma Group Pension Plan being funded over 
the trustees’ secondary funding target and closer to the expected current valuation on a solvency basis. As a result, it has been agreed 
with the trustees of the Halma Group Pension Plan that contributions will be suspended until April 2025, when they will either fall due or 
be superseded by cash contributions agreed with the trustees in respect of the latest triennial actuarial valuation. As a result, we expect 
contributions to the UK plans in the 2024 financial year to be £3.6m, relating specifically to the Apollo Pension and Life Assurance Plan.

An alternative to the Projected Unit method is a valuation on a solvency basis, which is an estimate of the cost of buying out benefits 
with a suitable insurance company. This amount represents the amount that would be required to settle the plan liabilities rather than 
the Group continuing to fund the ongoing liabilities of the Plans. Following the last triennial actuarial valuation the estimate of the 
solvency liability was £106.1m as at 30 November 2020 for the Halma Group Pension Plan and £44.1m as at 1 April 2021 for the Apollo 
Pension and Life Assurance Plan.

These sensitivities have been calculated to show the impact on the plan liabilities in isolation and assume no other changes in market 
conditions at the reporting date. This may not be representative of the actual change as the changes in assumptions would likely not 
occur in isolation – for example, a change in discount rate is unlikely to occur without any movement in the value of the assets held by 
the Group’s Schemes.

Assets in the non-UK plans are primarily insurance assets.

In conjunction with the trustees, the Group conducts asset-liability reviews for its defined benefit pension plan. The results of these 
reviews are used to assist the trustees and the Group to determine the optimal long-term asset allocation with regard to the structure 
of the liabilities of the plan. They are also used to assist the trustees in managing the volatility in the underlying investment performance 
and risk of a significant decrease in the defined benefit asset by providing information used to determine the plan’s investment strategy.

As a consequence, the Group is progressively giving more emphasis to a closer return matching of plan assets and liabilities, both to 
ensure the long-term security of its defined benefit commitment and to reduce earnings and balance sheet volatility.

Based on the most recent actuarial valuations and agreements with the plan trustees, the estimated amount of contributions expected 
to be paid to the UK and Swiss plans during the year ended 31 March 2024 is £4.2m.

The levels of contributions are based on the current service cost and the expected future cash flows of the defined benefit pension plans. 
The Group estimates the plan liabilities on average to fall due over 20 and 25 years, respectively, for the Halma and Apollo plans.

The Group has considered the requirements of IFRIC 14 with respect to the UK plans and has determined that it has an unconditional 
right to a refund under the plans and therefore IFRIC 14 does not have any practical impact on the plans and so no allowance for it 
(and, in particular, no allowance for the asset ceiling) has been made in the calculated figures.

The expected maturity analysis of the undiscounted pension obligation for the next 10 years is as follows:

30 Disposal of operations
In the prior year, in August 2021, the Group disposed of its entire interest in Texecom Limited. Cash received on disposal of operations 
in the prior year of £57.5m comprised proceeds from the sale of £64.8m, less £4.5m of cash disposed and £2.8m of disposal costs. 
The Group recognised a profit on disposal of operations of £34.0m.

31 Contingent liabilities
Group financing exemptions applicable to UK controlled foreign companies
On 2 April 2019, the European Commission (EC) published its final decision that the United Kingdom controlled Foreign Company Partial 
Exemption (FCPE) constitutes State Aid. As previously reported, the Group has benefited from the FCPE, which amounts to £15.4m of 
tax for the period from 1 April 2013 to 31 December 2018.

Appeals had been made by the UK Government, the Group and other UK-based groups to annul the EC decision. On 8 June 2022, 
the EU General Court delivered its decision in favour of the EC. In August 2022, the UK Government appealed this decision.

Notwithstanding this appeal, under EU law, the UK Government is required to commence collection proceedings. In January 2021, 
the Group received a Charging Notice from HM Revenue & Customs (HMRC) for £13.9m assessed for the period from 1 April 2016 to 
31 December 2018. The Group appealed against the notice but, as there is no right of postponement, the amount charged was paid in 
full in February 2021 with a further £0.8m of interest paid in May 2021. In February 2021, the Group received confirmation from HMRC 
that it was not a beneficiary of State Aid for the period from 1 April 2013 to 31 March 2016.

Whilst the EU General Court was in favour of the EC, the Group's assessment is that there are strong grounds for appeal and the appeal 
is expected to be successful. As the amounts paid are expected to be fully recovered, and given the appeal process is expected to take 
more than a year, the Group continues to recognise a receivable of £14.7m (31 March 2022: £14.7m) on the Consolidated Balance Sheet 
within non-current assets.

Other contingent liabilities
The Group has widespread global operations and is consequently a defendant in legal, tax and customs proceedings incidental to those 
operations. In addition, there are contingent liabilities arising in the normal course of business in respect of indemnities, warranties and 
guarantees. These contingent liabilities are not considered to be unusual or material in the context of the normal operating activities of 
the Group. Provisions have been recognised in accordance with the Group accounting policies where required. None of these claims are 
expected to result in a material gain or loss to the Group.

32 Events subsequent to end of reporting period
On 24 April 2023, Minicam Inc., a company in the Group’s Environmental & Analysis sector purchased its US service and distribution 
partner, Visual Imaging Resources LLC, for initial consideration of c.£2.3m (US$2.8m), and an earnout based on gross margin of a 
maximum of £1.0m (US$1.2m) per year for three years. 

On 4 May 2023, completing on 11 May 2023, the Group acquired the entire share capital of Sewertronics Sp. Z o.o. (Sewertronics), 
based in Rzeszów, Poland for a cash consideration of c.£36m (€41m) on a cash and debt-free basis. Additional consideration of up to 
c.£16m (€18m) may be payable in cash, based on the fulfilment of certain conditions. Sewertronics' technology repairs and rehabilitates 
wastewater pipelines without the need to dig a trench, by inserting a lining into the pipe, which is then cured using its innovative and 
patented ultraviolet (UV) LED technology. Sewertronics will be part of Halma’s Environmental & Analysis sector. As part of the 
acquisition a drawdown was made from the Group’s Revolving Credit Facility of £26.7m (€30.3m). 

A detailed purchase price allocation exercise is currently being performed to calculate the goodwill arising on these acquisitions.

There were no other known material non-adjusting events which occurred between the end of the reporting period and prior to the 
authorisation of these financial statements on 15 June 2023.

C1 Accounting policies 
Corporate Information
Halma plc (the Company) is a public limited company incorporated and domiciled in England, United Kingdom (registration number 
00040932). The registered address of the Company is Misbourne Court, Rectory Way, Amersham, Buckinghamshire, HP7 0DE, 
United Kingdom.

Basis of preparation
The separate Company financial statements are presented as required by the Companies Act 2006 and have been prepared on the 
historical cost and going concern basis, and in accordance with Financial Reporting Standard 101 ‘Reduced Disclosure Framework’ except 
for the revaluation of certain financial instruments, pension assets and contingent purchase consideration at fair value as permitted by 
the Companies Act 2006.

The principal accounting policies have been applied consistently in both the current and prior year.

Financial reporting standard 101 – reduced disclosure exemptions

The Company has taken advantage of the following disclosure exemptions under FRS 101:

•  the requirements of paragraphs 45(b) and 46–52 of IFRS 2 Share-based payment;
•  the requirements of IFRS 7 Financial Instruments: Disclosures;
•  paragraph 79(a)(iv) of IAS 1;
•  paragraph 73(e) of IAS 16 Property, Plant and Equipment;
•  paragraph 118(e) of IAS 38 Intangible Assets;
•  the requirements of paragraphs 10(d), 10(f), 16, 38A, 38B, 38C, 38D, 40A, 40B, 40C, 40D,111 and 134–136 of IAS 1 Presentation of 

Financial Statements;

•  the requirements of paragraph 52, the second sentence of paragraph 89, and paragraphs 90, 91 and 93 of IFRS 16 Leases;
•  the requirements of paragraph 58 of IFRS 16;
•  the requirements of IAS 7 Statement of Cash Flows and related notes;
•  the effects of new but not yet effective IFRS;
•  the requirements of paragraphs 30 and 31 of IAS 8 Accounting Policies, Changes in Accounting Estimates and Errors;
•  the requirements in IAS 24 Related Party Disclosures to disclose related party transactions entered into between two or more members 

of a group, provided that any subsidiary which is a party to the transaction is wholly owned by such a member; and

•  paragraph 17 of IAS 24, ‘Related party disclosures’ (key management compensation).

New Standards and Interpretations applied for the first time in the year ended 31 March 2023
The following Standards and Interpretations applied for the first time, with effect from 1 January 2022, and have been adopted in the 
preparation of these Company Accounts;

•  Reference to the Conceptual Framework – Amendments to IFRS 3 
•  Property, Plant and Equipment: Proceeds before Intended Use – Amendments to IAS 16
•  Onerous Contracts – Costs of Fulfilling a Contract – Amendments to IAS 37
•  Annual Improvements to IFRS 2018– 2020

None of the above mentioned new Standards and Interpretations have affected the Company’s results.

Significant accounting judgements and estimates
In preparing the financial statements, management has made judgements, estimates and assumptions that affect the application of 
the Company’s accounting policies and the reported amounts of assets, liabilities, income and expenses. Actual results may differ from 
these estimates. Estimates and assumptions are reviewed on an ongoing basis and are based on historical experience and various other 
factors that are believed to be reasonable under the circumstances.

Significant accounting estimates are used in determining the value of the future defined benefit obligation which requires estimation in 
respect of the assumptions used to calculate present values. These include future mortality, discount rate and inflation. Management 
determines these assumptions in consultation with an independent actuary. Details of the estimates made in calculating the defined 
benefit obligation are disclosed in note 29 to the Group accounts, specifically page 234.

The Company’s investments are assessed each reporting period for any indicators of impairment, both qualitative and quantitative. If 
there are deemed to be any indicators of impairment a ‘value in use’ calculation is performed. Where required, the ‘value in use’ 
calculation requires the Company to estimate the future cash flows expected to arise from the investments and apply suitable discount 
rates in order to calculate present values.

There are no significant judgements used by management in preparing the Company’s financial statements.

Summary of significant accounting policies
Foreign currencies
Transactions in foreign currency are recorded at the rate of exchange at the date of the transaction. Monetary assets and liabilities 
denominated in foreign currencies at the balance sheet date are reported at the rates prevailing at that date. Any gain or loss arising 
from subsequent exchange rate movements is included as an exchange gain or loss in the Profit and Loss Account.

Financial Instruments
The Company recognises financial instruments when it becomes a party to the contractual arrangements of the instrument. Financial 
instruments are de-recognised when they are discharged or when the contractual terms expire. The Company’s accounting policies in 
respect of financial instruments transactions are explained below:

Halma plc |  Annual Report and Accounts 2023 

  241

Notes to the Company Accounts continued

C1 Accounting policies continued
Financial assets
The Company recognises its financial assets into one of the categories discussed below, depending on the purpose for which the asset 
was acquired.

Other than the financial assets in a qualifying hedging relationship, the Company’s accounting policy for each category is as follows:

Fair value through profit or loss – Derivative financial instruments are carried in the balance sheet at fair value with changes in fair value 
recognised in the Profit and Loss Account.

Amortised costs – Loans and receivables are non-derivative financial assets with fixed or determinable payments that are not quoted in 
an active market. They arise principally through the provision of goods and services to customers (other group companies), but also 
incorporate other types of contractual monetary asset. They are initially recognised at fair value plus transaction costs that are directly 
attributable to their acquisition or issue and are subsequently carried at amortised cost using the effective interest rate method, less 
provision for impairment.

The Company’s receivables relate entirely to balances due from other group companies. Where the intercompany receivable is payable 
on demand the Company determines whether any impairment provision is required by assessing the Company’s ability to repay the 
loan. Where it is considered that the Company does not have the capacity to repay the loan or the loan is not repayable on demand, 
an expected credit loss model is used to calculate the impairment provision required.

Financial liabilities
The Company classifies its financial liabilities into one of the categories discussed below, depending on the purpose for which the liability 
was acquired.

Fair value through profit or loss – These comprise out-of-the-money derivatives and contingent purchase consideration. They are carried 
in the balance sheet at fair value with changes in fair value recognised in the Profit and Loss Account.

At amortised cost – Financial liabilities at amortised cost including bank borrowings are initially recognised at fair value. Such interest-
bearing liabilities are subsequently measured at amortised cost using the effective interest rate method.

Interest bearing loans and borrowings
Interest bearing loans and borrowings are initially recognised in the balance sheet at fair value less directly attributable transaction costs 
and are subsequently measured at amortised cost using the effective interest rate method.

Share-based payments
The cost of the equity-settled transactions with employees of other Group companies is measured by reference to the fair value at the 
date at which equity instruments are granted and, where it is not recharged to a Group company, is recognised as a capital contribution 
in investments in subsidiary undertakings over the vesting period, which ends on the date on which the employees become fully entitled 
to the award. A corresponding credit is recognised within equity. This credit is not distributable. 

Investments
Investments are stated at cost less provision for impairment. In respect of IFRS 2 ‘Share-based payments’, the Company records an 
increase in its investment in subsidiaries to reflect the share-based compensation recorded by its subsidiaries.

Fixed assets and depreciation
Fixed assets are stated at cost less provisions for impairment and depreciation which, with the exception of freehold land which is not 
depreciated, is provided on all fixed assets on the straight-line method, each item being written off over its estimated life. The principal 
annual rates used for this purpose are:

Freehold property

Plant, equipment and vehicles

2%

8% to 33.3%

Pensions
The Company makes contributions to defined contribution pension plans, which are charged against profits when they become payable. 
The Company also operates a UK defined benefit pension plan. For defined benefit plans, the asset or liability recorded in the Company 
Balance Sheet is the difference between the fair value of the plan’s assets and the present value of the defined obligation at that date. 
The defined benefit obligation is calculated separately for the plan on an annual basis by an independent actuary using the projected 
unit credit method.

Actuarial gains and losses are recognised in full in the year in which they occur, and are taken to other comprehensive income.

Current and past service costs, along with the impact of settlements or curtailments, are charged to profit and loss. The unwinding of 
the discounting on the net liability is recognised within finance income or expense as appropriate.

Taxation
Tax on the profit or loss for the year comprises both current and deferred tax. Tax is recognised in the Profit and Loss Account except to 
the extent that it relates to items recognised either in other comprehensive income or directly in equity.

Current tax is the expected tax payable, on the taxable income for the year, using tax rates enacted, or substantively enacted, at the 
balance sheet date, and any adjustments to tax payable in respect of previous years.

Deferred taxation is provided on taxable temporary differences between the carrying amounts of assets and liabilities in the financial 
statements and their corresponding tax bases. Deferred tax is measured at the tax rates that are expected to apply in the periods in 
which the temporary differences are expected to reverse, based on tax rates and laws that have been enacted or substantively enacted 
by the balance sheet date. Deferred tax assets are only recognised if recovery is considered more likely than not on the basis of all 
available evidence.

The recognition of deferred tax assets is dependent on assessments of future taxable income.

The increase of £83.0m in the year comprises additions from the acquisition of Thermocable (Flexible Elements) Limited of £22.5m and 
Zone Green 2013 Ltd of £3.9m and additional investments into existing subsidiaries Halma Euro Trading Limited of £52.1m and Halma 
Ventures Limited of £4.5m. 

In the prior year, the increase £132.6m comprised additions from the acquisition of Anton Industrial Services Limited of £3.2m and Ashton 
Lister Investments Limited (parent of Ramtech Electronics Limited) of £19.6m and additional investments into existing subsidiary Halma 
Euro Trading Limited of £109.8m. 

Capital contributions to subsidiary undertakings of £40.3m were recorded in the year pertaining to the current year and previous 
periods. These capital contributions arise where equity-settled share awards in the Company were granted to employees of subsidiary 
undertakings and no recharge was made to that subsidiary. More detail on the Company’s share plans can be found in note 24 to the 
Consolidated Accounts. Capital contributions are not realised profits and so are non-distributable retained earnings for the Company 
until such time as they are realised either through impairment of the investment or sales of the relevant subsidiary. The contribution in 
the year of £40.3m comprises £32.0m in relation to prior years which management do not consider quantitively or qualitatively material 
in the context of the Company’s distributable reserves and so has not been recognised as a prior year adjustment.

The Company has two sources of long-term funding, which comprise:

•  an unsecured five-year £550m Revolving Credit Facility, which expires in May 2027 and is therefore classified as expiring within two to 

five years (2022: within two to five years). Since the end of the year, the first one-year extension has been exercised, with the subsequent 
maturity date of May 2028. At 31 March 2023, £249.6m (2022: £297.4m) remained committed and undrawn, and

•  unsecured loan notes completed in May 2022 and drawn on 12 July 2022 in a mix of Sterling, US Dollars, Euro and Swiss Francs with a 10 
year final maturity, amortising from year four to year ten and an average maturity of seven years. In addition, unsecured loan notes of 
£35m completed in November 2015 and drawn on 6 January 2016 remain outstanding and mature in January 2026. At 31 March 2023, 
the outstanding loan notes totalled £376.9m (2022: £106.2m). The next tranche of loan notes is due in January 2026, as such all loan 
notes are classified as falling due after more than one year.

The bank overdrafts, which are unsecured, at 31 March 2023 and 31 March 2022 were drawn on uncommitted facilities which all 
expire within one year and were held pursuant to a Group pooling arrangement which offsets them against credit balances in 
subsidiary undertakings.

As part of our cash pooling arrangements UK companies have cross-guaranteed net overdraft facilities of £13.2m (2022: £13.2m). 
Total net overdrafts relating to cash pooling as at 31 March 2023 were £nil (2022: £nil). Total overdrafts for the Group as at 31 March 2023 
were £1.0m (2022: £0.7m).

The number of ordinary shares in issue at 31 March 2023 was 379,645,332 (2022: 379,645,332), including shares held by the Employee 
Benefit Trust of 1,901,415 (2022: 1,175,080).

C12 Reserves
The Capital redemption reserve was created on the repurchase and cancellation of the Company’s own shares. Own shares are ordinary 
shares in Halma plc purchased by the Company and held to fulfil its obligations under the Group’s share plans. Profits available for 
distributions are reduced by the value of Own shares.

Included in the profit and loss account are accumulated credits of £26.9m (2022: £19.2m) representing the provision for the value of 
unvested awards under the Group's equity settled share plans.

C13 Retirement benefits
The Company participates in, and is the sponsoring employer of, the Halma Group Pension Plan. The plan closed to new entrants in 
2002/03 and to future benefit accrual in 2014/15. From that date, the former defined benefit members joined the Company’s existing 
defined contribution plan (which has now been superseded by a defined contribution Master Trust with Aegon).

There is no contractual agreement or stated policy for charging the net defined benefit cost within the Group. In accordance with 
IAS 19 (Revised 2011), the Company contribution made to the defined benefit plan during the year ended 31 March 2023 was £4.4m 
(2022: £3.1m).

Net interest income on pension plan liabilities/assets of £0.9m (2022: net interest charge of £0.1m) was recognised in the Profit and Loss 
Account in respect of the Company defined benefit plan.

The net movement on actuarial gains and losses of the plan reported in the Company Statement of Comprehensive Income and 
Expenditure was as follows:

Defined benefit obligations
Fair value of plan assets

Net actuarial (losses)/gains

The actual return on plan assets was a loss of £53.9m (2022: gain of £8.4m).

The cash contributions of £10.5m include a £1.3m contribution related to Texecom in respect of obligations under section 75 of the 
Pensions Act 1995 following its disposal in the prior year (see Note 30 to the Consolidated Accounts).

The plan's triennial actuarial valuation review, rather than the accounting basis, is used to evaluate the level of any cash payments into 
the plan. Based on this valuation, the Trustees having consulted with the Company, agreed past service deficit recovery payments to be 
made for the immediate future with the objective of funding the plans in excess of the Technical Provisions valuation. During the year 
ended 31 March 2023 the aggregate payments made since the last triennial actuarial valuation, coupled with the performance of the 
plan assets and movement in the liabilities resulted in the Halma Group Pension Plan being funded over the trustees’ secondary funding 
target and closer to the expected current valuation on a solvency basis. As a result, it has been agreed with the trustees of the Halma 
Group Pension Plan that contributions will be suspended until April 2025, when they will either fall due or be superseded by cash 
contributions agreed with the trustees in respect of the latest triennial actuarial valuation.

Further details of Halma Group Pension Plan, including all disclosures required under FRS 101, are contained in note 29 to the 
Group accounts.

C14 Events subsequent to end of reporting period
On 4 May 2023, completing on 11 May 2023, Halma International Limited, a direct subsidiary of the Company, acquired the entire share

All years are presented under IFRS.

Notes:
1  Continuing and discontinued operations.
2  Adjusted to remove the amortisation and impairment of acquired intangible assets and acquisition transaction costs, release of fair value adjustments to inventory, 
adjustments to contingent consideration (collectively ‘acquisition items’), significant restructuring costs and profit or loss on disposal of operations. IFRS figures 
include results of operations up to the date of their sales or closure but exclude material discontinued and continuing profits on sales or closures of operations. 
In 2013/14 only, the effects of closure to future benefit accrual of the defined benefit pension plans have also been removed. In 2018/19, the adjustments also 
include the effect of equalising pension benefits for men and women in the Group’s defined benefit pension plans.

3  Return on Sales is defined as profit before taxation, the amortisation and impairment of acquired intangible assets; acquisition items; restructuring costs, profit 

or loss on disposal of operations; the effect of equalising pension benefits for men and women in the defined benefit pension plans (2018/19 only); and the effects 
of closure to future benefit accrual of the defined benefit pension plans net of associated costs (2013/14 only) expressed as a percentage of revenue.

4  See note 3 to the Report and Accounts for the definitions of ROCE and ROTIC. The ROCE and ROTIC measures were restated in 2014/15 and for all prior years 

to use an average Capital Employed and Total Invested Capital respectively. This measure is considered to be more representative. From 2019/20 the measures 
include the impact of adopting IFRS 16 ‘Leases’. There is no material impact on either measure from its inclusion.

5  The 2015/16 figures were restated in 2016/17, as required by IFRS 3 (revised) ‘Business Combinations’, for material changes arising on the provisional accounting 

for acquisitions in 2014/15.

into their bank or building society account by completing a 
bank mandate form. The advantages to using this service are: 
the payment is more secure than sending a cheque through 
the post; it avoids the inconvenience of paying in a cheque

Dividend reinvestment plan
The Company operates a dividend reinvestment plan (DRIP) which 
offers shareholders the option to elect to have their cash dividends 
reinvested in Halma ordinary shares purchased in the market. 
You can register for the DRIP online by visiting Computershare’s 
Investor Centre website (as above) or by requesting an application 
form direct from Computershare.

Shareholders who wish to elect for the DRIP for the forthcoming 
final dividend, but have not already done so, should return a DRIP 
application form to Computershare no later than 28 July 2023.

Electronic communications
All shareholder communications, including the Company’s Annual 
Report and Accounts, are made available to shareholders on the 
Halma website and you may opt to receive email notification that 
documents and information are available to view and download 
rather than to receive paper copies through the post. Using 
electronic communications helps us to limit the amount of 
paper we use and assists us in reducing our costs.

If you would like to sign up for this service, visit Computershare’s 
Investor Centre website. You may change the way you receive 
communications at any time by contacting Computershare.
