Description 
Our corporate and customer carbon 
emissions cover our own operations under 
Scope 1 and 2 and our customer emissions 
under Scope 3. We have visibility of 81 per 
cent of the energy use from our buildings by 
floorspace. For buildings where we do not 
receive data we have estimated energy use. 
Our science-based targets commit us to 
reducing the absolute corporate and 
customer carbon emissions of our portfolio 
by 42 per cent by 2030 (compared to a 
2020 baseline of 312,115 tCO2e), in line with 
a 1.5 degree scenario.

Description 
Under standard market lease terms we do 
not have automatic visibility of customer 
energy usage data. We recognise the 
importance of having good visibility of this 
data so we can accurately assess our Scope 
3 emissions and help our customers to 
reduce their own carbon footprint as well as 
improving their energy efficiency. We are 
therefore proactively engaging with our 
customers, requesting access to this data 
and have introduced green clauses requiring 
energy use visibility to all new leases.

Description 
Now that we have launched 12 Community 
Investment Plans (CIPs) across many of 
our key markets we have turned our focus 
towards the implementation of them. 
We are therefore measuring the number 
of employees who volunteered in projects 
(including on our annual Day of Giving). 

Our performance 
During 2023, we reduced the corporate 
and customer emissions of our portfolio 
to 254,168 tCO2e (2022: 272,318 tCO2e), 
reflecting a 19 per cent improvement from 
the baseline. This reduction was largely 
due to us having an increased amount of 
customer energy data (both their usage 
and also the type of energy sourced, 
i.e. renewable).

1 Percentage valuation movement during the period 
based on the difference between opening and 
closing valuations for all properties including 
buildings under construction and land, adjusting 
for capital expenditure, acquisitions and disposals. 
The valuation movement cannot be directly derived 
from the Financial Statements and is calculated to 
be comparable with published MSCI Real Estate 
indices against which SEGRO is measured. 
Table 3 on page 187 provides a reconciliation 
to the Financial Statements.

Warehouse property values saw modest 
declines during 2023, as higher interest rates 
and uncertainty over the future trajectory for 
interest rates continued to impact investors’ 
appetite for real estate assets. Investment 
market volumes remained low and yields 
expanded further, although at a much 
slower pace than during 2022. 

Occupier markets continued to perform well 
and although macroeconomic uncertainty 
contributed to take-up returning closer to 
pre-pandemic levels, the availability of 
well-located, modern and sustainable space 
remains limited across our markets. This helped 
us to grow the rental income on our portfolio, 
by increasing the rents on our existing space 
and through our development programme, 
both of which contributed to income and 
earnings growth. 

Modest decline in portfolio value due 
to further interest-rate driven yield 
expansion, partly offset by strong 
estimated rental value growth 
The Group’s property portfolio was valued at 
£17.8 billion at 31 December 2023 (£20.7 billion 
of assets under management). The portfolio 
valuation, including completed assets, land 
and buildings under construction, decreased 
by 4.0 per cent (after adjusting for capital 
expenditure and asset recycling) during the 
year, compared to a decline of 11.0 per cent 
in 2022. The majority of the fall came in the 
second half of the year and reflected the 
tighter financial conditions in capital markets, 
particularly in September and October. 
The significant fall in bond yields and future 
interest rate expectations at the end of 
2023 did not come in time for an increase in 
investment activity last year, but it appears to 
have improved sentiment in the investment 
market in the early stages of 2024, which we 
expect will lead to increased activity during 
the year ahead.

The reduction in the valuation of our 
portfolio primarily comprises a 4.5 per cent 
decline in assets held throughout the year 
(2022: 13.1 per cent decline), driven by yield 
expansion in most markets, which was partly 
offset by a 6.0 per cent increase in our valuer’s 
estimate of the market rental value of our 
portfolio (2022: 10.9 per cent increase) as well 
as development profits and the benefit of our 
asset management initiatives. 

Assets held throughout the year in the 
UK decreased in value by 3.3 per cent 
(2022: 15.5 per cent decrease), underperforming 
the MSCI Real Estate All Industrial Quarterly 
Index which decreased by 0.3 per cent over 
the same period. 

The underperformance was due to our 
weighting towards lower yielding prime 
assets, that were more sensitive to yield 
movements in response to higher interest 
rates. The net true equivalent yield applied 
to our UK portfolio was 5.2 per cent, 40 basis 
points higher than at 31 December 2022 
(4.8 per cent). Rental values improved by 
4.9 per cent (2022: 11.5 per cent). 

Assets held throughout the year in 
Continental Europe decreased in value by 
6.4 per cent (2022: 8.8 per cent decrease) 
on a constant currency basis, reflecting a 
combination of 60 basis points of yield 
expansion to 5.4 per cent (31 December 2022: 
4.8 per cent) and rental value growth of 7.9 
per cent (2022: 9.9 per cent).

What to expect from our portfolio in 2024
Forecasting yields over any future period is 
notoriously difficult given the multitude of 
economic and financial drivers (particularly 
interest rates and credit spreads), most of 
which are outside of our direct control.

However, if market expectations that central 
bank rates have peaked are sustained, this 
should provide a supportive backdrop for 
a recovery of investment market sentiment 
during 2024.

The fundamentals for our sector remain 
strong, with occupier demand supported 
by structural drivers and limited supply, 
which leaves us optimistic about the 
prospects for further rental value growth. 
This should result in investment markets in 
the industrial and logistics sector recovering 
more quickly than wider real estate assets. 
In addition, we expect investors to remain 
selective about where and in what they invest 
which, along with our active approach to asset 
management, should lead to our high-quality, 
modern and sustainable portfolio 
outperforming the wider industrial and 
logistics market on a long-run basis.

In terms of rent roll, we expect this to increase 
through the letting up of space currently 
under refurbishment, the further capture 
of reversion on the existing portfolio and 
by signing further pre-lets in response to 
occupier demand. We have the potential 
to more than double our rent roll over the 
coming years through our active asset 
management of the existing portfolio and 
the build out of our high-quality land bank.

Strong rent roll growth, with a large 
contribution from the capture of 
reversion on the standing portfolio 
as well as development 
During 2023, we contracted £88 million 
(2022: £98 million) of new headline rent, 
consistent with our expectations after the 
elevated levels seen during the pandemic 
and its immediate aftermath.

We added £30 million of net new rent from 
our existing portfolio (2022: £31 million). 
This comprised £16 million on new lettings 
(2022: £21 million) and £35 million from the 
capture of reversion (the difference between 
in-place and market rents) on rent reviews and 
renewals, and from inflation-related uplifts in 
index-linked leases (2022: £28 million), offset 
by rent lost from space returned of £21 million 
(2022: £18 million), much of it for refurbishment.

Occupier demand for new space enabled us 
to sign further pre-let agreements for delivery 
over the next two years. We contracted 
£27 million of headline rent from pre-let 
agreements and lettings of speculative 
developments prior to completion 
(2022: £41 million). The pre-lets signed 
during 2023 included an additional data 
centre on the Slough Trading Estate and 
big box warehouses across the UK and 
Continental Europe for third-party logistics 
operators, manufacturers and retailers 
(both traditional and online).

As a result of this activity, rent roll growth which 
reflects net new headline rent from existing 
space (adjusted for takebacks of space for 
development), take-up of developments 
and pre-lets agreed during the period, 
was £65 million (2022: £77 million).

At 31 December 2023, our portfolio generated 
passing rent of £639 million, rising to 
£697 million once rent free periods expire 
(‘headline rent’).

Progress through partnership in East London

Our market-leading operating platform, 
with local networks across Europe, is crucial 
to the development of strong relationships 
with local authorities and stakeholder groups. 

One such relationship is the East Plus 
partnership, which was established in 
London in 2016 and last year celebrated 
its halfway point. This partnership aims to 
revitalise 86 acres of industrial land across 
the London boroughs of Newham, Havering, 
and Barking and Dagenham and is a 
collaboration between SEGRO and GLA 
Land and Property (GLAP). 

Since the partnership’s inception, 
investment of over £120 million has 
delivered almost 60,000 sq m of 
sustainable industrial space for 50 
businesses, ranging from SMEs to major 
corporates. Beyond physical site delivery, 
East Plus has broader regeneration goals 
including upskilling the workforce, inspiring 
younger generations, and supporting 
community projects. Our community 
investment programme has helped over 
4,700 residents to develop the skills and 
confidence to reach their full potential, 
assisted 157 unemployed people into work, 
and supported 29 charities.

Collaboration, adaptability, experience, 
and a passion for delivering excellence 
in everything, forms the basis for the 
partnership and its extraordinary 
progress and success to date.

Update:  
Investment

What we said we would do
We said that we would continue to take a 
disciplined approach to capital allocation, 
focusing the majority of our investment 
on our development pipeline (through 
development capex, land acquisitions and 
acquiring assets with future redevelopment 
potential) and making strategic asset 
acquisitions if and when the 
opportunity arose. 

£575m

of investment for growth

Acquisitions of assets

£0m 

2022: £155m

What we achieved in 2023
All of the investment into our portfolio during 
2023 was into our development pipeline, a 
combination of development capex to build 
out our land bank and land acquisitions to 
fuel future growth. We made no asset 
acquisitions during the year but took 
advantage of increased appetite for prime 
assets in the second half to dispose of a 
number of assets ahead of book value. 

What to expect in 2024
We will continue to take the same disciplined 
approach during 2024, putting most of our 
focus on building out our attractive land 
bank will continue to consider unique asset 
or land acquisition opportunities that may 
arise in these subdued investment market 
conditions. We expect to dispose of 
between one and two per cent of the 
portfolio as per our normal levels of capital 
recycling but adapting the overall volume of 
disposals to market conditions. We have a 
number of transactions under discussion 
and expect to make further progress with 
these during 2024.

Taking a disciplined approach to capital 
allocation is key to delivering long-term 
outperformance. We use our in-depth 
knowledge of our markets and our customer 
base to position our portfolio accordingly. 
We also adapt our approach to capital 
deployment depending on our assessment of 
the property cycle and other external factors. 
During 2023 this has resulted in us prioritising 
capital deployment into the most profitable 
development opportunities on land that we 
already own, and increasingly funding this 
through disposals rather than taking on 
additional debt.

Net investment during the year was 
£575 million comprising: development capital 
expenditure of £527 million and £404 million 
of land acquisitions, partly offset by 
£356 million of disposals during the period.

It will be supported by a strategic rail freight 
interchange, allowing customers to reduce 
the number of trucks used in their operations, 
as well as a substantial 610 acre country park 
for use by the local community.

In Continental Europe we purchased an 
excellent plot of land outside Dortmund which 
will deliver over 200,000 sq m of big box and 
urban warehouse space in one of Germany's 
most attractive logistics markets. We also 
purchased small plots of land in Italy, France, 
Spain and Poland. 

Amid volatile capital markets and higher 
financing costs, we increased the pace of 
disposals to fund our development activity, 
generating £356 million of proceeds from 
asset and land sales, crystallising a profit 
of £39 million compared to book value.

These included:

 – Asset sales totalling £242 million, mainly 

of assets that did not meet our hurdle rates 
in our annual asset review process, as well 
as some non-core office assets. In total, 
£8 million of rental income (annualised) 
was lost as a result of these disposals. 

 – Land plots totalling £114 million, the majority 
of which came from the sale of land that the 
buyer intends to develop themselves for 
owner-occupation, offering us attractive 
risk-adjusted returns. 

Capital deployment focused on the most 
profitable development opportunities, 
increasingly funded by disposals
During the year we invested £931 million 
into our development pipeline, which 
comprised £527 million (2022: £787 million) 
in development spend, of which £92 million 
was for infrastructure and £404 million on 
new land acquisitions. The land acquisitions 
focused on rare and unique sites providing 
opportunities for future development. 

In the UK, this included the acquisition of Bath 
Road Shopping Park in Slough, which creates 
significant further potential for data centre 
development due to its position adjacent 
to the Slough Trading Estate. We also 
acquired the former Radlett Aerodrome 
in Hertfordshire, a brownfield site on the 
edge of London and close to the M25, 
which provides us with the opportunity 
to develop an exceptionally rare site of 
scale that will deliver over 330,000 sq m 
of logistics buildings.

Update:  
Development

What we said we would do
We expected to continue to develop out our 
land bank during 2023 and anticipated 
investing in excess of £600 million in 
development capex, including £100 million 
of infrastructure expenditure. 

What we achieved in 2023
2023 was another strong year of 
development completions. We completed 
625,700 sq m of space, capable of delivering 
£50 million of new headline rent. 

We spent £527 million on development 
capex, including £92 million on 
infrastructure. This was a little lower than our 
expectations and the residual capex is 
expected to be incurred in 2024. 

What to expect in 2024
We expect to invest approximately 
£600 million in development capex 
during 2024, including £150 million of 
infrastructure related to our UK big box 
logistics parks. The yield on cost for our 
development programme is expected to be 
between 7 and 8 per cent.

Disciplined capital allocation and Operational 
excellence are both key to the success of our 
development programme. They ensure that 
we deploy capital into the most profitable 
opportunities and into markets with the 
greatest long-term return potential, execute 
on our pipeline efficiently and safely, and build 
to the highest construction and sustainability 
standards.

Development completions delivered 
£50 million of potential headline rent
Development completions added 
625,700 sq m of new space to the portfolio 
during 2023, generating £43 million of 
headline rent, with a potential further 
£7 million to come when the remainder of the 
space is let. The yield on total development 
cost (including land, construction and finance 
costs) is expected to be 7.0 per cent when 
fully let (excluding developments completed 
by third parties on a forward funded basis 
acquired at investment value). 

We completed 478,800 sq m of big box 
warehouse space, including one of our last 
remaining plots at SEGRO Logistics Park East 
Midlands Gateway and across all of our major 
European markets, let to third-party logistics 
operators, retailers and manufacturers.

We completed 146,900 sq m of urban 
warehouses, including three data centres in 
Slough and industrial units in South London, 
Berlin, Cologne and Paris. The majority of 
these were developed speculatively and 
almost 80 per cent of the rent has already 
been secured.

During the year the contractor on one of 
our UK big box projects, Buckingham 
Contracting Group, entered administration. 
Our development team responded quickly 
to secure the scheme and liaise with our 
affected customers. 

Thanks to our strong relationship with an 
alternative contractor we were able to restart 
works quickly. Although an inevitable 
consequence has been an increase in costs 
along with a short delay to the original delivery 
programmes, we have managed the impacts of 
this alongside our customers and have revised 
completion dates in place. Contractor failure is 
a supply chain risk we consider explicitly and it 
is managed in part through avoiding over-
reliance on any single contractor.

Reducing embodied carbon in our 
development programme is critical to 
helping us achieve our net-zero targets 
and we continue to make progress in this 
area, reducing the carbon intensity of our 
developments to 348 kgCO2e per sq m during 
2023. This represents a 13 per cent reduction 
from our 2020 baseline, meaning we are on 
course to achieve our science-based target 
of a 20 per cent reduction by 2030.

Almost all (99 per cent) of our eligible 
development completions during 2023 have 
been, or are expected to be, accredited at least 
BREEAM ‘Very Good’ (or local equivalent), with 
92 per cent ‘Excellent’ or ‘Outstanding’. 

£71 million of potential headline rent 
currently under development or due to 
start shortly
At 31 December 2023, we had development 
projects approved, contracted or under 
construction totalling 415,200 sq m, 
representing £183 million of future capital 
expenditure to complete and £51 million of 
annualised gross rental income when fully let. 
62 per cent of this rent has already been secured 
and these projects should yield 7.3 per cent on 
total development cost when fully occupied.

In the UK, we have 169,900 sq m of space 
approved or under construction. Within this 
are our first multi-level warehouse scheme in 
West London, two new data centres on the 
Slough Trading Estate (the second largest 
hub of data centres globally) and big box 
warehouses at our logistics park in Coventry.

In Continental Europe, we have 245,200 sq m 
of space approved or under construction. 
This includes pre-let big box warehouses for a 
variety of different occupiers, from retailers to 
manufacturers, across Italy, Spain and Poland. 
We are also developing a further phase of 
our successful urban warehouse park in 
Amsterdam and are also on site with our 
underground scheme in central Paris.

We continue to focus our speculative 
developments on urban warehouse projects, 
particularly in cities such as London and Paris, 
where modern space is in short supply and 
occupier demand is strong.

We have factored current construction and 
financing costs into the returns for our future 
development projects. Encouragingly, we are 
seeing build costs stabilise across most of our 
markets and in some regions have started to 
see construction tenders coming in at reduced 
prices. We expect to be able to develop at a 
margin over the valuation yields on equivalent 
standing assets of at least 150 to 200 basis 
points, meaning that development remains 
a profitable way of growing the rent roll.

Within the future development pipeline are 
a number of pre-let projects close to being 
approved, awaiting either final conditions to 
be met or planning approval to be granted. 
We expect to commence these 'near-term' 
projects within the next six to 12 months. 
These projects total 208,700 sq m of space, 
equating to approximately £159 million of 
future capital expenditure and £20 million 
of potential annual rent.

£481 million of future potential rent from 
land bank and options
Our land bank identified for future 
development (including the near-term 
projects detailed above) totalled 1,138 
hectares as at 31 December 2023, valued at 
£1.7 billion, roughly 10 per cent of our total 
portfolio value. This includes £645 million 
of land acquired for future redevelopment 
but which is currently income producing, 
reducing the holding costs until development 
can start (equating to £20 million of 
annualised rent).

We estimate our land bank can support 
3.7 million sq m of development over the next 
five to seven years. The estimated capital 
expenditure associated with the future 
pipeline is approximately £3.7 billion. It could 
generate £392 million of gross rental income, 
representing a yield on total development 
cost (including land and notional finance 
costs) of between 7 and 8 per cent. These 
figures are indicative, based on our current 
expectations, and are dependent on our 
ability to secure pre-let agreements, planning 
permissions, construction contracts and on our 
outlook for occupier conditions in local markets.

The land bank also includes 24 sites that 
SEGRO has identified as suitable for data 
centre development, equating to a potential 
1.2 GW of additional capacity across the UK 
and Continental Europe. SEGRO expects to be 
able to commence construction on several of 
these sites (two of which are currently under 
development) over the next five years, 
which could more than double the current 
£50 million of headline rent attributed to the 
data centre sector (approximately 7 per cent 
of group headline rent at 31 December 2023).

  Further details of our completed projects and 
development pipeline are available in the 
2023 Full Year Property Analysis Report, at  
www.SEGRO.com/investors.

Land acquisitions (contracted but subject to 
further conditions) and land held under option 
agreements are not included in the figures 
above, but represent significant further 
development opportunities. These include 
sites for big box warehouses in the UK 
Midlands as well as in Italy and Poland. 
They also include urban warehouse sites 
in East and West London.

The options are held on the balance sheet at 
a value of £26 million (including joint ventures 
and associates at share). Those we expect to 
exercise over the next two to three years are 
for land capable of supporting almost 
830,000 sq m of space and generating 
£89 million of headline rent, for a blended 
yield of approximately 7 per cent.

A zero-tolerance approach  
to poor health & safety

Accident incident rate:

0.93

2022: 0.25

Health and safety is central to all of our 
business activities and it is our responsibility 
to ensure that we provide and promote a 
healthy, safe and secure environment in 
which our people can work, extending 
throughout our supply chain, and in 
particular on our development projects.

We aim to achieve our high standards 
through a combination of risk mitigation, 
training and promoting a widespread 
awareness of health and safety. We only 
want to work with businesses that share our 
approach of zero-tolerance of poor health 
and safety. We require all of our suppliers to 
confirm that they meet our Health and Safety 
Standards, and we undertake particularly 
rigorous assessments of those companies 
working on our development sites. We 
support our contractors by providing 
additional guidance, signage and 
undertake health and safety visits of all 
our development sites through the life of 
each project. We also facilitate the sharing 
of best practice across the industry though 
our Contractor Forums. 

This approach also extends to the ongoing 
day-to-day life of our estates, many of 
which are accessed by both our customers 
and the public. We factor this into the 
design, mitigate risks and provide training 
to raise awareness.

Whenever incidents occur we fully 
investigate to understand the causes and 
disseminate learnings across the Group, 
including the Board and Executive 
Committee, to ensure that we (and where 
appropriate third-parties) respond and 
improve our processes where necessary. 

The accident incident rate increased 
slightly during 2023, but these were minor 
incidents, mainly slips and trips, and we 
believe the increase has been driven by 
improved reporting.

Update:  
Asset management

What we said we would do
We expected occupier demand to remain 
strong, but at more normalised levels to the 
pandemic years. We anticipated that rental 
growth would continue, supported by this 
demand and the continued shortage of 
supply in our chosen markets. 

What we achieved in 2023
Our focus on Operational excellence and 
commitment to excellent customer service 
helped us to deliver another strong year of 
rent roll growth during 2023, albeit not quite 
at the 2022 record level. We made great 
progress capturing reversion and kept 
occupancy high, despite taking back some 
space in London for refurbishment and 
redevelopment to very high sustainability 
standards. We also made great progress with 
our carbon targets within the existing 
portfolio by improving the visibility of 
customer emissions and adding a significant 
amount to our solar capacity through 
retrofitting projects. 

What to expect in 2024
We have a unique portfolio in Europe’s 
strongest markets. Our active asset 
management approach will ensure that it will 
continually evolve to provide high quality, 
modern space appealing to the widest 
variety of customers, thereby increasing 
rental levels. In 2024, we will continue to 
focus on providing excellent customer 
service and to capture the reversion inherent 
in our leases which reflects the quality of our 
buildings. We will continue to take advantage 
of leases coming to an end on some of our 
older buildings to refurbish them, bringing 
them up to the high environmental 
standards our customers and other 
stakeholders expect.

The performance of our existing portfolio 
relies on our continued focus on Operational 
excellence; whether that means providing the 
best customer experience throughout the 
customer’s ‘journey’ with SEGRO, optimising 
rental income and lease terms, ensuring 
consistency of operating standards, or driving 
efficiency through continuous improvement 
and the digitalisation of processes.

We believe SEGRO has a market-leading 
operating platform with people on the ground 
in all of our key locations. Through the internal 
management of our portfolio, we build strong 
and meaningful relationships with our 
customers and other business partners, and 
actively manage our assets to generate 
long-term outperformance.

Strong and diversified customer base 
Understanding our customers and their 
evolving needs is crucial to the success of 
our business. The insights that we gain from 
these partnerships help us to shape our 
portfolio and ensure that our buildings are 
fit for the future and suitable for occupier’s 
evolving needs.

Our customer base remains well diversified, 
reflecting the flexibility of warehouse space 
and that two-thirds of our portfolio is in urban 
locations. Our top 20 customers account for 
32 per cent of total headline rent. Amazon 
remains our largest customer, accounting 
for 7 per cent of our total rent roll.

Customers from the transport and logistics 
sector were the largest takers of our space 
during 2023, as they continued to focus 
on prioritising efficiency, resilience and 
sustainability into their operations. This was 
closely followed by the technology, media 
and telecoms sector, which was driven by 
data centre operators taking additional space 
to keep up with increased corporate and 
consumer demand.

The health of our customer base remains 
strong: less than £3 million of rent was lost 
due to insolvency (2022: £2 million) and rent 
collection is tracking at normal levels despite 
the tougher economic environment. 

Focused on delivering excellent 
customer service
Although the quality and location of our 
portfolio is important to our customers, 
we aim to build outstanding customer 
relationships through the delivery of excellent 
customer service. This enables us to maintain 
high levels of customer retention, grow rents 
and create new business opportunities.

We often work with our larger customers in 
more than one location and regularly across 
geographies: 27 per cent of our headline rent 
comes from customers with whom we have 
leases in more than one country. Our cross-
border customer account teams help to 
ensure that we offer a streamlined and 
informed approach to these businesses.

We carry out a rolling survey of our customers 
throughout the year to identify and rectify 
issues promptly. In 2023, we spoke to 
347 customers, and 96 per cent said that 
they would recommend SEGRO to others 
(2022: 98 per cent) while 86 per cent said 
they rated their experience with SEGRO as 
‘Excellent’ or ‘Good’ (2022: 85 per cent).

During 2023 we extended the reach of our 
customer insight programme and added new 
customer onboarding and senior stakeholder 
interviews to better understand our 
customers' experiences of working with 
SEGRO and how we can best support them. 
One of the key takeaways from these 
interviews was that customers appreciate our 
efforts to improve connectivity with SEGRO 
and between their fellow customers. Our 
regular Customer Futures Forums bring 
together customers from different sectors 
to discuss emerging trends and anticipate 
future requirements.

Actively managing our portfolio 
to create value
The supply-demand dynamics across our 
chosen markets remained favourable during 
2023, helping to drive further rental (ERV) 
growth and £88 million of new headline rent 
signed during the year. The active asset 
management of portfolio ensures that we 
generate long-term outperformance. We 
create plans for every single asset as part of 
our annual asset review process, aiming to 
strike a balance between maintaining current 
high occupancy and creating opportunities to 
drive future rents and create value through 
refurbishment, redevelopment or conversion 
to alternative uses such as data centres.

We monitor a number of metrics that help us 
assess the performance of our existing portfolio:
 – Good progress in capturing the embedded 
reversion within our portfolio: Lease reviews 
and renewals during the period generated an 
uplift of 31.0 per cent (2022: 23.3 per cent), 
adding £20 million of new headline rent. New 
rents agreed at review and renewal were 
39.9 per cent higher in the UK (2022: 28.0 per 
cent) as reversion accumulated over the past 
five years was reflected in new rents agreed. In 
Continental Europe, rents agreed on renewal 
were 7.9 per cent higher (2022: 1.7 per cent 
higher), as a result of market rental growth 
continuing to outpace annual indexation 
uplifts that have accumulated over recent 
years. Our portfolio is now 20 per cent 
reversionary, providing us with the opportunity 
to capture a further £137 million of headline 
rent over the next five years, £84 million of 
which is up for rent review or renewal by the 
end of 2026.  

 – Occupancy has remained high at 95.0 per 
cent (31 December 2022: 96.0 per cent), in 
line with our 94 to 96 per cent target. The slight 
reduction from 2022 is concentrated in our 
London portfolio and primarily reflects the 
recent completion of speculative projects in 
South London as well as the take-back of some 
older buildings to facilitate refurbishment or 
redevelopment. For example, a number of 
customers were relocated from their existing, 

older SEGRO premises into brand new space 
at SEGRO Park Hayes and SEGRO Park 
Tottenham. The occupancy rate excluding 
recently completed speculative developments 
remains high at 96.0 per cent (31 December 
2022: 97.3 per cent) and the average 
occupancy rate during the period was 
95.5 per cent (2022: 96.4 per cent). 
 – Customer retention rate increased  

to 81 per cent. Approximately £71 million of 
headline rent was at risk from a break or lease 
expiry during the period, of which we 
retained 78 per cent in existing space 
(2022: 75 per cent), and a further 3 per cent 
in new premises (2022: 1 per cent).

 – Lease terms continue to offer attractive 
income security. The level of incentives 
agreed for new leases (excluding those on 
developments completed in the period) fell 
slightly to 5.8 per cent of the headline rent 
(2022: 6.1 per cent). We maintained the 
portfolio’s weighted average lease length, with 
7.3 years to first break and 8.3 years to expiry 
(31 December 2022: 7.0 years to first break, 
8.3 years to expiry). Lease terms are longer in 
the UK (8.4 years to break) than in Continental 
Europe (5.7 years to break), reflecting the 
market convention of shorter leases in 
countries such as France and Poland.

Working closely with our customers and 
refurbishing older assets to help us achieve 
our Championing low-carbon growth 
ambitions
We have targets set and approved under the 
international Science-Based Targets Initiative 
(SBTi) to reduce the absolute corporate and 
customer carbon emissions from our portfolio 
by 42 per cent by 2030 (compared to a 2020 
baseline), in line with the 1.5 degree scenario. 
During 2023, we reduced these carbon 
emissions by 7 per cent, taking our reduction 
from 2020 to 19 per cent and putting us a year 
ahead of our target.

The recent introduction of green lease clauses is 
helping us to improve our visibility of customer 
carbon emissions, which allows us to better 
identify opportunities to help them operate their 

buildings more efficiently, reducing their carbon 
footprint and operating costs. These clauses, as 
well as an increase in the number of automatic 
meter feeds that we receive, have helped take 
the visibility of our portfolio energy use to 
81 per cent (2022: 68 per cent).

At the end of 2023, 65 per cent of the 
portfolio had an EPC rating of B or better 
(2022: 58 per cent). Whilst the majority of our 
portfolio is modern and already meets the 
highest sustainability standards, we do have 
some older assets in heavily populated and 
congested cities such as London and Paris, 
where land and buildings are in short supply 
and rents continue to grow. This provides us 
with the opportunity to add significant value 
through refurbishment, redevelopment, or 
conversion into alternative uses whilst also 
improving their environmental performance. 

A key part of our asset planning process is 
therefore determining the phasing of these 
projects and managing the space to ensure we 
have vacant possession to suit our future plans. 
This can lead to periods where the headline 
vacancy in these sub-markets is elevated, for 
example in our West London portfolio at the 
end of 2023, but the cost of this vacancy is 
more than outweighed by the value created 
through the refurbishment or redevelopment. 
Opportunities such as these are not included in 
our future development programme and could 
create significant rental uplifts. One such 
refurbishment, SEGRO Park Greenford in West 
London, was awarded BREEAM ‘Outstanding’ 
during the period and rated EPC A+ and is our 
most sustainable refurbishment to date. 

Our asset management teams are also 
working hard to expand the solar capacity of our 
portfolio through retrofitting onto existing assets 
(whilst the development teams are installing 
panels on new developments) where feasible. 
During 2023 we added 15 MW to our solar 
capacity, including 11 MW through retrofits 
onto existing buildings. 

Applying Operational excellence  
to our supply chains

Supplier spend:

£887m

Number of suppliers:

2,842

We apply the same approach in our supply 
chains as we do in our internal operations and 
aim to develop collaborative partnerships, with 
mutually beneficial aims and objectives. Our 
suppliers range from small local businesses to 
multinational companies and we look to work 
with businesses who share our approach to 
matters such as health and safety, compliance, 
anti-bribery and corruption. Our Supplier 
Code of Conduct and Modern Slavery and 
Labour Standards Supply Code consolidate 
and set out in full the principles and standards 
that we expect and outline how we can work 
side-by-side to create real change. 

Our relationships with our suppliers are also 
important in us achieving our Responsible 
SEGRO ambitions. We work closely with our 
construction partners to reduce the embodied 
carbon intensity of our development 
programme. We also expect our suppliers to 
work with us to support local businesses and 
economies; this included proactively sourcing 
labour, goods and services from our local 
communities and contributing to our 
Community Investment Plans. 

In the spirit of partnership, we treat our 
suppliers well and ensure they are paid on 
time. We are a signatory of the UK Prompt 
Payment Code (average UK payment time is 14 
days). We are also an accredited UK Living 
Wage employer, and are working with our 
suppliers to help ensure everyone working in 
our supply chain to support us is paid a real 
Living Wage.

SEGRO European Logistics Partnership (SELP)

10 years of SELP

Assets under Management  €m

During 2023 we celebrated the tenth anniversary 
of the SEGRO European Logistics Partnership 
(SELP). SELP is our Continental European big box 
joint venture with PSP Investments, one of 
Canada’s largest pension investment managers. 

SELP started in October 2013 with €1 billion of 
assets. At the end of 2023, it had a portfolio worth 
€6.7 billion. SELP generates €342 million of headline 
rent with an occupancy rate of 99 per cent. 

Our partnership is an important element of our 
strategy to build scale in Continental European big 
box warehousing in a capital-efficient manner. By 
sharing the capital investment with PSP 
Investments, we have been able to grow the 
portfolio further and faster than we could have 
done on our own. Both partners benefit from the 
attractive yield on the portfolio, the development 
potential from the land and from the economies of 
scale we can extract from this high-quality, 
modern collection of big box warehouses.

During SELP's first ten years it has developed 
almost 1.9 million sq m of big box warehouse 
space across six European countries, adding 
€102 million of headline rent to the portfolio.

As a result, SEGRO now has in excess of €1 billion 
of assets under management in each of Germany, 
France, Italy and Poland, and we are building scale 
in the smaller markets of Spain, Czech Republic 
and the Netherlands. 

SELP's assets are managed by SEGRO alongside 
its own portfolio and in return SELP pays SEGRO 
annual fees for asset management, development 
and advisory and administrative services. Since 
2013, SELP has paid SEGRO £192 million of these 
fees, which has resulted in a net benefit before tax 
to SEGRO of £96 million, enhancing the returns 
from the Continental European big box portfolio. 

In addition to these management fees, during the 
first ten-years of the joint venture SEGRO also 
received £141 million (net benefit before tax of 
£70 million) in performance fees, reflecting its 
successful growth. The final fee for the ten-year 
period of £89 million was recognised in 2023 (net 
benefit before tax of £44 million) and was in 
addition to two other performance fees 
recognised in 2018 and 2021 of £26 million 
each (net benefit before tax of £13 million).

The appetite for investing in big box warehousing 
in strategic locations in Continental Europe 
remains strong and we look forward to successful 
collaboration in the future.

Cologne gets a fresh coat of paint 

Given the scarcity of land in our urban 
markets, many of our developments involve 
the regeneration of brownfield sites. These 
schemes help to grow the local economy by 
helping to attract new business investment 
into local areas and creating diverse and 
high-quality employment opportunities. 

In 2014, we acquired a former paint factory on 
the edge of Cologne which, as with many of 
our brownfield urban developments, required 
a significant amount of remediation work. This 
included the removal of 62 tonnes of material 
contaminated by paint and varnish waste. 

Less than 10 years on this site is now SEGRO 
Park Cologne City: a 55,000 sq m urban 
logistics and light industrial park built to the 
highest sustainability standards (helping it to 
be awarded DGNB the highest possible DGNB 
‘Platinum’ Certification). 

The park is now home to 23 customers 
from a diverse range of industries including: 
retail, film and media, post and parcel, 
luxury cars and food manufacturing. 
Together they employ 1,128 and are enabling 
a wide range of extraordinary things to 
happen in Cologne.

Monitoring and mitigating financial risk
As explained in the Risks section of this Annual 
Report, the Group monitors a number of 
financial metrics to assess the level of financial 
risk being taken and to mitigate that risk.

Treasury policies and governance
The Group Treasury function operates within 
a formal policy covering all aspects of treasury 
activity, including funding, counterparty 
exposure and management of interest rate, 
currency and liquidity risks. Group Treasury 
reports on compliance with these policies 
on a quarterly basis and policies are reviewed 
regularly by the Board.

Gearing and financial covenants
We consider the key leverage metric for 
SEGRO to be a proportionally consolidated 
(‘look-through’) loan to value ratio (LTV) which 
incorporates assets and net debt on SEGRO’s 
balance sheet and SEGRO’s share of assets 
and net debt on the balance sheets of its joint 
ventures. The LTV at 31 December 2023 on 
this basis was 34 per cent (31 December 2022: 
32 per cent), the increase primarily driven by 
the reduction in asset values and a higher 
debt balance.

SEGRO’s borrowings contain gearing 
covenants based on Group net debt and net 
asset value, excluding debt in joint ventures. 
The gearing ratio of the Group at 31 December 
2023, as defined within the principal debt 
funding arrangements of the Group, was 
45 per cent (31 December 2022: 41 per cent). 

This is significantly lower than the Group’s 
tightest financial gearing covenant within 
these debt facilities of 160 per cent. Property 
valuations would need to fall by around 44 per 
cent from their 31 December 2023 values to 
reach the gearing covenant threshold of 
160 per cent. A 44 per cent fall in property 
values would equate to an LTV ratio of 
approximately 62 per cent.

The Group’s other key financial covenant within 
its principal debt funding arrangements is 
interest cover, requiring that net interest before 
capitalisation be covered at least 1.25 times by 
net property rental income: the ratio for 2023

was 2.7 times, comfortably ahead of the 
covenant minimum. Net property rental income 
would need to fall by around 54 per cent from 
2023 levels, or interest rates would need to rise 
to 7.4 per cent from the full year average interest 
rate of 3.4 per cent to breach the interest cover 
covenant threshold. On a proportionally 
consolidated basis, including joint ventures, 
the interest cover ratio was 3.0 times.

SEGRO also monitors its leverage on a net 
debt:EBITDA basis which is an increasingly 
important metric for rating agencies and our 
investors. SEGRO has a long-term issuer 
default rating of ‘BBB+’ and a senior 
unsecured rating of ‘A-’ from Fitch Ratings as 
at 31 December 2023. These ratings were 
reduced from ‘A-’ and ‘A’ respectively in May 
2023, and placed on ‘negative watch’. 

SEGRO’s net debt:EBITDA ratio at the end 
of 2023 was 10.4 times (2022: 11.7 times), 
reflecting the net impact of an £75 million 
increase in EBITDA and a £250 million increase 
in net debt. The elevated 2022 ratio was the 
prime reason cited by Fitch Ratings for 
downgrading our senior unsecured debt 
rating during the year to A- from A and 
applying a negative outlook. Fitch state 
that a net debt:EBITDA ratio of 9.5 times 
is consistent with an A- rating and we have 
made significant progress towards that during 
2023 as a result of growing our rent roll and 
funding a significant proportion of our 
investment with the proceeds of disposals.

We mitigate the risk of over-gearing the 
Company and breaching debt covenants by 
carefully monitoring the impact of investment 
decisions on our LTV and by stress testing our 
balance sheet to potential changes in 
property values.

Our intention for the foreseeable future is 
to maintain our LTV at around 30 per cent, 
although the evolution of the property cycle 
will inevitably mean that there are periods of 
time when our LTV is higher or lower than this. 
However, this level of LTV through the cycle 
provides the flexibility to take advantage of 
investment opportunities arising and ensures 

significant headroom compared against our 
tightest gearing covenants should property 
values decline. 

The weighted average maturity of the gross 
borrowings of the Group (including joint 
ventures at share) was 6.9 years, with the 
closest maturity being SELP’s €500 million 
euro bond in November 2025, followed by 
SEGRO’s €195 million term loan in December 
2025. This long average debt maturity 
comprises a well spread debt funding 
maturity profile which reduces future 
refinancing risk.

Interest rate risk
The Group’s interest rate risk policy is 
designed to ensure that we limit our exposure 
to volatility in interest rates. The policy states 
that between 50 and 100 per cent of net 
borrowings (including the Group’s share of 
borrowings in joint ventures) should be at 
fixed or capped rates, including the impact 
of derivative financial instruments.

At 31 December 2023, including the impact 
of derivative instruments, 95 per cent 
(2022: 95 per cent) of the net borrowings 
of the Group (including the Group’s share of 
borrowings within joint ventures) were either 
at fixed rates or are protected from rising 
interest rates with interest rate caps, with a 
spread of expiry dates over the next 6 years 
and an average expiry of 3.4 years. The 
pure fixed level of debt is 76 per cent 
at 31 December 2023 (31 December 
2022: 83 per cent), rising to 95 per cent 
including floating rate debt which is now 
subject to an active cap. The remaining 
5 per cent of debt is at floating rates.

During the year, in line with our risk 
management processes and due to the higher 
levels of market volatility, the Group entered 
into €532 million of interest rate cap contracts 
to mitigate the risk of rising interest rates 
on our floating rate debt exposure. At 
31 December 2023 all of these caps 
were triggered.

As a result of the fixed rate cover in place, 
if short-term interest rates had been 200 
basis points higher throughout the year to 
31 December 2023, the adjusted net finance 
cost of the Group would have been 
approximately £10 million higher (31 December 
2022: £27 million higher) representing around 
3 per cent (31 December 2022: 7 per cent) of 
Adjusted profit after tax. This decrease in 
sensitivity to interest rate increases since 2022 
is attributed to the greater protection from our 
interest rate cap portfolio. 

The Group elects not to hedge account its 
interest rate derivatives portfolio. Therefore, 
movements in its fair value are taken to the 
income statement but, in accordance with 
EPRA Best Practices Recommendations 
Guidelines, these gains and losses are 
eliminated from Adjusted profit after tax.

Foreign currency translation risk
The Group has minimal transactional foreign 
currency exposure but does have a potentially 
significant currency translation exposure 
arising on the conversion of its foreign 
currency denominated assets (mainly euro) 
and euro denominated earnings into sterling 
in the Group consolidated accounts.

The Group seeks to limit its exposure to 
volatility in foreign exchange rates by hedging 
its foreign currency gross assets using either 
borrowings or derivative instruments. The 
Group targets a hedging range of between 
the last reported LTV ratio (34 per cent at 31 
December 2023) and 100 per cent. At 31 
December 2023, the Group was 74 per cent 
hedged by gross foreign currency denominated 
liabilities (31 December 2022: 76 per cent).

Including the impact of forward foreign 
exchange and currency swap contracts used 
to hedge foreign currency denominated net 
assets, if the value of the other currencies in 
which the Group operates at 31 December 
2023 weakened by 10 per cent against sterling 
(to €1.27, in the case of euros), net assets 
would have decreased by approximately £151 
million and there would have been a reduction 
in gearing of approximately 2.2 per cent and 
in the LTV of 1.3 per cent.

The average exchange rate used to translate 
euro denominated earnings generated 
during 2023 into sterling within the 
consolidated income statement of the Group 
was €1.15: £1. Based on the hedging position 
at 31 December 2023, and assuming that this 
position had applied throughout 2023, if the 
euro had been 10 per cent weaker than the 
average exchange rate (€1.27: £1), Adjusted 
profit after tax for the year would have been 
approximately £9 million (2.3 per cent) lower 
than reported. If it had been 10 per cent 
stronger, Adjusted profit after tax for the year 
would have been approximately £11 million 
(2.8 per cent) higher than reported.

Progress against our strategy

What we said we would do
We intend to keep our LTV at around 
30 per cent. 

What we achieved in 2023
The impact of increased borrowings 
(due to £0.6 billion net investment) during 
the year and the reduction in asset values 
meant that LTV has increased from 32 per 
cent to 34 per cent at 31 December 2023. 

What to expect in 2024
We aim to maintain our mid-cycle LTV at 
around 30 per cent, although the evolution 
of the property cycle will inevitably mean 
that there are periods of time when our LTV 
is higher or lower than this. We believe this 
approach ensures significant headroom 
compared against our tightest gearing 
covenants should property values decline 
further, as well as providing the flexibility to 
take advantage of investment opportunities 
which may arise. We have cash and 
available facilities of £1.9 billion (including 
our share of joint ventures and associates) 
on which we can draw to fund our 
investment plans.

Income statement review

Presentation of financial information 
The Group Financial Statements are 
prepared under IFRS where the Group’s 
interests in joint ventures and associates 
are shown as a single line item on the 
income statement and balance sheet 
and subsidiaries are consolidated at 
100 per cent.

The Adjusted profit measure reflects the 
underlying financial performance of the 
Group’s property rental business, which 
is our core operating activity. It is based 
on EPRA earnings as set out in the Best 
Practices Recommendations Guidelines of 
the European Public Real Estate Association 
(EPRA) which are widely used alternate 
metrics to their IFRS equivalents within the 
European real estate sector (further details 
can be found at www.epra.com). In 
calculating Adjusted profit, the Directors 
may also exclude additional items 
considered to be non-recurring, unusual, 
or significant by virtue of size and nature. 
In the current year, the net profit after tax 
impact of the SELP performance fees 
recognised of £42 million have been 
excluded. Furthermore an impairment of a 
loan to an associate of £28 million has also 
been excluded. Both items are discussed in 
more detail in Note 2. In the prior year there 
have been no such adjustments and 
therefore Adjusted profit and EPRA 
earnings were the same.

Going concern
As noted in the Financial Position and Funding 
section above, the Group has significant 
available liquidity to meet its capital 
commitments, a long-dated debt maturity 
profile and substantial headroom against 
financial covenants. 

 – In 2023, the Group extended the term 
of its €600 million and €200 million 
revolving credit facilities to 2026 and 2028, 
respectively, and extended the term of its 
£300 million and €115 million term loans 
to 2026.

 – The Group added a further £100 million 

and €150 million term loan facilities, both 
maturing in 2026.

 – Cash and available committed facilities 
at 31 December 2023 were £1.5 billion.

 – The Group continuously monitors its liquidity 

position compared to committed and 
expected capital and operating expenses 
on a rolling forward 18-month basis. 
The quantum of committed capital 
expenditure at any point in time is 
typically low due to the short timeframe 
to construct warehouse buildings. 

 – The Group also regularly stress-tests its 
financial covenants. As noted above, at 
31 December 2023, property values would 
need to fall by around 44 per cent before 
breaching the gearing covenant. In terms of 
interest cover, net rental income would have 
needed to fall by 54 per cent or the average 
interest rate would have needed to reach 
7.4 per cent before breaching the interest 
cover covenant. All would be significantly 
in excess of the Group’s experience during 
the financial crisis.

Having made enquiries and having 
considered the principal risks facing the 
Group, including liquidity and solvency risks, 
and material uncertainties, the Directors have 
a reasonable expectation that the Company 
and the Group have adequate resources to 
continue in operational existence for the 
foreseeable future (a period of at least 12 
months from the date of approval of the 
financial statements). Accordingly, they 
continue to adopt the going concern basis 
in preparing these financial statements.

Net rental income increased by £50 million 
to £462 million (or by £65 million to 
£587 million including joint ventures and 
associates at share before joint venture 
fees), reflecting the positive net impact of 
like-for-like rental growth, development 
completions and investment activity during 
the year, offset by the impact of disposals.

On a like-for-like basis¹, before other items 
(primarily corporate centre and other costs 
not specifically allocated to a geographic 
Business Unit), net rental income increased 
by £31 million, or 6.5 per cent, compared 
to 2022.

This is due to strong rental performance 
across our portfolio. Continental Europe: 
8.5 per cent increase, primarily through 
indexation; and UK: 5.3 per cent increase, 
primarily through capturing the reversionary 
potential in the portfolio through lease 
reviews and renewals (for more information 
see Performance review page 37.)

1  The like-for-like net rental growth metric is based on 
properties held throughout both 2023 and 2022 on 
a proportionally consolidated basis. This provides 
details of underlying net rental income growth 
excluding the distortive impact of acquisitions, 
disposals and development completions.

SEGRO’s share of joint ventures and 
associates’ Adjusted profit after tax 
increased by £11 million from £71 million in 
2022 to £82 million in 2023, excluding 
performance fee expense. The increase is 
driven by net rental income growth partially 
offset by interest costs and taxation.

Joint venture fee management fee income 
decreased by £1 million to £29 million in 
2023 due to a reduction in property values 
on which elements of the fees are based.

Performance fees from joint ventures have 
been excluded from Adjusted profit and are 
discussed in the IFRS loss section below.

Net finance costs were £32 million higher 
than 2022 at £106 million. Average interest 
rates during the year were 3.2 per cent 
compared to 2.6 per cent in the prior 
year. This has been partially offset by a 
£42 million increase in capitalised interest 
compared to the prior year due to the 
higher rate of interest on debt used to 
finance development projects. Furthermore, 
gross debt levels were higher in 2023 
compared to the prior year. At 31 December 
2023 gross debt was £5,348 million, 
£464 million higher than the prior year.

The tax charge on Adjusted profit of 
£10 million (2022: £11 million) reflects 
an effective tax rate of 2.4 per cent 
(2022: 2.8 per cent).

The Group’s effective tax rate reflects 
the fact that around three-quarters of its 
wholly-owned assets are located in the 
UK and qualify for REIT status. This status 
means that income from rental profits and 
gains on disposals of assets in the UK are 
exempt from corporation tax, provided 
SEGRO meets a number of conditions
including, but not limited to, distributing 
90 per cent of UK taxable profits.

Adjusted profit after tax increased by £25 
million to £399 million (2022: £374 million) 
as a result of the above movements, 
primarily growth in rental income offset 
by increased finance costs.

Adjusted profit is detailed further in Note 2 
to the Financial Statements.

Adjusted earnings per share are 32.7 pence 
compared to 31.0 pence in 2022 due to the 
increase in Adjusted profit slightly offset by 
the 13 million increase in the average 
number of shares in issue compared 
to the prior year.

increases in ERV. These are discussed in more 
detail in the Performance review on page 36. 
Other property movements include profit on 
sale of wholly-owned investment properties 
of £39 million (2022: £9 million profit). 

There was also a loss of £28 million 
recognised in the year in relation to the 
impairment of a loan to an associate which 
is assumed to be recovered through the fair 
value of land which has fallen during the year. 
This is further detailed in Note 17(vi).

IFRS loss
IFRS loss before tax in 2023 was £263 million 
(2022: £1,967 million loss), equating to basic 
post-tax IFRS loss per share of 20.7 pence 
compared with loss per share of 159.7 pence 
for 2022. A reconciliation between Adjusted 
profit before tax and IFRS loss before tax is 
provided in Note 2 to the Financial Statements.

The principal driver of IFRS loss is realised and 
unrealised property losses and gains which is 
the main reason for the lower loss per share in 
2023 versus 2022. Total loss on properties is 
£760 million (2022: £2,175 million loss). 
This includes a £598 million realised and 
unrealised property loss on investment 
and trading properties in the wholly-owned 
business (2022: £1,939 million loss) and 
£162 million loss from joint ventures and 
associates at share (2022: £236 million loss). 
The largest component are valuation losses 
on investment and trading properties of 
£809 million including joint ventures at share 
(2022: £2,191 million), which is driven by yield 
expansion in most markets partially offset by 

IFRS earnings in the year also included 
recognition of a performance fee from SELP 
following the ten-year anniversary of the joint 
venture. The overall net profit impact was 
£42 million (2022: £nil). This constituted a 
£89 million income less taxation of £10 million 
in respect of the wholly-owned business and 
a cost of the performance fee of £45 million 
less a tax credit of £8 million from the joint 
venture (at share).

Further detail on the performance fee 
including the recognition criteria and 
cumulative fee recognised are detailed 
in Note 7(ii).

IFRS earnings were also impacted by a net 
fair value gain on interest rate swaps and 
other derivatives of £24 million (2022: loss 
of £199 million).

In addition, SEGRO recognised a tax credit 
in respect of adjustments of £30 million 
(2022: £48 million) primarily in relation to 
property valuation movements. 

Balance sheet
At 31 December 2023, IFRS net assets 
were £10,904 million (31 December 2022: 
£11,373 million), reflecting 886 pence per 
share (31 December 2022: 938 pence) on 
a diluted basis.

Adjusted NAV per share at 31 December 
2023 was 907 pence (31 December 2022: 
966 pence). The 6.1 per cent decrease 
primarily reflects property valuation losses 
in the year as explained above. The chart 
highlights the other main factors behind the 
decrease. A reconciliation between IFRS and 
Adjusted NAV is available in Note 12 to the 
Financial Statements.

Cash flow and net debt reconciliation
Cash flows from operating activities of £584 
million are £105 million higher than the prior 
year. This is primarily due to increased rental 
income received during the year, and other 
working capital movements. As well as finance 
cost outflows of £162 million in servicing the 
debt facilities, a further £5 million was spent in 
closing out debt and reprofiling interest rate 
derivatives. Interest rate risk management is 
detailed further in the Financial review on 
page 49. In addition there were tax payments 
of £24 million primarily in France.

The Group made net investments of £487 
million in investment and development 
properties during the year on a wholly-owned 
cash flow basis (2022: £1,162 million). This is 
principally driven by expenditure of £839 
million (2022: £1,472 million) to purchase and 
develop investment properties to deliver 
further growth in line with our strategy. 
Disposals of investment properties increased 
by £42 million to £352 million compared to the 
prior year (2022: £310 million) as the business 
looked to recycle assets when the opportunity 
arose.

During the year £185 million (2022: £222 
million) dividends were paid which is lower 
than the total dividend due to the level of scrip 
uptake of £129 million (2022: £79 million) and 
tax due after year end on a Property Income 
Distribution of £13 million (2022: £nil). 

Other significant cash flows include £29 
million acquisition of plant and equipment 
and intangibles primarily on enhancing the 
businesses technology and PV plant, and £16 
million to acquire the residual non-controlling 
interest of Vailog Sarl.

Overall, net debt has increased in the year 
by £250 million to £4,972 million.

Capital expenditure
Table 10 in the Supplementary Notes sets 
out analysis of the capital expenditure during 
the year. This includes acquisition and 
development spend, on an accruals basis, 
in respect of the Group’s wholly-owned 
investment and trading property portfolios, 
as well as the equivalent amounts for joint 
ventures and associates, at share.

Total spend for the year was £1,121 million, 
a decrease of £777 million compared to 
2022, primarily from lower acquisition and 
development spend. More detail on this 
spend can be found in the Development 
and Investment Updates on pages 39 to 40.

Development capital expenditure was £527 
million in the year (2022: £787 million) across 
all our Business Units, particularly Southern 
Europe and National Logistics, reflecting our 
development-led growth strategy. Interest of 
£68 million (2022: £24 million) has been 
capitalised in the year.

Spend on existing completed properties, 
totalled £67 million (2022: £62 million), of 
which £1 million (2022: £13 million) was for 
incremental lettable space. The balance 
mainly comprises refurbishment and fit-out 
costs, which equates to less than six per cent 
of total spend. 

Dividend increase reflects the strong 
operational results and confidence for 
the future
Under the UK REIT rules, we are required to 
pay out 90 per cent of UK-sourced, tax-
exempt rental profits as a ‘Property Income 
Distribution’ (PID). Since we also receive 
income from our properties in Continental 
Europe, our total dividend should normally 
exceed this minimum level and we target a 
payout ratio of 85 to 95 per cent of Adjusted 
profit after tax. We aim to deliver a progressive 
and sustainable dividend which grows in line 
with our profitability in order to achieve our 
goal of being a leading income-focused REIT.

The Board has concluded that it is appropriate 
to recommend an increase in the final 
dividend per share by 0.9 pence to 19.1 pence 
(2022: 18.2 pence). We will pay the 2023 final 
dividend as a PID and expect to pay the 2024 
interim dividend as an ordinary dividend. The 
Board’s recommendation is subject to 
approval by shareholders at the 2024 Annual 
General Meeting to be held on 18 April 2024, 
in which event the final dividend will be paid 
on 3 May 2024 to shareholders on the register 
at the close of business on 15 March 2024.

In considering the final dividend, the Board 
took into account:

 – the policy of targeting a payout ratio of 

between 85 and 95 per cent of Adjusted 
profit after tax;

 – the desire to ensure that the dividend is 
sustainable and progressive throughout 
the cycle; and

 – the results for 2023 and the outlook for 

earnings.

The total dividend for the year will, therefore, 
be 27.8 pence, a rise of 5.7 per cent versus 
2022 (26.3 pence) and represents distribution 
of 85 per cent of Adjusted profit after tax.

The Board has decided to retain a scrip 
dividend option for the 2023 final dividend 
(subject to approval by shareholders at the 
2024 AGM), allowing shareholders to choose 
whether to receive the dividend in cash or 
new shares. In 2023, 49 per cent of the 2022 
final dividend and 21 per cent of the 2023 
interim dividend were paid in new shares, 
equating to £129 million of cash retained on 
the balance sheet.

Managing risk

Effective risk management

We understand that a 
unified and responsive 
approach to risk 
management is essential 
for us to be able to 
address the risks to our 
strategy.
Soumen Das, Chief Financial Officer

An effective, proportionate, and reliable 
risk management process is essential to 
support our strategy and business model. 
Whilst we still face the challenges of the 
external environment, risk management 
is embedded in our decision-making 
processes, meaning our business 
can remain stable and resilient.

Two examples of emerging risks we are 
currently monitoring are longer-term climate 
change and disruptive technologies.

Longer-term climate change
We consider the longer-term effects of some 
risks which are also principal risks within our 
risk register, for example, the effects of climate 
change. The further ahead the timescale, 
the harder it becomes to predict the physical 
effects of climate change, like temperature 
increases and heavier or more unpredictable 
rainfall, but we know this is something that will 
affect us in the future. In addition, SEGRO 
needs to consider how our actions to reduce 
carbon emissions will affect our strategy in the 
longer term, as well as potential new and 
rapidly changing liabilities associated with 
climate litigation. The impact of these risks 
could be a change in desired location of our 
assets, change in customer demand, 
reputation damage, downward impact on 
valuations and potential asset obsolescence.

Disruptive technologies
We also consider ‘new’ risks such as those 
associated with disruptive technologies. 
These may include developments such as the 
widespread adoption of autonomous vehicles 
and the resultant effect on demand and use 
of our assets, the longer term ‘working-from-
home’ habits and the effect on urbanisation, 
use of data and automation within our 
warehouses and the rise of ‘space-as-a-
service’ operators. While these changes could 
bring opportunities as well as threats, SEGRO 
cannot maintain a position of strength unless 
we continue to monitor the changes and 
increase our understanding over time. 

Soumen Das
Chief Financial Officer

The Group Risk Committee is made up of 
members of senior management and now 
includes the Group Customer & Operations 
Director. The members of the Committee 
have detailed knowledge of, and expertise in 
operational, financial and corporate aspects 
of our business. The Group Risk Committee 
has met three times during the year and has 
been responsible for overseeing the work of 
the risk management function on behalf of 
the Executive Committee. 

Although SEGRO’s principal risks do not 
dramatically change year-to-year there are key 
areas of focus in response to changes within the 
external environment or within the business. An 
example of a risk which has been a particularly 
are of focus this year is the risk associated with 
developments and construction. 

The successful delivery of SEGRO’s 
development programme required a suitable 
land bank in order to achieve SEGRO’s strategy 
of operational excellence. The macroeconomic 
environment is driving supply chain instability 
and more concern over contractor insolvency. 
Although development and construction 
execution is a long-standing principal risk 
within SEGRO’s risk register, the external 
environment impacts the type and significance 
of the risks associated with holding land and 
managing our development pipeline. We are 
therefore carefully monitoring our appetite for 
land holdings and undertaking due diligence 
associated with land, developments, appraisal 
assumptions and contractor performance. 
We have also extended this risk to specifically 
include reference to the potential impact of 
faulty design or construction, deleterious 
materials and changes in regulation 
affecting the compliance of our buildings.

Emerging risks
In addition to monitoring our principal risks in 
a risk register, we identify, assess and monitor 
emerging risks. We consider wide-ranging risks 
such as water availability and our buildings’ 
water demands, energy usage and access to 
power and changes to public sentiment which 
may affect customer demand associated, for 
example with air travel or data centres.

Annual risk management update
The macroeconomic and geopolitical 
challenges of 2022 have continued into 
2023 which inevitably affect SEGRO in terms 
of higher interest rates, and pressure on our 
asset valuations. Our rigorous risk management 
approach is therefore as vital as it has ever 
been, to not only maintain SEGRO’s stability 
and resilience into 2024 but also to remain well 
positioned in order to benefit from any positive 
trends in the near and longer-term future.

The Group’s Board and key committees 
have continued to oversee our response 
to these challenges and the wider 
economic implications throughout the year. 
Consequentially, they have taken actions to 
mitigate the impact on both our operations 
and the wellbeing of our employees. We review 
our investment plans regularly and continue to 
manage our balance sheet proactively to help 
mitigate the impacts of future volatility.

Our risk appetite

The Group’s ability to effectively manage 
risk throughout the organisation is central 
to the ongoing success of the business. 
Risk management ensures that there is a 
structured approach to the decision-making 
process that looks to reduce uncertainty over 
expected outcomes and to bring controllable 
risks within our appetite, thereby balancing 
uncertainty against the objective of creating 
and protecting value for our stakeholders, 
now and in the future.

We have put risk appetite at the heart of 
our risk management processes and it is 
integral both to our consideration of strategy 
and to our medium-term planning process. 
Our risk appetite is applicable throughout 
the organisation including joint ventures 
and associated companies.

The Group’s risk appetite is reviewed 
annually and approved by the Board in order 
to guide the business. As well as qualitative 
descriptions, the risk appetite defines 
tolerances and targets for key metrics. It also 
includes criteria for assessing the potential 
impact of risks and our mitigation of them.

Our risk appetite is dynamic, varying over 
time and during the course of the property 
cycle. We adjust our risk appetite in relation 
to different types of risks, as explained further 
below. However, overall, the Group maintains 
a low appetite for risk, appropriate to our 
strategic objectives of delivering long-term 
sustainable value.

Property risk
We recognise that, in seeking 
outperformance from our portfolio, 
the Group must accept a balanced level 
of property risk in order to enhance 
opportunities for superior returns. We strive 
for diversity in geographic locations and 
asset types, with an appropriate mixture 
of stabilised income-producing and 
opportunity assets. This is balanced 
against the backdrop of the geopolitical 
and macroeconomic environment and 
its impact on the property cycle. 

Our portfolio should deliver attractive, low 
risk income returns with strong rental and 
capital growth when market conditions are 
positive and with reasonable resilience in a 
downturn. We aim to enhance these returns 
through development, which requires 
appropriate levels of land holdings to 
support the pipeline. We seek to balance the 
risk of holding too much land, which might 
be a drag to earnings, by closely monitoring 
the churn and duration of our land holdings. 
We also seek to mitigate the risks, especially 
contractor covenant risks, that are inherent 
in development. With due consideration of 
our environmental responsibilities, we seek 
to develop buildings which meet and, 
preferably, exceed minimum regulatory 
requirements. Buildings which fail to achieve 
high environmental certification standards 
are increasingly less attractive to occupiers 
now and we expect this sentiment to 
intensify in the future.

We have a low appetite for risks to income 
from customers and therefore we maintain a 
diverse occupier base with strong covenants 
and avoid over-exposure to individual 
occupiers in specialist properties. 

Financial risk
The Group maintains a low appetite for 
financial risk in general, with a very low 
appetite for risks to solvency and gearing 
covenant breaches.

As an income-focused REIT we have a low 
appetite for risks which threaten a stable 
progression in earnings and dividends 
over the long-term. 

We also seek long-term growth in net 
asset value notwithstanding the impact 
of fluctuations from external factors which 
influence the property cycle. Our appetite 
for risks to net asset value from the 
factors within our control is low, albeit 
acknowledging that our appetite for 
moderate leverage across the cycle 
amplifies the impact of market-driven asset 
valuation movements on net asset value.

Corporate risk
We have a very low appetite for risks to our 
good reputation with our customers and 
wider stakeholders. These stakeholders 
include investors, regulators, employees, 
business partners, suppliers, lenders and 
the communities in which we operate.

Our responsibilities to these stakeholders 
include compliance with all relevant laws; 
accurate and timely reporting of financial 
and other regulatory information; 
protecting the health and safety of 
employees, suppliers, customers and 
other users of our assets; our impact on 
the environment; compliance with codes 
of conduct and ethics; ensuring business 
continuity; and making a positive 
contribution to our local communities.

Risk management

Our integrated and robust approach  
to risk management
The risk management process is designed 
to identify, assess and respond to significant 
risks to the Group’s objectives. Most of these 
risks cannot be eliminated or avoided so, 
instead, the process aims to understand, 
document, mitigate and monitor the 
risks. The risk management process 
can therefore only provide reasonable 
and not absolute assurance. 

The identification and review of emerging 
risks is integrated into our risk review 
process. Emerging risks are those risks 
or a combination of risks with a longer 
timescale. They are often rapidly evolving 
and, consequently, the impact and probability 
may be less predictable. Therefore, necessary 
mitigations are usually not yet fully evolved. 
All risk owners and managers within the 
business are challenged to consider 
emerging risks and this is supplemented 
through formal, twice-yearly horizon scans 
with the Executive Committee, as well as 
other relevant internal groups.

The Board has performed a robust 
assessment of the principal and emerging 
risks facing the Group. It formally reviewed 
the risks twice during the year and also 
completed its annual review and approval of 
the Group’s risk appetite, and the Group’s risk 
management policy. The Audit Committee 
then reviewed how the Group Risk Register 
has been compiled, at two points during 
the year.

The Board recognises that we have limited 
control over many of the external risks that 
the Group faces, such as global events as 
well as the macroeconomic, geopolitical, and 
regulatory environment, but still ensures we 
assess the potential impact of such risks on 
the business and consequential decision 
making. Internal risks are monitored by the 
Board to ensure that appropriately designed 
controls are in place and operate effectively 
to manage those risks.

The most significant risks are detailed in the 
Group Risk Register. Risks are assessed in both 
inherent (before taking any relevant controls 
into account) and residual (with mitigating 
controls operating normally) states. As part 
of the assessment, risk impact is directly 
measured against risk appetite so that it is 
clear whether each risk is classed as within 
appetite, tolerable, intolerable or below 
appetite. We also formally assess the velocity 
of the most significant risks to determine how 
quickly they might become intolerable. Each 
risk has a range of mitigating controls which 
are in place.

A Key Risk Indicator (KRI) dashboard is 
produced and monitored regularly to show 
actual and forecast performance against risk 
appetite metrics, allowing informed decision 
making. KRIs are considered regularly by the 
relevant monitoring committees in their 
decision making, as well as being integral 
to the Group’s Medium-Term Plan.

The Register is used as a key input to 
determine priorities for the Group’s internal 
audit assurance programme. 

Furthermore, management’s annual self-
assessment of control effectiveness is driven 
by the Register.

Our risk management 
process is long-standing 
and therefore is 
embedded and well 
understood throughout 
our business.

Our framework for risk governance
The Group adopts the ‘three lines of defence’ 
model of risk management. 

The first line of defence is provided by the 
function that has primary responsibility to 
own and manage the risk associated with 
day-to-day operational activities which may 
include operational management, the 
individual risk manager and executive 
risk owner. 

The second line of defence is provided 
by the function that oversees the risk or 
which specialises in compliance or risk 
management. This would typically be a 
monitoring committee such as the Executive 
Committee, the Investment Committee or 
the Technology Committee, as well as the risk 
management function overseen by the Group 
Risk Committee. 

The third line of defence is provided by 
Internal Audit which gives objective and 
independent assurance over whether the first 
and second lines of defence are operating 
effectively. Risks are considered within each 
area of the business to ensure that risk 
management is fully embedded within the 
Group’s operations, culture and decision-
making processes. 

The Board has overall responsibility for 
ensuring that risk is effectively and 
consistently managed across the Group. 
The Audit Committee monitors effectiveness 
on behalf of the Board. Further information 
on compliance with the risk management 
provisions of the UK Corporate Governance 
Code can be found in the Internal controls 
and risk management section of the Audit 
Committee Report. 

Accountabilities for the Group’s risk 
management are outlined in the diagram.

Principal risks

Principal risks and uncertainties
The principal risks have the potential to 
affect SEGRO’s business materially. Risks are 
classified as ‘principal’ based on their potential 
to intolerably exceed our appetite (considering 
both inherent and residual impact) and cause 
material harm to the Group.

Some risks that may be unknown at present, 
as well as other risks that are currently regarded 
as immaterial and therefore not detailed here, 
could turn out to be material in the future. The 
principal risks are reviewed and amended to 
reflect changing knowledge, understanding 
and assessment, including considering 
whether an emerging risk should be 
recorded, instead, as a principal risk. 

The current principal risks that the Group is 
aware that it is facing are summarised in the 
diagram and described on the following pages. 
The descriptions indicate the potential areas 
of impact on the Group’s strategy; the time-
horizon and probability of the risk; the principal 
activities that are in place to mitigate and 
manage such risks; the committees that 
provide second line of defence oversight; 
changes in the level of risk during the course 
of the year; and link to further relevant 
information in this report. 

A summary of the Group’s principal risks 
including an update of changes during the 
period and activity during the year, is provided 
below. The principal risks remain the same as 
reported in the 2022 Annual Report but, as 
mentioned earlier, the development plan 
execution risk has been slightly amended 
and renamed ‘Development and Construction 
Execution’. The impact and probability of each 
risk has not changed in the last year and the 
residual risk for each (after factoring in 
mitigations) remains within appetite.

Change in 2023:  
No change 

Current year activity
The uncertain geopolitical and 
macroeconomic outlook has continued 
to cause volatility in the capital markets 
and reduced liquidity in the property 
investment market. 

In response, we have continued to perform 
economic outlook assessments regularly 
and have ensured that portfolio strategy 
consequences are appropriately linked 
(see separate principal risk). We are therefore 
prepared to withstand these pressures even 
if they persist across the countries we 
operate in for some time. 

1   Macroeconomic impact on market cycle
The property market is cyclical in nature 
and there is a continuous risk that the 
Group could either misread or fail to 
react appropriately to the changing 
property market, cost of finance or wider 
macroeconomic and geopolitical conditions. 
This could result in the adoption of an 
inappropriate strategy or the ability to deliver 
a strategy being inhibited, and consequential 
impact on property performance and 
shareholder value.

Mitigations 
The Executive Committee, Investment 
Committee and ultimately the Board monitor 
the property market cycle on a continual 
basis and adapt the Group’s investment 
and divestment stance in response to 
experienced and anticipated changing 
market conditions.

Multiple, diverse investment and occupier 
market intelligence is regularly reviewed 
and considered, both from internal ‘on the 
ground’ sources and from independent 
external sources.

Upside and downside scenarios are 
incorporated into Investment Committee 
papers to assess the impact of differing 
market conditions and to inform our portfolio 
strategy (see separate principal risk).

Change in 2023:  
No change 

Regular analysis enables the portfolio to be 
correctly positioned in terms of location and 
asset type, and to retain the right mix of core 
and opportunity assets. The annual asset 
planning exercise provides a bottom-up 
assessment of the performance and 
potential for all existing assets to determine 
where to invest capital and to identify assets 
for disposal. ESG credentials are playing an 
increasingly significant role in transactional 
considerations.

Policies are in place to govern the evaluation, 
due diligence process, approval, execution 
and subsequent review of investment 
activity. Investment hurdle rates are regularly 
reappraised taking into account estimates of 
our weighted average cost of capital. 

Current year activity
The Group’s approach to portfolio 
management and capital allocation remains 
disciplined and responsive to opportunities 
that arise, as detailed in the Investment 
and Development updates sections. We 
continue to review our portfolio and maintain 
appropriate investment criteria and hurdle 
rates to ensure we remain resilient to 
macroeconomic uncertainty. 

2   Portfolio strategy and execution
The Group’s Total Property and/or 
Shareholder Returns could underperform 
in absolute or relative terms as a result of an 
inappropriate portfolio strategy. This could 
be caused by:

 – Unexpected macroeconomic factors;
 – Incorrect or ineffective capital allocation 

decisions;

 – Poor or incorrect market or asset level 
assumptions including disruptions, for 
example from changing occupier and 
customer needs, technological 
developments and innovation;

 – Inaccurate modelling or forecasting;
 – Increased competition for our assets or 

target customers; and/or

 – Lack of appropriate procedures and 
inadequate due diligence resulting in 
lengthy, onerous or costly transactions 
and missed opportunities.

Mitigations
The Group’s portfolio strategy is subject to 
regular review by the Board in order to 
consider the desired shape of the portfolio, 
so as to meet the Group’s overall strategy 
and to determine our response to changing 
opportunities and market conditions.

The Group’s approach to capital allocation is 
informed by comprehensive asset plans and 
independent external assessments of market 
conditions and forecasts. Major capital 
investment and disposal decisions are 
subject to Board approval in line with 
portfolio strategy. Locally-based property 
investment and operational teams provide 
market intelligence and use their networks to 
source attractive opportunities. They are 
overseen by UK and CE Heads of Investment.

Change in 2023:  
No change 

Current year activity
The heightened geopolitical uncertainty 
(including the ongoing conflict in Ukraine 
and the Middle East) has exacerbated global 
macroeconomic volatility. This economic 
backdrop continues to cause a degree of 
uncertainty to the Group’s operations and 
stakeholders. 

The Group maintains a robust financing and 
portfolio strategy in order to be well 
positioned and flexible in response to major 
events/business disruption. The Board and 
other committees remain vigilant and 
responsive in managing the mitigation of 
risks as they evolve. Working groups are set 
up, as required and often at short notice, to 
collate and align the Group’s response in an 
agile fashion as issues arise. These groups 
report directly to the Executive Committee.

4   Health and safety
A health and safety incident may occur 
which involves harm to an individual or loss 
of life. This may be due to the failure of 
management processes, failure of a building 
or other physical asset, or negligence of a 
third-party. Furthermore, the Group may 
breach relevant legislation and fail to provide 
suitable employee support. This may 
consequentially result in litigation, fines, 
serious reputational damage and a negative 
impact on employees. 

Mitigations
The Group operates an active health 
and safety management system, with a 
particular focus on the quality of and 
compliance with good health and safety 
practice of all our suppliers.

A published health and safety policy is 
supported by site inspections of existing 
assets (and potential new assets), as part of 
proactive management, and development 
project inspections in line with SEGRO’s 
Health and Safety Construction Standard.

Principal risks continued

3   Major event/business disruption
Unexpected global, regional or national 
events may result in severe adverse 
disruption to SEGRO, such as sustained 
asset value or revenue impairment, solvency 
or covenant stress, liquidity or business 
continuity challenges. A global event or 
business disruptor may include, but is not 
limited to, a global financial crisis, health 
pandemic, power/water shortages, weather-
related event, war or civil unrest, acts of 
terrorism, cyber-attack or other IT disruption. 
Events may be singular or cumulative, and 
lead to acute/systemic issues in the business 
and/or operating environment.

Mitigations
The Group positions itself to withstand a 
global event and business disruption through 
its financing strategy (see separate principal 
risk); portfolio strategy (see separate principal 
risk) including holding a diverse set of 
property assets; staying close to customers 
to understand their changing needs; holding 
insurance; strong customer base; 
organisational resilience of the workforce; 
and detailed business continuity and disaster 
recovery plans. Going concern and viability 
is assessed through a detailed, bottom-up, 
medium-term planning process including a 
business stress test and downside scenarios.

Specialist employees, under the oversight 
of our Technology Committee, continue to 
ensure the resilience and security of our 
technology using controls, training, testing 
and audits. We maintain suitable processes 
and controls in respect of business 
continuity and IT disaster recovery. We use 
third parties to supplement internal expertise 
when testing our resilience to a cyber-attack.

SEGRO has a zero-tolerance approach to 
poor health and safety and continues to 
work closely with our suppliers and health 
and safety consultants to increase 
understanding and implementation of 
SEGRO’s requirements.

The Health and Safety Committee develops 
and manages the implementation of Health 
and Safety policies, reviews the outcomes of 
the Health and Safety Working Group as well 
as any other health and safety matters. 
The Health and Safety Working Group is 
responsible for the implementation of, 
and compliance with the Health and Safety 
Policy and Safety Management System. It 
undertakes continuous monitoring of health 
and safety practices, including incidents, 
inspections and training tracked across the 
Group. Legal guidance and further support 
is provided through local health and safety 
consultants and lawyers who provide 
regulatory assurance support to the 
Group alongside our internal expertise.

Current year activity
The health and safety of the workforce 
remains a key priority in locations where we 
operate, including when working away from 
the office. We have continued to expand our 
wellbeing activities with employees. We have 
closely monitored our development sites 
with in-person inspections, in local language, 
in order to ensure a safe and compliant 
working environment and detailed further on 
page 41. This risk is expected to remain a key 
focus going forward.

This risk has increasing prominence each 
year and we expect this to continue. See 
page 73 for details of further actions

5   Environmental sustainability and climate change
There is a risk that we fail to anticipate and 
respond to the impact of both physical and 
transitional risks from climate change on 
our business as well as changes in climate-
related regulatory reporting. The likelihood 
of increased severity and unpredictability of 
weather-related events may result in more 
frequent and/or prolonged damage to our 
buildings causing disruption and increased 
costs to SEGRO and our customers. Non-
compliance with changing laws, regulations, 
policies, taxation and obligations cause loss 
of value to the Group. Not keeping pace with 
social attitudes and customer behaviours 
and preferences whereby SEGRO may need 
to alter the design and build and/or energy 
provision of their assets could additionally 
cause reputational damage and reduce the 
attractiveness and value of our assets. 

Climate-related risks, their time horizon 
and their management and mitigation 
are detailed further on pages 71 to 73.

Mitigations
The Responsible SEGRO framework sets out 
our corporate responsibility strategy, as well 
as medium and long-term commitments. 
Our dedicated Sustainability team is in place 
to support Group and local teams and share 
updates on legal and regulatory changes 
and best practice, as advised by a range 
of external expert advisors. Each significant 
investment appraisal includes an assessment 
of climate-related risk and other 
considerations such as measures taken 
to increase energy efficiency and reduce 
carbon emissions. A climate resilience study 
has been undertaken to assess the medium 
and long-term physical risks to our portfolio 
as detailed further on page 71.

6   Development and construction execution
The Group has an extensive current 
programme and future pipeline of 
developments which brings the 
following risks: 

 – Cost over-runs on larger, more complex 
projects, for example, due to contractor 
default or poor performance and 
management;

 – Increased construction costs or over-

optimistic appraisals leading to reduced 
or uneconomic development yields;

 – Above-appetite exposure to non-income 

producing assets, reducing returns;

 – Below-appetite land holdings restricting 

opportunities; and

 – Additional costs, reputation damage, 

health and safety exposure or regulatory 
breach due to building defect or 
deleterious materials in buildings.

Mitigations
Our appetite for exposure to non-income 
producing assets (including land, 
infrastructure and speculative developments) 
is monitored closely, for example, when 
acquisition decisions are being made by the 
Investment Committee. The development 
programme remains weighted towards 
pre-let opportunities. We retain a high level 
of optionality in our future development 
programme including at the point of land 
acquisition, commitment to infrastructure 
and commitment to building. 

The risk of cost overruns or supply chain 
issues is, at least in part, mitigated by using 
our experienced development teams and a 
panel of trusted advisors and contractors, 
and typically using fixed price contracts. We 
work collaboratively with our contractors and 
remain in constant dialogue to identify 
possible issues and possible solutions 
ahead of time.

Change in 2023:

The risk of contractor default is mitigated by 
using a diversified selection of companies 
which have been through a rigorous 
onboarding process and closely monitoring 
their financial strength. Our short 
development lead-times enable a quick 
response to changing market conditions.

Internally, oversight is maintained via the 
Construction Steering Group, who link in 
with the Health and Safety team and manage 
challenges like defects or deleterious 
materials in our buildings. Additionally, our 
Partnership Development team engages 
with stakeholders as part of SEGRO’s social 
responsibilities and also support planning 
processes. 

Current year activity
As market conditions have remained 
challenging, as detailed in the Portfolio 
Strategy Execution risk above, we have 
maintained clear investment criteria. We 
continue to work closely with our contractors 
and were able to react with agility and 
responsiveness when a UK contractor 
faced difficulties during the year. Going 
forward, with an expected continuing volatile 
economic environment, similar pressures 
are likely to continue so we must carefully 
monitor the risks while we balance the needs 
of our contractors and customers. We have 
investigated our exposure to defective and 
deleterious materials in response to issues 
as they have arisen.

7   Financing strategy
The Group could suffer an acute liquidity 
or solvency crisis, financial loss or financial 
distress as a result of a failure in the design 
or execution of its financing strategy.

Such an event may be caused by a number 
of factors including a failure to obtain debt or 
equity funding (for example, due to market 
disruption or rating downgrade); having an 
inappropriate debt structure (including 
leverage level, debt maturity, interest rate 
or currency exposure); poor forecasting; 
defaulting on loan agreements as a result 
of a breach of financial or other covenants; 
or counterparty default. 

Change in 2023:  
No change 

Current year activity
Despite uncertainty caused by the external 
geopolitical macroeconomic environment 
the Group can still access financial markets 
as seen by our funding activity (as detailed in 
the Financial review). The Group (including its 
largest joint venture SELP) maintains a 
meaningful presence in the Euro bond 
market as well as in the sterling bond and US 
Private Placement markets leaving us well 
positioned financially to fund activity in 
line with our strategy priorities. The Group 
continues to use fixed rate debt and 
relevant derivatives to mitigate against 
the risk of interest rates increasing both 
now and going forward.

Mitigations
The Group’s financing strategy is aligned 
with our long-term business strategy, the 
Medium-Term Plan and our risk appetite. 
Our Treasury policy defines key policy 
parameters and controls to support 
execution of the strategy.

The Group regularly reviews its changing 
financing requirements in light of 
opportunities and market conditions and 
maintains a good long-term relationship 
with a wide range of finance providers.

Funding requirements and liquidity are 
closely monitored and there is substantial 
headroom on all our financial covenants.

8   Legal, political and regulatory
The Group could fail to anticipate legal, 
political, tax or other regulatory changes, 
leading to litigation, censure, penalties 
and fines. This would result in a significant 
unforeseen financial or reputational impact.

In general, legal, regulatory and tax matters 
present medium- to long-term risks with a 
medium likelihood of causing significant 
harm to the Group.

Political risks could impact business 
confidence and conditions in the short 
and longer terms.

Mitigations
Legal and regulatory risks are reviewed 
regularly by internal specialists (e.g. Legal, 
Health and Safety, Sustainability) as well as 
the Executive Committee. Corporate heads 
of function regularly consult with external 
advisers, attend industry and specialist 
briefings, and sit on key industry bodies 
such as EPRA and the British Property 
Federation, as well as maintaining 
relationships with their peers. 

We continue to closely monitor the taxation 
regulations with our advisors to ensure 
changes which may impact the Group or 
our customers are identified and addressed, 
in a timely fashion. The Group’s tax 
compliance is managed by an experienced 
internal tax team. REIT and SIIC tax regime 
compliance is demonstrated at least 
bi-annually. Compliance with joint venture 
and associated shareholder agreements 
is managed by experienced property 
operations, finance and legal employees. 
Where necessary, comprehensive 
governance and compliance arrangements 
are in place, including specific management 
operating manuals.

Change in 2023:  
Increased 

Current year activity
The legal and regulatory environment 
remains dynamic with an ever-increasing 
number of new laws and regulations. 

Tax authorities are continuing to update 
regulations and SEGRO is working closely 
with advisors to respond to this enhanced 
reporting environment.

In addition, the current economic situation 
means we are alert to an increased risk of 
unethical behaviour making our Code of 
Business Conduct and Ethics, with the 
accompanying training, even more 
important.

9   People and talent
The performance of the business could be 
impaired due to SEGRO:

 – Not having the appropriate culture, 
organisational structure, policies 
and procedures or skilled people;
 – Failing to attract, motivate, retain and 
develop diverse talent as part of our 
Nurturing talent ambition due to 
inappropriate reward and recognition, 
learning and development, performance 
management, hybrid working practices 
or social policies; and

 – Failing to prepare adequate talent 
management or succession plans. 

Mitigations
We review succession planning and key 
person risk at least annually with the 
Executive Committee and the Board. We 
review compensation in our largest countries 
annually with a third party to ensure that we 
have appropriate salary ranges in place. We 
have a variety of incentive tools that can be 
applied flexibly during the year to retain at 
risk, talented employees and these are 
reviewed by the Remuneration Committee. 
We have created a people planning process 
with senior leaders so that we can proactively 
plan for resourcing and development needs. 
We regularly review the hiring, and appraisal, 
succession planning and talent process as 
well as undertaking employee engagement 
surveys to understand employee sentiment.

Our ambition is to build a more sustainable 
business, a key feature of which is to become 
more inclusive and diverse, as set out in our 
Responsible SEGRO framework. We continue 
to use a programme of work which is being 
guided by the National Equality Standard 
framework. The Human Resources team 
work with our Partnership Development team 
on wider Responsible SEGRO initiatives like 
employment projects.

Change in 2023:  
No change 

Current year activity
The talent market continues to be relatively 
benign and attrition levels are within appetite 
and lower than the previous year. We have 
restructured our organisation in 2023 and, 
with a new Executive Committee and 
Leadership Team in place, we are well 
progressed with embedding the changes. 
The majority of appointments were internal, 
showing the strength of our talent and 
succession pipeline.

We have further developed our Values and 
introduced clear Behaviours for all 
colleagues. We continue to review our 
employment proposition in each country to 
ensure that we are able to attract and retain 
strong talent.

Change in 2023:  
No change 

Current year activity
During the period we continue to have 
enhanced engagement with our customers 
in light of the volatile economic conditions 
and have continued to consider customer 
concentration risks. Our customer 
development team has grown over the year 
to support the customer engagement and 
development work.

We have introduced workflow tools which 
increase the automation and transparency 
of the lettings and asset management 
processes.

We work closely with our supply chain and 
have undertaken a review of key suppliers 
to ensure suitable alternatives are in place 
should one fail. Critical suppliers include 
those contractors and, by association their 
sub-contractors (detailed more fully in the 
Development and Construction Execution 
risk) and IT suppliers. Furthermore, we 
continue to ensure our suppliers are 
paid promptly.

10   Operational delivery
The Group could suffer an operational failure 
such as: major customer default; supply 
chain, reporting or treasury failure; 
inappropriate or inaccurate valuation 
reporting; erroneous lease execution 
or poor customer insight and retention. 

This could cause a range of negative impacts 
including reputational damage and financial 
impact from fines, unexpected costs and 
lost revenue.

Mitigations
The Group maintains a strong focus on 
Operational excellence. The Executive 
Committee and Joint Operating Group 
regularly monitor the range of risks to 
property management, organisational 
effectiveness and customer management. 
Each operational area is overseen by a strong 
and skilled internal team.

We ensure our customer base is broad and, 
as far as possible, has a strong covenant 
which we closely monitor as well as 
customer concentration metrics. We 
undertake senior customer stakeholder 
interviews and an annual strategic customer 
survey which shapes our customer 
engagement plans. 

We regularly review our policies and 
procedures to ensure they remain 
appropriate as well as checking 
compliance through internal and external 
audits. We also maintain adequate 
insurances across the Group.
