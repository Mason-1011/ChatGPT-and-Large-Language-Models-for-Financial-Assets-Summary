What we do
SEGRO owns, manages 
and develops modern 
and sustainable warehouse 
space across Europe.

Our portfolio includes both urban and big box warehouses*.

Urban warehouses

Big box warehouses

66%

asset type by value
Urban warehouses are located in, 
or close to, population centres and 
business districts and provide flexible 
space suitable for a wide-range of 
activities. They are used by a variety 
of businesses who need rapid 
access to end customers, as well 
as labour. They are generally 
situated close to main roads 
and public transport.

32%

asset type by value
Big box warehouses are typically used 
for storage and processing of goods 
for regional, national and international 
distribution and are much larger than 
urban warehouses. They are often 
located far from the end customer but 
are situated on major transport routes 
(mainly motorways, ports, rail freight 
terminals and airports) to allow 
rapid transit.

*Other 2% – includes offices and retail uses such as trade counters, car showrooms 
and self storage facilities

Responsible SEGRO as a key part of our future success

How this works for our business
Responsible SEGRO is embedded into the day-to-day running of our business and 
all of our decision making. This helps us to ensure that our business remains fit for

Investment case

Supportive structural trends
We are focused on the industrial and logistics sector 
where there are long-term structural trends driving 
occupier demand from a diverse range of sectors

Prime portfolio of existing assets
One of the most modern and sustainable pan-European 
portfolios focused on the most attractive European markets

SEGRO is structurally 
advantaged to 
outperform.

Active in a sector where demand is fuelled by 
supportive structural drivers but competing supply 
is restricted. Our prime portfolio, sizeable land bank, 
market-leading operating platform and strong 
balance sheet create a compelling competitive 
advantage. We have the potential to more than 
double our rent roll through the active asset 
management of our portfolio and building out our 
land bank. Added to this, our continued focus on 
Responsible SEGRO ensures we are creating 
long-term value for all of our stakeholders.

Market overview
Our business performance is driven by both 
cyclical and structural factors. The investment 
market remains cyclical but the occupier 
market continues to be supported by long-term 
structural trends, which are resulting in resilient 
levels of occupier demand.

Our business model
At the heart of how we do business lies a deep 
understanding of our customers’ needs. We rely 
on different inputs, which combine to give us our 
competitive advantage and our ability to create 
superior value for all of our stakeholders.

Our prime portfolio and market-
leading operating platform 
combine to create a strong 
competitive advantage, and 
position us to create value through 
the cycle for all our stakeholders.

SEGRO has delivered a strong operational 
performance during 2023, throughout 
a period of ongoing geopolitical and 
macroeconomic uncertainty. We have 
continued to focus on delivering excellent 
customer service; actively asset managing 
our portfolio; reducing our carbon footprint; 
and tactically adapting our capital allocation 
to reflect current financial conditions. 

Our market-leading operating platform, 
with in-house property expertise in all of 
our local markets, ensures we keep close 
to our customers, develop local stakeholder 
relationships and provides us with critical 
insights to help identify attractive opportunities 
and optimise performance from our portfolio. 
This platform has enabled us to deliver 
another set of strong operating metrics, 
which led to continued growth in both 
Adjusted earnings and dividends.

Highlights of the year included:
 – £88 million of new rent contracted, close 
to our 2022 record year which benefited 
from exceptional occupier demand 
during the pandemic;

 – Significant success capturing rental 

reversion, with a 31 per cent uplift in rent from 
reviews and renewals, whilst maintaining high 
levels of customer retention at 81 per cent, 
illustrating that our customers are prepared 
to pay higher rents to occupy the best-
located, modern and sustainable space. 
This helped us to deliver like-for-like net 
rental income growth of 6.5 per cent; 
 – Development completions delivering 
£50 million of potential headline rent, 
92 per cent of which have been, or 
are designed to be, certified at least 
BREEAM ‘Excellent’ (or local equivalent);

 – Outperforming our carbon-reduction 
targets with a further reduction in the 
average carbon intensity in our development 
programme and significant progress in 
gaining visibility of, and influencing, the 
carbon emissions of our customers;
 – Good progress with our Community 
Investment Plans, providing tangible 
economic and social benefits for 
thousands of people in the communities 
closest to our assets.

Financially we are pleased to report a 
5.5 per cent increase in Adjusted earnings per 
share and we are therefore recommending a 
5.7 per cent increase in the total distribution 
to our shareholders to 27.8 pence for 2023 
(2022: 26.3 pence) through payment of a 
19.1 pence per share final dividend.

Adjusted net asset value per share was down 
6.1 per cent to 907 pence (31 December 2022: 
966 pence), reflecting a 4.0 per cent 
like-for-like portfolio valuation decline 
(2022: 11.0 per cent decline), as a result of 
interest rate-driven yield expansion. This was 
partly offset by rental value (ERV) growth of 
6.0 per cent, resulting from asset management 
initiatives and by development profits.

I would like to thank everyone at SEGRO for 
their contributions to our 2023 performance. 
In what have been more challenging market 
conditions, these results are a testament to 
the successful reshaping of our portfolio 
and balance sheet over the past decade; 
the strong relationships that we have built 
with our customers; and the continued focus 
of our team on delivering benefits for all of 
our stakeholders. 

A year of continued occupier demand 
in the industrial and logistics sector
During 2023, occupier demand in the 
industrial and logistics sector normalised  
close to pre-pandemic levels of take-up, 
proving resilient in the face of cost 
challenges (rising input costs, wage 
inflation and higher interest rates) and 
macroeconomic headwinds faced both 
by consumers and businesses. 

We believe this level of activity demonstrates 
the enduring strength of the structural 
tailwinds which have been driving occupier 
demand over recent years and will continue 
to do so. These include the explosion of 
data and the digitalisation of businesses 
and society, including continued growth 
in e-commerce volumes and of demand for 
data centres; supply chain optimisation to 
drive cost savings, improve customer service 
and provide greater resilience; increased 
focus on sustainability; and urbanisation – 

the long-term trend for urban population 
growth which creates greater demand for 
warehouse space, whilst reducing the 
supply of available land.

These trends highlight both the changing 
nature of our customer base, and a 
fundamental change in the way industrial 
logistic space is used. Today it represents 
part of the critical infrastructure of 
businesses providing a range of goods 
and services which are essential to the 
smooth running of the economy and 
supporting our day-to-day lives.

For users of industrial and logistics space, 
location is critical to the success of their 
operations. They are increasingly seeking 
modern, flexible and highly sustainable 
space to improve operational efficiency 
and to attract talent in a competitive labour 
market. Beyond the typical users such as 
manufacturers, retailers and third-party 
logistics operators, modern warehouse 
space is used by data centres, digital content 
producers, healthcare and life sciences as 
well as a huge array of other businesses that 
provide essential goods and services to our 
towns and cities. Our buildings are essential 
to support the growth, productivity and 
competitiveness of our economies. 

New supply to meet this broad demand is 
restricted by the low levels of land available 
for new development across Europe, especially 
in the major cities in which we operate, where 
public policy and restrictive planning regimes 
give housing preference over industrial usage 
and severely limit the release of green belt 
land. In the immediate-term, financial market 
conditions are also restricting the supply of 
new space, with tighter (and more expensive) 
capital availability resulting in a reduction of 
speculative construction starts and less 
competition. This should play in the favour 
of market participants such as SEGRO who 
have prime portfolios, focus on total returns 
over a multi-year period and are supported 
by strong balance sheets.

As a result of continuing occupier demand 
and limited new supply, market vacancy rates 
remain low by any historical standard in our 
key markets at four to six per cent. Average 
country-level vacancy rates, which are above 
this range in Spain and Poland, hide significant 
disparities in regional supply and, importantly, 
the quality of available stock. Not all 
warehouse space is equal: there are older 
buildings and estates in secondary locations 
that do not compete directly with the quality 
of space provided by SEGRO. 

Laser-focused strategy execution
We have long followed a clear and consistent 
strategy comprised of Disciplined capital 
allocation and Operational excellence, 
underpinned by an Efficient financial and 
corporate structure and a commitment 
to making a significant social and 
environmental contribution through 
our Responsible SEGRO approach.

In a higher interest rate and inflationary 
environment, taking a disciplined and 
thoughtful approach to capital allocation has 
never been more important. Recognising that 
capital is more scarce and more expensive for 
all market participants, we increased our return 
requirements for all investment opportunities, 
focusing our efforts on those projects with the 
best risk-adjusted returns. With development, 
we have continued to favour pre-let projects, 
remaining prudent in only bringing forward 
speculative schemes in markets with the 
tightest supply and the deepest demand. 
In some cases, we have sold selective land 
plots to key customers to develop themselves. 
During 2023, we sought to match a substantial 
proportion of our development expenditure 
with sales proceeds, and we were pleased 
to complete total sales of £356 million 
significantly ahead of book value. 

As a result, our balance sheet remains in 
great shape, with moderate leverage and no 
near-term refinancing requirements, helping 
to ensure we have an efficient capital structure 
with capacity to continue investing in the 
most attractive investment opportunities 
as we move forward in 2024. 

Operational excellence has also remained 
a key focus: delivering superior customer 
service; actively managing our portfolio to 
capture reversion; creating value through 
asset management initiatives and executing 
on our development pipeline efficiently 
and sustainably. Our operating results, once 
again, show the benefits of this strategy in 
action, despite the more challenging 
macroeconomic environment.

2023 saw the retirement of our long-standing 
Chief Operating Officer, Andy Gulliford. Andy 
made a tremendous contribution to SEGRO 
since he joined the business in 2004 and 
particularly since becoming our COO in 2011. 

Following Andy’s retirement, we took the 
opportunity to change our organisational 
structure to reflect the increased scale and 
footprint of our business. The new structure 
provided opportunities to promote great 
talent from within the business, whilst 
ensuring that the leadership team has 
the right experience and capabilities to 
deliver SEGRO’s strategic priorities and 
secure its ambitious plans for future 
growth. The main changes were:

 – We have consolidated our six regional 

business units into two property businesses, 
each under a separate Managing Director – 
the UK and Continental Europe – enabling 
us to drive performance and consistency 
across the two businesses. 

 – We have appointed a Group Customer 

and Operations Director to further drive a 
high-level customer experience across the 
Group, and to ensure greater consistency of 
execution of several operational functions 
such as sustainability, health & safety 
and procurement.

 – We also appointed a Chief of Staff 

to support the work of the Executive 
Committee, to drive progress around our 
core strategic priorities, including digital 
transformation, and new growth initiatives 
across the business in areas such as data 
centres and renewable energy.

1   Proportionally consolidated figures and metrics: 

SEGRO owns assets both wholly itself and through 
stakes in 50-50 joint ventures. In the Financial 
Statements, the profit from joint ventures is stated 
as a single figure in the Income Statement and the 
net asset value of joint ventures is stated as a 
single equity figure on the Balance Sheet; Note 7 to 
the Financial Statements provides the component 
parts of these figures. In operational terms, SEGRO 
does not distinguish between assets held in joint 
ventures from those assets which are wholly-
owned. Therefore, unless specifically stated, in the 
Strategic Report, performance metrics and 
financial figures are stated reflecting SEGRO’s 
wholly-owned assets and its share of joint venture 
assets (known commonly as a ‘proportionally 
consolidated’ basis). Where the Strategic Report 
refers to the area of a property, it is stated at 100 
per cent of the space, irrespective of whether the 
property is wholly-owned or held in a joint venture.

 2 EPRA and Adjusted metrics: The Financial 

Statements are prepared under IFRS. SEGRO 
management monitors a number of adjusted 
performance indicators in assessing and 
managing the performance of the business 
which they believe reflect the underlying recurring 
performance of the property rental business which 
is the Group’s core operating activity. These 
include those defined by EPRA as part of their 
mission to establish consistency of calculation 
across the European listed real estate sector. 
Pages 162-163 contain more information about 
the adjustments and the reconciliation of these 
to IFRS equivalents. SEGRO discloses EPRA 
alternative metrics on pages 186-192. 
Adjusted NAV per share is in line with EPRA NTA.
3  Percentage valuation movement during the period 
based on the difference between opening and 
closing valuations for all properties including 
buildings under construction and land, adjusting 
for capital expenditure, acquisitions and disposals. 
More details are provided on page 36 and Table 3 
in the Supplementary Notes.

Chief Executive’s statement continued

I am very pleased that we were able to fill 
these roles from our internal pool of talent, 
and I am very much enjoying the fresh 
perspective and additional debate that 
our new and expanded Executive 
Committee offers. 

Responsible SEGRO remains a key priority and 
we continue to work hard towards achieving 
the challenging targets that we have set 
ourselves. Reducing our own carbon footprint, 
increasing our solar capacity and the energy 
efficiency of our buildings remains a key focus 
for all of our stakeholders and it is of growing 
relevance to property occupiers and investors, 
felt through both rental and capital values. 
We made good progress in 2023 towards 
our mid-term carbon reduction goals, but 
we still have some way to go to become a 
net-zero enterprise. 

Our Community Investment Plans are gaining 
traction and are having a real impact on the 
communities near our assets, embedding 
our buildings as local centres of economic 
success, helping to create opportunities for 
local people and improving the environment 
and local amenities for local residents.

Finally, our success in developing and 
promoting colleagues across the Group 
shows the importance of Nurturing talent. 
We continue to strive to ensure that SEGRO 
provides a fulfilling and rewarding place to 
work, offers an inclusive environment and 
equal opportunities for all. We are working 
hard towards becoming a more diverse and 
representative organisation and although we 
are gender diverse at a Group level, we are 
not satisfied with the current levels of gender 
and ethnic diversity in more senior roles 
and recognise that we still have some way 
to go. For this reason, we have set ourselves 
stretching targets to improve diversity in 
senior leadership roles to 40 per cent women 
by 2025 and 15 per cent ethnic minorities 
by 2027 (currently 33 and 5 per cent).

Positioning our business 
for long-term success
Last year we launched a new and bolder 
ambition, to be the best property company. 
We focused on this ambition at our Group 
Conference in September, while getting the 
whole company together for the first time 
since the pandemic. We discussed how, by 
challenging ourselves to search for excellence 
in every aspect of our business, we can drive 
SEGRO to achieve even more success in the 
decade ahead than we have in the past ten 
years. This ambition will drive us to keep one 
eye on the continuously changing horizon, 
think outside the box, innovate, search for 
new ways of serving our customers, challenge 
market norms and seek to remain one step 
ahead of the competition in our markets. 

There are a number of areas that we 
are prioritising to help us achieve this:
 – We remain focused on developing 

outstanding customer relationships, built 
upon a consistent, high-level experience 
through every aspect of the customers’ 
journey with us. The more we can create 
genuine long-term partnerships with our 
customers, the better we can anticipate 
future trends, identify new opportunities 
and help them achieve their goals. 

 – In parallel, we are sourcing and analysing 
data to gain valuable insights into our 
markets to enhance decision-making 
and keep us one step ahead of our 
peers. Our focus on strategic active 
asset management has helped to shape, 
and drive value from, our prime portfolio, 
but we want to harness these insights to 
ensure we maximise long-term performance 
and create exceptional opportunities for 
growth. We are also dedicating time to 
investigate potential ways of accelerating 
this growth, such as new business 
areas, strategic partnerships and 
other opportunities to create value.

 – We are creating a culture of continuous 

change and improvement in our processes, 
our ways of working and our digital and 
technological capabilities to help us 
become more efficient as a business, 
allowing us to improve productivity and 
maximise the talents of our employees.

 – We cannot be the best property company 

without a strong social responsibility 
and a compelling offering to our wider 
stakeholders. Our focus on Championing 
low-carbon growth, Investing in our local 
communities and environments and 
Nurturing talent are parts of our DNA, 
increasingly embedded within our 
day-to-day activities and other 
strategic priorities.

Together, we believe that these priorities 
will ensure that we continue to deliver on our 
Purpose of creating the space that enables 
extraordinary things to happen, and fulfil our 
ambition to be the best property company. 

Outlook
SEGRO has one of the highest quality, best 
located and most modern pan-European 
industrial warehouse portfolios, with a 
diverse customer base. Our strategic focus 
is to ensure that our properties are located 
in the most supply constrained locations 
and are of a standard that makes them highly 
appealing to occupiers - and are therefore 
able to generate superior long-term rental 
growth and overall performance. 

As we progress through 2024, whilst 
macroeconomic and geopolitical uncertainty 
remain elevated, we note that inflation has 
fallen sharply over recent months and capital 
market pricing is now implying that interest 
rates have peaked. If sustained, this provides a 
positive backdrop for a recovery of investment 
market sentiment as the year progresses.

Take-up levels are in line with or higher 
than pre-pandemic levels across our 
markets, supported by the key structural 
drivers of occupier demand which remain 
very much in evidence: data and digitalisation, 
supply chain optimisation, sustainability 
and urbanisation. 

developers; and in the longer-term as public 
policy, particularly in urban areas, continues 
to favour housing over industrial usage and 
severely restricts the use of greenbelt land.

£137 million of our future income growth 
is underpinned by rent reversion within our 
existing portfolio, approximately 20 per cent 
of our current rent roll. Most of this reversion 
is in the UK and will be captured by the 
five-yearly open market rent review process, 
whilst we will continue to benefit from 
index-linked uplifts on over half of our 
leases (mostly in Continental Europe). 

Further, our high-quality land bank, with 
the potential to add over £390 million of 
rental income, provides us with the ability 
to meet occupier demand through further 
development. Projects within this land bank, 
as well as redevelopment opportunities within 
our existing portfolio such as on the Slough 
Trading Estate, combine to give the potential 
for 1.2 GW of new data centre capacity across 
24 sites. Our strong balance sheet provides 
financial flexibility to invest at a time when 
construction costs are moderating, and 
supply of new competing product remains 
low. Development therefore continues to 
offer a profitable growth opportunity, as 
demonstrated with improving development 
yields of seven to eight per cent.

Overall, we believe the present market 
environment offers an attractive opportunity 
for profitable mid-term investment, including 
the ability to grow passing rents by more than 
50 per cent over the next three years. SEGRO 
is therefore well-placed to deliver attractive 
returns and continued growth in earnings 
and dividends.

David Sleath
Chief Executive 

This gives us confidence in the outlook 
for continued rental growth in line with our 
medium-term guidance of two to six per cent 
per annum, particularly as supply remains 
restricted in the near-term due to low levels 
of vacancy and limited capital availability for

Market overview

The performance of real estate businesses 
are influenced both by occupier markets and 
investment markets. 

The 
occupier 
market

These 
markets are 
interconnected

The 
investment 
market

Overview
The occupier market is driven by simple supply and 
demand dynamics for our warehouses. If there is 
high demand but limited supply, vacancy rates will 
be low and the shortage of supply will drive rents higher.

Outside factors that drive the market
Supply and demand can be driven by cyclical 
factors such as the macroeconomic environment, for 
example economic growth, but also structural factors which 
can drive continued demand throughout the economic 
cycle.

How this influences our performance
The occupier market affects our ability to grow rents 
and therefore deliver growth in earnings and dividends.

Where these two interconnect is ultimately down to the 
importance of cashflow in the real estate sector, i.e. the 
rental income expected to be recevied from the buildings. 
If occupier markets are strong and rental income is growing, 
investors may be prepared to accept a lower return (yield) 
than they would in an environment where the occupier 
market is poor and the rental income is potentially riskier. 

The occupier market therefore generally impacts the 
investment market but the same is not true in reverse. 
This was the case during 2023 where we have seen 
resilience in our occupier markets, driven by structural 
drivers which helped to offset macroeconomic weakness, 
but investment markets have been weaker driven by 
uncertainty around inflation and interest rates.

Overview
The investment market is influenced by the relative 
attractiveness of real estate as an asset class versus other 
potential investments, for example cash, corporate and 
government bonds and equities. Real estate is typically 
seen as having some bond-type characteristics, long-term 
and relatively low-risk income streams (as leases on 
commercial property are signed for multiple years) 
but with the potential for that income to grow. 

Outside factors that drive the market
If interest rates increase and government bond yields (the 
‘risk-free rate’) are higher this can lead to investors wanting 
a higher return from their real estate investments (the 
yield). If yields increase asset values typically fall (absent 
any other changes).

How this influences our performance
The investment market therefore has an impact on the 
value of our assets and the total returns from our portfolio.

Cyclical 
factors

Factors often linked to the economic 
cycle that influence supply and 
demand, and therefore impact 
asset values and rental levels.

Economic outlook

Interest rate environment

Description
Economic outlook is an important driver of 
occupier demand for space. A supportive 
economic outlook encourages businesses 
to grow and therefore to secure extra space. 
In a recession, customer insolvencies and 
commercial property vacancy rates have 
historically increased.

Macroeconomic uncertainty continued 
during 2023. Falling energy prices helped 
reduce inflation but GDP growth was low 
at less than one per cent (UK: 0.5 per cent, 
Eurozone 0.5 per cent). It is expected to 
improve during 2024 but growth will 
likely remain low (IMF expects UK and 
Eurozone GDP growth of 0.6 and 
0.9 per cent respectively). 

Occupier demand in 2023 remained 
resilient in the face of the uncertain 
macroeconomic environment, supported 
by the structural drivers at play in our sector. 
However, market take-up levels returned 
closer to pre-pandemic averages as some 
customers chose to delay their expansion 
plans in the light of the uncertainty around 
the future strength of consumer demand 
and also higher funding costs. 

How SEGRO responded
We brought forward a lower amount of 
speculative development during 2023, 
focusing the majority of our new activity 
on signing pre-lets on land that we already 
own. Most of our competitors did the same 
which meant that speculative construction 
starts fell significantly. Market vacancy rates 
are therefore likely to stay low given the 
resilience of take-up, which bodes well 
for future rental growth. 

Description
In response to elevated levels of inflation, 
central banks repeatedly increased interest 
rates during 2023, reaching levels not seen 
in over a decade (Eurozone 4.0 per cent, 
UK 5.25 per cent). The margin between 
government bond yields (the ‘risk free 
benchmark’) and property yields, that helps 
to determine the attractiveness of property 
assets to investors, has therefore reduced. 

Uncertainty around the trajectory for rates 
also impacted property investment markets 
and resulted in low investment volumes. As 
a result industrial real estate yields moved 
out further and were between 4.3 and 6.3 
per cent in our markets at the end of 2023.

Higher interest rates also result in a higher 
cost of debt which can make investments 
financed through debt (for example 
development) less profitable and on a 
corporate level can impact earnings growth. 

How SEGRO responded
Market yield movements are largely 
outside of our control but we have 
focused our portfolio on the markets 
where we believe demand will be strongest 
and supply will remain limited. This should 
drive greater rental growth and long-term 
outperformance. The yield on our portfolio 
increased 50 basis points during 2023 
(from 4.8 to 5.3 per cent) but six per cent 
estimated rental value growth helped to 
offset the impact of the yield movement.

We adjusted the hurdle rates on our 
investment decisions to ensure we 
focused on the most profitable development 
opportunities and increased disposals 
to part fund capex rather than issuing 
new debt.

Market overview continued

Geopolitical environment

Competitive supply

Digitalisation of society

Description
A stable geopolitical environment is 
important for businesses as it provides 
certainty and confidence when planning 
for the future. 

The geopolitical environment remained 
uncertain during 2023 with continued 
impacts from the Russian invasion 
of Ukraine and also conflict in the 
Middle East. 

Despite this, supply chain issues were 
largely resolved during the course of 2023 as 
alternative solutions were found. This helped 
to reduce the cost of the major raw materials 
used in our development programme (steel, 
cement, timber etc) and brought stability 
to construction cost inflation. 

There are a number of other geopolitical 
situations across the globe that have the 
potential to cause further disruption and 
we will continue to keep a close eye on 
these. This uncertainty is likely to increase 
the focus of our customers on supply chain 
resilience (see structural drivers).

How SEGRO responded
We continued to work closely with our 
construction partners to manage the 
situation during 2023. The moderation of 
construction costs (and in some markets 
we have seen reductions) whilst rents have 
continued to grow has helped to improve the 
development yields for our pipeline.

Description
The relatively short construction time for 
warehousing means that the availability of 
new, speculatively developed buildings can 
sometimes create excess supply, leading 
to increased vacancy and weaker rents. 

Occupier demand was resilient during 2023 
but take-up has returned to pre-pandemic 
averages across all of our markets. This 
combined with the completion of a relatively 
high number of development schemes has 
meant that vacancy levels increased across 
some markets from record low levels. 
They remain below longer-term averages, 
however, and the resilience of occupier 
demand meant that there continued to 
be sufficient tension between supply and 
demand for strong market rental growth. 

In addition, SEGRO's portfolio is located 
in mostly supply constrained areas where 
there is lack of land and vacancy rates in 
our chosen sub-markets have therefore 
remained lower than market averages. 

Increased build and finance costs as 
well as economic uncertainty meant 
that speculative construction starts fell 
significantly in 2023 (34 per cent in the UK 
according to Savills) so new supply should 
reduce and vacancy rates are likely to stay 
low if occupier demand remains resilient.

How SEGRO responded
We took a cautious approach to speculative 
development during 2023 and focused our 
efforts on mostly pre-let schemes. Rental 
growth was strong across our portfolio, 
particularly on the Continent where less 
new supply has been delivered.

Structural 
drivers

Changes in the way that an 
industry or market functions 
can result in longer-term or 
even permanent change. 

Description
Digital technologies are changing the 
way that we live, work and behave. Entire 
industries are adapting and new ones are 
emerging as digital adoption accelerates.

One of the most significant impacts of 
digitalisation on industrial assets is the rise 
in e-commerce, with consumers wanting 
to receive an increasing array of goods 
and services more flexibly. The pandemic 
accelerated this need, and e-commerce 
penetration rates are significantly above 
pre-pandemic trend levels. Most European 
markets are forecast to reach online sales 
penetration levels of close to or above 
20 per cent by 2027. Distribution networks 
will need to be reconfigured to facilitate 
this growth in a cost effective and 
sustainable manner. 

Increased demand for data centres 
to store and process the huge amounts 
of data generated by both individuals 
and businesses is another aspect of 
digitalisation and this has been further 
strengthened by the rise of Artificial 
Intelligence during 2023 and resulted in 
increased demand for data centre space.

How SEGRO responded
Our unique combination of big box and 
urban warehouses is ideally suited for 
businesses looking to adapt to an omni 
channel model so we continue to target 
retailers and third-party logistics operators 
for pre-lets. During 2023 we also expanded 
our data centre pipeline through the 
acquisition of a retail park in Slough and 
have identified several plots within our 
UK and Continental European land bank 
suitable for data centre development.

Supply chain efficiency and resilience

Urbanisation

Climate change and the need for efficient, 
sustainable buildings

1

Description
Manufacturers, retailers (both traditional 
and online) and distributors require efficient, 
reliable distribution networks and supply 
chains to compete effectively in meeting 
customer demands and reducing costs. 
By investing in modern, well-located 
warehouse facilities they can better 
serve their customers and gain access 
to labour pools to staff their facilities. 
These businesses frequently need larger 
buildings in central locations with space 
and power to support automation, as 
well as smaller buildings close to the 
consumer to support the ‘last-mile’ 
of the distribution journey. 

The disruption to supply chains caused by 
the pandemic and the Russian invasion of 
Ukraine has highlighted the importance of 
supply chain resilience, leading businesses 
to hold more inventory, source more locally 
and have multiple suppliers. 

Trade routes into Europe are changing with 
fewer imports from Asia via Eastern Europe 
and the increased importance of European 
ports in northern Germany, southern 
France and Italy. 

How SEGRO responded
There is increased demand for modern, 
well-located warehousing for supply 
chain efficiency and future resilience. 
Our pan-European portfolio has assets 
located on key transportation routes and 
in major logistics hubs and is well-placed to 
benefit from additional demand generated 
by the transformation of trade routes. 
We are actively targeting these 
customer types for pre-lets. 

Link to strategy:
Operational excellence, 
Disciplined capital allocation

Link to risk:
Portfolio strategy (2)

Description
The populations of most major European 
cities continue to grow, leading to increased 
housing requirements as well as increased 
demand for goods and services, and for 
warehouse space from which to supply 
them, including for ‘last-mile’ deliveries.

Description
The world is facing a climate crisis and 
governments, business and consumers 
across the world are making commitments 
and changing their behaviour to help tackle 
this massive challenge and limit global 
temperature rise to less than 1.5 degrees. 

Land previously used for industrial purposes 
in and around major towns and cities can 
also be used to construct new residential 
and other types of properties required to 
meet the demand of the larger urban 
population. As a result, land available to 
meet the need for increased warehouse 
demand is being eroded, leading to 
higher land prices and increased rents 
for well-located urban industrial properties. 

Planning can also be more challenging in 
urban areas, particularly in our Inner City 
portfolios in London and Paris, due to a 
policy bias towards residential development. 

How SEGRO responded
Two-thirds of our portfolio is in urban 
locations so we are well-positioned to 
benefit from this trend. We continue to think 
creatively to identify new opportunities and 
during 2023 started on our first underground 
logistics development in central Paris. 
Although we are currently undertaking less 
speculative development, we progressed 
several of our urban schemes through the 
planning process so that we can act quickly 
to bring these forward once approved, 
subject to market conditions. 

As a result of this there is increasing 
focus on the impact of buildings on the 
environment. Our customers also want 
to minimise their carbon footprint and 
reduce overall occupancy costs. It is 
therefore important that landlords and 
developers own and create buildings 
that are sustainable and use natural 
resources efficiently. 

Major European conurbations are also 
looking to reduce traffic emissions which 
means it will be even more important for 
businesses to be located in the properties 
that help them reach their customers 
by low-carbon means.

How SEGRO responded
We have continued to make good progress 
in our reduction of carbon emissions 
through both our development programme 
and our corporate and customer emissions. 
During 2023, 99 per cent of our development 
completions were BREEAM 'Very Good' 
or higher and we took back an increased 
amount of older space in London to 
refurbish to high levels of sustainability 
and improve operating efficiency. 
We also installed 15 MW of new solar 
capacity on our rooftops to provide our 
customers with renewable energy and 
reduce their carbon footprints.

Underpinning these stakeholder relationships 
is a culture which promotes high standards of

sustainable strategy and which recognises 
our responsibilities to the environment.

Responsible SEGRO on page 23

  See Key performance  
indicators on page 32

At the heart of our strategy lies 
Responsible SEGRO, because it is woven 
through everything that we do; from the 
asset management of our portfolio, to the 
planning and execution of our development 
programme, to the way we treat our People. 
It provides us with clear focus areas - carbon, 
communities and talent - to help us to balance 
the priorities of all of our stakeholders and also 
between short and long-term benefits. 

We take a proactive approach to risk 
management (for more information on 
how we manage risk see pages 54 to 64) to 
ensure that we are positioning our business to 
respond to potential threats. We also regularly 
carry out ESG materiality assessments to 
ensure we understand the wider priorities 
of our stakeholders, as well as to highlight 
potential opportunities. 

Following this strategy, combined with our 
day-to-day insights, governance and risk 
management processes, helps us to adapt 
to suit changing market conditions (allowing 
us to respond quickly if needed) and also to 
ensure that we are positioning the business 
for long-term success. This should translate 
into not only sustainable, attractive returns for 
all our shareholders, but also significant value 
for all other stakeholders.

Our strategy drives both our day-to-day 
decision making as well as our long-term 
strategic thinking.

We have been following this simple but 
effective strategy for over a decade and its 
four key pillars provide a clear focus as we 
work towards our ambition of being the best 
property company .

We are Disciplined in our approach 
to capital allocation. We take the local 
knowledge provided by our teams on the 
ground in all our key markets and supplement 
it with valuable data-informed insights. This 
ensures that we focus on the highest quality 
assets in the strongest markets and adapt our 
approach to capital deployment depending 
on our assessment of the property cycle. 
This should result in a portfolio that generates 
attractive returns; provides above-average 
growth (both in terms of rent and capital 
values) when market conditions are positive 
and proves to be resilient in a downturn. 

We strive for Operational excellence in 
everything that we do: our market-leading 
operating platform helps us to develop 
outstanding customer (as well as other 
stakeholder) relationships; execute on 
our development programme and other 
operational activity to the highest standards 
(including taking a zero-tolerance approach 
to health and safety); and create exceptional 
opportunities for growth, using the market 
intelligence that it provides.

Our operational activity is supported by 
an Efficient capital and corporate structure 
that provides a lean overhead structure, 
leverages technological developments 
to transform processes and applies 
appropriate financial leverage.

A postcard from Amsterdam

Our strong company culture encourages 
collaboration, care for one another and a 
desire to never stand still. In September, 
SEGRO came together in Amsterdam for 
our first Group Conference since 2018. 

The conference was hosted by our new 
Executive Committee, who led a discussion 
on what our ambition ’to be the best 
property company’ means and how, 
by challenging ourselves to search for 
excellence in every aspect of our business, 
we can drive SEGRO to enable more 
extraordinary things in the decade ahead. 
We also used the event as an opportunity to 
talk about the ways of working that support 
our Values and will help us to maintain our 
strong culture as our business grows. 

Creating opportunities such as this, 
for people from across the Group 
to come together to share ideas and 
develop their networks, is crucial to 
the success of our business and the 
talent that makes it special.

Responsible SEGRO

We are 
committed to 
being a force 
for societal and 
environmental 
good.

Responsible SEGRO demonstrates how our 
environmental and social contributions are 
embedded within our business strategy, 
and are fundamental to how we enable 
extraordinary things to happen.

Our commitment to being a force for societal 
and environmental good has been at the heart 
of how our business operates since it was 
founded. It has been instrumental in the 
success of the Company over the past 
103 years and will be just as important for 
the next 100 years. This commitment is led 
by our Board but lived by SEGRO colleagues 
every day. It is about doing the right thing and 
making a positive impact wherever we operate.

We have long-held commitments to 
leadership in health and safety, stakeholder 
engagement, corporate governance and 
being a good corporate citizen.

Our Responsible SEGRO framework helps 
us to articulate our sustainability goals 
and address our stakeholders’ most 
material concerns. Within this we have 
focused in on three enduring strategic 
priorities, which were determined 
through engagement with our stakeholders. 
These priorities cover the areas where we 
believe we can make the greatest business, 
environmental and social contribution. 

 Scan the QR code to hear our Group  
Customer & Operations Director talk about  
the importance of Responsible SEGRO 
www.segro.com/ara23/responsible-segro

They are:

Alignment with the UN SDGs

Championing low-carbon growth
Investing in our local communities and 
environments
Nurturing talent

For each of these areas we have established 
challenging targets that are linked to six 
non-financial KPIs and to the annual bonus 
for all employees. 

We report a summary of our progress with 
these during 2023 in the following section and 
discuss our priorities for 2024 – more detailed 
information (along with full datasets) can be 
found in our 2023 Responsible SEGRO Report.

We intend to set additional, more specific, 
supporting targets as necessary and expect 
our actions and approach to evolve over time 
to reflect our achievement, technological 
change and the priorities of our stakeholders 
and wider society.

  Read about our ESG commitments 
in our Responsible SEGRO Report:  
www.segro.com/responsible-segro/ 
reports-downloads

We have reviewed the United Nations 
Sustainable Development Goals against 
our Responsible SEGRO strategic priorities 
to understand which goals are particularly 
significant to our business. Elements of our 
business are aligned with all of the goals but 
we believe we are able to make the greatest 
contribution to six of them:

Championing low-carbon growth 

We are committed to reducing the 
embodied carbon in our development 
programme as well as reducing the 
carbon-intensity of our properties. We 
want to play our part in tackling climate 
change and have ambitious net-zero goals.

Investing in our local communities 
and environments

We have a strong track-record of supporting 
local communities and employment 
(including training) is one of the areas that 
our Community Investment Plans (CIPs) 
focus on. We want to play our part in 
reducing inequalities and ensuring more 
people have the right skills to access 
meaningful work.

Nurturing talent 

We want our people to have rewarding and 
fulfilling careers and are committed to fair 
pay throughout our operations and also 
our supply chain, and to ensuring that our 
spaces provide safe working environments 
and promote health and wellbeing for all.

Responsible SEGRO materiality assessment

Our material issues

 Priority Material Issues
 Material Issues

We regularly review our materiality 
assessment to ensure that our strategic 
priorities and the targets within them are 
appropriate and reflect our stakeholders’ 
expectations. Our last review was in 
2022 and followed guidelines by the 
Global Reporting Initiative (GRI) and the 
Sustainability Accounting Standards Board 
(SASB), now part of the IFRS Foundation. 

The 2022 process included a review of 
benchmarks and standards, peer reporting 
and aligned with internal risk management 
processes. The aim was to identify those 
issues (both risks and opportunities) that 
are most important to the Company and its 
primary stakeholders, to ensure that they are 
considered within our Responsible SEGRO 
strategic priorities, and to inform the structure 
of our sustainability reporting. Emerging 
issues were also identified and considered.

This process identified 18 material 
issues, considered through four lenses 
– environmental, societal, economic and 
governance – but with recognition that 
the issues may well be inter-dependent. 
We refined these to eight priority material 
issues (PMIs) to focus on the areas which 
are both important to our stakeholders and 
where we intend to focus our immediate 
efforts. We recognise this represents their 
relative importance at a point in time and 
is based on the views of a small number 
of informed participants. 

Each issue identified has been allocated 
to the relevant team within SEGRO for further 
attention has been embedded into business 
processes. All financially material PMIs are 
governed by the SEGRO business risk process 
(see page 54). These issues are remain aligned 
with our current Responsible SEGRO priorities. 

During 2024 we intend to refresh this work 
and will consider the concept of double 
materiality, i.e. looking at the impact SEGRO's 
activities have externally, as well as the 
financial impact of sustainability and 
climate issues on SEGRO. 

Championing low-carbon growth

Driving a pathway to net-zero through effective energy management (including embodied 
carbon), and by enabling a transition to renewable energy for SEGRO and our customers.

Ensuring environmental compliance, today and in anticipation of future regulatory 
changes, and ongoing certification against relevant standards.

Understanding the need and opportunity for climate adaptation, and building resilience 
to climate change, for SEGRO and our customers.

Identifying and executing business and diversification strategies in the renewables 
sector, that build on our unique positioning and strengths.

Understanding our biodiversity impacts and supporting urban greening.

Responsible water management.

Nurturing talent

Attracting, developing and nurturing talent for rewarding careers.

Ensuring the safety and health of our employees, our suppliers and those who 
use our facilities.

Promoting diversity, equity and inclusion, including and beyond succession planning 
and compliance. 

Investing in our local communities and environments

Implementing smart technology that makes lives better, and protects the environment.

Leading in the development and implementation of ethical building standards.

Engaging with and investing in local communities for mutual positive impact.

Operating in the context of sound governance (see pages 76-133)

Ensuring sound and ethical business conduct, including through the effective 
management of our supply chain, and in our customer base (to the extent that 
this is possible).
Ensuring ongoing and increasing ESG disclosure and transparency.

Protecting and upholding human rights (including Modern Slavery) within SEGRO 
and amongst customers and suppliers.
Protecting and preserving our reputation, by doing the right thing and anticipating 
stakeholder concerns.
Promoting and preserving a positive and caring culture, which is mindful of economic 
equality and hardship.
Being mindful of cyber security and the ethical use of information and data.

Responsible SEGRO continued

Championing low-carbon growth

SEGRO’s pathway to net-zero

SEGRO’s carbon emission reduction targets 
focus on the most material aspects for the 
company, namely our corporate and customer 
emissions and embodied carbon from our 
development programme, representing 
over 85 per cent of SEGRO’s value chain 
emissions.

We have made significant progress in 
transitioning to low or zero-carbon energy 
sources and materials in recent years and 
we are committed to continuing this progress 
and accelerating it wherever possible. 

Our carbon reduction targets were set 
and approved under the international 
Science-Based Targets Initiative (SBTi). 
The SBTi methodology identified a pathway 
for companies to reduce the emissions 
within their value chains to align with 
reaching net-zero in eligible 1.50C 
pathways by 2050 or sooner. 

SEGRO’s carbon reduction targets are 
based primarily on an absolute reduction 
in emissions and comprise the following 
key actions: 
 – Purchase certified renewable electricity for 
SEGRO’s own (Scope 2) use and for those 
customers for whom we procure energy 
on their behalf (Scope 3).

 – Most of our customers are responsible for 

procuring their own energy. In these cases, 
we encourage them to agree to our green 
leases and procure certified renewable 
electricity where possible and confirm 
this to us. 

 – Remove gas-powered heating in units 

which become vacant or through 
negotiation with customers occupying 
premises heated with gas.

 – Install solar panels to generate clean energy 
for our customers to use and, where the 
grid connectivity allows, install additional 
capacity to sell to the grid.

 – Improve the energy efficiency of our units 
through construction and refurbishment 
by targeting at least BREEAM 'Excellent' 
certification and an Energy Performance 
Certificate of B-grade or better.

 – Reduce embodied carbon emissions in our 
developments by working with our partners 
to procure and utilise low-carbon materials 
and designs.

 – Offset residual emissions as a last resort, 
and as far as possible, identify offsetting 
schemes within our operating geographies 
with clearly measurable, long-term impacts. 

The results since 2020 (our baseline year) are 
encouraging. We have reduced our corporate 
and customer emissions by 19 per cent and 
the average embodied carbon intensity of 
our development programme has fallen by 
13 per cent, meaning that we are tracking 
ahead of our near- to mid-term SBTi Standard 
Net Zero trajectory on both of these key 
metrics (see charts to the right). In addition, 
our installed solar capacity has more than 
doubled over the same timeframe. 

Since 2021, the science-based target 
framework landscape has evolved and, 
during 2023, the SBTi developed a new 
Standard, specifically designed for the 
Real Estate industry, At the time of writing 
this SBTi Building Standard is in its pilot 
phase, with further guidance under 
preparation. We will evaluate the new 
Standard once this has been published, 
which is expected during 2024, and consider 
any changes to our targets or approach as 
part of this work. We intend to publish any 
new targets in our 2024 Annual Report 
and Accounts.

In addition to delivering absolute reductions, 
we have also invested in an emissions 
forecasting and modelling tool, which is 
expected to support the creation of new 
net- zero commitments and target dates 
at a local market as well as a corporate level. 

Until then, we continue to pursue a 
collaborative approach to working with 
stakeholders throughout our value chain 
to reduce our carbon footprint as swiftly 
as we can.

Putting the green in Greenford 

Enabling extraordinary things to happen is 
not limited to the new space that we create. 
Whilst most of our portfolio consists of 
modern and sustainable space, we have 
opportunities in supply-constrained cities 
such as London and Paris to redevelop and 
refurbish some older assets and create 
significant value.

During 2023 we completed the refurbishment 
of a unit in SEGRO Park Greenford, one of our 
West London estates, however this was no 
ordinary refurbishment. Having spotted the 
increased importance that our customers are 
placing on the sustainability of the space they 
use, we decided to use this opportunity to 
raise the bar in terms of what can be achieved 
from a refurbishment. 

We moved the EPC rating from a C to A+ and 
were awarded BREEAM ‘Outstanding’ 
certification, achieving the highest score ever 
lodged by the Building Research 
Establishment for a refurbished industrial unit. 

This newly modernised, sustainable space 
will now become home to a new business 
and will deliver a significant reduction in 
carbon footprint for both our customer 
and SEGRO.

The world is facing a climate crisis and as an 
owner, manager and developer of buildings, 
we have a significant part to play in tackling 
the challenge of limiting global temperature 
rise to 1.5°C. It is also an area of increasing 
focus with our customers who wish to 
minimise their own carbon footprints.

Our approach to carbon management 
is dictated by our own carbon footprint: 
we focus on the emissions that are most 
material to us. More than three-quarters of 
our emissions come from our customers and 
our development programme so it is in these 
areas we have focused our efforts and set 
ambitious science-based targets.

Corporate and customer emissions: almost 
all of these emissions are generated by the 
activity of the customers using our buildings 
(our corporate emissions account for less than 
two per cent) and we are aiming to reduce this 
by 42 per cent (from a 2020 baseline). We are 
driving reductions in these emissions through:
 – delivering energy efficient buildings (new 

build and via refurbishment);

 – photovoltaic and renewable energy rollout;
 – replacing gas use with efficient electrical 

heating systems; 

 – procuring zero-carbon electricity;
 – encouraging our customers to also change 

their electricity tariffs. 

Our increasing visibility of customer energy 
use is strengthening and targeting our efforts. 

Embodied carbon emissions: 31 per cent 
of our emissions were generated by our 
development programme in 2023 and 
we are aiming to reduce the embodied 
carbon intensity of it by 20 per cent by 2030. 
Our Mandatory Sustainability Policy commits 
us to carry out embodied carbon calculations 
for projects over 5,000 sq m. We will continue 
to adopt the latest techniques to reduce 
embodied carbon within our developments, 
including the use of low-carbon materials 
and considering the use of alternative, 
lower-carbon layouts and building 
techniques. We target BREEAM 'Excellent' 
certification (or local equivalent) or higher 
for all new developments.

Beyond our approach to carbon we also think 
carefully about the impact of our operations 
on other natural resources and the local 
environment. Biodiversity remains a key focus 
and our development projects aim to have 
a positive impact on our local communities. 
Although our use of water is not material, 
we are careful in our use of it and design in 
features that help our customers use it more 
efficiently. Finally, the vast majority of our 
waste is created by our construction and 
demolition projects, we work carefully with 
our construction partners to minimise this, 
for example through recycling as much 
as possible.

Enabling extraordinary things to happen 
also applies to the spaces and communities 
around our assets. This is a core part of our 
strategy and something we are incredibly 
passionate about. 

We do this by creating Community Investment 
Plans (CIPs) to provide the framework to invest 
in projects that help improve the lives of local 
people. Our teams in each market tailor their 
plans to suit the needs of their own local 
community, partnering with organisations 
that have knowledge and insight of the most 
pressing challenges our local communities 
face, as well as the expertise to ensure we 
deliver an impactful and outcome-driven 
programme. Our Community Investment 
Plans focus on the following areas:

Education & employment: working with local 
education establishments to help prepare 
young people for the world of work, as well 
as helping people from disadvantaged or 
marginalised backgrounds into employment 
or better jobs.

Environment: delivering environmental 
projects that improve the biodiversity of 
the local area and the health and wellbeing 
of the local community. 

Economy: enabling our local economies 
to thrive by connecting local businesses with 
our suppliers, customers and other partners 
to deliver projects that help to enhance 
productivity and innovation. 

Volunteering is vital to the success of our 
CIPs and there is no limit to the number 
of days employees can donate. In 2023 
436 employees (95 per cent of our workforce) 
supported our projects, including as part of 
our annual Day of Giving. We have also had 
a tremendous response from our customers 
and suppliers, 143 of whom supported our 
community work during the year, helping to 
maximise the reach of these programmes. 

Alongside our CIPs, our buildings also play 
an important role in supporting our local 
communities. Our estates provide valuable 
space for charity partners such as City 
Harvest, Slough Foodbank and the Felix 
Project to re-distribute food that would 
otherwise be wasted. 

Key achievements during 2023:
 – Launch of a new CIP in Amsterdam.
 – Record levels of volunteering from SEGRO 
employees and many of our customers 
and suppliers also donated their time 
to support our projects. 

 – Tremendous outcomes from our 

education programme, during 2023 
we engaged with 8,032 students.
 – Launch of national employment 

programme with LandAid, inspired by our 
pilot in 2023. 1,303 unemployed people 
benefited from training support, and 
347 are now in employment as a result.
 – 44 projects were delivered to enhance 

the environment, biodiversity or the health 
and wellbeing of our local communities. 
 – Launched our first jointly funded project 

with Heathrow Airport. 

Our priorities for 2024:
 – Expand UK CIP into other areas of 

London, Hertfordshire, Derbyshire and 
also expand our French and German 
CIPs into new regions. 

 – Launch new CIPs in Italy and Spain.
 – Continue to drive the involvement of 
our customers, suppliers and other 
stakeholders to maximise the positive 
outcomes for our local communities.

 – Implement a social value measure.
 – Embed social value into SEGRO's 

tendering process.

Spreading the joy in Paris 

Enabling extraordinary things to happen 
applies to the spaces and communities 
around our estates as much as it does to 
the assets themselves. Our Community 
Investment Plans (CIPs) create frameworks 
that fund projects that aim to improve the 
lives and prospects for thousands of people 
living in our local communities. 

One of the projects that our Paris CIP 
supports is Café Joyeux, France’s leading 
café for the inclusion of people with 
intellectual disability through training and 
recruitment. We have been an ambassador 
since 2021 and have provided the financial 
support to train and recruit seven Café 
Joyeux team members so far. We buy all 
our coffee from there and offer Café Joyeux 
“Welcome Packs” to all our new customers 
in France, helping to spread the word of their 

fantastic work. During 2023, eight colleagues 
from our French team volunteered to work 
in their cafés as part of our Annual Day 
of Giving programme.

Café Joyeux is a fantastic example of how, 
by bringing together our local communities, 
customers and other business partners 
we can maximise the reach of these 
programmes and make a meaningful 
impact on people’s lives.

The 460 individuals that we employ across eight 
countries are vital to the success of SEGRO, and 
we are committed to attracting and retaining a 
diverse range of talented individuals in our 
business. Creating the space for extraordinary 
things to happen applies as much to the careers 
and work lives of our people as it does to our 
assets. Our priorities include:

Celebrating our strong culture: our 
employees tell us that they enjoy working at 
SEGRO and value their working environment, 
which encourages collaboration and care for 
one another. We have a clear Purpose and 
Values and have developed Behaviours that 
will help us to maintain this culture as our 
business grows. 

Building fulfilling and rewarding careers: 
we want our people to thrive in their roles 
and offer extensive training and development 
opportunities as well as secondments.

Building a diverse workforce: we are 
committed to building an inclusive workplace 
where everyone is treated with fairness 
and respect. We have set ourselves targets 
to increase the representation of women 
and those identifying as being from an 
ethnic minority group within our leadership 
population and also our leadership pipeline. 
We are also committed to attracting people 
from non-property backgrounds into our sector. 
We have appropriate support, training and 
facilities for employees who are disabled or 
become disabled whilst in our employment.

Following the highest standards of business 
conduct: our Code of Business Conduct and 
Ethics sets out the high standards expected 
of all our people in their daily work. 

Health & Safety and Wellbeing: we want our 
people to work in a healthy, safe and secure 
environment so have a comprehensive health 
and safety training programme and initiatives 
to support employee Wellbeing.

Rewarding careers: to help us retain the 
best people we offer generous compensation 
packages that include variable compensation, 
share award and savings schemes and health 
insurance.

Key achievements during 2023:
 – Invested in building capability for the future 
through: the reshaping of our leadership 
team; investing in new capabilities to help 
drive our strategic priorities; and the 
extension of our Management Academy 
to all people leaders.

 – Engaged employees on our ambition 

to be the best property company at our 
Leadership Forum and Group Conference.

 – Launched our internal Behaviours, which 
bring to life our established Values for 
leaders and colleagues. 

 – Established clear diversity goals, with 

a supporting action plan.

UK Gender and Ethnicity Pay Gap progression
During 2023 our Pay Gaps improved but our 
Bonus Gaps increased. This was due to the 
variable element of LTIPs and share-based 
payments influencing the gap in favour of 
male colleagues, whom we have more of 
in senior roles. Our reported Pay Gaps are 
a direct result of our employee profile 
and do not represent pay discrimination. 
As part of our salary reviews we undertake 
checks to ensure employees are paid equally 
for doing equivalent jobs across our business. 
Key to closing the Gender Pay Gap is 
increasing the number of women in 
senior roles in the coming years.

towards a more diverse leadership team.

 – Enhance our employee experience 

with a focus on more flexible policies 
and supporting our colleagues 
career ambitions.

 – Embed our Behaviours, supporting 
our colleagues and leaders to live 
them every day. 

 – Further investment in the development 
of our leadership teams and colleagues. 

Our Values

 – Say it like it is 

We always give honest feedback, keep 
our promises and keep messaging clear 
and simple.

 – Stand side by side 

We work together and put the interests 
of our business ahead of our own. We go 
out of our way to support each other and 
share knowledge across the business. 

 – If the door is closed... 

If one route is closed to us, we always 
find another way. We challenge ourselves 
to think differently and search for new 
ways to succeed.

 – Keep one eye on the horizon 

We constantly look ahead to ensure 
we are successful in the future. we do 
this in part by taking an active interest 
in our customers and their customers. 

 – Does it make the boat go faster? 

We keep things simple and continue to 
look for improvements to how we work.

Key performance indicators

We measure our success by tracking Key 
Performance Indicators (KPIs) that reflect our 
strategic, operational and financial progress 
and performance. They drive the internal 
management of the business, and some 
are used to determine how management 
and employees are remunerated.

Financial
All our financial KPIs are based on 
proportionally consolidated metrics 
incorporating our share of joint ventures 
and associates.

Total shareholder return (TSR)  (%)

Description 
TSR measures the change in our share price 
over the year, assuming that dividends paid 
are reinvested. This reflects our commitment 
to delivering enhanced returns for our 
shareholders through executing our strategy 
over the medium term. TSR is a key metric 
used in setting the long-term incentive plan 
remuneration for both the Executive 
Directors and senior managers.

Our performance 
TSR was 20.3 per cent, compared with 12.9 
per cent for the FTSE 350 Real Estate index. 
This reflects a combination of the 26.9 pence 
dividend (18.2 pence 2022 final dividend and 
8.7 pence 2023 interim dividend) paid during 
the year, and an increase in the share price 
from 763.6 pence at 31 December 2022 to

a percentage of Adjusted NAV per share at 
31 December 2022. It measures the return on 
capital and is a key metric used in setting the 
long-term incentive plan remuneration for 
both the Executive Directors and senior 
managers.

Our performance 
The TAR for the Group was -3.3 per cent 
(2022: -12.8 per cent). This performance 
reflects a combination of the 59 pence 
decrease in Adjusted NAV from 966 pence 
at December 2022 to 907 pence at 
31 December 2023 and the 26.9 pence 
dividend (18.2 pence 2022 final dividend 
and 8.7 pence 2023 interim dividend) paid 
during the year.

1. The TPR has been calculated independently 
by MSCI Real Estate in order to provide a 
consistent comparison with an appropriate 
MSCI benchmark. It is calculated as the 
change in capital value, less any capital 
expenditure incurred, plus net income, 
expressed as a percentage of capital 
employed over the period concerned for 
standing investments held throughout the 
year, excluding land.

Description 
Our Adjusted EPS reflects earnings from 
our operating business: rental income less 
operating, administrative and financing 
costs and tax. It is the primary determinant 
of the level of the annual dividend. IFRS EPS 
includes the impact of realised and unrealised 
changes in the valuation of our assets, which 
can often mask the underlying operating 
performance. The reconciliation between 
Basic EPS and Adjusted EPS can be found 
in Note 12(i) on page 161.

Our performance 
Adjusted EPS increased by 5.5 per cent to 
32.7 pence during the year, reflecting higher 
rental income from our standing assets 
and new income from acquisitions and 
developments, partially offset by higher 
financing costs.

Link to strategy: All strategic pillars

Our performance 
In total, we generated £65 million of 
net new annualised rent during the year 
(2022: £77 million). The decrease was driven 
by a lower number of pre-lets signed during 
the year (£27 million versus £41 million in 
2022) as occupier demand normalised 
closer to pre-pandemic levels.

Linked to remuneration  Yes

Link to strategy: Operational excellence

Our performance 
Our LTV ratio increased to 34 per cent during 
2023. This was due to a combination of the 
£809 million unrealised fall in the value of our 
portfolio and £575 million of net investment 
in our business. We recognise that this is 
above recent levels, but given where we 
are in the cycle we are comfortable with 
this level. We retain significant headroom 
to covenants as well as liquidity to fund 
both visible investment and potential 
opportunities that may arise.

Key performance indicators continued

Non-financial
Our non-financial KPIs help to measure 
the shared value our business creates to 
ensure that our business is positioned for 
long-term success.

Our non-financial KPIs link to our Responsible 
SEGRO strategic priorities. 

Given where we are in our journey towards 
these goals we anticipate that our non-
financial KPIs will evolve as we progress 
towards our stated ambitions.

What it is 
The percentage of our customers who rate 
their experience as occupiers of our buildings 
as ‘good’ or ‘excellent’ as opposed to ‘poor’ or 
‘average’. Our customers are at the heart of 
our business and we strive to ensure that we 
are providing the best level of service possible 
to maximise customer retention.

What it is 
We carry out an employee survey annually 
asking all our people to comment on various 
aspects of their work at SEGRO. We share the 
results of this with the Board, Leadership 
team and all our people.

Our performance 
Satisfaction as an occupier of our buildings 
was rated as ‘good’ or ‘excellent’ by 86 per 
cent of the 347 customers who participated 
in 2023 (2022: 85 per cent). The continued 
high satisfaction rate reflects our focus on 
communication, being responsive and 
understanding the needs of our customers 
and is particularly pleasing given the cost 
pressures that some of them are under 
(including rental increases). 96 per cent 
of our customers said that they would 
recommend SEGRO to others.

What it is 
The largest source of carbon emissions 
within our control is the embodied carbon 
in our newly developed buildings. Within our 
science-based targets, we are committed 
to reducing the average carbon intensity 
of all new developments by 20 per cent 
by 2030 (compared to a 2020 baseline of 
400 kgCO2e/m2). We calculate this metric 
based on completed developments over 
the past two years for which a life cycle 
assessment has been completed.

Our performance 
The average embodied carbon intensity 
in our development programme was 
348 kgCO2e/m (2022: 353 kgCO2e/m) 
reflecting a 13 per cent improvement 
from the 2020 baseline. We reduced this 
by trialling low carbon or recycled materials, 
including concrete, steel and timber across 
multiple projects.

Description 
Our corporate and customer carbon 
emissions cover our own operations under 
Scope 1 and 2 and our customer emissions 
under Scope 3. We have visibility of 81 per 
cent of the energy use from our buildings by 
floorspace. For buildings where we do not 
receive data we have estimated energy use. 
Our science-based targets commit us to 
reducing the absolute corporate and 
customer carbon emissions of our portfolio 
by 42 per cent by 2030 (compared to a 
2020 baseline of 312,115 tCO2e), in line with 
a 1.5 degree scenario.

Description 
Under standard market lease terms we do 
not have automatic visibility of customer 
energy usage data. We recognise the 
importance of having good visibility of this 
data so we can accurately assess our Scope 
3 emissions and help our customers to 
reduce their own carbon footprint as well as 
improving their energy efficiency. We are 
therefore proactively engaging with our 
customers, requesting access to this data 
and have introduced green clauses requiring 
energy use visibility to all new leases.

Description 
Now that we have launched 12 Community 
Investment Plans (CIPs) across many of 
our key markets we have turned our focus 
towards the implementation of them. 
We are therefore measuring the number 
of employees who volunteered in projects 
(including on our annual Day of Giving). 

Our performance 
During 2023, we reduced the corporate 
and customer emissions of our portfolio 
to 254,168 tCO2e (2022: 272,318 tCO2e), 
reflecting a 19 per cent improvement from 
the baseline. This reduction was largely 
due to us having an increased amount of 
customer energy data (both their usage 
and also the type of energy sourced, 
i.e. renewable).

1 Percentage valuation movement during the period 
based on the difference between opening and 
closing valuations for all properties including 
buildings under construction and land, adjusting 
for capital expenditure, acquisitions and disposals. 
The valuation movement cannot be directly derived 
from the Financial Statements and is calculated to 
be comparable with published MSCI Real Estate 
indices against which SEGRO is measured. 
Table 3 on page 187 provides a reconciliation 
to the Financial Statements.

Warehouse property values saw modest 
declines during 2023, as higher interest rates 
and uncertainty over the future trajectory for 
interest rates continued to impact investors’ 
appetite for real estate assets. Investment 
market volumes remained low and yields 
expanded further, although at a much 
slower pace than during 2022. 

Occupier markets continued to perform well 
and although macroeconomic uncertainty 
contributed to take-up returning closer to 
pre-pandemic levels, the availability of 
well-located, modern and sustainable space 
remains limited across our markets. This helped 
us to grow the rental income on our portfolio, 
by increasing the rents on our existing space 
and through our development programme, 
both of which contributed to income and 
earnings growth. 

Modest decline in portfolio value due 
to further interest-rate driven yield 
expansion, partly offset by strong 
estimated rental value growth 
The Group’s property portfolio was valued at 
£17.8 billion at 31 December 2023 (£20.7 billion 
of assets under management). The portfolio 
valuation, including completed assets, land 
and buildings under construction, decreased 
by 4.0 per cent (after adjusting for capital 
expenditure and asset recycling) during the 
year, compared to a decline of 11.0 per cent 
in 2022. The majority of the fall came in the 
second half of the year and reflected the 
tighter financial conditions in capital markets, 
particularly in September and October. 
The significant fall in bond yields and future 
interest rate expectations at the end of 
2023 did not come in time for an increase in 
investment activity last year, but it appears to 
have improved sentiment in the investment 
market in the early stages of 2024, which we 
expect will lead to increased activity during 
the year ahead.

The reduction in the valuation of our 
portfolio primarily comprises a 4.5 per cent 
decline in assets held throughout the year 
(2022: 13.1 per cent decline), driven by yield 
expansion in most markets, which was partly 
offset by a 6.0 per cent increase in our valuer’s 
estimate of the market rental value of our 
portfolio (2022: 10.9 per cent increase) as well 
as development profits and the benefit of our 
asset management initiatives. 

Assets held throughout the year in the 
UK decreased in value by 3.3 per cent 
(2022: 15.5 per cent decrease), underperforming 
the MSCI Real Estate All Industrial Quarterly 
Index which decreased by 0.3 per cent over 
the same period. 

The underperformance was due to our 
weighting towards lower yielding prime 
assets, that were more sensitive to yield 
movements in response to higher interest 
rates. The net true equivalent yield applied 
to our UK portfolio was 5.2 per cent, 40 basis 
points higher than at 31 December 2022 
(4.8 per cent). Rental values improved by 
4.9 per cent (2022: 11.5 per cent). 

Assets held throughout the year in 
Continental Europe decreased in value by 
6.4 per cent (2022: 8.8 per cent decrease) 
on a constant currency basis, reflecting a 
combination of 60 basis points of yield 
expansion to 5.4 per cent (31 December 2022: 
4.8 per cent) and rental value growth of 7.9 
per cent (2022: 9.9 per cent).

What to expect from our portfolio in 2024
Forecasting yields over any future period is 
notoriously difficult given the multitude of 
economic and financial drivers (particularly 
interest rates and credit spreads), most of 
which are outside of our direct control.

However, if market expectations that central 
bank rates have peaked are sustained, this 
should provide a supportive backdrop for 
a recovery of investment market sentiment 
during 2024.

The fundamentals for our sector remain 
strong, with occupier demand supported 
by structural drivers and limited supply, 
which leaves us optimistic about the 
prospects for further rental value growth. 
This should result in investment markets in 
the industrial and logistics sector recovering 
more quickly than wider real estate assets. 
In addition, we expect investors to remain 
selective about where and in what they invest 
which, along with our active approach to asset 
management, should lead to our high-quality, 
modern and sustainable portfolio 
outperforming the wider industrial and 
logistics market on a long-run basis.

In terms of rent roll, we expect this to increase 
through the letting up of space currently 
under refurbishment, the further capture 
of reversion on the existing portfolio and 
by signing further pre-lets in response to 
occupier demand. We have the potential 
to more than double our rent roll over the 
coming years through our active asset 
management of the existing portfolio and 
the build out of our high-quality land bank.

Strong rent roll growth, with a large 
contribution from the capture of 
reversion on the standing portfolio 
as well as development 
During 2023, we contracted £88 million 
(2022: £98 million) of new headline rent, 
consistent with our expectations after the 
elevated levels seen during the pandemic 
and its immediate aftermath.

We added £30 million of net new rent from 
our existing portfolio (2022: £31 million). 
This comprised £16 million on new lettings 
(2022: £21 million) and £35 million from the 
capture of reversion (the difference between 
in-place and market rents) on rent reviews and 
renewals, and from inflation-related uplifts in 
index-linked leases (2022: £28 million), offset 
by rent lost from space returned of £21 million 
(2022: £18 million), much of it for refurbishment.

Occupier demand for new space enabled us 
to sign further pre-let agreements for delivery 
over the next two years. We contracted 
£27 million of headline rent from pre-let 
agreements and lettings of speculative 
developments prior to completion 
(2022: £41 million). The pre-lets signed 
during 2023 included an additional data 
centre on the Slough Trading Estate and 
big box warehouses across the UK and 
Continental Europe for third-party logistics 
operators, manufacturers and retailers 
(both traditional and online).

As a result of this activity, rent roll growth which 
reflects net new headline rent from existing 
space (adjusted for takebacks of space for 
development), take-up of developments 
and pre-lets agreed during the period, 
was £65 million (2022: £77 million).

At 31 December 2023, our portfolio generated 
passing rent of £639 million, rising to 
£697 million once rent free periods expire 
(‘headline rent’).

Progress through partnership in East London

Our market-leading operating platform, 
with local networks across Europe, is crucial 
to the development of strong relationships 
with local authorities and stakeholder groups. 

One such relationship is the East Plus 
partnership, which was established in 
London in 2016 and last year celebrated 
its halfway point. This partnership aims to 
revitalise 86 acres of industrial land across 
the London boroughs of Newham, Havering, 
and Barking and Dagenham and is a 
collaboration between SEGRO and GLA 
Land and Property (GLAP). 

Since the partnership’s inception, 
investment of over £120 million has 
delivered almost 60,000 sq m of 
sustainable industrial space for 50 
businesses, ranging from SMEs to major 
corporates. Beyond physical site delivery, 
East Plus has broader regeneration goals 
including upskilling the workforce, inspiring 
younger generations, and supporting 
community projects. Our community 
investment programme has helped over 
4,700 residents to develop the skills and 
confidence to reach their full potential, 
assisted 157 unemployed people into work, 
and supported 29 charities.

Collaboration, adaptability, experience, 
and a passion for delivering excellence 
in everything, forms the basis for the 
partnership and its extraordinary 
progress and success to date.

Update:  
Investment

What we said we would do
We said that we would continue to take a 
disciplined approach to capital allocation, 
focusing the majority of our investment 
on our development pipeline (through 
development capex, land acquisitions and 
acquiring assets with future redevelopment 
potential) and making strategic asset 
acquisitions if and when the 
opportunity arose.

of investment for growth

Acquisitions of assets

£0m 

2022: £155m

What we achieved in 2023
All of the investment into our portfolio during 
2023 was into our development pipeline, a 
combination of development capex to build 
out our land bank and land acquisitions to 
fuel future growth. We made no asset 
acquisitions during the year but took 
advantage of increased appetite for prime 
assets in the second half to dispose of a 
number of assets ahead of book value. 

What to expect in 2024
We will continue to take the same disciplined 
approach during 2024, putting most of our 
focus on building out our attractive land 
bank will continue to consider unique asset 
or land acquisition opportunities that may 
arise in these subdued investment market 
conditions. We expect to dispose of 
between one and two per cent of the 
portfolio as per our normal levels of capital 
recycling but adapting the overall volume of 
disposals to market conditions. We have a 
number of transactions under discussion 
and expect to make further progress with 
these during 2024.

Taking a disciplined approach to capital 
allocation is key to delivering long-term 
outperformance. We use our in-depth 
knowledge of our markets and our customer 
base to position our portfolio accordingly. 
We also adapt our approach to capital 
deployment depending on our assessment of 
the property cycle and other external factors. 
During 2023 this has resulted in us prioritising 
capital deployment into the most profitable 
development opportunities on land that we 
already own, and increasingly funding this 
through disposals rather than taking on 
additional debt.

Net investment during the year was 
£575 million comprising: development capital 
expenditure of £527 million and £404 million 
of land acquisitions, partly offset by 
£356 million of disposals during the period.

It will be supported by a strategic rail freight 
interchange, allowing customers to reduce 
the number of trucks used in their operations, 
as well as a substantial 610 acre country park 
for use by the local community.

In Continental Europe we purchased an 
excellent plot of land outside Dortmund which 
will deliver over 200,000 sq m of big box and 
urban warehouse space in one of Germany's 
most attractive logistics markets. We also 
purchased small plots of land in Italy, France, 
Spain and Poland. 

Amid volatile capital markets and higher 
financing costs, we increased the pace of 
disposals to fund our development activity, 
generating £356 million of proceeds from 
asset and land sales, crystallising a profit 
of £39 million compared to book value.

These included:

 – Asset sales totalling £242 million, mainly 

of assets that did not meet our hurdle rates 
in our annual asset review process, as well 
as some non-core office assets. In total, 
£8 million of rental income (annualised) 
was lost as a result of these disposals. 

 – Land plots totalling £114 million, the majority 
of which came from the sale of land that the 
buyer intends to develop themselves for 
owner-occupation, offering us attractive 
risk-adjusted returns. 

Capital deployment focused on the most 
profitable development opportunities, 
increasingly funded by disposals
During the year we invested £931 million 
into our development pipeline, which 
comprised £527 million (2022: £787 million) 
in development spend, of which £92 million 
was for infrastructure and £404 million on 
new land acquisitions. The land acquisitions 
focused on rare and unique sites providing 
opportunities for future development. 

In the UK, this included the acquisition of Bath 
Road Shopping Park in Slough, which creates 
significant further potential for data centre 
development due to its position adjacent 
to the Slough Trading Estate. We also 
acquired the former Radlett Aerodrome 
in Hertfordshire, a brownfield site on the 
edge of London and close to the M25, 
which provides us with the opportunity 
to develop an exceptionally rare site of 
scale that will deliver over 330,000 sq m 
of logistics buildings.

Update:  
Development

What we said we would do
We expected to continue to develop out our 
land bank during 2023 and anticipated 
investing in excess of £600 million in 
development capex, including £100 million 
of infrastructure expenditure. 

What we achieved in 2023
2023 was another strong year of 
development completions. We completed 
625,700 sq m of space, capable of delivering 
£50 million of new headline rent. 

We spent £527 million on development 
capex, including £92 million on 
infrastructure. This was a little lower than our 
expectations and the residual capex is 
expected to be incurred in 2024. 

What to expect in 2024
We expect to invest approximately 
£600 million in development capex 
during 2024, including £150 million of 
infrastructure related to our UK big box 
logistics parks. The yield on cost for our 
development programme is expected to be 
between 7 and 8 per cent.

Disciplined capital allocation and Operational 
excellence are both key to the success of our 
development programme. They ensure that 
we deploy capital into the most profitable 
opportunities and into markets with the 
greatest long-term return potential, execute 
on our pipeline efficiently and safely, and build 
to the highest construction and sustainability 
standards.

Development completions delivered 
£50 million of potential headline rent
Development completions added 
625,700 sq m of new space to the portfolio 
during 2023, generating £43 million of 
headline rent, with a potential further 
£7 million to come when the remainder of the 
space is let. The yield on total development 
cost (including land, construction and finance 
costs) is expected to be 7.0 per cent when 
fully let (excluding developments completed 
by third parties on a forward funded basis 
acquired at investment value). 

We completed 478,800 sq m of big box 
warehouse space, including one of our last 
remaining plots at SEGRO Logistics Park East 
Midlands Gateway and across all of our major 
European markets, let to third-party logistics 
operators, retailers and manufacturers.

We completed 146,900 sq m of urban 
warehouses, including three data centres in 
Slough and industrial units in South London, 
Berlin, Cologne and Paris. The majority of 
these were developed speculatively and 
almost 80 per cent of the rent has already 
been secured.

During the year the contractor on one of 
our UK big box projects, Buckingham 
Contracting Group, entered administration. 
Our development team responded quickly 
to secure the scheme and liaise with our 
affected customers. 

Thanks to our strong relationship with an 
alternative contractor we were able to restart 
works quickly. Although an inevitable 
consequence has been an increase in costs 
along with a short delay to the original delivery 
programmes, we have managed the impacts of 
this alongside our customers and have revised 
completion dates in place. Contractor failure is 
a supply chain risk we consider explicitly and it 
is managed in part through avoiding over-
reliance on any single contractor.

Reducing embodied carbon in our 
development programme is critical to 
helping us achieve our net-zero targets 
and we continue to make progress in this 
area, reducing the carbon intensity of our 
developments to 348 kgCO2e per sq m during 
2023. This represents a 13 per cent reduction 
from our 2020 baseline, meaning we are on 
course to achieve our science-based target 
of a 20 per cent reduction by 2030.

Almost all (99 per cent) of our eligible 
development completions during 2023 have 
been, or are expected to be, accredited at least 
BREEAM ‘Very Good’ (or local equivalent), with 
92 per cent ‘Excellent’ or ‘Outstanding’. 

£71 million of potential headline rent 
currently under development or due to 
start shortly
At 31 December 2023, we had development 
projects approved, contracted or under 
construction totalling 415,200 sq m, 
representing £183 million of future capital 
expenditure to complete and £51 million of 
annualised gross rental income when fully let. 
62 per cent of this rent has already been secured 
and these projects should yield 7.3 per cent on 
total development cost when fully occupied.

In the UK, we have 169,900 sq m of space 
approved or under construction. Within this 
are our first multi-level warehouse scheme in 
West London, two new data centres on the 
Slough Trading Estate (the second largest 
hub of data centres globally) and big box 
warehouses at our logistics park in Coventry.

This includes pre-let big box warehouses for a 
variety of different occupiers, from retailers to 
manufacturers, across Italy, Spain and Poland. 
We are also developing a further phase of 
our successful urban warehouse park in 
Amsterdam and are also on site with our 
underground scheme in central Paris.

We continue to focus our speculative 
developments on urban warehouse projects, 
particularly in cities such as London and Paris, 
where modern space is in short supply and 
occupier demand is strong.

We have factored current construction and 
financing costs into the returns for our future 
development projects. Encouragingly, we are 
seeing build costs stabilise across most of our 
markets and in some regions have started to 
see construction tenders coming in at reduced 
prices. We expect to be able to develop at a 
margin over the valuation yields on equivalent 
standing assets of at least 150 to 200 basis 
points, meaning that development remains 
a profitable way of growing the rent roll.

Within the future development pipeline are 
a number of pre-let projects close to being 
approved, awaiting either final conditions to 
be met or planning approval to be granted. 
We expect to commence these 'near-term' 
projects within the next six to 12 months. 
These projects total 208,700 sq m of space, 
equating to approximately £159 million of 
future capital expenditure and £20 million 
of potential annual rent.

£481 million of future potential rent from 
land bank and options
Our land bank identified for future 
development (including the near-term 
projects detailed above) totalled 1,138 
hectares as at 31 December 2023, valued at 
£1.7 billion, roughly 10 per cent of our total 
portfolio value. This includes £645 million 
of land acquired for future redevelopment 
but which is currently income producing, 
reducing the holding costs until development 
can start (equating to £20 million of 
annualised rent).

We estimate our land bank can support 
3.7 million sq m of development over the next 
five to seven years. The estimated capital 
expenditure associated with the future 
pipeline is approximately £3.7 billion. It could 
generate £392 million of gross rental income, 
representing a yield on total development 
cost (including land and notional finance 
costs) of between 7 and 8 per cent. These 
figures are indicative, based on our current 
expectations, and are dependent on our 
ability to secure pre-let agreements, planning 
permissions, construction contracts and on our 
outlook for occupier conditions in local markets.

The land bank also includes 24 sites that 
SEGRO has identified as suitable for data 
centre development, equating to a potential 
1.2 GW of additional capacity across the UK 
and Continental Europe. SEGRO expects to be 
able to commence construction on several of 
these sites (two of which are currently under 
development) over the next five years, 
which could more than double the current 
£50 million of headline rent attributed to the 
data centre sector (approximately 7 per cent 
of group headline rent at 31 December 2023).

  Further details of our completed projects and 
development pipeline are available in the 
2023 Full Year Property Analysis Report, at  
www.SEGRO.com/investors.

Land acquisitions (contracted but subject to 
further conditions) and land held under option 
agreements are not included in the figures 
above, but represent significant further 
development opportunities. These include 
sites for big box warehouses in the UK 
Midlands as well as in Italy and Poland. 
They also include urban warehouse sites 
in East and West London.

The options are held on the balance sheet at 
a value of £26 million (including joint ventures 
and associates at share). Those we expect to 
exercise over the next two to three years are 
for land capable of supporting almost 
830,000 sq m of space and generating 
£89 million of headline rent, for a blended 
yield of approximately 7 per cent.

A zero-tolerance approach  
to poor health & safety

Accident incident rate:

0.93

2022: 0.25

Health and safety is central to all of our 
business activities and it is our responsibility 
to ensure that we provide and promote a 
healthy, safe and secure environment in 
which our people can work, extending 
throughout our supply chain, and in 
particular on our development projects.

We aim to achieve our high standards 
through a combination of risk mitigation, 
training and promoting a widespread 
awareness of health and safety. We only 
want to work with businesses that share our 
approach of zero-tolerance of poor health 
and safety. We require all of our suppliers to 
confirm that they meet our Health and Safety 
Standards, and we undertake particularly 
rigorous assessments of those companies 
working on our development sites. We 
support our contractors by providing 
additional guidance, signage and 
undertake health and safety visits of all 
our development sites through the life of 
each project. We also facilitate the sharing 
of best practice across the industry though 
our Contractor Forums. 

This approach also extends to the ongoing 
day-to-day life of our estates, many of 
which are accessed by both our customers 
and the public. We factor this into the 
design, mitigate risks and provide training 
to raise awareness.

Whenever incidents occur we fully 
investigate to understand the causes and 
disseminate learnings across the Group, 
including the Board and Executive 
Committee, to ensure that we (and where 
appropriate third-parties) respond and 
improve our processes where necessary. 

The accident incident rate increased 
slightly during 2023, but these were minor 
incidents, mainly slips and trips, and we 
believe the increase has been driven by 
improved reporting.

Update:  
Asset management

What we said we would do
We expected occupier demand to remain 
strong, but at more normalised levels to the 
pandemic years. We anticipated that rental 
growth would continue, supported by this 
demand and the continued shortage of 
supply in our chosen markets. 

What we achieved in 2023
Our focus on Operational excellence and 
commitment to excellent customer service 
helped us to deliver another strong year of 
rent roll growth during 2023, albeit not quite 
at the 2022 record level. We made great 
progress capturing reversion and kept 
occupancy high, despite taking back some 
space in London for refurbishment and 
redevelopment to very high sustainability 
standards. We also made great progress with 
our carbon targets within the existing 
portfolio by improving the visibility of 
customer emissions and adding a significant 
amount to our solar capacity through 
retrofitting projects. 

What to expect in 2024
We have a unique portfolio in Europe’s 
strongest markets. Our active asset 
management approach will ensure that it will 
continually evolve to provide high quality, 
modern space appealing to the widest 
variety of customers, thereby increasing 
rental levels. In 2024, we will continue to 
focus on providing excellent customer 
service and to capture the reversion inherent 
in our leases which reflects the quality of our 
buildings. We will continue to take advantage 
of leases coming to an end on some of our 
older buildings to refurbish them, bringing 
them up to the high environmental 
standards our customers and other 
stakeholders expect.

The performance of our existing portfolio 
relies on our continued focus on Operational 
excellence; whether that means providing the 
best customer experience throughout the 
customer’s ‘journey’ with SEGRO, optimising 
rental income and lease terms, ensuring 
consistency of operating standards, or driving 
efficiency through continuous improvement 
and the digitalisation of processes.

We believe SEGRO has a market-leading 
operating platform with people on the ground 
in all of our key locations. Through the internal 
management of our portfolio, we build strong 
and meaningful relationships with our 
customers and other business partners, and 
actively manage our assets to generate 
long-term outperformance.

Strong and diversified customer base 
Understanding our customers and their 
evolving needs is crucial to the success of 
our business. The insights that we gain from 
these partnerships help us to shape our 
portfolio and ensure that our buildings are 
fit for the future and suitable for occupier’s 
evolving needs.

Our customer base remains well diversified, 
reflecting the flexibility of warehouse space 
and that two-thirds of our portfolio is in urban 
locations. Our top 20 customers account for 
32 per cent of total headline rent. Amazon 
remains our largest customer, accounting 
for 7 per cent of our total rent roll.

Customers from the transport and logistics 
sector were the largest takers of our space 
during 2023, as they continued to focus 
on prioritising efficiency, resilience and 
sustainability into their operations. This was 
closely followed by the technology, media 
and telecoms sector, which was driven by 
data centre operators taking additional space 
to keep up with increased corporate and 
consumer demand.

The health of our customer base remains 
strong: less than £3 million of rent was lost 
due to insolvency (2022: £2 million) and rent 
collection is tracking at normal levels despite 
the tougher economic environment. 

Focused on delivering excellent 
customer service
Although the quality and location of our 
portfolio is important to our customers, 
we aim to build outstanding customer 
relationships through the delivery of excellent 
customer service. This enables us to maintain 
high levels of customer retention, grow rents 
and create new business opportunities.

We often work with our larger customers in 
more than one location and regularly across 
geographies: 27 per cent of our headline rent 
comes from customers with whom we have 
leases in more than one country. Our cross-
border customer account teams help to 
ensure that we offer a streamlined and 
informed approach to these businesses.

We carry out a rolling survey of our customers 
throughout the year to identify and rectify 
issues promptly. In 2023, we spoke to 
347 customers, and 96 per cent said that 
they would recommend SEGRO to others 
(2022: 98 per cent) while 86 per cent said 
they rated their experience with SEGRO as 
‘Excellent’ or ‘Good’ (2022: 85 per cent).

During 2023 we extended the reach of our 
customer insight programme and added new 
customer onboarding and senior stakeholder 
interviews to better understand our 
customers' experiences of working with 
SEGRO and how we can best support them. 
One of the key takeaways from these 
interviews was that customers appreciate our 
efforts to improve connectivity with SEGRO 
and between their fellow customers. Our 
regular Customer Futures Forums bring 
together customers from different sectors 
to discuss emerging trends and anticipate 
future requirements.

Actively managing our portfolio 
to create value
The supply-demand dynamics across our 
chosen markets remained favourable during 
2023, helping to drive further rental (ERV) 
growth and £88 million of new headline rent 
signed during the year. The active asset 
management of portfolio ensures that we 
generate long-term outperformance. We 
create plans for every single asset as part of 
our annual asset review process, aiming to 
strike a balance between maintaining current 
high occupancy and creating opportunities to 
drive future rents and create value through 
refurbishment, redevelopment or conversion 
to alternative uses such as data centres.

We monitor a number of metrics that help us 
assess the performance of our existing portfolio:
 – Good progress in capturing the embedded 
reversion within our portfolio: Lease reviews 
and renewals during the period generated an 
uplift of 31.0 per cent (2022: 23.3 per cent), 
adding £20 million of new headline rent. New 
rents agreed at review and renewal were 
39.9 per cent higher in the UK (2022: 28.0 per 
cent) as reversion accumulated over the past 
five years was reflected in new rents agreed. In 
Continental Europe, rents agreed on renewal 
were 7.9 per cent higher (2022: 1.7 per cent 
higher), as a result of market rental growth 
continuing to outpace annual indexation 
uplifts that have accumulated over recent 
years. Our portfolio is now 20 per cent 
reversionary, providing us with the opportunity 
to capture a further £137 million of headline 
rent over the next five years, £84 million of 
which is up for rent review or renewal by the 
end of 2026.  

 – Occupancy has remained high at 95.0 per 
cent (31 December 2022: 96.0 per cent), in 
line with our 94 to 96 per cent target. The slight 
reduction from 2022 is concentrated in our 
London portfolio and primarily reflects the 
recent completion of speculative projects in 
South London as well as the take-back of some 
older buildings to facilitate refurbishment or 
redevelopment. For example, a number of 
customers were relocated from their existing, 

older SEGRO premises into brand new space 
at SEGRO Park Hayes and SEGRO Park 
Tottenham. The occupancy rate excluding 
recently completed speculative developments 
remains high at 96.0 per cent (31 December 
2022: 97.3 per cent) and the average 
occupancy rate during the period was 
95.5 per cent (2022: 96.4 per cent). 
 – Customer retention rate increased  

to 81 per cent. Approximately £71 million of 
headline rent was at risk from a break or lease 
expiry during the period, of which we 
retained 78 per cent in existing space 
(2022: 75 per cent), and a further 3 per cent 
in new premises (2022: 1 per cent).

 – Lease terms continue to offer attractive 
income security. The level of incentives 
agreed for new leases (excluding those on 
developments completed in the period) fell 
slightly to 5.8 per cent of the headline rent 
(2022: 6.1 per cent). We maintained the 
portfolio’s weighted average lease length, with 
7.3 years to first break and 8.3 years to expiry 
(31 December 2022: 7.0 years to first break, 
8.3 years to expiry). Lease terms are longer in 
the UK (8.4 years to break) than in Continental 
Europe (5.7 years to break), reflecting the 
market convention of shorter leases in 
countries such as France and Poland.

Working closely with our customers and 
refurbishing older assets to help us achieve 
our Championing low-carbon growth 
ambitions
We have targets set and approved under the 
international Science-Based Targets Initiative 
(SBTi) to reduce the absolute corporate and 
customer carbon emissions from our portfolio 
by 42 per cent by 2030 (compared to a 2020 
baseline), in line with the 1.5 degree scenario. 
During 2023, we reduced these carbon 
emissions by 7 per cent, taking our reduction 
from 2020 to 19 per cent and putting us a year 
ahead of our target.

The recent introduction of green lease clauses is 
helping us to improve our visibility of customer 
carbon emissions, which allows us to better 
identify opportunities to help them operate their 

buildings more efficiently, reducing their carbon 
footprint and operating costs. These clauses, as 
well as an increase in the number of automatic 
meter feeds that we receive, have helped take 
the visibility of our portfolio energy use to 
81 per cent (2022: 68 per cent).

At the end of 2023, 65 per cent of the 
portfolio had an EPC rating of B or better 
(2022: 58 per cent). Whilst the majority of our 
portfolio is modern and already meets the 
highest sustainability standards, we do have 
some older assets in heavily populated and 
congested cities such as London and Paris, 
where land and buildings are in short supply 
and rents continue to grow. This provides us 
with the opportunity to add significant value 
through refurbishment, redevelopment, or 
conversion into alternative uses whilst also 
improving their environmental performance. 

A key part of our asset planning process is 
therefore determining the phasing of these 
projects and managing the space to ensure we 
have vacant possession to suit our future plans. 
This can lead to periods where the headline 
vacancy in these sub-markets is elevated, for 
example in our West London portfolio at the 
end of 2023, but the cost of this vacancy is 
more than outweighed by the value created 
through the refurbishment or redevelopment. 
Opportunities such as these are not included in 
our future development programme and could 
create significant rental uplifts. One such 
refurbishment, SEGRO Park Greenford in West 
London, was awarded BREEAM ‘Outstanding’ 
during the period and rated EPC A+ and is our 
most sustainable refurbishment to date. 

Our asset management teams are also 
working hard to expand the solar capacity of our 
portfolio through retrofitting onto existing assets 
(whilst the development teams are installing 
panels on new developments) where feasible. 
During 2023 we added 15 MW to our solar 
capacity, including 11 MW through retrofits 
onto existing buildings. 

Applying Operational excellence  
to our supply chains

Supplier spend:

£887m

Number of suppliers:

2,842

We apply the same approach in our supply 
chains as we do in our internal operations and 
aim to develop collaborative partnerships, with 
mutually beneficial aims and objectives. Our 
suppliers range from small local businesses to 
multinational companies and we look to work 
with businesses who share our approach to 
matters such as health and safety, compliance, 
anti-bribery and corruption. Our Supplier 
Code of Conduct and Modern Slavery and 
Labour Standards Supply Code consolidate 
and set out in full the principles and standards 
that we expect and outline how we can work 
side-by-side to create real change. 

Our relationships with our suppliers are also 
important in us achieving our Responsible 
SEGRO ambitions. We work closely with our 
construction partners to reduce the embodied 
carbon intensity of our development 
programme. We also expect our suppliers to 
work with us to support local businesses and 
economies; this included proactively sourcing 
labour, goods and services from our local 
communities and contributing to our 
Community Investment Plans. 

In the spirit of partnership, we treat our 
suppliers well and ensure they are paid on 
time. We are a signatory of the UK Prompt 
Payment Code (average UK payment time is 14 
days). We are also an accredited UK Living 
Wage employer, and are working with our 
suppliers to help ensure everyone working in 
our supply chain to support us is paid a real 
Living Wage.

SEGRO European Logistics Partnership (SELP)

10 years of SELP

Assets under Management  €m

During 2023 we celebrated the tenth anniversary 
of the SEGRO European Logistics Partnership 
(SELP). SELP is our Continental European big box 
joint venture with PSP Investments, one of 
Canada’s largest pension investment managers. 

SELP started in October 2013 with €1 billion of 
assets. At the end of 2023, it had a portfolio worth 
€6.7 billion. SELP generates €342 million of headline 
rent with an occupancy rate of 99 per cent. 

Our partnership is an important element of our 
strategy to build scale in Continental European big 
box warehousing in a capital-efficient manner. By 
sharing the capital investment with PSP 
Investments, we have been able to grow the 
portfolio further and faster than we could have 
done on our own. Both partners benefit from the 
attractive yield on the portfolio, the development 
potential from the land and from the economies of 
scale we can extract from this high-quality, 
modern collection of big box warehouses.

During SELP's first ten years it has developed 
almost 1.9 million sq m of big box warehouse 
space across six European countries, adding 
€102 million of headline rent to the portfolio.

As a result, SEGRO now has in excess of €1 billion 
of assets under management in each of Germany, 
France, Italy and Poland, and we are building scale 
in the smaller markets of Spain, Czech Republic 
and the Netherlands. 

SELP's assets are managed by SEGRO alongside 
its own portfolio and in return SELP pays SEGRO 
annual fees for asset management, development 
and advisory and administrative services. Since 
2013, SELP has paid SEGRO £192 million of these 
fees, which has resulted in a net benefit before tax 
to SEGRO of £96 million, enhancing the returns 
from the Continental European big box portfolio. 

In addition to these management fees, during the 
first ten-years of the joint venture SEGRO also 
received £141 million (net benefit before tax of 
£70 million) in performance fees, reflecting its 
successful growth. The final fee for the ten-year 
period of £89 million was recognised in 2023 (net 
benefit before tax of £44 million) and was in 
addition to two other performance fees 
recognised in 2018 and 2021 of £26 million 
each (net benefit before tax of £13 million).

The appetite for investing in big box warehousing 
in strategic locations in Continental Europe 
remains strong and we look forward to successful 
collaboration in the future.

Cologne gets a fresh coat of paint 

Given the scarcity of land in our urban 
markets, many of our developments involve 
the regeneration of brownfield sites. These 
schemes help to grow the local economy by 
helping to attract new business investment 
into local areas and creating diverse and 
high-quality employment opportunities. 

In 2014, we acquired a former paint factory on 
the edge of Cologne which, as with many of 
our brownfield urban developments, required 
a significant amount of remediation work. This 
included the removal of 62 tonnes of material 
contaminated by paint and varnish waste. 

Less than 10 years on this site is now SEGRO 
Park Cologne City: a 55,000 sq m urban 
logistics and light industrial park built to the 
highest sustainability standards (helping it to 
be awarded DGNB the highest possible DGNB 
‘Platinum’ Certification). 

The park is now home to 23 customers 
from a diverse range of industries including: 
retail, film and media, post and parcel, 
luxury cars and food manufacturing. 
Together they employ 1,128 and are enabling 
a wide range of extraordinary things to 
happen in Cologne.

borrowings are unsecured. Cash and cash 
equivalent balances were £404 million 
(31 December 2022: £194 million). The average 
debt maturity was 6.9 years (31 December 
2022: 8.6 years) and the average cost of 
debt (excluding non-cash interest and 
commitment fees) was 3.1 per cent 
(31 December 2022: 2.5 per cent).

Funds available to SEGRO Group (including its 
share of joint venture funds) at 31 December 
2023 totalled £1,930 million (31 December 
2022: £2,208 million), comprising £404 million 
cash and short-term investments and £1,526 
million of undrawn credit facilities of which 
£148 million was uncommitted. Cash and 
cash equivalent balances, together with the 
Group’s interest rate and foreign exchange 
derivatives portfolio, are spread amongst a 
strong group of banks, all of which have a 
credit rating of A- or better.

obligations and strengthen liquidity. We have 
extended £1,096 million of SEGRO bank 
facilities and €600 million of SELP bank 
facilities by a further year. In response to 
increased interest rate volatility, we have 
expanded our interest rate cap portfolio to 
maintain the level of fixed and capped rate 
debt at 95 per cent.

Financing during the year
 – Short-term debt: SEGRO has extended the 
term of €800 million of its revolving credit 
facilities by a further year, €200 million to 
2028 and €600 million to 2026. SELP also 
extended the term of its €600 million of 
facilities a further year to 2027. In January 
2024, SEGRO arranged a €100 million 
bilateral revolving credit facility with a new 
relationship bank, increasing available 
revolving credit facilities to €1.9 billion. 

 – Medium-term debt: SEGRO arranged 

£100 million and €150 million of new term 
loans, maturing in 2026, from existing 
relationship banks, and extended the term 
of £300 million and €115 million of term 
loans by a further year also to 2026. 
During the year, SEGRO drew £400 million 
and €558 million of term loans.

Monitoring and mitigating financial risk
As explained in the Risks section of this Annual 
Report, the Group monitors a number of 
financial metrics to assess the level of financial 
risk being taken and to mitigate that risk.

Treasury policies and governance
The Group Treasury function operates within 
a formal policy covering all aspects of treasury 
activity, including funding, counterparty 
exposure and management of interest rate, 
currency and liquidity risks. Group Treasury 
reports on compliance with these policies 
on a quarterly basis and policies are reviewed 
regularly by the Board.

Gearing and financial covenants
We consider the key leverage metric for 
SEGRO to be a proportionally consolidated 
(‘look-through’) loan to value ratio (LTV) which 
incorporates assets and net debt on SEGRO’s 
balance sheet and SEGRO’s share of assets 
and net debt on the balance sheets of its joint 
ventures. The LTV at 31 December 2023 on 
this basis was 34 per cent (31 December 2022: 
32 per cent), the increase primarily driven by 
the reduction in asset values and a higher 
debt balance.

SEGRO’s borrowings contain gearing 
covenants based on Group net debt and net 
asset value, excluding debt in joint ventures. 
The gearing ratio of the Group at 31 December 
2023, as defined within the principal debt 
funding arrangements of the Group, was 
45 per cent (31 December 2022: 41 per cent). 

This is significantly lower than the Group’s 
tightest financial gearing covenant within 
these debt facilities of 160 per cent. Property 
valuations would need to fall by around 44 per 
cent from their 31 December 2023 values to 
reach the gearing covenant threshold of 
160 per cent. A 44 per cent fall in property 
values would equate to an LTV ratio of 
approximately 62 per cent.

The Group’s other key financial covenant within 
its principal debt funding arrangements is 
interest cover, requiring that net interest before 
capitalisation be covered at least 1.25 times by 
net property rental income: the ratio for 2023

was 2.7 times, comfortably ahead of the 
covenant minimum. Net property rental income 
would need to fall by around 54 per cent from 
2023 levels, or interest rates would need to rise 
to 7.4 per cent from the full year average interest 
rate of 3.4 per cent to breach the interest cover 
covenant threshold. On a proportionally 
consolidated basis, including joint ventures, 
the interest cover ratio was 3.0 times.

SEGRO also monitors its leverage on a net 
debt:EBITDA basis which is an increasingly 
important metric for rating agencies and our 
investors. SEGRO has a long-term issuer 
default rating of ‘BBB+’ and a senior 
unsecured rating of ‘A-’ from Fitch Ratings as 
at 31 December 2023. These ratings were 
reduced from ‘A-’ and ‘A’ respectively in May 
2023, and placed on ‘negative watch’. 

SEGRO’s net debt:EBITDA ratio at the end 
of 2023 was 10.4 times (2022: 11.7 times), 
reflecting the net impact of an £75 million 
increase in EBITDA and a £250 million increase 
in net debt. The elevated 2022 ratio was the 
prime reason cited by Fitch Ratings for 
downgrading our senior unsecured debt 
rating during the year to A- from A and 
applying a negative outlook. Fitch state 
that a net debt:EBITDA ratio of 9.5 times 
is consistent with an A- rating and we have 
made significant progress towards that during 
2023 as a result of growing our rent roll and 
funding a significant proportion of our 
investment with the proceeds of disposals.

We mitigate the risk of over-gearing the 
Company and breaching debt covenants by 
carefully monitoring the impact of investment 
decisions on our LTV and by stress testing our 
balance sheet to potential changes in 
property values.

Our intention for the foreseeable future is 
to maintain our LTV at around 30 per cent, 
although the evolution of the property cycle 
will inevitably mean that there are periods of 
time when our LTV is higher or lower than this. 
However, this level of LTV through the cycle 
provides the flexibility to take advantage of 
investment opportunities arising and ensures 

significant headroom compared against our 
tightest gearing covenants should property 
values decline. 

The weighted average maturity of the gross 
borrowings of the Group (including joint 
ventures at share) was 6.9 years, with the 
closest maturity being SELP’s €500 million 
euro bond in November 2025, followed by 
SEGRO’s €195 million term loan in December 
2025. This long average debt maturity 
comprises a well spread debt funding 
maturity profile which reduces future 
refinancing risk.

Interest rate risk
The Group’s interest rate risk policy is 
designed to ensure that we limit our exposure 
to volatility in interest rates. The policy states 
that between 50 and 100 per cent of net 
borrowings (including the Group’s share of 
borrowings in joint ventures) should be at 
fixed or capped rates, including the impact 
of derivative financial instruments.

At 31 December 2023, including the impact 
of derivative instruments, 95 per cent 
(2022: 95 per cent) of the net borrowings 
of the Group (including the Group’s share of 
borrowings within joint ventures) were either 
at fixed rates or are protected from rising 
interest rates with interest rate caps, with a 
spread of expiry dates over the next 6 years 
and an average expiry of 3.4 years. The 
pure fixed level of debt is 76 per cent 
at 31 December 2023 (31 December 
2022: 83 per cent), rising to 95 per cent 
including floating rate debt which is now 
subject to an active cap. The remaining 
5 per cent of debt is at floating rates.

During the year, in line with our risk 
management processes and due to the higher 
levels of market volatility, the Group entered 
into €532 million of interest rate cap contracts 
to mitigate the risk of rising interest rates 
on our floating rate debt exposure. At 
31 December 2023 all of these caps 
were triggered.

As a result of the fixed rate cover in place, 
if short-term interest rates had been 200 
basis points higher throughout the year to 
31 December 2023, the adjusted net finance 
cost of the Group would have been 
approximately £10 million higher (31 December 
2022: £27 million higher) representing around 
3 per cent (31 December 2022: 7 per cent) of 
Adjusted profit after tax. This decrease in 
sensitivity to interest rate increases since 2022 
is attributed to the greater protection from our 
interest rate cap portfolio. 

The Group elects not to hedge account its 
interest rate derivatives portfolio. Therefore, 
movements in its fair value are taken to the 
income statement but, in accordance with 
EPRA Best Practices Recommendations 
Guidelines, these gains and losses are 
eliminated from Adjusted profit after tax.

Foreign currency translation risk
The Group has minimal transactional foreign 
currency exposure but does have a potentially 
significant currency translation exposure 
arising on the conversion of its foreign 
currency denominated assets (mainly euro) 
and euro denominated earnings into sterling 
in the Group consolidated accounts.

The Group seeks to limit its exposure to 
volatility in foreign exchange rates by hedging 
its foreign currency gross assets using either 
borrowings or derivative instruments. The 
Group targets a hedging range of between 
the last reported LTV ratio (34 per cent at 31 
December 2023) and 100 per cent. At 31 
December 2023, the Group was 74 per cent 
hedged by gross foreign currency denominated 
liabilities (31 December 2022: 76 per cent).

Including the impact of forward foreign 
exchange and currency swap contracts used 
to hedge foreign currency denominated net 
assets, if the value of the other currencies in 
which the Group operates at 31 December 
2023 weakened by 10 per cent against sterling 
(to €1.27, in the case of euros), net assets 
would have decreased by approximately £151 
million and there would have been a reduction 
in gearing of approximately 2.2 per cent and 
in the LTV of 1.3 per cent.

The average exchange rate used to translate 
euro denominated earnings generated 
during 2023 into sterling within the 
consolidated income statement of the Group 
was €1.15: £1. Based on the hedging position 
at 31 December 2023, and assuming that this 
position had applied throughout 2023, if the 
euro had been 10 per cent weaker than the 
average exchange rate (€1.27: £1), Adjusted 
profit after tax for the year would have been 
approximately £9 million (2.3 per cent) lower 
than reported. If it had been 10 per cent 
stronger, Adjusted profit after tax for the year 
would have been approximately £11 million 
(2.8 per cent) higher than reported.

Progress against our strategy

What we said we would do
We intend to keep our LTV at around 
30 per cent. 

What we achieved in 2023
The impact of increased borrowings 
(due to £0.6 billion net investment) during 
the year and the reduction in asset values 
meant that LTV has increased from 32 per 
cent to 34 per cent at 31 December 2023. 

What to expect in 2024
We aim to maintain our mid-cycle LTV at 
around 30 per cent, although the evolution 
of the property cycle will inevitably mean 
that there are periods of time when our LTV 
is higher or lower than this. We believe this 
approach ensures significant headroom 
compared against our tightest gearing 
covenants should property values decline 
further, as well as providing the flexibility to 
take advantage of investment opportunities 
which may arise. We have cash and 
available facilities of £1.9 billion (including 
our share of joint ventures and associates) 
on which we can draw to fund our 
investment plans.

Income statement review

Presentation of financial information 
The Group Financial Statements are 
prepared under IFRS where the Group’s 
interests in joint ventures and associates 
are shown as a single line item on the 
income statement and balance sheet 
and subsidiaries are consolidated at 
100 per cent.

The Adjusted profit measure reflects the 
underlying financial performance of the 
Group’s property rental business, which 
is our core operating activity. It is based 
on EPRA earnings as set out in the Best 
Practices Recommendations Guidelines of 
the European Public Real Estate Association 
(EPRA) which are widely used alternate 
metrics to their IFRS equivalents within the 
European real estate sector (further details 
can be found at www.epra.com). In 
calculating Adjusted profit, the Directors 
may also exclude additional items 
considered to be non-recurring, unusual, 
or significant by virtue of size and nature. 
In the current year, the net profit after tax 
impact of the SELP performance fees 
recognised of £42 million have been 
excluded. Furthermore an impairment of a 
loan to an associate of £28 million has also 
been excluded. Both items are discussed in 
more detail in Note 2. In the prior year there 
have been no such adjustments and 
therefore Adjusted profit and EPRA 
earnings were the same.

Going concern
As noted in the Financial Position and Funding 
section above, the Group has significant 
available liquidity to meet its capital 
commitments, a long-dated debt maturity 
profile and substantial headroom against 
financial covenants. 

 – In 2023, the Group extended the term 
of its €600 million and €200 million 
revolving credit facilities to 2026 and 2028, 
respectively, and extended the term of its 
£300 million and €115 million term loans 
to 2026.

 – The Group added a further £100 million 

and €150 million term loan facilities, both 
maturing in 2026.

 – Cash and available committed facilities 
at 31 December 2023 were £1.5 billion.

 – The Group continuously monitors its liquidity 

position compared to committed and 
expected capital and operating expenses 
on a rolling forward 18-month basis. 
The quantum of committed capital 
expenditure at any point in time is 
typically low due to the short timeframe 
to construct warehouse buildings. 

 – The Group also regularly stress-tests its 
financial covenants. As noted above, at 
31 December 2023, property values would 
need to fall by around 44 per cent before 
breaching the gearing covenant. In terms of 
interest cover, net rental income would have 
needed to fall by 54 per cent or the average 
interest rate would have needed to reach 
7.4 per cent before breaching the interest 
cover covenant. All would be significantly 
in excess of the Group’s experience during 
the financial crisis.

Having made enquiries and having 
considered the principal risks facing the 
Group, including liquidity and solvency risks, 
and material uncertainties, the Directors have 
a reasonable expectation that the Company 
and the Group have adequate resources to 
continue in operational existence for the 
foreseeable future (a period of at least 12 
months from the date of approval of the 
financial statements). Accordingly, they 
continue to adopt the going concern basis 
in preparing these financial statements.

Net rental income increased by £50 million 
to £462 million (or by £65 million to 
£587 million including joint ventures and 
associates at share before joint venture 
fees), reflecting the positive net impact of 
like-for-like rental growth, development 
completions and investment activity during 
the year, offset by the impact of disposals.

On a like-for-like basis¹, before other items 
(primarily corporate centre and other costs 
not specifically allocated to a geographic 
Business Unit), net rental income increased 
by £31 million, or 6.5 per cent, compared 
to 2022.

This is due to strong rental performance 
across our portfolio. Continental Europe: 
8.5 per cent increase, primarily through 
indexation; and UK: 5.3 per cent increase, 
primarily through capturing the reversionary 
potential in the portfolio through lease 
reviews and renewals (for more information 
see Performance review page 37.)

1  The like-for-like net rental growth metric is based on 
properties held throughout both 2023 and 2022 on 
a proportionally consolidated basis. This provides 
details of underlying net rental income growth 
excluding the distortive impact of acquisitions, 
disposals and development completions.

SEGRO’s share of joint ventures and 
associates’ Adjusted profit after tax 
increased by £11 million from £71 million in 
2022 to £82 million in 2023, excluding 
performance fee expense. The increase is 
driven by net rental income growth partially 
offset by interest costs and taxation.

Joint venture fee management fee income 
decreased by £1 million to £29 million in 
2023 due to a reduction in property values 
on which elements of the fees are based.

Performance fees from joint ventures have 
been excluded from Adjusted profit and are 
discussed in the IFRS loss section below.

Net finance costs were £32 million higher 
than 2022 at £106 million. Average interest 
rates during the year were 3.2 per cent 
compared to 2.6 per cent in the prior 
year. This has been partially offset by a 
£42 million increase in capitalised interest 
compared to the prior year due to the 
higher rate of interest on debt used to 
finance development projects. Furthermore, 
gross debt levels were higher in 2023 
compared to the prior year. At 31 December 
2023 gross debt was £5,348 million, 
£464 million higher than the prior year.

The tax charge on Adjusted profit of 
£10 million (2022: £11 million) reflects 
an effective tax rate of 2.4 per cent 
(2022: 2.8 per cent).

The Group’s effective tax rate reflects 
the fact that around three-quarters of its 
wholly-owned assets are located in the 
UK and qualify for REIT status. This status 
means that income from rental profits and 
gains on disposals of assets in the UK are 
exempt from corporation tax, provided 
SEGRO meets a number of conditions
including, but not limited to, distributing 
90 per cent of UK taxable profits.

Adjusted profit after tax increased by £25 
million to £399 million (2022: £374 million) 
as a result of the above movements, 
primarily growth in rental income offset 
by increased finance costs.

Adjusted profit is detailed further in Note 2 
to the Financial Statements.

Adjusted earnings per share are 32.7 pence 
compared to 31.0 pence in 2022 due to the 
increase in Adjusted profit slightly offset by 
the 13 million increase in the average 
number of shares in issue compared 
to the prior year.

increases in ERV. These are discussed in more 
detail in the Performance review on page 36. 
Other property movements include profit on 
sale of wholly-owned investment properties 
of £39 million (2022: £9 million profit). 

There was also a loss of £28 million 
recognised in the year in relation to the 
impairment of a loan to an associate which 
is assumed to be recovered through the fair 
value of land which has fallen during the year. 
This is further detailed in Note 17(vi).

IFRS loss
IFRS loss before tax in 2023 was £263 million 
(2022: £1,967 million loss), equating to basic 
post-tax IFRS loss per share of 20.7 pence 
compared with loss per share of 159.7 pence 
for 2022. A reconciliation between Adjusted 
profit before tax and IFRS loss before tax is 
provided in Note 2 to the Financial Statements.

The principal driver of IFRS loss is realised and 
unrealised property losses and gains which is 
the main reason for the lower loss per share in 
2023 versus 2022. Total loss on properties is 
£760 million (2022: £2,175 million loss). 
This includes a £598 million realised and 
unrealised property loss on investment 
and trading properties in the wholly-owned 
business (2022: £1,939 million loss) and 
£162 million loss from joint ventures and 
associates at share (2022: £236 million loss). 
The largest component are valuation losses 
on investment and trading properties of 
£809 million including joint ventures at share 
(2022: £2,191 million), which is driven by yield 
expansion in most markets partially offset by 

IFRS earnings in the year also included 
recognition of a performance fee from SELP 
following the ten-year anniversary of the joint 
venture. The overall net profit impact was 
£42 million (2022: £nil). This constituted a 
£89 million income less taxation of £10 million 
in respect of the wholly-owned business and 
a cost of the performance fee of £45 million 
less a tax credit of £8 million from the joint 
venture (at share).

Further detail on the performance fee 
including the recognition criteria and 
cumulative fee recognised are detailed 
in Note 7(ii).

IFRS earnings were also impacted by a net 
fair value gain on interest rate swaps and 
other derivatives of £24 million (2022: loss 
of £199 million).

In addition, SEGRO recognised a tax credit 
in respect of adjustments of £30 million 
(2022: £48 million) primarily in relation to 
property valuation movements. 

Balance sheet
At 31 December 2023, IFRS net assets 
were £10,904 million (31 December 2022: 
£11,373 million), reflecting 886 pence per 
share (31 December 2022: 938 pence) on 
a diluted basis.

Adjusted NAV per share at 31 December 
2023 was 907 pence (31 December 2022: 
966 pence). The 6.1 per cent decrease 
primarily reflects property valuation losses 
in the year as explained above. The chart 
highlights the other main factors behind the 
decrease. A reconciliation between IFRS and 
Adjusted NAV is available in Note 12 to the 
Financial Statements.

Cash flow and net debt reconciliation
Cash flows from operating activities of £584 
million are £105 million higher than the prior 
year. This is primarily due to increased rental 
income received during the year, and other 
working capital movements. As well as finance 
cost outflows of £162 million in servicing the 
debt facilities, a further £5 million was spent in 
closing out debt and reprofiling interest rate 
derivatives. Interest rate risk management is 
detailed further in the Financial review on 
page 49. In addition there were tax payments 
of £24 million primarily in France.

The Group made net investments of £487 
million in investment and development 
properties during the year on a wholly-owned 
cash flow basis (2022: £1,162 million). This is 
principally driven by expenditure of £839 
million (2022: £1,472 million) to purchase and 
develop investment properties to deliver 
further growth in line with our strategy. 
Disposals of investment properties increased 
by £42 million to £352 million compared to the 
prior year (2022: £310 million) as the business 
looked to recycle assets when the opportunity 
arose.

During the year £185 million (2022: £222 
million) dividends were paid which is lower 
than the total dividend due to the level of scrip 
uptake of £129 million (2022: £79 million) and 
tax due after year end on a Property Income 
Distribution of £13 million (2022: £nil). 

Other significant cash flows include £29 
million acquisition of plant and equipment 
and intangibles primarily on enhancing the 
businesses technology and PV plant, and £16 
million to acquire the residual non-controlling 
interest of Vailog Sarl.

Overall, net debt has increased in the year

Capital expenditure
Table 10 in the Supplementary Notes sets 
out analysis of the capital expenditure during 
the year. This includes acquisition and 
development spend, on an accruals basis, 
in respect of the Group’s wholly-owned 
investment and trading property portfolios, 
as well as the equivalent amounts for joint 
ventures and associates, at share.

Total spend for the year was £1,121 million, 
a decrease of £777 million compared to 
2022, primarily from lower acquisition and 
development spend. More detail on this 
spend can be found in the Development 
and Investment Updates on pages 39 to 40.

Development capital expenditure was £527 
million in the year (2022: £787 million) across 
all our Business Units, particularly Southern 
Europe and National Logistics, reflecting our 
development-led growth strategy. Interest of 
£68 million (2022: £24 million) has been 
capitalised in the year.

Spend on existing completed properties, 
totalled £67 million (2022: £62 million), of 
which £1 million (2022: £13 million) was for 
incremental lettable space. The balance 
mainly comprises refurbishment and fit-out 
costs, which equates to less than six per cent 
of total spend. 

Dividend increase reflects the strong 
operational results and confidence for 
the future
Under the UK REIT rules, we are required to 
pay out 90 per cent of UK-sourced, tax-
exempt rental profits as a ‘Property Income 
Distribution’ (PID). Since we also receive 
income from our properties in Continental 
Europe, our total dividend should normally 
exceed this minimum level and we target a 
payout ratio of 85 to 95 per cent of Adjusted 
profit after tax. We aim to deliver a progressive 
and sustainable dividend which grows in line 
with our profitability in order to achieve our 
goal of being a leading income-focused REIT.

The Board has concluded that it is appropriate 
to recommend an increase in the final 
dividend per share by 0.9 pence to 19.1 pence 
(2022: 18.2 pence). We will pay the 2023 final 
dividend as a PID and expect to pay the 2024 
interim dividend as an ordinary dividend. The 
Board’s recommendation is subject to 
approval by shareholders at the 2024 Annual 
General Meeting to be held on 18 April 2024, 
in which event the final dividend will be paid 
on 3 May 2024 to shareholders on the register 
at the close of business on 15 March 2024.

In considering the final dividend, the Board 
took into account:

 – the policy of targeting a payout ratio of 

between 85 and 95 per cent of Adjusted 
profit after tax;

 – the desire to ensure that the dividend is 
sustainable and progressive throughout 
the cycle; and

 – the results for 2023 and the outlook for 

earnings.

The total dividend for the year will, therefore, 
be 27.8 pence, a rise of 5.7 per cent versus 
2022 (26.3 pence) and represents distribution 
of 85 per cent of Adjusted profit after tax.

The Board has decided to retain a scrip 
dividend option for the 2023 final dividend 
(subject to approval by shareholders at the 
2024 AGM), allowing shareholders to choose 
whether to receive the dividend in cash or 
new shares. In 2023, 49 per cent of the 2022 
final dividend and 21 per cent of the 2023 
interim dividend were paid in new shares, 
equating to £129 million of cash retained on 
the balance sheet.

Managing risk

Effective risk management

We understand that a 
unified and responsive 
approach to risk 
management is essential 
for us to be able to 
address the risks to our 
strategy.
Soumen Das, Chief Financial Officer

An effective, proportionate, and reliable 
risk management process is essential to 
support our strategy and business model. 
Whilst we still face the challenges of the 
external environment, risk management 
is embedded in our decision-making 
processes, meaning our business 
can remain stable and resilient.

Two examples of emerging risks we are 
currently monitoring are longer-term climate 
change and disruptive technologies.

Longer-term climate change
We consider the longer-term effects of some 
risks which are also principal risks within our 
risk register, for example, the effects of climate 
change. The further ahead the timescale, 
the harder it becomes to predict the physical 
effects of climate change, like temperature 
increases and heavier or more unpredictable 
rainfall, but we know this is something that will 
affect us in the future. In addition, SEGRO 
needs to consider how our actions to reduce 
carbon emissions will affect our strategy in the 
longer term, as well as potential new and 
rapidly changing liabilities associated with 
climate litigation. The impact of these risks 
could be a change in desired location of our 
assets, change in customer demand, 
reputation damage, downward impact on 
valuations and potential asset obsolescence.

Disruptive technologies
We also consider ‘new’ risks such as those 
associated with disruptive technologies. 
These may include developments such as the 
widespread adoption of autonomous vehicles 
and the resultant effect on demand and use 
of our assets, the longer term ‘working-from-
home’ habits and the effect on urbanisation, 
use of data and automation within our 
warehouses and the rise of ‘space-as-a-
service’ operators. While these changes could 
bring opportunities as well as threats, SEGRO 
cannot maintain a position of strength unless 
we continue to monitor the changes and 
increase our understanding over time. 

Soumen Das
Chief Financial Officer

The Group Risk Committee is made up of 
members of senior management and now 
includes the Group Customer & Operations 
Director. The members of the Committee 
have detailed knowledge of, and expertise in 
operational, financial and corporate aspects 
of our business. The Group Risk Committee 
has met three times during the year and has 
been responsible for overseeing the work of 
the risk management function on behalf of 
the Executive Committee. 

Although SEGRO’s principal risks do not 
dramatically change year-to-year there are key 
areas of focus in response to changes within the 
external environment or within the business. An 
example of a risk which has been a particularly 
are of focus this year is the risk associated with 
developments and construction. 

The successful delivery of SEGRO’s 
development programme required a suitable 
land bank in order to achieve SEGRO’s strategy 
of operational excellence. The macroeconomic 
environment is driving supply chain instability 
and more concern over contractor insolvency. 
Although development and construction 
execution is a long-standing principal risk 
within SEGRO’s risk register, the external 
environment impacts the type and significance 
of the risks associated with holding land and 
managing our development pipeline. We are 
therefore carefully monitoring our appetite for 
land holdings and undertaking due diligence 
associated with land, developments, appraisal 
assumptions and contractor performance. 
We have also extended this risk to specifically 
include reference to the potential impact of 
faulty design or construction, deleterious 
materials and changes in regulation 
affecting the compliance of our buildings.

Emerging risks
In addition to monitoring our principal risks in 
a risk register, we identify, assess and monitor 
emerging risks. We consider wide-ranging risks 
such as water availability and our buildings’ 
water demands, energy usage and access to 
power and changes to public sentiment which 
may affect customer demand associated, for 
example with air travel or data centres.

Annual risk management update
The macroeconomic and geopolitical 
challenges of 2022 have continued into 
2023 which inevitably affect SEGRO in terms 
of higher interest rates, and pressure on our 
asset valuations. Our rigorous risk management 
approach is therefore as vital as it has ever 
been, to not only maintain SEGRO’s stability 
and resilience into 2024 but also to remain well 
positioned in order to benefit from any positive 
trends in the near and longer-term future.

The Group’s Board and key committees 
have continued to oversee our response 
to these challenges and the wider 
economic implications throughout the year. 
Consequentially, they have taken actions to 
mitigate the impact on both our operations 
and the wellbeing of our employees. We review 
our investment plans regularly and continue to 
manage our balance sheet proactively to help 
mitigate the impacts of future volatility.

Our risk appetite

The Group’s ability to effectively manage 
risk throughout the organisation is central 
to the ongoing success of the business. 
Risk management ensures that there is a 
structured approach to the decision-making 
process that looks to reduce uncertainty over 
expected outcomes and to bring controllable 
risks within our appetite, thereby balancing 
uncertainty against the objective of creating 
and protecting value for our stakeholders, 
now and in the future.

We have put risk appetite at the heart of 
our risk management processes and it is 
integral both to our consideration of strategy 
and to our medium-term planning process. 
Our risk appetite is applicable throughout 
the organisation including joint ventures 
and associated companies.

The Group’s risk appetite is reviewed 
annually and approved by the Board in order 
to guide the business. As well as qualitative 
descriptions, the risk appetite defines 
tolerances and targets for key metrics. It also 
includes criteria for assessing the potential 
impact of risks and our mitigation of them.

Our risk appetite is dynamic, varying over 
time and during the course of the property 
cycle. We adjust our risk appetite in relation 
to different types of risks, as explained further 
below. However, overall, the Group maintains 
a low appetite for risk, appropriate to our 
strategic objectives of delivering long-term 
sustainable value.

Property risk
We recognise that, in seeking 
outperformance from our portfolio, 
the Group must accept a balanced level 
of property risk in order to enhance 
opportunities for superior returns. We strive 
for diversity in geographic locations and 
asset types, with an appropriate mixture 
of stabilised income-producing and 
opportunity assets. This is balanced 
against the backdrop of the geopolitical 
and macroeconomic environment and 
its impact on the property cycle. 

Our portfolio should deliver attractive, low 
risk income returns with strong rental and 
capital growth when market conditions are 
positive and with reasonable resilience in a 
downturn. We aim to enhance these returns 
through development, which requires 
appropriate levels of land holdings to 
support the pipeline. We seek to balance the 
risk of holding too much land, which might 
be a drag to earnings, by closely monitoring 
the churn and duration of our land holdings. 
We also seek to mitigate the risks, especially 
contractor covenant risks, that are inherent 
in development. With due consideration of 
our environmental responsibilities, we seek 
to develop buildings which meet and, 
preferably, exceed minimum regulatory 
requirements. Buildings which fail to achieve 
high environmental certification standards 
are increasingly less attractive to occupiers 
now and we expect this sentiment to 
intensify in the future.

We have a low appetite for risks to income 
from customers and therefore we maintain a 
diverse occupier base with strong covenants 
and avoid over-exposure to individual 
occupiers in specialist properties. 

Financial risk
The Group maintains a low appetite for 
financial risk in general, with a very low 
appetite for risks to solvency and gearing 
covenant breaches.

As an income-focused REIT we have a low 
appetite for risks which threaten a stable 
progression in earnings and dividends 
over the long-term. 

We also seek long-term growth in net 
asset value notwithstanding the impact 
of fluctuations from external factors which 
influence the property cycle. Our appetite 
for risks to net asset value from the 
factors within our control is low, albeit 
acknowledging that our appetite for 
moderate leverage across the cycle 
amplifies the impact of market-driven asset 
valuation movements on net asset value.

Corporate risk
We have a very low appetite for risks to our 
good reputation with our customers and 
wider stakeholders. These stakeholders 
include investors, regulators, employees, 
business partners, suppliers, lenders and 
the communities in which we operate.

Our responsibilities to these stakeholders 
include compliance with all relevant laws; 
accurate and timely reporting of financial 
and other regulatory information; 
protecting the health and safety of 
employees, suppliers, customers and 
other users of our assets; our impact on 
the environment; compliance with codes 
of conduct and ethics; ensuring business 
continuity; and making a positive 
contribution to our local communities.

Risk management

Our integrated and robust approach  
to risk management
The risk management process is designed 
to identify, assess and respond to significant 
risks to the Group’s objectives. Most of these 
risks cannot be eliminated or avoided so, 
instead, the process aims to understand, 
document, mitigate and monitor the 
risks. The risk management process 
can therefore only provide reasonable 
and not absolute assurance. 

The identification and review of emerging 
risks is integrated into our risk review 
process. Emerging risks are those risks 
or a combination of risks with a longer 
timescale. They are often rapidly evolving 
and, consequently, the impact and probability 
may be less predictable. Therefore, necessary 
mitigations are usually not yet fully evolved. 
All risk owners and managers within the 
business are challenged to consider 
emerging risks and this is supplemented 
through formal, twice-yearly horizon scans 
with the Executive Committee, as well as 
other relevant internal groups.

The Board has performed a robust 
assessment of the principal and emerging 
risks facing the Group. It formally reviewed 
the risks twice during the year and also 
completed its annual review and approval of 
the Group’s risk appetite, and the Group’s risk 
management policy. The Audit Committee 
then reviewed how the Group Risk Register 
has been compiled, at two points during 
the year.

The Board recognises that we have limited 
control over many of the external risks that 
the Group faces, such as global events as 
well as the macroeconomic, geopolitical, and 
regulatory environment, but still ensures we 
assess the potential impact of such risks on 
the business and consequential decision 
making. Internal risks are monitored by the 
Board to ensure that appropriately designed 
controls are in place and operate effectively 
to manage those risks.

The most significant risks are detailed in the 
Group Risk Register. Risks are assessed in both 
inherent (before taking any relevant controls 
into account) and residual (with mitigating 
controls operating normally) states. As part 
of the assessment, risk impact is directly 
measured against risk appetite so that it is 
clear whether each risk is classed as within 
appetite, tolerable, intolerable or below 
appetite. We also formally assess the velocity 
of the most significant risks to determine how 
quickly they might become intolerable. Each 
risk has a range of mitigating controls which 
are in place.

A Key Risk Indicator (KRI) dashboard is 
produced and monitored regularly to show 
actual and forecast performance against risk 
appetite metrics, allowing informed decision 
making. KRIs are considered regularly by the 
relevant monitoring committees in their 
decision making, as well as being integral 
to the Group’s Medium-Term Plan.

The Register is used as a key input to 
determine priorities for the Group’s internal 
audit assurance programme. 

Furthermore, management’s annual self-
assessment of control effectiveness is driven 
by the Register.

Our risk management 
process is long-standing 
and therefore is 
embedded and well 
understood throughout 
our business.

Our framework for risk governance
The Group adopts the ‘three lines of defence’ 
model of risk management. 

The first line of defence is provided by the 
function that has primary responsibility to 
own and manage the risk associated with 
day-to-day operational activities which may 
include operational management, the 
individual risk manager and executive 
risk owner. 

The second line of defence is provided 
by the function that oversees the risk or 
which specialises in compliance or risk 
management. This would typically be a 
monitoring committee such as the Executive 
Committee, the Investment Committee or 
the Technology Committee, as well as the risk 
management function overseen by the Group 
Risk Committee. 

The third line of defence is provided by 
Internal Audit which gives objective and 
independent assurance over whether the first 
and second lines of defence are operating 
effectively. Risks are considered within each 
area of the business to ensure that risk 
management is fully embedded within the 
Group’s operations, culture and decision-
making processes. 

The Board has overall responsibility for 
ensuring that risk is effectively and 
consistently managed across the Group. 
The Audit Committee monitors effectiveness 
on behalf of the Board. Further information 
on compliance with the risk management 
provisions of the UK Corporate Governance 
Code can be found in the Internal controls 
and risk management section of the Audit 
Committee Report. 

Accountabilities for the Group’s risk 
management are outlined in the diagram.

Principal risks

Principal risks and uncertainties
The principal risks have the potential to 
affect SEGRO’s business materially. Risks are 
classified as ‘principal’ based on their potential 
to intolerably exceed our appetite (considering 
both inherent and residual impact) and cause 
material harm to the Group.

Some risks that may be unknown at present, 
as well as other risks that are currently regarded 
as immaterial and therefore not detailed here, 
could turn out to be material in the future. The 
principal risks are reviewed and amended to 
reflect changing knowledge, understanding 
and assessment, including considering 
whether an emerging risk should be 
recorded, instead, as a principal risk. 

The current principal risks that the Group is 
aware that it is facing are summarised in the 
diagram and described on the following pages. 
The descriptions indicate the potential areas 
of impact on the Group’s strategy; the time-
horizon and probability of the risk; the principal 
activities that are in place to mitigate and 
manage such risks; the committees that 
provide second line of defence oversight; 
changes in the level of risk during the course 
of the year; and link to further relevant 
information in this report. 

A summary of the Group’s principal risks 
including an update of changes during the 
period and activity during the year, is provided 
below. The principal risks remain the same as 
reported in the 2022 Annual Report but, as 
mentioned earlier, the development plan 
execution risk has been slightly amended 
and renamed ‘Development and Construction 
Execution’. The impact and probability of each 
risk has not changed in the last year and the 
residual risk for each (after factoring in 
mitigations) remains within appetite.

Change in 2023:  
No change 

Current year activity
The uncertain geopolitical and 
macroeconomic outlook has continued 
to cause volatility in the capital markets 
and reduced liquidity in the property 
investment market. 

In response, we have continued to perform 
economic outlook assessments regularly 
and have ensured that portfolio strategy 
consequences are appropriately linked 
(see separate principal risk). We are therefore 
prepared to withstand these pressures even 
if they persist across the countries we 
operate in for some time. 

1   Macroeconomic impact on market cycle
The property market is cyclical in nature 
and there is a continuous risk that the 
Group could either misread or fail to 
react appropriately to the changing 
property market, cost of finance or wider 
macroeconomic and geopolitical conditions. 
This could result in the adoption of an 
inappropriate strategy or the ability to deliver 
a strategy being inhibited, and consequential 
impact on property performance and 
shareholder value.

Mitigations 
The Executive Committee, Investment 
Committee and ultimately the Board monitor 
the property market cycle on a continual 
basis and adapt the Group’s investment 
and divestment stance in response to 
experienced and anticipated changing 
market conditions.

Multiple, diverse investment and occupier 
market intelligence is regularly reviewed 
and considered, both from internal ‘on the 
ground’ sources and from independent 
external sources.

Upside and downside scenarios are 
incorporated into Investment Committee 
papers to assess the impact of differing 
market conditions and to inform our portfolio 
strategy (see separate principal risk).

Change in 2023:  
No change 

Regular analysis enables the portfolio to be 
correctly positioned in terms of location and 
asset type, and to retain the right mix of core 
and opportunity assets. The annual asset 
planning exercise provides a bottom-up 
assessment of the performance and 
potential for all existing assets to determine 
where to invest capital and to identify assets 
for disposal. ESG credentials are playing an 
increasingly significant role in transactional 
considerations.

Policies are in place to govern the evaluation, 
due diligence process, approval, execution 
and subsequent review of investment 
activity. Investment hurdle rates are regularly 
reappraised taking into account estimates of 
our weighted average cost of capital. 

Current year activity
The Group’s approach to portfolio 
management and capital allocation remains 
disciplined and responsive to opportunities 
that arise, as detailed in the Investment 
and Development updates sections. We 
continue to review our portfolio and maintain 
appropriate investment criteria and hurdle 
rates to ensure we remain resilient to 
macroeconomic uncertainty. 

2   Portfolio strategy and execution
The Group’s Total Property and/or 
Shareholder Returns could underperform 
in absolute or relative terms as a result of an 
inappropriate portfolio strategy. This could 
be caused by:

 – Unexpected macroeconomic factors;
 – Incorrect or ineffective capital allocation 

decisions;

 – Poor or incorrect market or asset level 
assumptions including disruptions, for 
example from changing occupier and 
customer needs, technological 
developments and innovation;

 – Inaccurate modelling or forecasting;
 – Increased competition for our assets or 

target customers; and/or

 – Lack of appropriate procedures and 
inadequate due diligence resulting in 
lengthy, onerous or costly transactions 
and missed opportunities.

Mitigations
The Group’s portfolio strategy is subject to 
regular review by the Board in order to 
consider the desired shape of the portfolio, 
so as to meet the Group’s overall strategy 
and to determine our response to changing 
opportunities and market conditions.

The Group’s approach to capital allocation is 
informed by comprehensive asset plans and 
independent external assessments of market 
conditions and forecasts. Major capital 
investment and disposal decisions are 
subject to Board approval in line with 
portfolio strategy. Locally-based property 
investment and operational teams provide 
market intelligence and use their networks to 
source attractive opportunities. They are 
overseen by UK and CE Heads of Investment.

Change in 2023:  
No change 

Current year activity
The heightened geopolitical uncertainty 
(including the ongoing conflict in Ukraine 
and the Middle East) has exacerbated global 
macroeconomic volatility. This economic 
backdrop continues to cause a degree of 
uncertainty to the Group’s operations and 
stakeholders. 

The Group maintains a robust financing and 
portfolio strategy in order to be well 
positioned and flexible in response to major 
events/business disruption. The Board and 
other committees remain vigilant and 
responsive in managing the mitigation of 
risks as they evolve. Working groups are set 
up, as required and often at short notice, to 
collate and align the Group’s response in an 
agile fashion as issues arise. These groups 
report directly to the Executive Committee.

4   Health and safety
A health and safety incident may occur 
which involves harm to an individual or loss 
of life. This may be due to the failure of 
management processes, failure of a building 
or other physical asset, or negligence of a 
third-party. Furthermore, the Group may 
breach relevant legislation and fail to provide 
suitable employee support. This may 
consequentially result in litigation, fines, 
serious reputational damage and a negative 
impact on employees. 

Mitigations
The Group operates an active health 
and safety management system, with a 
particular focus on the quality of and 
compliance with good health and safety 
practice of all our suppliers.

A published health and safety policy is 
supported by site inspections of existing 
assets (and potential new assets), as part of 
proactive management, and development 
project inspections in line with SEGRO’s 
Health and Safety Construction Standard.

Principal risks continued

3   Major event/business disruption
Unexpected global, regional or national 
events may result in severe adverse 
disruption to SEGRO, such as sustained 
asset value or revenue impairment, solvency 
or covenant stress, liquidity or business 
continuity challenges. A global event or 
business disruptor may include, but is not 
limited to, a global financial crisis, health 
pandemic, power/water shortages, weather-
related event, war or civil unrest, acts of 
terrorism, cyber-attack or other IT disruption. 
Events may be singular or cumulative, and 
lead to acute/systemic issues in the business 
and/or operating environment.

Mitigations
The Group positions itself to withstand a 
global event and business disruption through 
its financing strategy (see separate principal 
risk); portfolio strategy (see separate principal 
risk) including holding a diverse set of 
property assets; staying close to customers 
to understand their changing needs; holding 
insurance; strong customer base; 
organisational resilience of the workforce; 
and detailed business continuity and disaster 
recovery plans. Going concern and viability 
is assessed through a detailed, bottom-up, 
medium-term planning process including a 
business stress test and downside scenarios.

Specialist employees, under the oversight 
of our Technology Committee, continue to 
ensure the resilience and security of our 
technology using controls, training, testing 
and audits. We maintain suitable processes 
and controls in respect of business 
continuity and IT disaster recovery. We use 
third parties to supplement internal expertise 
when testing our resilience to a cyber-attack.

SEGRO has a zero-tolerance approach to 
poor health and safety and continues to 
work closely with our suppliers and health 
and safety consultants to increase 
understanding and implementation of 
SEGRO’s requirements.

The Health and Safety Committee develops 
and manages the implementation of Health 
and Safety policies, reviews the outcomes of 
the Health and Safety Working Group as well 
as any other health and safety matters. 
The Health and Safety Working Group is 
responsible for the implementation of, 
and compliance with the Health and Safety 
Policy and Safety Management System. It 
undertakes continuous monitoring of health 
and safety practices, including incidents, 
inspections and training tracked across the 
Group. Legal guidance and further support 
is provided through local health and safety 
consultants and lawyers who provide 
regulatory assurance support to the 
Group alongside our internal expertise.

Current year activity
The health and safety of the workforce 
remains a key priority in locations where we 
operate, including when working away from 
the office. We have continued to expand our 
wellbeing activities with employees. We have 
closely monitored our development sites 
with in-person inspections, in local language, 
in order to ensure a safe and compliant 
working environment and detailed further on 
page 41. This risk is expected to remain a key 
focus going forward.

Current year activity
Our Responsible SEGRO framework 
continues to outline our strategy to reduce 
our corporate and customer carbon 
emissions and embodied carbon and is 
underpinned by minimum requirements set 
out in our Mandatory Sustainability policy. 
This risk has increasing prominence each 
year and we expect this to continue. See 
page 73 for details of further actions 
during 2023. 

5   Environmental sustainability and climate change
There is a risk that we fail to anticipate and 
respond to the impact of both physical and 
transitional risks from climate change on 
our business as well as changes in climate-
related regulatory reporting. The likelihood 
of increased severity and unpredictability of 
weather-related events may result in more 
frequent and/or prolonged damage to our 
buildings causing disruption and increased 
costs to SEGRO and our customers. Non-
compliance with changing laws, regulations, 
policies, taxation and obligations cause loss 
of value to the Group. Not keeping pace with 
social attitudes and customer behaviours 
and preferences whereby SEGRO may need 
to alter the design and build and/or energy 
provision of their assets could additionally 
cause reputational damage and reduce the 
attractiveness and value of our assets. 

Climate-related risks, their time horizon 
and their management and mitigation 
are detailed further on pages 71 to 73.

Mitigations
The Responsible SEGRO framework sets out 
our corporate responsibility strategy, as well 
as medium and long-term commitments. 
Our dedicated Sustainability team is in place 
to support Group and local teams and share 
updates on legal and regulatory changes 
and best practice, as advised by a range 
of external expert advisors. Each significant 
investment appraisal includes an assessment 
of climate-related risk and other 
considerations such as measures taken 
to increase energy efficiency and reduce 
carbon emissions. A climate resilience study 
has been undertaken to assess the medium 
and long-term physical risks to our portfolio 
as detailed further on page 71.

Principal risks continued

6   Development and construction execution
The Group has an extensive current 
programme and future pipeline of 
developments which brings the 
following risks: 

 – Cost over-runs on larger, more complex 
projects, for example, due to contractor 
default or poor performance and 
management;

 – Increased construction costs or over-

optimistic appraisals leading to reduced 
or uneconomic development yields;

 – Above-appetite exposure to non-income 

producing assets, reducing returns;

 – Below-appetite land holdings restricting 

opportunities; and

 – Additional costs, reputation damage, 

health and safety exposure or regulatory 
breach due to building defect or 
deleterious materials in buildings.

Mitigations
Our appetite for exposure to non-income 
producing assets (including land, 
infrastructure and speculative developments) 
is monitored closely, for example, when 
acquisition decisions are being made by the 
Investment Committee. The development 
programme remains weighted towards 
pre-let opportunities. We retain a high level 
of optionality in our future development 
programme including at the point of land 
acquisition, commitment to infrastructure 
and commitment to building. 

The risk of cost overruns or supply chain 
issues is, at least in part, mitigated by using 
our experienced development teams and a 
panel of trusted advisors and contractors, 
and typically using fixed price contracts. We 
work collaboratively with our contractors and 
remain in constant dialogue to identify 
possible issues and possible solutions 
ahead of time.

Change in 2023:  
Increased

1

The risk of contractor default is mitigated by 
using a diversified selection of companies 
which have been through a rigorous 
onboarding process and closely monitoring 
their financial strength. Our short 
development lead-times enable a quick 
response to changing market conditions.

Internally, oversight is maintained via the 
Construction Steering Group, who link in 
with the Health and Safety team and manage 
challenges like defects or deleterious 
materials in our buildings. Additionally, our 
Partnership Development team engages 
with stakeholders as part of SEGRO’s social 
responsibilities and also support planning 
processes. 

Current year activity
As market conditions have remained 
challenging, as detailed in the Portfolio 
Strategy Execution risk above, we have 
maintained clear investment criteria. We 
continue to work closely with our contractors 
and were able to react with agility and 
responsiveness when a UK contractor 
faced difficulties during the year. Going 
forward, with an expected continuing volatile 
economic environment, similar pressures 
are likely to continue so we must carefully 
monitor the risks while we balance the needs 
of our contractors and customers. We have 
investigated our exposure to defective and 
deleterious materials in response to issues 
as they have arisen.

7   Financing strategy
The Group could suffer an acute liquidity 
or solvency crisis, financial loss or financial 
distress as a result of a failure in the design 
or execution of its financing strategy.

Such an event may be caused by a number 
of factors including a failure to obtain debt or 
equity funding (for example, due to market 
disruption or rating downgrade); having an 
inappropriate debt structure (including 
leverage level, debt maturity, interest rate 
or currency exposure); poor forecasting; 
defaulting on loan agreements as a result 
of a breach of financial or other covenants; 
or counterparty default. 

Change in 2023:  
No change 

Current year activity
Despite uncertainty caused by the external 
geopolitical macroeconomic environment 
the Group can still access financial markets 
as seen by our funding activity (as detailed in 
the Financial review). The Group (including its 
largest joint venture SELP) maintains a 
meaningful presence in the Euro bond 
market as well as in the sterling bond and US 
Private Placement markets leaving us well 
positioned financially to fund activity in 
line with our strategy priorities. The Group 
continues to use fixed rate debt and 
relevant derivatives to mitigate against 
the risk of interest rates increasing both 
now and going forward.

Mitigations
The Group’s financing strategy is aligned 
with our long-term business strategy, the 
Medium-Term Plan and our risk appetite. 
Our Treasury policy defines key policy 
parameters and controls to support 
execution of the strategy.

The Group regularly reviews its changing 
financing requirements in light of 
opportunities and market conditions and 
maintains a good long-term relationship 
with a wide range of finance providers.

Funding requirements and liquidity are 
closely monitored and there is substantial 
headroom on all our financial covenants.

8   Legal, political and regulatory
The Group could fail to anticipate legal, 
political, tax or other regulatory changes, 
leading to litigation, censure, penalties 
and fines. This would result in a significant 
unforeseen financial or reputational impact.

In general, legal, regulatory and tax matters 
present medium- to long-term risks with a 
medium likelihood of causing significant 
harm to the Group.

Political risks could impact business 
confidence and conditions in the short 
and longer terms.

Mitigations
Legal and regulatory risks are reviewed 
regularly by internal specialists (e.g. Legal, 
Health and Safety, Sustainability) as well as 
the Executive Committee. Corporate heads 
of function regularly consult with external 
advisers, attend industry and specialist 
briefings, and sit on key industry bodies 
such as EPRA and the British Property 
Federation, as well as maintaining 
relationships with their peers. 

We continue to closely monitor the taxation 
regulations with our advisors to ensure 
changes which may impact the Group or 
our customers are identified and addressed, 
in a timely fashion. The Group’s tax 
compliance is managed by an experienced 
internal tax team. REIT and SIIC tax regime 
compliance is demonstrated at least 
bi-annually. Compliance with joint venture 
and associated shareholder agreements 
is managed by experienced property 
operations, finance and legal employees. 
Where necessary, comprehensive 
governance and compliance arrangements 
are in place, including specific management 
operating manuals.

Change in 2023:  
Increased 

Current year activity
The legal and regulatory environment 
remains dynamic with an ever-increasing 
number of new laws and regulations. 

Tax authorities are continuing to update 
regulations and SEGRO is working closely 
with advisors to respond to this enhanced 
reporting environment.

In addition, the current economic situation 
means we are alert to an increased risk of 
unethical behaviour making our Code of 
Business Conduct and Ethics, with the 
accompanying training, even more 
important.

9   People and talent
The performance of the business could be 
impaired due to SEGRO:

 – Not having the appropriate culture, 
organisational structure, policies 
and procedures or skilled people;
 – Failing to attract, motivate, retain and 
develop diverse talent as part of our 
Nurturing talent ambition due to 
inappropriate reward and recognition, 
learning and development, performance 
management, hybrid working practices 
or social policies; and

 – Failing to prepare adequate talent 
management or succession plans. 

Mitigations
We review succession planning and key 
person risk at least annually with the 
Executive Committee and the Board. We 
review compensation in our largest countries 
annually with a third party to ensure that we 
have appropriate salary ranges in place. We 
have a variety of incentive tools that can be 
applied flexibly during the year to retain at 
risk, talented employees and these are 
reviewed by the Remuneration Committee. 
We have created a people planning process 
with senior leaders so that we can proactively 
plan for resourcing and development needs. 
We regularly review the hiring, and appraisal, 
succession planning and talent process as 
well as undertaking employee engagement 
surveys to understand employee sentiment.

Our ambition is to build a more sustainable 
business, a key feature of which is to become 
more inclusive and diverse, as set out in our 
Responsible SEGRO framework. We continue 
to use a programme of work which is being 
guided by the National Equality Standard 
framework. The Human Resources team 
work with our Partnership Development team 
on wider Responsible SEGRO initiatives like 
employment projects.

Change in 2023:  
No change 

Current year activity
The talent market continues to be relatively 
benign and attrition levels are within appetite 
and lower than the previous year. We have 
restructured our organisation in 2023 and, 
with a new Executive Committee and 
Leadership Team in place, we are well 
progressed with embedding the changes. 
The majority of appointments were internal, 
showing the strength of our talent and 
succession pipeline.

We have further developed our Values and 
introduced clear Behaviours for all 
colleagues. We continue to review our 
employment proposition in each country to 
ensure that we are able to attract and retain 
strong talent.

Change in 2023:  
No change 

Current year activity
During the period we continue to have 
enhanced engagement with our customers 
in light of the volatile economic conditions 
and have continued to consider customer 
concentration risks. Our customer 
development team has grown over the year 
to support the customer engagement and 
development work.

We have introduced workflow tools which 
increase the automation and transparency 
of the lettings and asset management 
processes.

We work closely with our supply chain and 
have undertaken a review of key suppliers 
to ensure suitable alternatives are in place 
should one fail. Critical suppliers include 
those contractors and, by association their 
sub-contractors (detailed more fully in the 
Development and Construction Execution 
risk) and IT suppliers. Furthermore, we 
continue to ensure our suppliers are 
paid promptly.

10   Operational delivery
The Group could suffer an operational failure 
such as: major customer default; supply 
chain, reporting or treasury failure; 
inappropriate or inaccurate valuation 
reporting; erroneous lease execution 
or poor customer insight and retention. 

This could cause a range of negative impacts 
including reputational damage and financial 
impact from fines, unexpected costs and 
lost revenue.

Mitigations
The Group maintains a strong focus on 
Operational excellence. The Executive 
Committee and Joint Operating Group 
regularly monitor the range of risks to 
property management, organisational 
effectiveness and customer management. 
Each operational area is overseen by a strong 
and skilled internal team.

We ensure our customer base is broad and, 
as far as possible, has a strong covenant 
which we closely monitor as well as 
customer concentration metrics. We 
undertake senior customer stakeholder 
interviews and an annual strategic customer 
survey which shapes our customer 
engagement plans. 

We regularly review our policies and 
procedures to ensure they remain 
appropriate as well as checking 
compliance through internal and external 
audits. We also maintain adequate 
insurances across the Group.

Viability Statement

Confirmation of viability
The Directors have considered the Group’s 
prospects, including reference to the Group’s 
principal risks, to form the basis of our 
assessment of short-term and longer-term 
viability. The process for conducting this 
assessment is summarised in the Audit 
Committee’s report on page 100.

Plan. They also provide forecasts on potential 
development activity from the existing land 
bank, refurbishment of existing assets 
(including with regard to current and 
expected environmental legislation - see 
page 68 for more detail on climate-related 
financial disclosure) and their expectations of 
acquisitions and disposals.

The Directors confirm that they have a 
reasonable expectation that the Group will 
be able to continue in operation and has 
adequate resources to meet its liabilities 
as they fall due over the next five years.

The assessment of viability is split into 
short-term and longer-term time horizons. 

Short-term assessment
The short-term assessment included 
consideration of our going concern 
assessment (see page 50) and a review of key 
controls around liquidity management. 

Management regularly reviews the Group’s 
liquidity position and operating results. In 
addition, key treasury metrics including 
financial covenants are reviewed by the 
Executive Committee on a quarterly basis.

Longer-term assessment
The period assessed for the longer term is 
the same five-year time horizon as covered by 
the Group’s annual rolling five-year strategic 
financial plan. This is considered to be the 
optimum balance between our need to plan 
for the long term, and the progressively 
unreliable nature of forecasting in later years, 
particularly given the historically cyclical 
nature of the property industry. 

The strategic financial plan comprises a 
five-year Medium-Term Plan (MTP) and 
an Asset Plan, within the context of 
macroeconomic and property market 
outlooks provided by external advisers 
and SEGRO expertise.

The central corporate team and each of the 
Business Units provide a forecast for revenue 
and costs for the business for the MTP and for 
total returns from each asset for the Asset 

This process generates a five-year forecast for 
capital expenditure and associated funding 
requirements, net income, net asset values 
and cash flows. The Directors confirm that 
they have no reason to expect a step-change 
in the Group’s viability immediately following 
the five-year period assessed. 

In addition to the robust ongoing assessment 
and management of the risks facing the 
Group, as already set out in this section, the 
Group has stress tested the MTP. The stress 
tests consider the risks that could either 
individually, or in aggregate, threaten the 
viability of the Group, represented by the 
breach of key financial ratios and covenants. 
The risks are based on an individual event or 
combination of events occurring, using 
historic data (for example the acute property 
valuation decline in 2007–2009) and forward-
looking probability analysis where available. 
The process for conducting the Group’s 
assessment is the responsibility of the 
Chief Financial Officer and is overseen 
by the Audit Committee.

The main stress tests carried out in 2023, 
along with their potential impacts, were: 

 – Zero market rental (ERV) growth 

throughout the period: the main impacts 
are lower asset values and Adjusted NAV 
throughout the period, with earnings 
growth reduced in later years.

 – A scenario where, in addition to the 

previous scenario, occupier demand for 
new space slows, manifested in reduced 
take-up of standing assets and 
development levels: the main impacts are 
reduced earnings growth throughout the 
period (primarily from fewer development 
completions), while gearing levels benefit 
from lower capital expenditure. 

 – A scenario where, in addition to the two 

 – A sustained interruption to the Group’s 

previous scenarios, capital value decline, 
manifested through a 100bp increase in 
yields: the main impacts are lower asset 
values throughout the period, causing 
leverage to rise.

 – Impact of rising interest rates, manifested 

in a reverse stress test to assess what 
level of interest rates would cause a 
covenant breach: a rise of at least five 
percentage points in the Group’s average 
interest rate towards the middle of the 
period, assuming current levels of fixed 
rate interest and protection from our 
interest rate caps. 

Reverse stress testing was also undertaken 
over the period under review. None of the 
financial covenants were breached during 
the five-year period, with gearing remaining 
comfortably below 160 per cent and interest 
cover well above 1.25 times. 

Property valuations would need to fall by 
around 44 per cent from their 31 December 
2023 values to reach the gearing covenant 
threshold of 160 per cent. A 44 per cent fall in 
property values would equate to an LTV ratio 
of approximately 62 per cent. Net property 
rental income would need to fall by around 54 
per cent from 2023 levels to reach the interest 
cover covenant threshold of 1.25 times.

Outside the MTP, the following viability risks 
were also considered:

 – A 10 per cent movement in foreign 

exchange rates: due to long-term hedging 
arrangements in place foreign exchange 
movements are not considered a material 
risk to the Group’s viability.

 – An inability to refinance maturing debt: 

the nearest material refinancing requirement 
is in 2025 (SEGRO and SELP) so the risk to 
the Group’s viability is towards the middle 
and end of the period. We tend to refinance 
long-term debt around 12 months in 
advance of maturities and, should 
relationship bank lending, equity and bond 
markets be unavailable, options to raise 
liquidity include reductions in capital 
expenditure and increased asset disposals.

business continuity: a qualitative 
assessment of SEGRO’s ability to operate 
with compromised workspace and IT 
structure is carried out each year, with 
regular live scenario tests undertaken by key 
members of staff with the help of external 
advisers to ensure responses are rehearsed 
and mitigations are in place. No material 
threat to SEGRO’s viability was identified.
 – Climate-related threats to the portfolio: 
working with Savills Earth, we conducted a 
climate resilience study to assess the acute 
and chronic physical risks to our portfolio 
spanning a period from current day to 2100. 
Heat and drought stress present as the 
most significant emerging chronic risks but 
assets at risk represent only between 2 and 
3 per cent of the portfolio rental value. 
Therefore, we do not consider such risks 
to be a threat to the viability of the Group. 

The scenarios set out are hypothetical and 
severe for the purpose of creating outcomes 
which have the ability to threaten the viability 
of the Group. We also note that, in the event of 
a severe threat to liquidity, various options are 
available to the Group to maintain viability. 
These options include reduction of any 
non-committed capital expenditure and 
acquisitions, selling assets, or reducing cash 
dividends (including the use of scrip 
dividends). 

We are optimistic about the longer-term 
prospects of our business based on our 
prime, sustainable portfolio, high levels of 
occupancy let to a diverse range of customers 
on long average lease lengths, backed by 
strong balance sheet with long debt maturity 
and no near-term refinancing requirements. 
These are supported by the long-term trends 
in the warehouse and industrial real estate 
sector of greater e-commerce penetration of 
retail sales, supply chain reconfiguration and 
increasing urbanisation across Europe (see 
Market Overview on page 12 for more 
information).

Streamlined energy and carbon reporting

We are proud of the part that our buildings 
play in supporting our customers to achieve 
efficiencies and carbon reductions 
throughout their supply chain, and this is 
reflected in SEGRO’s comprehensive 
approach to carbon management. SEGRO’s 
Scope 1 and 2 emissions (our ‘corporate’ 
emissions) account for less than 1 per cent 
of our total (Scopes 1 to 3) carbon emissions. 
Customer direct energy use in our buildings 
totalled 251,058 tonnes of CO2e, equating to 
39 per cent of total emissions (57 per cent 
including upstream fuel and energy-related 
activities outside their and our control) and 
the carbon emissions related to the 
construction of new buildings (known as 
embodied carbon) represent a further 
31 per cent (196,855 tonnes). This is why 
SEGRO’s two key carbon reduction metrics 
are our corporate and customer emissions 
and our embodied carbon intensity, and why 
our performance on these two metrics is 
incorporated into the annual bonus of all 
SEGRO employees. 

We have made good progress on both 
measures. We have delivered a 7 per cent 
absolute reduction in our corporate and 
customer emissions in 2023, despite growing 
the portfolio area by almost 5 per cent, which 
means we are on track to achieve our 
science-based target (see the Metrics and 
Targets within our Climate-related financial 
reporting disclosure on pages 74 to 75). This 
reflects our regional teams’ efforts to support 
and work with our customers to deliver 
carbon reductions. More of our customers 
are sharing their energy data with us than 
ever before, meaning we have actual data 
covering 81 per cent of our floor area 
(2022: 68 per cent) improving the accuracy 
of our emissions figures. 

We have also made further progress 
in cutting the carbon intensity of our 
development programme, improving 
the figure to 348 kg CO2e per sq m on 
developments completed over the past two 
years (2022: 353 kgCO2e). Our development 
teams and contractors have applied 
innovative approaches to materials and 
design to reduce the carbon intensity of our 
buildings across their full life cycle.

Streamlined energy and carbon reporting 
(SECR)
The SECR legislation only covers our 
corporate energy use which accounts for less 
than 1 per cent of SEGRO’s total emissions. For 
our full Scopes 1 to 3 carbon footprint, and all 
of the metrics we are tracking on our path to 
net-zero carbon, please see our Responsible 
SEGRO Report at www.segro.com/
responsible-segro. 

In line with best practice, we report both a 
‘market-based’ and ‘location-based’ figure for 
emissions from electricity consumption. The 
market-based approach incorporates 
SEGRO’s move towards low-carbon energy 
tariffs on its controlled space (largely its 
SEGRO-occupied offices, SEGRO-managed 
common parts and vacant space), whereas 
the ‘location-based’ approach uses national 
grid averages (see the notes to the table 
below for more on location/market).

assurance to ASAE3000.

Note: Responsible floor area can change significantly from year to year as it only relates to space under SEGRO’s 
control which, apart from space for our own use (e.g. our management offices), includes space vacant for a 
portion of the year. This is reflected in the low carbon intensity per square meter as empty buildings use very little 
energy.

*    The location-based approach to calculating Scope 2 emissions (emissions from electricity consumption) uses 
national grid average emissions factors which reflect the make-up of a country’s electricity supply between 
fossil fuels and renewables. SECR legislation requires that a location-based figure be reported. 

** The market-based approach to calculating Scope 2 emissions reflects the carbon intensity of the electricity 

tariffs procured by SEGRO.

We have chosen ‘responsible floor area’ as our 
intensity metric, which is all floor area with 
Scope 1 and 2 emissions in the reporting year. 

‘Total energy use’ covers electricity, fuels 
(including transport fuels) and district heating 
converted to kWh units. Our Responsible 
SEGRO Report, and a detailed description of 
our methodology, can be found at segro.com/
responsible-segro/reports-downloads. The 
2023 greenhouse gas emissions and energy 
use data above are for the period 1 October 
2022 to 30 September 2023 (2022: 1 October 
2021 to 30 September 2022). 

Reporting Methodology
The SECR figures above have been prepared 
in accordance with the GHG Protocol to 
discharge our regulatory obligation to report 
greenhouse gas emissions pursuant to 
section 7 of the Companies Act 2006 
(Strategic Report and Directors’ Report) 
Regulations 2013 and the Companies 
(Directors’ Report), and Limited Liability 
Partnerships (Energy and Carbon Report) 
Regulations 2018; the latter commonly 
referred to as Streamlined Energy and Carbon 
Reporting. 

We report our data using an operational 
control approach to define our organisational 
boundary and have reported emissions 
following both the location-based and 
market-based approach, using the IEA 
residual emission factors for any energy tariffs 
that are not low carbon.

Climate-related financial disclosures

As a leading owner, manager and developer 
of industrial and warehouse assets in Europe, 
our sustainability and financial strength is 
reliant upon an effective and rigorous risk 
management framework. Our properties 
span the UK and Continental Europe and are 
therefore exposed to a variety of effects from 
a changing climate. We believe that these 
climate-related risks, if unmitigated, present 
a threat to society as well as to our business 
operations and financial strength over the 
coming decades.

We have made good progress on our strategy 
to reduce the carbon intensity of our business, 
particularly reducing the embodied carbon 
intensity of our development activities and 
increasing our solar energy generation 
capacity. We have made further progress 
on increasing the visibility of our Scope 3 
customer emissions: in most leases, we have 
little or no legal right to be informed about 
such emissions, so progress in this area relies 
on adopting our 'green' lease clause on new 
lettings or persuading our customers to share 
their energy data. As at 31 December 2023, 
approximately 10 per cent of our space 
was covered by leases containing our 
green clause.

There have been no material changes to the 
nature of the business over the past twelve 
months which would require a review to our 
baseline metrics or future targets.

We believe this disclosure is consistent with
the recommendations and recommended
disclosures of the Task Force on Climate 
related Financial Disclosures (TCFD), including
the 'Guidance for All Sectors' and the specific 
guidance applicable to the 'Materials and 
Buildings' industry to the extent to which it is 
applicable to SEGRO's operations. It sets out 
how SEGRO incorporates climate-related risks 
and opportunities into governance, strategy, 
risk management, metrics and targets, and 
how we are responding to stakeholder 
expectations, national regulations and 
sector-wide best practice.

This is an area of constant evolution and we 
intend to continue improving the disclosure 
of our activity and performance. The material 
information and disclosure on climate impact 
is provided in this Annual Report but 
additional complementary information can be 
found in the 2023 Responsible SEGRO Report.

Governance
Governance plays a key contributing role to 
the effective delivery of strategy and SEGRO 
has a clear governance structure with a 
single Board comprising an independent 
Chair, six independent Non-Executive 
Directors and two Executive Directors. 

Board oversight of climate-related risks 
and opportunities
The Board is responsible for setting the 
strategic direction of the Company to ensure 
its long-term success which includes the 
delivery and integration of its eight strategic 
priorities, three of which relate to Responsible 
SEGRO, and their associated targets. 
Specifically, the Board has oversight of 
climate-related performance, risks and 
opportunities and takes into consideration all 
elements of Responsible SEGRO, including 
climate-related risks and opportunities, when 
reviewing and guiding on annual budget and 
long-term planning matters as well as major 
strategic and investment decisions.

The Board has access to advice relating to 
climate-related risks and opportunities from 
internal and external bodies including the 
in-house Sustainability Team, CBRE which 
values the portfolio, Longevity Partners as 
environmental and energy consultants and 
SLR Consulting as providers of partial 
assurance of Group environmental data, 
among others.

The Chief Executive has overall responsibility 
for the Responsible SEGRO strategic priorities. 
The Group Customer and Operations 
Director is responsible for climate-related 
risks and opportunities as they may relate 
to the portfolio.

The table on page 69 outlines the ways in 
which Board and Management Committees 
provide oversight for SEGRO’s climate 
change-related strategy and targets. 

Governance: action during 2023
 – The Board received updates on Responsible 
SEGRO actions from Group Customer and 
Operations Director and the Director of 
Sustainability, including progress on 
reducing carbon emissions, in addition to 
updates on specific projects including on an 
update to SEGRO’s Net-Zero Transition Plan;

 – The Board and Audit Committee received 
training from the Commercial Finance 
Director and Director of Sustainability on the 
introduction of new sustainability reporting 
requirements from the European 
Commission and the International 
Sustainability Standards Board and the 
progress SEGRO is making to introduce and 
integrate them throughout the business; and
 – The Remuneration Committee approved the 
targets relating to the Responsible SEGRO 
annual bonus metrics for Executive 
Directors and all employees, of which half 
are related to reducing carbon emissions 
throughout the business.

Strategy
As a long-term property owner, we need to 
ensure that our buildings are fit for purpose for 
the future. One of the ways we do this is to 
build adaptable buildings, suited to more than 
one customer. This ensures a longer lifespan 
for the building as well as reducing the risk of 
vacancy and future refurbishment costs.

The Responsible SEGRO framework sets out 
how we integrate environmental and social 
considerations into our corporate strategy 
through three strategic priorities. The first 
strategic priority sets out our approach to 
reducing carbon emissions from our business 
activities. This commitment includes Scope 1 
and 2 emissions and the material Scope 3 
emissions which are Capital Goods 
(embodied carbon from completed 
developments) and Downstream Leased 
Assets (largely corporate emissions and those 
from customers occupying our buildings). See 
the Responsible SEGRO Report at www.segro.
com for a full breakdown of our Scope 1, 2 
and 3 emissions.

Strategy: action during 2023
SEGRO completed a number of projects 
to mitigate climate-related transition risks:

 – We integrated our analysis of climate 

change physical risk, carried out in 2022, 
within our annual asset planning exercise 
and the investment process;

 – We conducted a full audit of our portfolio, 
identifying missing and expired Energy 
Performance Certificates, and taking action 
to understand why an EPC may be 
unavailable (primarily buildings nearing the 
end of their useful life which are to be 
redeveloped) or to commission refreshed 
EPCs to measure more accurately the 
energy efficiency of our portfolio and what 
investment is required to improve below-
average units; and

For this study, the physical risk from hazards 
under RCP 2.6 (less than 2ºC warming by 
2100), 4.5 (3ºC warming by 2100) and RCP 8.5 
(4-5ºC warming by 2100) were modelled on 
197 estates, covering 99 per cent of our 
owned or managed floor area (at 100 per 
cent) and rental value (based on SEGRO 
wholly-owned properties and its share of 
properties in joint ventures and associates). 

In summary, Heat and Drought Stress present 
as the most significant emerging chronic 
climate-related hazards across all three RCP 
scenarios, although assets exposed represent 
only between 2 and 3 per cent of rental value. 
In terms of change from current baselines, 
both of these hazards show potentially 
significant percentage increases indicating 
that asset adaptive measures likely to become 
more important in these areas. The absolute 
exposure risk to Drought Stress and Heat 
Stress is primarily concentrated in SEGRO’s 
Southern European portfolio, specifically our 
assets in Italy, Spain and southern France. 

 – We initiated a project with external 

consultants to refine our Net-Zero Transition 
Plan, taking advantage of the increased 
visibility of the carbon emissions from our 
business activities to inform a more accurate 
strategy and timeline for achieving net zero. 
We have also worked with external 
consultants to ensure that we comply with 
the requirements of the Corporate 
Sustainability Reporting Directive and EU 
Taxonomy comfortably before we become 
eligible to report them.

Identification of climate-related risks and 
opportunities over the short, medium and 
long term and their impact on SEGRO’s 
business, strategy and financial planning
Materiality analysis of physical risk
In 2022, working with Savills Sustainability in 
conjunction with climate change physical risk 
and scenario data from global reinsurer 
Munich Re, we have carried out a climate 
change physical risk study to assess the acute 
and chronic physical risks to our portfolio by 
geography, by Representative Concentration 
Policy (RCP) scenario and across four time 
horizons out to 2100. The full report from 
Savills is available at https://www.segro.com/

The table above shows the modelled climate

outcomes based on percentage of floor area 
and rental value at risk based on the worst-
case scenario (RCP 8.5, 2050) and the 
best-case scenario (RCP 2.6, 2050). Note that 
River Flood was not modelled under RCP 2.6 
given the limited expected impact compared 
to the current risk.

The assessment report and data above do 
not consider any asset specific development 
or refurbishment mitigation cycles. As part of 
our sustainable development objectives, 
assessments are carried out prior to 
development and adaptation measures, 
including but not limited to those listed 
below, are carried out accordingly.

Materiality analysis of transition risk
We work with our stakeholders (primarily 
our customers, suppliers and investors) 
and advisers (primarily our valuers and 
environmental consultants) to monitor, 
assess and prioritise emerging climate 
change transition risks. We judge 
materiality with reference to two main risks: 
the environmental and reputational risk of 
failing to meet our carbon emission reduction 
targets and the financial risk of building 
redundancy or being unable legally to 
lease our buildings.

Risk
Drought Stress and Heat 
Stress (see R1 below)

Adaptation Techniques

–  Rainwater harvesting systems for internal building use and landscaping
–  Thermal modelling undertaken and orientation/window positioning of the building 
reviewed, including external planting to provide shade, brise soleil, louvres, window 
tinting

–  Onsite renewable energy generation installed to manage additional cooling 

requirements

River Flood and 
Precipitation Stress (see 
R2 below)

–  Flood risk assessment to be carried out on development or retrospectively
–  Sustainable urban drainage systems
–  Retention schemes – ponds/basins

We believe that there are three main climate 
change transition risks with the potential to 
impact the Group financially:

 – Environmental legislation: legislation 

surrounding the sustainability performance 
of commercial and non-commercial real 
estate is likely to tighten in future as 
governments pursue their commitments 
under the Paris Agreement. We expect this 
to take the form of regulations but also 
increasingly some form of carbon tax 
to encourage the use of lower carbon 
materials and processes. The primary 
financial risk relates to our ability to rent 
out our buildings if they fall below emerging 
environmental legislation. This drives our 
determination to improve the energy 
performance of our portfolio both in new 
development and through refurbishment, 
measured primarily by increasing the 
floorspace rated B or better by Energy 
Performance Certificates.

 – Customer behaviours and preferences: 
our customers, particularly our largest, 
international customers, increasingly 
expect their premises to display high levels 
of energy efficiency. Energy efficiency not 
only reduces the operating costs of the 
building but also helps them with their 
own environmental and carbon reduction 
targets. The primary financial risk relates to 
the appeal of our buildings to customers if 
they are below acceptable levels of energy 
efficiency and wider environmental 
sustainability. We are addressing this risk 
through improving the EPC ratings of our 
portfolio, increasing the amount of on-site 
renewable energy generation, and 
improving the sustainability credentials 
of our developments.

 – Access to capital: investors are increasingly 

discriminating between investment 
opportunities based on sustainability 
credentials. The primary financial risk relates 
to reduced availability and higher cost of 
capital for companies which do not show 
strong performance and/or progress in this 
area. Under our Green Finance Framework, 
we have issued €2.9 billion of Green ‘Use 
of Proceeds’ bonds in SEGRO and SELP 
since 2021.

Applying the analysis to strategic planning
In terms of decision making, we consider 
climate-related issues within the following 
time horizons:

 – Short term: up to 12 months, in line with the 
budget setting carried out annually in the 
autumn;

 – Medium term: up to 5 years, in line with the 
Medium-Term Planning carried out annually 
in the autumn;

 – Long term: up to 10 years, in line with capital 
investment appraisal cash flows. We assume 
a 60-year life span for our newly-developed 
properties.

Given the relatively small element of the 
portfolio exposed to the physical risks, and 
the fact that our Southern European portfolio 
contains some of our newest buildings, we 
believe the overall financial risk to be 
immaterial and longer term. However, as part 
of our active asset management and based 
on the scenario analysis work above, we 
expect to improve our visibility of the asset-
level risks and opportunities and their 
associated financial implications. We 
recognise that this is an area for improvement 
within our climate-related financial disclosure.

Risk Horizon
Medium-term risks: 
 – Higher operating costs for customers and 
SEGRO from increased cooling demand

 – Greater investment in cooling measures inside 

and outside buildings

 – Reduced wellbeing and productivity of workforce
Short-term risks: 
 – Increased insurance, maintenance and repair 

costs from growing flood risk

 – Increased investment in drainage solutions and 

flood defences

 – Negative impact on asset valuations

Medium-term risks: 
In the UK, the MEES (Minimum Energy Efficiency 
Standard) regulations require buildings to achieve a 
certain standard of energy performance for them 
to be leased. At a high level, by 2030, properties 
will need to achieve a minimum Energy 
Performance Certificate rating of ‘B’ before they 
can be leased.

Similar legislation is emerging across a number of 
our other markets. The aim of our corporate 
strategy is to be compliant with such legislation 
well in advance of the deadlines.
Short- and medium-term risks: 
Customers expect to operate their properties 
efficiently. There is growing evidence of rental 
discount associated with buildings which display 
poor sustainability credentials.

The Sustainable Finance Disclosure Regulation 
(SFDR) imposes mandatory ESG disclosure 
obligations for asset managers and other financial 
markets participants.

Corporate Strategy
Mitigations integrated into developments and 
refurbishments in properties in high-risk 
geographies, including water conservation through 
recycling of rain water and measures to reflect heat 
and improve shading externally.

Financial Planning
Measures incorporated into financial appraisals of 
developments and refurbishments.

All new investments (both acquisitions and 
developments) incorporate flood risk assessments.

Measures incorporated into financial appraisals of 
acquisitions, refurbishments and developments.

Measures taken to mitigate flood risk include 
rainwater recycling and landscaping to minimise 
run-off, and balancing pools to cater for run-off 
from hard-standing areas.
Properties which are unrated or have an EPC below 
B are expected to be upgraded when they become 
vacant (approximately 64 per cent of such 
buildings in the UK are expected to be vacated by 
2030).

New developments and refurbishments 
incorporate sustainability technologies suited to 
their use and location, including (but not limited to) 
solar panels (for customer use), electric vehicle 
charging facilities, low-carbon heating and 
initiatives to promote local biodiversity and 
worker wellbeing.
We have established a Green Finance Framework 
which complies with International Capital Market 
Association and the Loan Market Association 
principles. The Framework sets out the investment 
criteria for deploying and allocating the proceeds 
of green finance instruments, including in energy 
efficient and low-carbon buildings.

Valuers review assets for short-term physical risks 
as part of twice-yearly appraisals.

Capex associated with refurbishment, 
including improving energy efficiency, is 
factored into short-term budgets and the five-year 
Medium-Term Plan. 

The estimated cost to upgrade the UK estate to EPC 
rating ‘B’ or better is approximately £66 million by 
2030, much of which will be absorbed within 
normal course of refurbishment capex. The figure 
has reduced primarily due to work carried out 
during 2023 to improve low-grade EPC premises 
to at least B-grade.

Capex associated with refurbishment, including 
improving energy efficiency, is factored into 
short-term budgets and the five-year Medium-Term 
Plan.

When a decision is made to raise capital, 
consideration is given to whether the issue should 
fall under the Green Finance Framework (e.g. a 
Green Bond).

Corporate Strategy
PV panels are installed on roofs where feasible and 
all new developments are constructed with roofs to 
support PV panels if a full array is not installed 
during construction. Energy saving from solar PV is 
an important element in creating net-zero carbon 
buildings on a full life basis.
We are reviewing more strategic use of estate 
landscaping to plant additional trees and shrubs to 
act as long-term carbon capture while also 
improving the local environment for the benefit of 
our customers and communities.
All new developments require installation of EV 
chargers in at least 20 per cent of parking spaces.

Financial Planning
The costs of solar panels are incorporated in new 
development and refurbishment capex. Revenues 
and cost savings, which are currently a small 
proportion of overall revenues, are split between 
being incorporated into rents and separately 
identified.
The cost of landscaping is incorporated within 
development and refurbishment capex and is 
immaterial compared to overall spend.

The cost of EV chargers sufficient to comply 
with the SEGRO Mandatory Sustainability Policy 
is factored into all development and refurbishment 
appraisals.

Risk management
Climate-related risks are identified and 
assessed using our risk management 
framework set out on page 56. Principal risks 
are defined as those which could intolerably 
exceed our risk appetite, considering both 
inherent and residual impact, and cause 
material harm to the Group.

Engagement with stakeholders
We engage with our stakeholders throughout 
the year on many different topics, although 
the subjects of climate change and the need 
to reduce corporate and customer GHG 
emissions have featured more prominently 
over the past year. More detail on our 
stakeholder engagement, including on 
climate-related matters, can be found on 
pages 18 and 19.

Identifying and assessing  
climate-related risks
Although climate change presents 
opportunities as well as risks for SEGRO, 
Climate Change is identified as a Principal Risk 
within Environmental Sustainability and 
Climate Change on the Risk Register. Climate-
related risks are also considered within other 
principal risks including Political and 
Regulatory, Development plan execution 
and Major event/Business disruption.

For each risk, our Risk Register tracks:

 – Description of the risk and the potential 

effects;

 – Identifies the Executive Director with overall 

ownership and the Risk Manager 
responsible for monitoring and managing 
the risk;

 – An annual probability and potential impact, 

to enable prioritisation;

 – Mitigations in place as well as the owner 

of each mitigating action.

At the current time and based on asset-level 
scenario analysis, no material capital 
expenditure has been identified beyond 
normal course development and 
refurbishment costs associated with 
mitigating assets in high-risk locations 
against climate change-related risks. Such 
risks, and related capital expenditure, are 
considered as part of the annual asset 
planning process associated with the 
five-year Medium-Term Plan.

Managing and mitigating  
climate-related risks
Our process for recognising, monitoring and 
mitigating Principal Risks, including climate-
related risks, is set out on page 58 of the 
Annual Report. The Board has overall 
responsibility for ensuring that risk is 
effectively and consistently managed 
across the Group. 

The Audit Committee monitors the 
effectiveness of the Group’s risk management 
process on behalf of the Board. In every year, 
the Audit Committee twice reviews the 
process of how the Group Risk Register has 
been compiled and the Board twice reviews 
the principal and emerging risks. The Board 
also reviews and approves the Group’s risk 
appetite at least once every year. 

In its Responsible SEGRO framework, SEGRO 
has committed itself to achieving science-
based targets for reducing Scope 1, 2 and 3 
emissions (including corporate and customer 
emissions) to ensure compliance with a less 
than 1.5ºC increase in global temperatures by 
2050. A key risk surrounding these targets is 
that we cannot be certain to achieve them 
given the lack of visibility and control relating 
to customers’ energy use in our buildings and 
the embodied carbon emissions in 
developments. We believe that we have 
sufficient full or partial visibility to be able to 
provide sufficiently accurate information to be 
consistent with the TCFD's recommended 
disclosures and we are working hard to 
improve our visibility, and therefore accuracy, 
in this regard.

The Metrics and Targets section below 
provides details on how we monitor these 
risks and our progress over the past year. 

Risk management: action during 2023
We have established the Mandatory 
Sustainability Policy and set internal targets 
associated with not only reducing emissions 
but also working with our customers and 
supply chain to achieve greater visibility of 
those emissions. These targets are integrated 
within a Responsible SEGRO element of the 
bonus metrics throughout the organisation.

 – Materiality: we refreshed our materiality 
assessment to incorporate the double-
materiality requirement under new 
European Commission (EC) reporting 
requirements. This 'Double Materiality 
Assessment' (DMA) reviews not only the 
impact of SEGRO’s economic activity on 
society and the environment but also the 
impact of society and the environment on 
SEGRO’s economic activity. Under the EC 
requirements, the DMA needs to be 
reviewed by an independent third party to 
ensure the process has been carried out 
appropriately. Once that review has 
completed, we will publish the results;

 – Sustainability Policy: Having established the 
Mandatory Sustainability Policy in 2022, we 
kept it under continuous review and 
adjusted and tightened it in response to 
emerging regulation and market norms to 
ensure that it is always in line with best-in-
class practice;

 – Reporting requirements: The new EC 

reporting regulations set down a number of 
very specific requirements for buildings to 
be classed as 'green'. Our development and 
asset management teams are formally 
engaging with external consultants to align 
our policies with the new requirements. 

Metrics and targets
To enable our stakeholders to consider and 
compare our reporting, we contribute to a 
number of externally-recognised initiatives 
including GRESB, CDP and the FTSE4Good 
Index. We also disclose metrics in line with 
externally-recognised frameworks including 
Sustainability Accounting Standards Board 
(SASB), Global Reporting Initiative (GRI) and 
the EPRA Best Practices Recommendations 
on Sustainability Reporting.

In order to ensure that we also report on those 
issues that we can have a direct impact upon, 
we use our materiality assessment to identify 
the key metrics that are material to the 
business. Below are the climate-related 
metrics and targets which we monitor. 
Those in bold are incorporated into the 
Responsible SEGRO elements of the annual 
bonus of all employees.

There are no metrics specifically mapped to 
Risk 2 (flood) or Opportunity 2 (biodiversity), 
although Risks 1 and 2 are addressed in the 
Scenario analysis on pages 69 and 70. We 
are monitoring and addressing the asset-level 
risks and opportunities but there is not yet 
a meaningful, measurable metric for 
these areas.

Narrative
Based on completed developments for which we 
have Life Cycle Assessments (LCAs). To 
accommodate delayed receipt of LCAs we have 
adopted a two-year rolling average to assess 
embodied carbon intensity. This figure incorporates 
the results from 974,000 sq m of space completed 
in 2022 and 2023. As we transition more of our LCAs 
to more accurate Building Information Modelling 
(BIM) assessments, our embodied carbon intensity 
may rise as BIM provides more detailed analysis of 
materials and processes used in construction.

A carbon price is applied to capex relating to 
environmental improvements, particularly when 
considering the returns from retrofitting solar PV to 
existing assets.
15 MW capacity added during the calendar year 
(2022: 9 MW) as part of new development 
completions and retrofitting PV panels to 
existing buildings.
Based on the portfolio for which we have visibility. 
Where we have not been provided with the source 
of energy, we assume a non-renewable tariff. This 
figure will fluctuate as we increase the visibility of 
our customers’ energy use. We are working with our 
customers to improve this metric through increased 
use of certified renewable energy tariffs and 
renewable energy generated on-site.
Revenue from SEGRO-owned PV panels. This metric 
reflects cases where SEGRO sells the energy to the 
occupier or feeds surplus energy into the national 
grid and includes local or national subsidies. In other 
cases, PV-generated energy is provided to 
customers as part of their rent. This revenue is not 
recorded here as it is not possible to disaggregate it 
from underlying rent.

governance procedures

Andy Harrison, Chair

Dear shareholder,

As Chair of SEGRO, I am pleased to present 
the Governance Report for 2023 in which you 
will read how the Board continued to promote 
the long-term, sustainable success of the 
Company during the year. 

Governance and the delivery of strategy
2023 was another busy year for the Board, with 
the Company responding to the challenges 
associated with the macroeconomic and 
geopolitical environments, the impact of 
higher inflation and interest rates on property 
valuations, and the step up in the cost of 
capital. The impact of these external factors 
on the business and its stakeholders remained 
an important influence on Board discussions 
throughout the year, as we ensured decisions 
made against this backdrop were done so in 
the best interests of the Company, for both 
the short and long term.

  Find out more about Board changes during 
the year in the Nomination Committee Report 
on page 95

Board changes and our people
As you will read in the Nomination Committee 
Report on page 95, our Chief Operating 
Officer, Andy Gulliford, and Non-Executive 
Director, Martin Moore, retired from the Board 
in 2023. I would like to take this opportunity 
to thank them both for their significant 
contributions over a number of years.

The internal Board evaluation carried out in 
2023 confirmed that the Board and its 
Committees continued to operate effectively, 
and we have proposed that all Directors will 
stand for re-election at the 2024 AGM. You 
can read more about this on pages 93 to 94, 
and 99.

Succession planning and talent development 
throughout the organisation remain one of the 
Board’s key areas of focus. The promotion of 
internal candidates to create the new 
Executive Committee demonstrates the 
effectiveness of the Company’s succession 
planning and the Board was delighted to see 
the breadth of experience that the new 
members of the Committee bring. You can 
read more about these appointments on 
page 11. 

On a personal note, having now been in the 
role of Chair for over a year, I have enjoyed 
getting to know our people across the 
business even more and am continually 
impressed with the high quality of our 
employees and the passion they have 
for working at SEGRO. 

Despite these challenges, we have 
delivered another year of strong operational 
performance. This is testament not only 
to our high-quality portfolio of assets, but 
to the effectiveness of our long-term strategy, 
our culture, and the hard work and talent 
of our people.

In addition, our long-established and effective 
corporate governance procedures have 
provided a robust structure to decision 
making, ensuring that we identify, consider 
and manage the risks and uncertainties 
facing the business. 

Responsible SEGRO and our stakeholders
Our Responsible SEGRO framework remains 
at the core of our strategy, recognising the 
importance of considering all stakeholders 
in our decisions, as well as our commitment 
to be a force for good in society. 

You can find examples throughout this report 
on how we consider all stakeholders in our 
operating business and our Section 172 
statement on page 90 provides details about 
how the Board engaged with these stakeholder 
groups, and how this engagement has 
impacted its decision making. The Board 
received regular updates on our Responsible 
SEGRO ambitions throughout the year and was 
particularly pleased at the engagement from 
across the business and the progress made 
against our Responsible SEGRO targets. 

Our regular Strategy Event was a valuable 
opportunity for the Board to step away from 
the day-to-day with the members of the 
Executive Committee, and to keep one eye 
on the horizon by hearing from a number of 
experts to add further perspective to Board 
discussions about the strategy and long-term 
objectives of the Company. You can read 
more about this on page 85.

The Company proposes separate resolutions 
on each substantially separate issue, with 
voting conducted by poll. All the resolutions 
proposed at the 2023 AGM were passed with 
80 per cent of the issued share capital voted 
(2022: 82 per cent). Following the meeting, 
the results of votes lodged for and against 
each resolution were announced to the 
London Stock Exchange and added to 
our website. 

The 2024 AGM will be held on 18 April 2024 at 
RSA House, and we hope that we can count 
on shareholders’ support for the proposed 
resolutions. Full details can be found on page 
195 and in the Notice of Meeting. 

Thank you
I would like to take this opportunity to 
recognise the hard work and commitment 
of all our people during the year and to thank 
them for their continued efforts to ensure the 
future success of the business. 

Finally, please also join me in thanking my 
Board colleagues for their insightful and 
valuable contributions during the year.

Our shareholders
Each year we write to our larger shareholders, 
offering them the opportunity to meet 
privately and discuss their thoughts on 
the Company and the wider market with 
myself, the Senior Independent Director or 
the Committee Chairs. In addition, during 
the year our Head of Investor Relations and 
Deputy Company Secretary met with the 
stewardship teams from a number of our 
larger shareholders to gain insight into the 
matters which are important to them. Valuable 
feedback from those meetings was relayed to 
and considered by the Board. We will continue 
to engage with our shareholders and 
representative bodies to make sure that there 
is an ongoing dialogue about our approach 
to governance, including remuneration, and to 
ensure any feedback from our shareholders is 
shared with the Board and all views are fully 
understood and considered. 

Annual General Meeting (AGM)
On behalf of the Board, I would like to extend 
my thanks to those shareholders who joined 
us in April for the 2023 AGM, where the Chief 
Executive delivered a presentation on 
SEGRO’s performance in 2022 and the early 
part of 2023. 

All shareholders received communications for 
the AGM at least 20 working days in advance 
of the meeting and were invited to ask 
questions, either in the room or by email 
ahead of the meeting. The other Directors and 
I were also available to meet with attendees 
informally, both before and after the meeting, 
and we look forward to doing so again at this 
year’s AGM.

Andy Harrison 
Chair

Appointed: 1 April 2022 
(Chair from 30 June 2022)

Skills and experience
Andy is an experienced chair having held the position 
at Dunelm Group plc for over seven years. He is also a 
former CEO who has led multiple large consumer 
facing organisations with strong service offerings. His 
leadership, business understanding and insights have 
proven to be invaluable additions to the boardroom.

With over 35 years' experience serving on the boards 
of listed companies across a wide range of industries 
and during varying economic conditions, Andy is 
particularly well-placed to lead SEGRO through the 
current, more challenging market conditions to enable 
the business to remain fit for the future. 

His Board colleagues consider him to be an effective 
Chair, with his thoughtful leadership style facilitating an

David Sleath OBE
Chief Executive

Appointed: 1 January 2006
(Chief Executive from 28 April 2011; 
Finance Director from 1 January 2006 to 28 April 2011)

Skills and experience
David has considerable board-level experience of 
listed companies and has extensive knowledge of the 
real estate, manufacturing and distribution sectors and 
the Company. His financial and general management 
experience has helped lead the successful design and 
implementation of the Company’s strategy during his 
tenure as Chief Executive.

He is a Fellow of the Institute of Chartered Accountants 
in England and Wales.

Contribution to SEGRO's long-term success
As Finance Director, David was a key member of the 
management team which navigated SEGRO through 
the global financial crisis, swiftly followed by the 
acquisition of Brixton whose London-centric portfolio 
complemented and enhanced SEGRO's own. As Chief 
Executive, he initiated a wide-ranging strategic review 
in 2011 involving reshaping both the portfolio and the 
business, with a particular focus on culture, purpose 
and sustainability. This review laid the foundation for 
SEGRO to become the largest UK REIT and the only 
liquid means of investing in a pan-European urban and 
big box logistics portfolio. Outside SEGRO, his position 
as a Non-Executive Director at a global business-to-
business distribution company provides valuable 
insight into the opportunities and challenges in this 
sector, while his involvement with the EPRA Board and 
the BPF ensures that SEGRO has a leadership position 
in two influential trade associations.

Soumen Das
Chief Financial Officer

Appointed: 16 January 2017

Skills and experience
Soumen combines leadership of the finance functions 
with a wider contribution to the business through 
investment, insight and transformation and 
technology. He brings his extensive board-level 
experience and deep knowledge of capital markets to 
the Group, having been Chief Financial Officer of listed 
companies for 14 years and with a background as a 
corporate financier.

Contribution to SEGRO's long-term success
Since his arrival in 2017, Soumen has been responsible 
for driving the financial performance of SEGRO and 
managing a capital structure which is both efficient 
and appropriate for the different stages of the property 
cycle. In his role, he is also responsible for SEGRO's risk 
management, investment and technology strategies 
which are vital to SEGRO's future financial success and 
resilience. 

He holds external positions which are also pertinent 
to his SEGRO role. His position as a Non-Executive 
Director at a major retailer provides valuable insight 
into the opportunities and challenges in a sector which 
comprises a material proportion of SEGRO's customer 
base. His Co-Chair role of the Parker Review into 
improving ethnic diversity on UK Boards gives him 
a unique perspective on diversity and inclusion to 
support SEGRO's actions and progress in this 
important area.

performance and conclude that it continued to 
operate effectively.

Effective and efficient functioning of the Board
During 2023, there were seven scheduled Board meetings. Each Director has committed to 
attend all scheduled Board and Committee meetings, and would not do so only in exceptional 
circumstances. This is kept under review to ensure that Directors are fulfilling their 
commitments to the Company. Similarly, every effort is made by Directors to attend ad hoc 
meetings. On the rare occasion that a Director cannot attend a meeting they are still provided 
with the papers in advance of the meeting and are given an opportunity to discuss them with 
the Chair or Chief Executive. 

The Board has the flexibility to meet in person, by telephone or by video conference as the 
need arises or on an ad hoc basis.

There is an approved Schedule of Matters 
Reserved for Decision by the Board which 
is reviewed periodically and available at 
www.SEGRO.com. The Board retains 
responsibility for the approval of certain 
matters which include: 
 – Group strategy; 
 – the annual budget; 
 – reviewing the Medium Term Plan;
 – the financial structure;
 – major capital expenditure including 

investments and disposals;  

 – approval of the financial statements; 
 – the dividend policy; and 
 – compliance with the Code. 

  See how the Board delegates some of its 
responsibilities in the Governance Framework 
on page 89

The Directors value meeting and hearing from 
different people in the business who are close 
to the Company’s markets and who can tell 
the Board what they are seeing and hearing 
on the ground, as well as from external 
sources who give a wider perspective on 
market trends. These sessions allow the 
Directors to gain further insight on market 
trends and provided the context for them to 
make strategic decisions about acquisitions, 
disposals and the development pipeline.

During the year, the Board heard from:  
 – the Executive Committee on their individual 

areas of responsibility and the Group’s 
strategic priorities;

 – the Head of Investor Relations on investor 
feedback following the Full- and Half-Year 
Results;

 – the Managing Director, Group Investment on 
market outlook, the investment stance and 
customer exposure across the Group;
 – the Commercial Finance Director on the 

Group's liquidity position; and 

 – the Head of Tax, Head of Legal and Director 

of Health and Safety who all provided 
regular updates on their areas. 

Directors receive accurate, timely and clear 
information on the matters to be considered. 
Electronic Board packs are available to the 
Directors well in advance of a meeting. 

During the Board evaluation process, the 
Non-Executive Directors commented 
positively on the quality of the papers 
received from the Company which set the 
scene for the Board meetings and signpost 
the important aspects for consideration. 
Everyone agreed that the Board meetings 
were well managed and facilitated open 
discussion of the appropriate topics and focus 
areas.

Strategy Event 2023

In November 2023, the Board and Executive 
Committee spent a day and a half offsite, 
where they reflected on the strategic 
direction of the Company and considered 
how to position the business for continued 
long-term, sustainable success in pursuit of 
the Company’s ambition to be the best 
property company, all whilst navigating the 
ongoing uncertainty in the wider 
macroeconomic and geopolitical 
environment.

As always, the Board valued this opportunity 
to step away from the usual day-to-day 
boardroom agenda and dedicate its time to 
discussing key strategic areas. The Strategy 
Event focused on a small number of key 
items and a full pack of papers, covering a 
wide range of topics, was provided ahead of 
the session to set the context for discussion 
and ensure that the Directors were fully 
briefed. As well as hearing from speakers 
from around the business, external guests 
were invited to share their areas of expertise 
to further inform the conversation.

The first part of the offsite was spent 
considering the external economic 
environment and macroeconomic outlook 
within the countries in which the Company 
operates, and the Board welcomed a 
number of external speakers, including 
those from Morgan Stanley and Savills to 
share their views on the outlook for the UK 
and Continental European economies as 
well as the occupier market.

The Board also heard from the newly 
appointed Managing Directors for the UK 
and Continental Europe, James Craddock 
and Marco Simonetti, who summarised 
their initial reflections on their new roles and 
what they considered to be the near-term 
challenges for each of their business areas 
in light of the current market conditions.

These insights contributed to the Board’s 
discussions on the assumptions, strategic 
choices and outputs underlying the Group’s 
Medium Term Plan. It also considered the 
annual portfolio review, views of the 
property cycle and the markets the 
Company operates in, as well as the 
investment strategy in the near term 
and in future years.

On the second day, as part of the Board's 
enhanced programme of stakeholder 
engagement, a speaker from National Grid 
was welcomed who provided an overview 
of National Grid’s business and the broader 
risks, challenges and opportunities 
associated with the energy market 
in the UK.

Finally, upon reflection of the discussions 
from the first day, the Board further 
considered the key strategic priorities for 
the business with the Group HR Director, 
Margaret Murphy, leading a discussion on 
Nurturing talent, including diversity and 
inclusion and succession planning for 
the business.

The Board concluded that the strategic 
direction of the business remains 
appropriate. Whilst being mindful 
of the pace of change in the wider 
macroeconomic environment and 
the need to remain vigilant and nimble in 
the execution of that strategy, there was 
consensus amongst Directors on the 
Company’s planned approach for 2024.

Board leadership and Company purpose continued

How the Board lives our Purpose 
and Values 
We are proud of our Purpose – to create the 
space that enables extraordinary things to 
happen – and our five Values which support 
our culture and align with our strategic 
priorities. They are well embedded in 
the business and form the basis of our 
workforce policies. They help to unify 
employees and describe the core beliefs 
about how SEGRO does business, acting 
as a universal language across our business 
and the countries in which we operate.

It is essential that the Directors lead by 
example and live the Values. The Executive 
Directors are more visible leaders around 
the business and help set the tone.

Within the boardroom, the consistent 
feedback from the recent evaluations is that 
all Directors feel they can contribute, speak 
freely and do not feel constrained. The 
Chair encourages open debate and no 
one individual dominates. The seasoned 
relationships of most of the Board 
members mean that they are able 
to say it like it is whilst their varied 
backgrounds and wide-ranging 
experience bring differing perspectives 
to Board discussions, allowing for true 
diversity of thought and constructive 
challenge in a supportive environment.

  See more on our Purpose and Values on page 31

Say it like it is
The Directors are honest and 
transparent in dealings with 
each other and those who 
interact with them both inside 
and outside of the boardroom. 
The Chair encourages 
constructive debate and 
challenge during meetings.

We have a unifying set 
of Values that drive 
our culture. When the 
Directors are together, 
they live the Values as 
follows: 

Stand side by side
The Non-Executive Directors 
bring to the Board their 
knowledge and experience 
from other businesses. The 
Directors are supportive and 
take collective responsibility 
for decisions.

Does it make the  
boat go faster?
The Directors look at different 
ways of working to create 
effective relationships and 
discuss regularly where they 
can best add value.

If the door is closed…
The Non-Executive Directors 
support the Executive 
Directors to find solutions to 
more complex issues and 
provide assistance where 
more difficult judgement calls 
and decisions need to be 
made.

Keep one eye  
on the horizon
The Directors look to the long 
term in their decision making. 
They want to understand future 
trends and how the Company 
can use them for the benefit of 
all of our stakeholders.

How the Board manages and monitors 
our culture

The Board believes that our culture can be 
defined by:
 – a strong desire to create a successful 

business we can be proud of; 

 – trust and strong professional integrity – 

we deliver on promises; 

 – pragmatism – a ‘sleeves up’ approach 

regardless of status; 

 – thoughtful, detailed and measured 

decision making; 

 – respect and transparency; and
 – caring about people and taking an interest 

in their wellbeing. 

The Board continues to monitor the culture of 
the Company through indicators which serve 
as a temperature check. They consider:
 – the results of the annual employee 

engagement survey 'Your Say';

 – feedback from the workforce engagement 
sessions led by the Non-Executive Directors;

 – internal audit reports;
 – data on employee turnover;
 – feedback from office and site visits by 
Executive Directors and the Board as a 
whole;

 – any whistleblowing incidents;
 – any health and safety incidents;
 – any breaches of the Code of Business 

Conduct and Ethics; and

 – the results of the annual Customer and 

Supplier Satisfaction surveys.

Promoting long-term sustainable success 

SEGRO’s principal duty is to deliver lasting, 
sustainable success and generate value for 
shareholders and other investors, whilst being 
mindful of our impact on stakeholders and 
wider society. The Board helps facilitate this 
through robust governance processes and 
ensuring effective risk management is in place 
against which key decisions are made on 
behalf of the Company. 

Despite continued low volumes in investment 
markets during the year, occupier markets 
remained strong with demand being driven 
by long-term structural trends and vacancy 
remaining low in our chosen sub-markets. This 
resulted in further rental growth, which, when 
combined with our customer focus and the 
active asset management of our portfolio of 
high quality, sustainable assets, allowed us to 
deliver another strong year of operational 
performance.

The Company contracted £88 million of 
new headline rent during the year through 
capturing reversion and growing rents on 
the existing portfolio and we also completed 
625,700 sq m of new space, capable of 
delivering £50 million of new headline rent. 
This activity resulted in further growth in 
earnings and resulted in the Board 
recommending an increase in dividend 
returns for our shareholders. The Board 
was also pleased to hear about the progress 
that has been made against the Responsible 
SEGRO targets during the year, as detailed 
further on pages 23 to 31. 

Looking ahead, the combination of new rental 
income from the development programme, 
and the benefits of active asset management 
of our existing portfolio, a key strategic priority 
for the business, should enable us to drive 
sustainable growth in both earnings and 
dividends. The Chief Executive’s Statement on 
pages 8 to 11, along with the Financial review 
on pages 48 to 53, set out in much more 
detail our strategy and the reasons why we are 
confident in the long-term prospects for our 
business.

Board leadership and Company purpose continued

Investing for the long term
Since the Company's principal duty is to 
deliver long-term success, much of the 
Board’s decision making is focused around 
ensuring that the Company is sustainable in 
the long term. 

 – Each year, the Board considers our Medium 
Term Plan, which assesses the opportunities 
and risks for the Company over the following 
five years, and forms the basis of our viability 
statement. 

 – At the annual Strategy Event, the Board 
takes time to consider the long-term 
strategy of the business, incorporating 
presentations and discussions on 
longer-term opportunities and threats 
to the business. 

 – Throughout the year, the Board has overall 
responsibility for the Company’s approach 
to risk and ensures that risk is effectively and 
consistently managed. It reviews the 
measures in place to mitigate the near- and 
longer-term risks (including emerging risks) 
to the business. 

Real estate is inherently a long-term industry, 
and the Board therefore takes this into 
consideration in all its decision making. The 
Board approved the current strategy in 2011, 
which included the repositioning of the 
portfolio and strengthening of the balance 
sheet. In the Chief Executive’s statement on 
page 8, you can read more about how we 
have adapted our long-held strategy to 
respond to the current environment. 

Identifying and managing conflicts of 
interest
The Board operates a policy to identify and, 
when appropriate, manage actual or potential 
conflicts of interest affecting Directors. 
Prior to taking on any additional external 
commitments, Directors are required to 
submit any actual or potential conflicts of 
interest they may have with the Company 
to the Chair or Senior Independent Director 
for approval. Any conflicts of interest are 
recorded and approved by the Board at 
each meeting. Directors have a duty to keep 
the Board updated about any changes to 
these conflicts.

Effective controls and necessary resources
The Board has a responsibility to ensure that 
appropriate controls and resources are in 
place to enable the Company to achieve 
its long-term goals. 

As detailed on page 84 there is a Schedule of 
Matters Reserved for Decision by the Board.

You can read about the Company’s approach 
to risk and risk management on pages 54 to 
67, whilst page 106 contains further details 
about the Audit Committee’s role in ensuring 
that robust processes have been put in place 
to ensure risks are identified, evaluated and 
managed. The Board regularly discusses the 
Company’s principal risks, along with new 
and emerging risks, and considers how 
they may impact on our long-term goals.

The Board is ever mindful of the need to 
balance the pursuit of opportunities without 
taking unacceptable or excessive risk and 
ensures that the Company has the 
appropriate resources, in terms of time, 
people and funding to do so.

Code of Business Conduct and Ethics
The Board takes an active interest in ensuring 
that appropriate policies and practices are in 
place, consistent with the Company’s Purpose 
and Values. One such policy is our Code of 
Business Conduct and Ethics (Code of Ethics) 
which is core to the way in which our business 
is run, the work we do, and to our reputation.

The Code of Ethics sets out the high ethical 
standards expected of all our people in their 
daily work to enable us to act with honesty 
and integrity. The Code of Ethics covers 
various policies on a wide range of activities 
and any breaches are thoroughly investigated 
with appropriate action taken. The Board 
receives regular reports on compliance with 
the Code of Ethics and the Company’s policy 
on whistleblowing, which sets out the 
procedure by which employees and any third 
parties can use a confidential external service 
to raise concerns. No matters of concern were 
raised via the confidential external service 
during 2023. 

The Code of Ethics also sets out our approach 
to the human rights of all our stakeholders. 
Our due diligence to combat slavery and 
human trafficking which is set out in our 
Modern Slavery Statement which is approved 
by the Board each year and is on our website. 
See page 131.

The Audit Committee is responsible for 
ensuring that appropriate safeguards are in 
place for the detection of fraud and 
prevention of bribery, including overseeing 
and monitoring the Group’s anti-bribery and 
corruption policies and procedures. See page 
106. During the year, the Company received a 
direct report of one whistleblowing allegation 
which, following a thorough investigation, was 
found to be not material and unsubstantiated, 
and was therefore closed. 

  See the Chief Executive's statement on page 8

and risk management on pages 54 to 67

Division of responsibilities

The division of responsibilities of the Chair, 
Chief Executive and Senior Independent 
Director are clearly established in writing 
and approved by the Board.

Chair
The Chair is responsible for the leadership 
of the Board and its overall effectiveness in 
directing the Company and promoting an 
open environment for challenge and debate. 
He encourages participation by all the 
Directors, facilitates constructive relations 
and creates the right atmosphere to promote 
a culture of open discussion and effective 
decision making.

account against agreed objectives. 

Chief Executive

impact of the Board’s decisions. 

Senior Independent Director

when it considers his succession. 

Availability of the Chair, Chief Executive 
and the Company Secretary
The Chair, the Chief Executive and the 
Company Secretary are always available for 
the Directors to discuss any issues concerning 
Board meetings or other matters. All Directors 
have access to the advice and services of the 
Company Secretary, who is responsible for 
ensuring compliance with Board procedures. 
Directors also have the right to seek 
independent professional advice at the 
Company’s reasonable expense should 
they so wish.

Our Governance Framework

The Board is responsible for creating and delivering shareholder value by setting the strategic direction of the Group.

are dedicated sessions to discuss strategic priorities as well as ad hoc sessions to keep up to date with more day-to-day operational issues.

The Executive Committee delegates some of its responsibilities to a number of management committees, membership of each includes  
at least one member of the Executive Committee.

It serves as a discussion forum and sounding board with which the Executive Directors can share knowledge and ideas,  
gain a better understanding of the local market outlook and share cross-functional and cross-border information.

Stakeholder engagement from the Board’s perspective

Section 172(1) Statement 
The Board confirms that during the year 
ended 31 December 2023 it has acted in 
the way it considers, in good faith, would 
be most likely to promote the long-term 
success of the Company for the benefit 
of its members as a whole whilst having 
due regard to the matters set out in 
section 172(1) (a) to (f) of the Companies 
Act 2006 (s172).

Each of the Directors is mindful of their 
duties under s172 to run the Company for 
the benefit of its shareholders, and in doing 
so, to take into account the long-term 
impact of any decisions on stakeholder 
relationships and the impact of the 
Company’s activities on the environment, 
whilst maintaining its reputation for high 
standards of business conduct at all times. 
The Company cannot operate in a vacuum. 
We can only succeed if we conduct 
ourselves in a responsible manner and 
have positive relationships with all of our 
stakeholders. 

The Directors engage directly with as many 
stakeholders as they can but given the 
number of stakeholders, who are spread 
across multiple geographies, engagement 
often takes place at the operational level. In 
this section we explain how the Board has 
specifically engaged with our stakeholders 
and how the engagement has influenced their 
decision making.

In line with our Responsible SEGRO commitments to Champion low-carbon growth and Invest in our local 
communities and environments, the Board was pleased to note that the development will incorporate a 
610 acre country park for use by the local community. The park will include a 10-mile network of footpaths 
and recreational features including a trim trail, outdoor gym, new children’s play areas, new bird watching 
hides and a Visitor Interpretation Centre. Over 4,000 trees and 132,000 saplings will be planted, while the 
local habitat will be enhanced by creating new ponds and nesting sites.

It is anticipated that the completed scheme will deliver around 4,000 jobs, with approximately 500 further 
jobs generated on site during construction. In addition to employment opportunities and environmental 
considerations, the development will stimulate economic growth and enhance local infrastructure. SEGRO 
is committed to a significant investment programme to fund new traffic relieving measures, including £22 
million to fund a new 1.4-mile stretch of relief road for Park Street / Frogmore to alleviate traffic on the A5183, 
and it is estimated that the completed scheme will deliver around £12 million each year in business rates.

At the 2023 AGM, a number of our shareholders communicated to the Board that they would value the 
opportunity to visit one of our assets, to see first hand the work that we do at SEGRO.

In October, we invited a group of retail shareholders to our London office for a presentation on the 
Company followed by an asset tour at SEGRO Park Tottenham. We received great feedback from the 
attendees, who were appreciative of the invitation, and were impressed with the modern look and feel 
of SEGRO Park Tottenham along with the biodiversity features of the asset.

remain appropriate, stretching and in the 
best interests of our stakeholders.

 – The Remuneration Committee considered 

changes to the ESG metrics in the 2024 bonus 
targets, for both Executive Directors and the 
wider workforce, to focus on more stretching

Stakeholder engagement from the Board’s perspective continued

Workforce Engagement

The Board feels strongly that, in order to be 
authentic, meaningful and received 
positively by our employees, its approach to 
engaging with the wider workforce should 
mirror the Company’s value to say it like it is.

As the Group has a non-unionised business 
with a headcount of 460 employees based 
in multiple countries, an alternative 
arrangement (as permitted by Provision 5 
of the Code) remains the most appropriate 
option. This involves a three-stage approach 
which, whilst now well-embedded, remains 
under review to ensure it continues to be 
effective and encompasses the spirit of 
enabling the voice of the employee to be 
heard in the boardroom.

1. Individual meetings with the Directors
Each year, our Non-Executive Directors 
hold a series of informal meetings with 
employees from across the business to hear 
first hand how they feel about working at 
SEGRO. The Board appreciates the value 
of hearing a variety of views directly from 
a broad cross-section of employees in 
different roles, grades and offices to gain a 
deeper understanding of the issues that are 
important to them without members of the 
Leadership team present. 

In 2023, pairs of Non-Executive Directors 
led three sessions: two thematic sessions 
which focused on Diversity and Inclusion 
and Executive Remuneration (which is 
detailed further on page 119), and one 
session on more general topics during their 
visit to Poland. We felt that this was a good 
balance between focused conversations on 
topics the Board wanted to hear more from 
employees on as well as offering the 
flexibility for employees to share their views 
on areas of importance for them. 

Non-attributable feedback from each 
session was relayed at the following Board 
meeting for discussion. 

We take meaningful action to address the 
areas of importance raised by our people 
during these sessions and their feedback 
is an important consideration in our people 
strategy and planning. After hearing what 
was important to our colleagues during 
2023, we will continue to build on our 
commitments to improve employee 
communication around workforce 
remuneration, enhance our employee 
experience with a focus on more 
flexible policies and continue to evolve 
and communicate our diversity and 
inclusion strategy.

2. Presentations at Board and Committee 
meetings
The Board regularly invites representatives 
from around the business to present at 
Board and Committee meetings and in 
2023 welcomed a number of guest 
speakers as detailed on page 85. 

Each of the Committee Chairs also met 
with employees in relation to the business 
of their Committees.

3. Informal meetings 
During the year, the Board travelled to 
Warsaw, Poland where they toured local 
assets with the Managing Director, Poland 
and Czech Republic and her team. During 
their time there they took the opportunity 
to have lunches and a dinner with different 
members of the Polish and Czech teams. 
The Board enjoyed the opportunity to spend 
time with the Central European team.

Composition, succession and evaluation

Internal Board evaluation 
Frequency and evaluation type

Process

Stage 1: 

Year 1: External Year 2: Internal

Year 3: Internal

The Board undertakes an externally 
facilitated evaluation on a triennial basis in 
line with the requirements of the Code. The 
last external evaluation took place in 2021 and 
our intention is to repeat this exercise in the 
coming year. 

In the intervening two years, an internal 
review of the Board, its Committees and the 
performance of individual Directors is carried 
out, allowing the Board the opportunity 
to reflect regularly on its performance, 
effectiveness and address any areas of 
concern as they arise. 

This year's internal review was led by 
the Senior Independent Director, 
Carol Fairweather, who was supported 
throughout the process by the Chair and 
the Company Secretary. 

The overall picture 
from the review remains 
positive, with all Directors 
feeling that the Board 
works well, performs 
to a high standard 
and covers all its 
statutory duties.
Carol Fairweather,
Senior Independent Director

The Senior Independent Director, Chair and Company Secretary met to discuss their initial thoughts for 
this year's review and agreed to follow a similar process to 2022, which the Board found to be effective, 
comprising a short survey followed by individual face-to-face meetings with the Board members and 
key contributors. 

Stage 2: 

The areas of focus for the review were agreed and all participants were asked to complete a short, 
anonymous survey where they rated and provided feedback on a selection of questions to help focus the 
face-to-face meetings.

Stage 3: 

The responses were collated and analysed and the Senior Independent Director and Company Secretary met 
with each of the Board members on a one-to-one basis to gain a deeper understanding of their feedback and 
give them the opportunity to express their views on any other matters of importance to them. 

During these meetings, participants also shared their feedback on the contribution and performance of each 
of the individual Directors, including the Chair.

 A draft report, summarising the key themes coming from the survey and meetings, was discussed with the 
Chair and Chief Executive ahead of the December meeting. 

Stage 4: 

The final report was presented to the December Board meeting where time was allocated for an open 
discussion on the conclusions of the review and the recommendations for the coming year.

Stage 5: 

Areas of focus
The review focused on a wide selection 
of themes, and the combination of topics 
allowed us to seek views on both strategic 
and business as usual items. 

Key areas of focus included:
 –  the size and composition of the Board and 

its Committees and the balance of the skills, 
experience, independence and diversity 
brought by each of the Directors;

 –  Board dynamics and the relationships 

between the Directors, and between the 
Board and the Executive Committee;

 –  the performance of the Board as a whole 
as well as the contributions of individual 
Directors, including the Chair;

 –  how the Board focused its time and the ratio 
of time spent on strategic and non-strategic 
items;

 –  stakeholder engagement and the 

consideration of stakeholder interests 
as part of Board discussion and decision 
making; and

 – Board succession planning, along with the 

people strategy for the wider business.

Conclusions
The overall picture from the review remained 
positive and very much in line with the 
findings of the last internal review and external 
evaluation, conducted in 2022 and 2021 
respectively, concluding that the Board and its 
Committees continued to operate effectively 
and perform well.

The key findings of the review are summarised 
below:
 – The balance of experience and skills was 
considered to be appropriate, with the 
collaborative culture enabling a suitable 
level of challenge and support. 

 –  The overall size of the Board was considered 
carefully in light of Martin Moore’s retirement. 
On balance, the Board felt that the revised 
ratio of Independent Non-Executive Directors 
to Executive Directors would continue to 
provide the right amount of challenge, 
independent scrutiny and hold the 
Executives to account. However, this would 
be kept under review during the coming year.

Further information:

Succession planning
Dedicate additional time on the Board agenda 
to succession planning discussions, inclusive 
of reviewing the skills and experience for the 
appointment of Non-Executive Directors in the 
longer term as well as wider Leadership team 
considerations. 

Stakeholder engagement
Maintain the programme of regular stakeholder 
engagement to enable the Board to hear from our 
key stakeholders and industry experts on areas of 
interest, allowing deep dive sessions into areas of 
relevance to enhance Board discussion and 
thinking. 

The Board approved the changes to the executive leadership 
structure following the retirement of our Chief Operating Officer 
during the year and were delighted to see a significant number of 
promotions from the internal pool of talent, both at the Executive 
Committee level and below.

All Directors agreed that succession planning remained a priority 
for the coming year. 

The enhanced stakeholder engagement programme was valued 
by the Board who had found the opportunities to meet with key 
stakeholders interesting and insightful. Feedback to further 
improve this engagement for the coming years was taken on 
board during the 2023 review.

Strategy
Maintain focus on key strategic items and succinct 
summaries in Board and Committee papers. 

In addition to the dedicated Strategy Event in November 2023, 
the Board spent time discussing our strategic priorities at 
regularly scheduled Board meetings. 

This will continue to be an area of focus throughout 2024. 

Composition, succession and evaluation  
continued

 – Board meetings were effectively run with 
the quality of papers supporting effective 
discussions and decision-making. 

 –  All three Board Committees were thought to 
be well-chaired and effective in discharging 
their respective duties with the combination 
of skills and experience brought by the 
Committee members deemed appropriate 
to enable informed debate and 
recommendations on their areas of 
responsibility. Membership of the 
Committees would remain under review 
to ensure the most efficient use of Board 
resources. 

Actions
As ever, the Board appreciated the 
opportunity to reflect on its performance and 
highlighted areas for continued focus in 2024, 
some of which included:
 – continuing to maintain focus on strategic 

drivers of the business and receive updates 
throughout the year on the key topics 
considered at the 2023 Strategy Event;
 – continuing the programme of regular 

stakeholder engagement;

 – inviting members of the new Executive 
Committee to attend Board meetings, 
allowing the Board to hear first-hand about 
their areas of responsibility; and

 – keeping succession planning under review.

Actions against these priorities will be 
considered by the Board during the course 
of 2024 and reported against in next year's 
Annual Report.

Dear shareholder,

I am pleased to present to shareholders the 
Nomination Committee (the Committee) 
Report for 2023, in which we set out how the 
Committee has discharged its responsibilities 
during the year. 

The Committee comprises the Independent 
Non-Executive Directors and is chaired by 
myself as the Chair of the Board. 

In this Report we will demonstrate how 
the Committee has fulfilled its role of 
overseeing the composition of the Board and 
its Committees, and monitoring the balance 
of skills, experience, independence and 
knowledge as well as the diversity of its 
members in its broadest sense. 

Throughout the year, the Committee has 
acted in accordance with its Terms of 
Reference, which were last updated in 
February 2024 and can be found at 
www.SEGRO.com. 

Board changes
In 2023, there were a number of planned 
changes to the Board and membership of 
the Board Committees:

 – Chief Operating Officer 

Our Chief Operating Officer, Andy Gulliford, 
retired from the business and stepped down 
from the Board on 30 June 2023 following 
which the Company announced the 
expansion of the executive leadership 
structure and four internal promotions to 
create the new Executive Committee. The 
Committee was supportive of this decision 
which reflected the ambitions of SEGRO’s 
Nurturing talent programme.  

Further information on the new Executive 
Committee members and the wide range 
of experience they bring to their roles can 
be found on page 11. 

 – Senior Independent Director 

On 1 July 2023, following completion of nine 
years' service on the Board, Martin Moore 
stepped down from the role of Senior 
Independent Director and Independent 
Non-Executive Director and Chair of the 
Audit Committee, Carol Fairweather, was 
appointed to the role.  

Martin continued to serve on the Board as 
a Non-Executive Director and member of 
the Audit, Nomination and Remuneration 
Committees until his retirement on 
31 December 2023. 

Please join me in thanking Andy and Martin 
for their service and valuable contributions 
to the Board. We wish them all the best for 
the future. 

 – Committee membership 

Additionally, Independent Non-Executive 
Director, Mary Barnard, stepped down as a 
member of the Audit Committee with effect 
from 1 July 2023. She remains a member of 
the Nomination and Remuneration 
Committees.  

 – Appointments  

There were no new Board appointments 
during the year. 

Board succession planning
Succession planning has long been a key 
focus of the Committee and you can read 
more about our approach on page 97. 

Within the context of the recent Director 
retirements, the Committee considered 
carefully the overall size of the Board, the 
skillsets of the individual Directors as well 
as the ratio of Executive to Independent 
Non-Executive Directors. We concluded that 
the balance remained appropriate but would 
be kept under review.

Composition, succession and evaluation 
Nomination Committee Report continued

Re-appointment of Independent 
Non-Executive Directors
Non-Executive Directors are appointed by the 
Board for three-year terms. At the conclusion 
of each term, the Committee undertakes a 
review of their performance and contribution 
before making any recommendation to the 
Board for their re-appointment.

Board Diversity and Inclusion Policy
The updated Board Diversity and Inclusion 
Policy was considered at the December 2023 
meeting, where the Committee determined 
that it was appropriate and in line with best 
practice, and recommended it to the Board 
for formal approval. Further information can 
be found on page 98 of this Report. 

In January 2024, Carol Fairweather reached 
six years’ service on the Board. Following her 
confirmation that she wished to continue 
serving as Senior Independent Director and 
Chair of the Audit Committee, her re-election 
was considered by the Committee at the 
December 2023 meeting. 

The Committee gave due regard to her 
performance, contributions and ongoing 
ability to contribute to the long-term success 
of the Board as well as the time commitment 
required to fulfil these role. We concluded that 
Carol continued to be a valuable member of 
the Board and it was agreed that her term be 
extended for a further three years, subject to 
the annual re-election by shareholders at the 
upcoming AGM. 

Carol was not present when her 
re-appointment was discussed. 

Committee effectiveness
As part of the internal Board evaluation 
undertaken during the year, detailed on 
pages 93 and 94, the operation of each of the 
Board Committees was considered and it was 
concluded that they continue to operate 
effectively. An update on the activities of the 
Committee is provided to the Board at each 
subsequent Board meeting. 

Looking ahead
Simon Fraser and Linda Yueh will each reach 
the end of their first three-year term in May 
2024 and Sue Clayton will reach the end of 
her second three-year term in June 2024. The 
Committee will consider their contribution to 
the long-term success of the Company and 
re-appointments in due course, as well as 
succession planning and Board diversity 
more generally for the longer term.

Composition, skills and experience
The Board is currently made up of a 
Non-Executive Chair, two Executive Directors 
and five Independent Non-Executive Directors, 
all of whom are equally responsible for the 
effective stewardship and leadership 
of the Group. 

During the year, the Committee reviewed the 
skills and experience of the Board members, 
as well as the size of the Board as a whole, 
and concluded that it was appropriate in 
size with the right balance of skills and 
experience to fulfil its duties. As ever, this 
will be kept under review. 

Directors may request training on specific 
issues with some attending external courses 
(often provided by our professional advisers). 
From time to time, meetings with specialists 
in the business are arranged for Directors 
who may wish to gain a deeper insight into a 
particular topic. The Directors may raise any 
training needs with the Chair which helps to 
ensure that the training programme meets the 
needs of the Board, individual Directors and 
the business. The Directors have access to 
the advice of the Company Secretary and 
independent professional advice is available 
at the Company’s expense, if necessary, 
in fulfilling their duties and responsibilities.

In order to stay abreast of the enhanced 
regulation and disclosure requirements 
around ESG, which the Board recognises 
to be an area of importance for many of 
our stakeholders, Directors received training 
on EU Taxonomy and The Corporate 
Sustainability Reporting Directive at 
the September 2023 Board meeting. 

Additionally, Board members received the 
annual refresher training on Market Abuse 
Regulation from the Company Secretary. 

Induction and ongoing training 
On joining the Board new Directors participate 
in a comprehensive induction programme 
designed to familiarise them with the 
Company, its assets, policies and procedures, 
and to introduce them to employees and key 
advisers, in order to assist them in becoming 
effective in their role as quickly as possible.

As part of the induction process, they are 
provided with detailed information on the 
Group, its policies and its governance 
structure by the Company Secretary. 

They will also meet with the Executive 
Directors, the other members of the 
Executive Committee, the Heads of 
Functions covering all aspects of the business, 
and the Company’s valuers, brokers, as well 
as the internal and external auditors. 

To ensure the Board continually updates and 
refreshes its skills and knowledge, ongoing 
training and development support is provided 
to the Board during the year. The Board is 
regularly briefed on: business-related matters; 
governance updates; investor expectations; 
and legal and regulatory changes which 
impact the Company. During the year, both 
the Audit and Remuneration Committees 
received updates on relevant accounting, 
remuneration and regulatory developments, 
evolving market trends and changing 
disclosure requirements from external 
advisers and management.

Succession planning 
The Committee is responsible for the effective 
and orderly succession planning for Directors, 
both Non-Executive and Executive, the Group 
HR Director and the Company Secretary. 

It monitors the tenure of Directors to ensure 
that it plans sufficiently in advance of 
retirements from the Board to ensure orderly 
succession of Non-Executive Directors. All 
the Directors stand for election or re-election 
at each AGM. 

Along with considering Board succession, 
the Committee oversees the development 
of a strong pipeline of diverse and talented 
individuals below Board level. It reviews 
regularly the quality of the Leadership team 
and senior managers as it recognises the 
importance of creating and developing a 
suitably talented, diverse pipeline ready to 
serve as the next generation of leaders. 

The Chief Executive, supported by the Group 
HR Director, presents to the Committee on 
Leadership team succession planning and the 
talent development programme for the wider 
workforce. For the Executive Committee and 
for roles in the Leadership team, plans are in 
place for both sudden, unforeseen absences, 
and for longer-term succession. These form 
the basis of development plans for our most 
talented people and will ensure that, looking 
forward, we have the right people to deliver 
our strategic priorities.

Directors in their biographies on pages 81 to 83

Composition, succession and evaluation 
Nomination Committee Report continued

Board Diversity and Inclusion

The Directors are committed to having a 
balanced Board which recognises the benefits 
of diversity in its broadest sense and the value 
that this brings to the organisation in terms of 
skills, knowledge and experience. 

The composition of the Board exceeds the 
criteria of both the FTSE Women Leaders 
Review on gender balance and the Parker 
Review on ethnic diversity. As at 31 December 
2023, 50 per cent of the Board were female 
and 25 per cent were from an ethnic 
minority background. 

In last year’s Report, the Committee 
demonstrated its support of the FCA’s aim to 
encourage increased transparency around 
diversity reporting at a Board and senior 
management level by proactively reporting 
compliance with two out of the three diversity 
targets set out in the updated Listing Rules. 
We are pleased to report that, following the 
appointment of Carol Fairweather to the role 
of Senior Independent Director on 1 July 2023, 
the Company now complies with all three 
targets as set out in the charts to the right. The 
data collected from Directors and executive 
management for the purposes of making this 
disclosure is provided on a voluntary basis. 

When searching for an additional Director, 
the Committee is mindful of the advantages 
a diverse board brings, and ensures that in 
selecting and briefing executive search firms, 
the importance of diversity and inclusion are 
highlighted at the outset. The Committee 
particularly considers how it describes the skills 
and experience needed for the roles as this 
helps attract as wide a pool of candidates as 
possible. Only executive search firms who have 
signed up to the Voluntary Code of Conduct 
for Executive Search Firms will be used in the 
recruitment of Directors. In the final selection 
decision, all Board appointments are made 
on merit and relevant experience, against the 
criteria identified by the Committee with regard 
to the benefits of diversity in the widest sense, 
including gender and ethnicity.

The Board aspires to promote greater diversity 
across the business which forms an integral 
part of our Nurturing talent strategic priority. 
During the year, the Group HR Director 
presented to the Board on the progress 
against these objectives, which included 
plans to set and publicly disclose voluntary 
gender and ethnicity diversity targets for 
senior leadership roles as recommended 
by the FTSE Women Leaders Review and 
Parker Review.

  Read more about Nurturing talent, including our 
senior leadership diversity targets, on page 31

Board Diversity and Inclusion Policy
The Committee is responsible for monitoring 
the effectiveness of the Board Diversity and 
Inclusion Policy (the Policy), available to view 
on the Company’s website, www.SEGRO.com, 
which sets out the Company’s approach to 
diversity and inclusion in respect of the 
Board and its Committees. 

The Policy incorporates a broad range of 
diversity factors as set out in the Disclosure 
Guidance and Transparency Rules, specifies 
diversity targets with which the Board aims 
to comply, and considers how the Policy 
is applied to the Audit, Nomination and 
Remuneration Committees as well as the 
Board as a whole. 

It was last updated during 2023 to incorporate 
Board oversight of diversity below Board level, 
including monitoring our diversity targets for 
senior leadership roles. 

The Committee considers that the Board 
and its Committees are in compliance with 
the Policy, which is appropriate and aligned 
with best practice, and will keep both the 
Policy itself and compliance with it under 
periodic review.

  For further information about the Company’s 
approach to diversity and inclusion in the 
workforce see page 31

Time commitment
As part of the recruitment process, the 
significant time commitments of potential 
Board members should be disclosed to the 
Committee. On appointment, the Chair and 
Non-Executive Directors receive a formal 
letter of appointment clearly setting out their 
expected time commitment to the Company 
and any additional future commitments 
should not be undertaken without prior 
notification to the Board. 

Executive Directors are permitted to hold one 
external directorship as approved by the Board. 

The Committee has considered the additional 
commitments of all Directors and has 
concluded that each of them has sufficient 
time to commit to the Company and are not 
overboarded. Their individual contributions 
are, and continue to be, important to the 
Company’s long-term sustainable success. 

For transparency we disclose all significant 
external appointments held by our Directors in  
their biographies on pages 81 to 83; however 
many of these appointments do not require 
the same time commitment as appointments 
to publicly listed companies. 

Directors’ independence
The Board is made up of a majority of 
Independent Non-Executive Directors, 
which promotes the good governance of the 
Company by ensuring that the Executives are 
held to account and are not able to dominate 
Board decision making.

The Committee considers each of the 
Non-Executive Directors to be independent 
in character and judgement in accordance 
with the criteria set out in the Code. 

The Chair was considered independent 
on appointment and the Committee still 
considers him to be so. 

Prior to their appointment, the Directors 
must disclose any actual or potential conflicts 
of interests and any future business interests 
that could result in a conflict must not be 
undertaken without the prior notification to, 
and authorisation of, the Board. The Board 
considers and approves the conflicts of 
interest as declared by any Director at 
each Board meeting.

Directors’ effectiveness
The performance and individual contribution 
of each of the Directors is reviewed annually 
as part of the Board evaluation process led 
by the Senior Independent Director. 

The review concluded that the Chair 
demonstrated strong leadership and 
remained effective in his role.

The Non-Executive Directors also agreed that 
the Chief Executive continued to perform his 
role with energy and commitment and leads 
an effective Executive team. 

The performance of the other Non-Executive 
Directors is appraised by the Chair and 
Senior Independent Director, whilst the 
Chief Executive provides feedback on the 
Chief Financial Officer.

Director re-election at the AGM
Having considered the skills and performance 
of each Director and whether they continue 
to be effective and demonstrate commitment 
to their roles, the Committee makes a formal 
recommendation to the Board that they be 
re-elected. 

The Committee has concluded that all 
Directors continue to be effective in their roles 
and accordingly will submit themselves for 
re-election by shareholders at the 2024 AGM. 

  For information on how each of the Directors 
contribute to the long-term success of the 
Company see their biographies on pages 81 to 83

Dear shareholder,

As Chair of the Audit Committee (the 
Committee), I am pleased to present 
the Committee’s report for 2023. 

During the year, the Committee has acted in 
accordance with the objectives of its Terms 
of Reference which are available at  
www.SEGRO.com. 

Over the following pages you will see how the 
Committee has discharged its responsibilities, 
as well as other areas which it has focused on. 

Composition and Committee Changes
The Committee is made up entirely of 
Independent Non-Executive Directors and 
each member has considerable commercial 
knowledge and broad industry expertise. 

I satisfy the requirement of the UK Corporate 
Governance Code 2018 (the Code) to bring 
recent and relevant financial experience to the 
Committee, and the Committee also benefits 
from the additional financial expertise and 
experience provided by both Simon Fraser 
and Linda Yueh as well as the wealth of 
property experience brought by Sue Clayton. 

There have been a number of planned 
changes to the Committee during the year:

 – As you will have read on page 93, the Board 
reviewed Committee membership during 
the year to ensure the most efficient use of 
resources and, following the review, Mary 
Barnard stepped down as a member of the 
Committee on 1 July 2023.

 – Having served nine years as an Independent 

Non-Executive Director, Martin Moore 
stepped down from the Board and the 
Committee at the end of the year.

I would like to extend my thanks to both Martin 
and Mary for their valuable contributions and 
support to the Committee during their tenure.

The Board remains satisfied that the 
Committee as a whole has the relevant 
competence and appropriate balance of 
skills and experience to properly discharge 
its duties.

Meetings
The Committee met formally three times 
during the year and provided updates to the 
Board on its activities at each subsequent 
meeting. Outside of the scheduled meetings, 
we can also use time set aside for Board 
meetings to discuss any matters that arise in 
real time. We feel that this is the appropriate 
balance of scheduled meetings and time 
available for ad hoc discussion, however 
should the need arise, additional formal 
meetings would be convened. 

As usual, our external and internal auditors 
joined the meetings throughout the year, 
together with a number of employees from 
across the business. We continue to find this 
incredibly valuable as it allows us to see the 
pool of talent within the Company and 
facilitates a greater depth of discussion 
and debate on some specialist topics. 

In 2023, we were joined by:
 – the Head of Finance for the Group and 

Head of Financial Reporting to consider the 
accounting judgements and treatments that 
have been adopted for particular 
transactions;

 – the Head of Legal, who provided updates on 
relevant legal and regulatory matters as well 
as the status of material litigation matters 
impacting the Group; 

 – the Head of Tax, who provided an update on 
developments in the current tax landscape, 
the Group’s tax strategy and an overview of 
significant tax issues or changes that could 
potentially impact the Group’s tax charge;

 – the Head of Technology, who delivered his 
annual update on developments in cyber 
security threats, the continued investments 
by the Company in response, and the 
current status of cyber security defences; 
and

 – the Commercial Finance Director and 

Director of Sustainability, who shared an 
update on sustainability matters and the 
evolving reporting requirements in respect 
of ESG.

Regular updates were also provided to the 
Committee on the risk management process, 
internal controls and anti-bribery and 
corruption matters.

In addition to scheduled meetings, I speak 
regularly with the Chief Financial Officer, Head 
of Finance for the Group and Head of Legal 
and Company Secretary to discuss any topical 
issues that should be brought to the attention 
of the Committee. 

Areas of focus in 2023
A comprehensive list of the Committee's 
activities in 2023 can be found on the right. 
Some highlights included:
 – oversight of the transition of lead audit 

partner;

 – reviewing the recognition of the SELP 

performance fee; and

 – considering the evolving requirements 
for the Group in relation to forthcoming 
European standards on sustainability 
reporting.

Committee effectiveness
As part of the internal Board evaluation 
process, the operation of the Committee was 
considered (see pages 93 and 94) and was 
deemed to be operating effectively. 

Discharge of responsibilities
The quality of debate and challenge amongst 
the Committee, management and the internal 
and external audit teams, together with the 
comprehensive information provided to the 
Committee, has assisted us in appropriately 
discharging our responsibility. 

I would like to thank all those who have 
contributed to the Committee this year for 
their efforts. 

Looking ahead
In 2024, the Committee will: 
 – respond to new legislation and guidance 

affecting the Group as it becomes available, 
including the incoming Economic Crime 
Act, the updated UK Corporate Governance 
Code 2024 and the Revised Ethical Standard 
for audit engagements; 

 – continue to review and respond to the 
evolving regulatory landscape around 
corporate sustainability reporting; and 

 – consider the implications of the RICS 

mandatory requirement for the periodic 
rotation of UK external valuers which comes 
into force in May 2026, following a two-year 
transition period.

Committee or the contents of this Report,

Chair of the Audit Committee

What the Committee did in 2023

Throughout the year, the Committee has:
 – reviewed and monitored the integrity 
of the Financial Statements including 
reviewing significant financial reporting 
judgements and estimates made by 
management, to ensure that the quality 
of the Company’s financial reporting is 
maintained, in the Company’s Half- 
and Full-Year Financial Statements;

 – assessed the objectivity, independence 

and competence of the external valuer of 
the Group’s property portfolio and gained 
assurance around the valuation process;

 – ensured compliance with applicable 
accounting standards, monitoring 
developments in accounting regulations 
as they affect the Group and reviewing the 
appropriateness of accounting polices 
and practices in place;

 – received a briefing on the Committee's 
evolving responsibilities concerning 
non-financial and sustainability data 
reporting and governance under 
forthcoming European and international 
regulations and accounting standards;

 – monitored matters relating to tax, 

including REIT status and other significant 
open matters;

 – reviewed the recognition of the 

performance fee received from SELP;

 – monitored the effectiveness of the 

Group’s risk management systems and 
considered the adequacy of the process 
being undertaken to identify risks and 
mitigate the exposure of the Group to 
them;

 – reviewed cyber security processes and 
the continued investment in this area to 
respond to increasing trends in cyber 
threats; 

 – ensured the processes followed to 

support the making of the going concern 
and viability statements remained robust 
and were correctly followed;

 – ensured appropriate safeguards were 
in place for the detection of fraud and 
prevention of bribery. This extends 
to responsibility for overseeing and 
monitoring the Group’s Anti-Bribery 
and Corruption policies and procedures 
contained in the Company’s Code of 
Business Conduct and Ethics;

 – reviewed the adequacy of internal 

financial controls and broader internal 
control systems;

 – oversaw the process for transition 
of the lead external audit partner; 
 – examined the performance of the 
external and internal auditors, their 
objectivity, effectiveness and 
independence, as well as the terms 
of their engagement and scope of 
the external and internal audit plans; 
 – reviewed and re-approved the Policy 

for Approval of Non-Audit fees; 

 – monitored the ratio and level of audit to 

non-audit fees paid to the external auditor 
and agreed their remuneration for the 
year; 

 – analysed and challenged the results of 

internal audit reviews and management’s 
plans to resolve any actions arising from 
them; and

 – advised the Board on whether the process 
supporting the preparation of the Annual 
Report taken as a whole, is appropriate to 
allow the Board to conclude that the 
Annual Report is fair, balanced and 
understandable and provides the 
information necessary to shareholders to 
assess the Group’s position, performance, 
business model and strategy.

Audit, risk and internal controls 
Audit Committee Report continued

Financial reporting process

Viability statement and going concern

Fair, balanced and understandable

The Committee is responsible for ensuring 
that the process put in place to allow the 
Board to make the viability statement on 
page 65 remains robust, in line with market 
practice and is correctly and properly 
followed. 

The Committee reviewed the process which 
included extended scenario analysis and is 
comfortable with the process followed to 
make the viability statement and has 
confirmed this to the Board. 

The Committee reviewed the 
recommendation setting out the support 
for adopting the going concern basis in 
preparing the financial statements. The 
Committee confirmed to the Board that 
the recommendation was appropriate. The 
Board’s statement is set out on page 50.

The Code requires the Board to confirm 
that they consider that the Annual Report, 
taken as a whole, is fair, balanced and 
understandable and provides the 
information necessary for shareholders 
to assess the Company’s position, 
performance, business model and strategy.

In order to enable the Board to make this 
confirmation, the Audit Committee has 
oversight of the process which has been 
followed, whereby the section owners and 
an independent reviewer confirm that in 
their opinion and against an agreed list of 
criteria the Annual Report is fair, balanced 
and understandable. 

These criteria include: 
 – is the whole story presented, with key 
messages appropriately reflected?; 
 – does the Report properly provide the 

necessary information, with a good level 
of consistency, for stakeholders to assess 
SEGRO as a business?; and 

 – is the Report presented in straightforward 
language, easy to understand and within a 
clear framework?

The Committee reviewed the process that 
management had undertaken to make the 
statement, which included regular meetings 
of the Annual Report and Accounts Working 
Group during the drafting process to ensure 
a consistent approach, and confirmed to 
the Board that the processes and controls 
around the preparation of the Annual 
Report are appropriate, robust and 
consistent.

The fair, balanced and understandable 
statement is made on page 133.

A key area of responsibility for the 
Committee is the monitoring of the integrity 
of the Company’s Financial Statements and 
any formal announcements relating to the 
Company’s financial performance, as well 
as reviewing any significant financial 
reporting issues and judgements 
contained therein.

The Group has long-established internal 
controls and risk management systems in 
relation to the process for preparing the 
Financial Statements. Various checks on 
internal financial controls take place 
throughout the year, including internal 
audits which are detailed further on page 
106. Developments in accounting 
regulations and best practice in financial 
reporting are monitored by the Company 
and, where appropriate, reflected in the 
Financial Statements. Training is also 
provided to the finance teams and the 
Committee is kept appropriately informed.

The financial reporting from each Business 
Unit is reviewed by a local Finance Director 
prior to being submitted to the Group 
Finance function. The results of each 
Business Unit are subject to further review 
by the Group Finance function before being 
consolidated by Group Finance and are 
subject to various levels of review including 
by senior members of the Finance team. 
The draft consolidated statements are 
reviewed by various individuals including 
those independent of the preparer. The 
review includes checking consistency 
internally, with other statements and with 
internal accounting records.

The Committee receives reports from 
management and the auditor on significant 
judgements, changes in accounting 
policies, and other relevant matters relating 
to the consolidated Financial Statements. 

The Committee and the Board review the 
draft consolidated Financial Statements.

Significant judgements made by the Committee in 2023

Significant matter

The action taken

Valuation of the property portfolio
Valuation is central to the business' performance and is a significant estimate for the 
Committee as it is inherently subjective, because the valuer must make assumptions 
and judgements in reaching its conclusions. 

This is a recurring risk for the Group as it is key to its IFRS profitability, balance sheet 
portfolio value, net asset value, total property return, and employee incentives. It also 
affects investment decisions and the implementation of the Company’s Disciplined 
Capital Allocation policy. 

The Committee ensured that there was a robust process in place to satisfy itself that the valuation of the property portfolio by 
CBRE, a leading firm in the UK and Continental European property markets, was carried out appropriately and independently. 

The Chair of the Audit Committee met separately with CBRE in advance of the Committee meetings to review the valuation 
process in detail and ensure the valuer remained independent, objective and effective. 

Given the significance of this judgement, as in previous years, the full Board also met twice with CBRE to review, challenge, 
debate and consider the valuation process; understand any particular issues encountered in the valuation; understand the 
impact of climate change and sustainability requirements on valuations; and discuss the processes and methodologies used. 

It is included on the Risk Register and the process risk map as a potential key business 
risk.

The auditors also meet with the valuers, and they use the services of their own in-house property valuation expert to test the 
assumptions made by CBRE. They report to the Audit Committee on their findings. 

  For further information see page 135

The Committee confirmed that it was satisfied that the valuation was not subject to undue influence and had been carried 
out fairly and appropriately, and in accordance with the industry valuation standards, and therefore suitable for inclusion in 
the Financial Statements. 

For details of the Group’s properties and related accounting policies see Note 13 and Note 1 of the Financial Statements. For 
details of the results of the valuation see Note 13 of the Financial Statements.

Audit, risk and internal controls 
Audit Committee Report continued

External auditor

Following a tender in 2015, 
PricewaterhouseCoopers LLP (PwC) has 
served as the Company’s external auditor 
since 2016, and the Committee continues 
to enjoy a constructive working relationship 
with them. 

As highlighted in last year's Report, our 
previous external audit partner retired 
from PwC in 2023 and the Committee 
welcomed Richard Porter into the role. 
Richard has been supported by a strong 
team already familiar with the Company, 
and the Committee is satisfied that there 
has been a smooth and effective transition 
of audit partners. 

The Committee Chair has had regular 
discussions with Richard and his PwC 
colleagues to consider matters as they arise 
throughout the year and the Committee 
regularly meets privately with Richard to 
discuss PwC’s work and observations on the 
Company. No areas of concern were raised 
during the year.

Oversight
PwC presented their audit plan for the year 
which the Committee considered and 
approved. The key areas of risk, which were 
primarily identified as areas of judgement 
and complexity, were highlighted by PwC 
and were consistent with those areas 
identified by the Committee. 

The level of audit materiality was also 
discussed and agreed.

PwC presented a detailed report of their audit 
findings at the year end, which were reviewed 
and discussed. A review of the external 
auditor’s report was also undertaken by the 
Committee at the half year. As part of the 
reviews the Committee probed and 
challenged the work undertaken and the 
findings and the key assumptions made, 
with particular attention to the areas of 
audit risk identified.

Effectiveness
The Committee assesses the effectiveness of 
the external audit process on an annual basis, 
by taking account of the views of 
management involved in the audit and by 
reviewing a number of factors including:
 – performance in discharging the audit and 

half-year review;

 – independence and objectivity; 
 – robustness of the audit process, including 

how the auditor demonstrated professional 
scepticism and challenged management’s 
assumptions particularly in relation to the 
valuation of the Group’s portfolio; 

 – the quality of service and delivery, including 

appropriate resources and skills for the 
complexity of SEGRO’s audit; and
 – reappointment and remuneration.

The Committee also noted the results of the 
PwC Audit Quality Review inspection results 
2022/23.

Independence
The Company complies with the Competition 
and Markets Authority Order 2014 relating to 
audit tendering and the provision of non-audit 
services. There are no contractual obligations 
which restrict the Committee’s choice of 
external auditor or which put in place a 
minimum period for their tenure. The external 
audit was last tendered in 2015 following 
which the auditor changed in 2016 from 
Deloitte LLP to PwC. 

The Committee has no current plans to 
re-tender the services of the external auditor 
before it is required in 2025, as stipulated by 
current regulation that requires a tender 
every 10 years. 

The Committee believes that the audit quality 
and process benefits from the continuity, 
stability and understanding of the business 
by the PwC team, with an appropriate level 
of challenge.

Remuneration 
The Committee considers the remuneration 
of the external auditor at least on a semi-
annual basis and approves its remuneration. 
It also keeps under close review the ratio of 
audit to non-audit fees to ensure that the 
independence and objectivity of the external 
auditor are safeguarded.

In 2023, fees for audit services amounted to 
£1.39 million and the non-audit fees amounted 
to £0.19 million. 

The decrease in non-audit fees from 2022 to 
2023 is due to the engagement of PwC on 
debt offerings in 2022 and not in 2023. It is 
standard practice for a Company's external 
auditor to undertake this engagement. 

The non-audit fee for 2023 equates to 15 per 
cent of the average audit fees of the last 
three years.

The chart below sets out the ratio of audit to 
non-audit fees for each of the past three years:

The Committee has concluded that PwC 
remains independent and objective, and 
that the level of non-audit to audit fees is 
acceptable for 2023. PwC has provided 
written confirmation of its independence 
to the Committee. 

We have voluntarily provided details on the 
fees relating to the audit of the Group’s SELP 
joint venture with PSP Investments, for which 
PwC is the auditor, in Note 6(ii) to the Financial 
Statements. The Committee has no oversight 
or control over these fees as the SELP joint 
venture operates totally independently and 
is not controlled by the SEGRO Group or the 
Committee. The fees are provided solely for 
information purposes and do not form part 
of the audit fees nor are they included in the 
calculation to determine the ratio of audit to 
non-audit fees on an annual or three-year 
basis for the SEGRO Group.

Policy for approval of non-audit fees
The Committee considers the Policy for 
Approval of Non-Audit Fees on an annual 
basis to ensure that it remains fit for purpose. 
The Policy, which is available on our website at 
www.SEGRO.com, was updated in February 
2023 to reflect the latest updates to the 
International Code of Ethics for Professional 
Accounts (including International 
Independence Standards) issued by the 
International Ethics Standard Board for 
Accounts (IESBA) and in February 2024 in 
preparation for the work that will be carried 
out by PwC in respect of statutory reporting 
required by the Corporate Sustainability 
Reporting Directive. 

The Committee is satisfied that the Policy 
is appropriate and in line with industry 
best practice.

External auditor continued

Internal auditor

Valuers

The Policy sets out the very limited 
circumstances where PwC may be appointed 
to carry out non-audit services but only with 
the prior consent of the Committee or the 
Committee Chair, through delegation of 
authority from the Committee. There must be 
an obvious and compelling reason why PwC 
should be appointed and there should be no 
threat to the independence of PwC. 

The impact on non-audit to audit fees must 
also be considered, and fees incurred for 
non-audit work must not exceed 70 per cent 
of the average of the audit fees paid for the 
last three consecutive years. All non-audit fees 
are reported to the Committee.

Re-appointment
Taking into account the views of management 
involved in the audit, the Committee was 
satisfied with the performance of PwC on the 
basis of the above and recommended to the 
Board that it propose to shareholders at the 
2024 Annual General Meeting that PwC 
should be reappointed for the 2024 
financial year.

We are aware of the requirements of the 
Audit Committees and External Audit: 
Minimum Standards as published by the 
FRC in May 2023 and, whilst these do not 
apply at the date of this report, the Group will 
comply with these requirements which will be 
particularly relevant during any forthcoming 
audit tender processes.

The Committee believes that given the 
Company’s size and structure using a third 
party to perform the internal audit function 
continues to be the most appropriate model. 
This provides independent challenge of 
management and gives access to a wide 
range of expertise. 

Each internal audit during 2023 confirmed 
that no significant control issues were 
identified. However, a number of process 
and minor control improvement points were 
identified with follow up actions and timelines 
which were regularly monitored by 
management and the Committee.

Feedback on the performance of KPMG for 
each internal audit is given by the Company 
and was largely positive and no areas of 
particular concern have been brought to 
the Committee’s attention. The lead KPMG 
partner attends Committee meetings to 
present its report and the Committee also 
meets privately with him during the year. 
No matters of concern were raised in the 
private meetings.

Effectiveness of internal audit
The Committee believes that both the process 
for determining the internal audit programme, 
and the programme itself, are appropriate and 
effective, and as in previous years the 
programme will be amended during the year 
if required to react to any new events or 
information. 

The Committee is satisfied that the internal 
audit function continues to perform 
effectively. 

KPMG has performed the role since its 
appointment in 2007 and re-appointments 
in 2014 and 2022 following a tender.

During their tenure, there have been a number 
of rotations of lead partners and audit 
managers to ensure that a fresh perspective 
is given, and their independence and scrutiny 
are maintained.

Topics included in the internal audit plan for 
2023 were selected based on a review of the 
Group’s principal risks, the timing of the 
previous audit and advice on market insights 
from KPMG. Significant areas of risk are 
subject to internal audit on a cyclical basis. 

The proposed internal audit plan for 2023 was 
considered and approved by the Committee 
in December 2022, and was kept under review 
during the course of the year. 

Internal audits during 2023 included:
 – Valuation;
 – Corporate Tax;
 – Land Disposals;
 – Developments;
 – Treasury;
 – Oversight of third-party IT suppliers; and
 – Small country audit.

The single most important judgement that the 
Committee and the Board has to make is the 
value of the Group’s portfolio. The Committee 
is assisted in reaching this judgement by its 
external valuer CBRE, which has held this 
position since 2012. CBRE was reappointed 
in 2021 for a further four-year term, and the 
Committee believes that it continues to be 
effective in its role. 

The effectiveness of the Group’s valuers is 
assessed through regular meetings during the 
year with the Chair of the Audit Committee 
and supplemented by additional sessions with 
management, which focused on the following:
 – independence and objectivity;
 – experience and qualification of the valuation 

team;

 – consistency of approach across each of the 
countries in which the Group operates; and
 – quality of data and materials, including the 

two presentations to the Board.

As a result, the Committee concluded that the 
external valuers performed to a high standard, 
were independent, and that the well-run 
process delivered a robust set of valuations.

The Committee is cognisant of the new RICS 
(Royal Institute of Chartered Surveyors) rules 
requiring the periodic rotation of valuers in the 
UK, which will come into force on 1 May 2024 
and require a change to the Company’s valuer 
every 10 years. The Committee will consider 
how to prepare for this requirement (which will 
come into effect for SEGRO in 2025/2026) in 
the coming year.

Audit, risk and internal controls 
Audit Committee Report continued

Internal controls and risk management

Risk
The Board recognises that effective risk 
management is key to the long-term 
sustainable success and future growth of the 
business and the achievement of the Group’s 
strategic objectives (see pages 54 to 57). It is 
ever aware of the need to ensure that new 
and emerging risks, as well as the more 
established principal risks, are adequately 
managed and mitigated. Risk management 
is therefore embedded in the Company’s 
decision making and culture, and robust 
systems have been put in place to ensure 
this remains the case.

There is an ongoing process for identifying, 
evaluating and managing the principal risks 
faced by the Group, which has been in place 
during the year, together with the means for 
identifying those emerging risks which may 
impact the Group in the future. These 
emerging risks are discussed throughout the 
business by the appropriate working groups, 
conducting both horizon scanning and 
discussions at a more granular level. 
The Group Risk Committee monitors and 
reports on the Company’s approach to risk 
management as detailed further on page 54. 

The Board assumes responsibility for the 
effective management of risk across the 
Group, determined by its risk appetite, as 
well as ensuring that each business area 
implements appropriate internal controls. The 
Committee reviews regularly the effectiveness 
of the risk management process on behalf of 
the Board and is satisfied that it remains 
robust for the financial year in question 
and up to the date of this Annual Report. 

Internal controls
The Committee is responsible for reviewing 
the adequacy and effectiveness of internal 
control systems, (covering all material controls 
including financial, operational and 
compliance controls and risk management 
systems) on behalf of the Board. 

Outcome
The framework for monitoring and 
maintaining internal controls is considered 
appropriate for a Group of SEGRO’s size and 
complexity and is designed to provide 
reasonable assurance against material 
misstatement or loss. 

At each meeting, the Committee receives 
an update on internal controls and regularly 
reviews the adequacy and effectiveness of 
the Group’s internal control systems through 
various activities including:
 – reviewing the effectiveness of the risk 

management process;

 – reviewing and challenging management’s 
self-assessment of the internal controls 
framework; and

 – reviewing the work undertaken by the 
internal and external auditor, in relation 
to internal controls.

On the basis of the Committee’s work, it 
confirms that it has not been advised of, or 
identified, any failings or weaknesses which 
it regards to be significant in relation to the 
Group’s internal control systems during the 
year. It also confirms that the Group’s internal 
control systems have been in place for the 
year under review and up to the date of 
approval of this Annual Report and are in 
accordance with the Guidance on Risk 
Management, Internal Control and Related 
Financial and Business Reporting issued by 
the Financial Reporting Council. 

The Committee also receives at each 
meeting an anti-bribery and corruption 
report to enable it to satisfy its responsibility 
for ensuring that adequate safeguards for the 
detection of fraud and prevention of bribery 
are in place. Details of how matters of concern 
can be reported and will be investigated are 
on page 88.

During the year, the Committee received a 
report of one whistleblowing allegation which, 
following a thorough investigation, was found 
to be not material and unsubstantiated.

Dear shareholder,

On behalf of the Board, I am pleased to 
present our Remuneration Report for 2023.

The role of the Remuneration Committee 
(the Committee) is to determine the 
remuneration policies and practices which 
promote the long-term sustainable success 
of the Company, which are aligned with 
the Company’s Purpose and Values and 
its strategy.

In the following pages you will see how the 
Committee has discharged its responsibilities 
as well as other key areas of focus in 2023.

Composition and Committee meetings
The Committee continues to be comprised 
entirely of Independent Non-Executive 
Directors. Martin Moore retired from the 
Board and stepped down as a member of 
the Remuneration Committee with effect 
from 31 December 2023. On behalf of the 
Committee, we would like to thank Martin 
for his valuable contribution during his 
tenure. There were no other changes to 
the composition of the Committee during 
the year.  

The Committee had three scheduled 
meetings during the year and Committee 
member attendance can be found on page 
83. The Chief Executive, Group HR Director 
and external remuneration adviser attend 
Committee meetings by invitation as 
required. Following each Committee 
meeting, I provide an update to the Board 
on the Committee’s activities. 

Key areas of focus in 2023
Following the retirement of Andy Gulliford 
as Chief Operating Officer and Executive 
Director on 30 June 2023 and the subsequent 
organisational changes, the Committee 
reviewed the remuneration arrangements of 
the new Executive Committee and Leadership 
team. Full details of Andy’s exit arrangements 
can be found on page 124.  

During the year, the Committee approved 
the Executive Directors’ variable remuneration 
and annual salary increases and assessed the 
variable targets prior to the LTIP vesting to 
ensure the outcomes represented a fair 
reflection of the business performance 
throughout the performance period. 

The Committee also approved the grant of 
awards under the Company’s all-employee 
schemes and reviewed the wider workforce 
remuneration framework to ensure this 
remained aligned with the structure of 
remuneration for the Executive Directors.

Remuneration and alignment to Company 
performance
As covered elsewhere within this Annual 
Report, 2023 provided a challenging market 
environment characterised by weak economic 
growth, stubborn inflation and geopolitical 
instability. Central banks continued to hike 
interest rates well into the second half of the 
year, which impacted property investment 
markets as the uncertainty around where rates 
would settle longer term left potential buyers 
unable to accurately assess future returns. 
Investment volumes remained low as a 
result and yield expansion drove further falls 
in asset values, albeit at a more moderate 
pace than in 2022. 

Despite the more challenging macroeconomic 
environment, SEGRO delivered strong 
operational results during 2023, helped by 
the long-term structural drivers at play in 
our sector. These ensured resilient levels of 
occupier demand for our prime, well-located 
and sustainable space, whilst supply in our 
chosen markets remained limited. This 
supply-demand tension, along with the 
active asset management of our prime 
portfolio, helped us to deliver further rental 
growth, capture a significant amount of 
reversion and expand our development 
programme, all of which contributed to 
income and earnings growth.

Remuneration 
Remuneration Committee Report continued

Adjusted profit before tax (Adjusted PBT) 
increased by 6.0 per cent to £409 million 
and adjusted earnings per share increased by 
5.5 per cent to 32.7 pence. Adjusted NAV per 
share has fallen by 6.1 per cent to 907 pence, 
reflecting the decline in the value of our 
portfolio. The balance sheet remains in 
good shape with a loan to value ratio of 
34.0 per cent. The Board is recommending a 
final dividend of 19.1 pence per share, making 
the full year dividend 27.8 pence per share, an 
increase of 5.7 per cent.  

Further information on the Company’s 
performance during the year can be found in 
the Chief Executive’s statement on pages 8 to 
11 and the Strategic Report on pages 6 to 75.  

A summary of the Group’s key financial 
metrics relating to Executive remuneration 
in 2023 can be found on page 110 and 
information regarding the alignment of 
remuneration outcomes to our strategy 
and performance can be found on page 117. 

Remuneration in 2023
Directors’ remuneration in 2023 was paid 
in line with the Company’s existing 
Remuneration Policy (the Policy), which was 
approved by shareholders at the 2022 AGM.  

The remuneration framework for both our 
Executive Directors and the wider workforce 
is aligned with the strategic direction and 
performance of SEGRO as well as the interests 
of our stakeholders, and this is set out in the 
charts on pages 117 and 118. 

As indicated on page 118, the 2023 annual 
bonus for the wider workforce is aligned to 
Group-wide Adjusted PBT, rent roll growth 
(RRG), ESG measures, as well as the 
achievement of personal objectives. The 
weighting of the personal performance 
measure varies based on seniority and makes 
up a larger percentage of bonus measures for 
more junior employees, allowing for sufficient 
opportunity to recognise individual 
performance as well as Company financial 
and operational performance in the annual 
bonus structure. 

In light of the difficult macroeconomic 
conditions, the Committee and Executive 
Committee continued to ensure that the 
remuneration framework remained fit for 
purpose to adequately support our workforce. 
Further details can be found on page 117.

Following his retirement from the Board and 
the Company on 30 June 2023, Andy Gulliford 
was paid in line with the Policy. This entitled 
him to participate in the bonus for the first six 
months of the year and retain the time 
prorated proportion of the LTIP awards he has 
been awarded. None of these payments were 
accelerated and he is required to retain 
SEGRO shares with a value of at least 2.5 times 
his salary until 30 June 2025. He ceased to be 
paid his salary and all other benefits (which 
include cash allowances in lieu of a company 
car, company pension and private medical 
healthcare) from 30 June 2023 and received a 
payment for accrued but unused holiday as at 
30 June 2023. Further details can be found on 
page 124.

Variable remuneration
Taking into account our strong operational 
results and our performance versus the 
financial and non-financial KPIs that were 
within management's control during a year 
of continued macroeconomic uncertainty, 
the Committee has confirmed the following 
performance-related payments to the 
Executive Directors: 

 – 2023 annual bonus 

The annual bonus payment will be 81.6 per 
cent of their maximum award (see page 113).

 – 2021 LTIP performance 

The LTIP structure is designed to ensure that 
senior management reward is well aligned 
with shareholder returns. Vesting is 
calculated by reference to three equally-
weighted performance conditions. We 
anticipate that the 2021 LTIP award will pay 
out 62.7 per cent (subject to the final TPR and 
TAR data being available) (see page 114). 
These awards are subject to a two-year 
post-vesting holding period. The net amount 
of shares will be released at the end of the 
holding period in 2026. 

The TSR component of the 2021 LTIP will 
not vest due to the underperformance of 
SEGRO’s shares compared to the benchmark 
over the three-year period; although the 
shares outperformed the benchmark in 2021 
and 2023, it was not enough to outweigh the 
underperformance in 2022 as industrial 
property values adjusted more than other 
types of real estate due to the higher 
interest rate environment.

 – Exercise of discretion and judgement 

Given the Company’s performance during 
the year, the Committee considered that 
it was appropriate that the variable 
components of remuneration for the 
Executive Directors pay out in accordance 
with the level at which their respective 
performance conditions have been met. 

When approving these payments and 
awards, the Committee considered whether 
or not they represented a fair reflection of 
the underlying performance of the business. 
The Committee was satisfied that the 
performance conditions were reflective 
of the business performance and that no 
overriding adjustment would have been 
appropriate. The Committee did not exercise 
discretion in relation to the operation of the 
Policy during the year.

 – 2023 LTIP award 

The Chief Executive and Chief Financial 
Officer received an LTIP award in March 2023 
with three equally-weighted performance 
conditions in line with the Policy. Further 
details can be found on page 115.

Remuneration in 2024
A major area of focus for the Committee 
in the upcoming year will be a review of the 
current Remuneration Policy, which we will be 
recommending to shareholders for approval 
at the 2025 AGM (the 2025 Policy). The 
Committee is committed to understanding 
shareholder views relating to remuneration 
policy and in our 2022 review of policy, we 
consulted with holders of approximately 
65 per cent of our shares. During 2024, we 
will begin the consultation process to include 
our shareholders and key proxy advisory 
agencies, and will also ensure our 
employees are well informed of any 
proposed policy changes. 

Salary reviews
The Committee reviewed the salaries of 
Executive Directors taking into consideration 
the increases for all other employees as part 
of the process. Our salary budget is 
approximately five per cent higher for 2024 
than 2023, excluding the impact of changes in 
employee numbers. The highest increases are 
being awarded where salary levels are below 
mid-market ranges and in countries where 
inflation remains highest. 

Reflecting their performance and that of 
the business, we have approved salary 
increases of approximately two per cent 
for the Executive Directors to take effect 
from 1 April 2024 (see page 111).

2024 bonus targets
Targets for the annual bonus are set by the 
Committee at the beginning of the year. The 
weighting of the annual bonus performance 
measures are made up of 75 per cent for 
financial measures, comprising Adjusted PBT 
(37.5 per cent) and RRG (37.5 per cent, made 
up of 18.75 per cent standing (existing) stock 
and 18.75 per cent development), and 
25 per cent non-financial measures linked 
to our Responsible SEGRO (ESG) ambitions. 
Following a review of the metrics used to 
calculate the bonus elements and their 
alignment to the Company’s strategy, the 
Committee concluded that some adjustments 
to the RRG and ESG measures were 
appropriate.

Conclusion
The Remuneration Report will be submitted to 
shareholders at the 2024 AGM. I am grateful 
for the level of support and engagement from 
shareholders during 2023 and look forward to 
continuing this engagement throughout 2024 
as we develop our 2025 Policy.

I will also be attending the 2024 AGM and will 
be pleased to answer any questions you may 
have about the work of the Committee.

Simon Fraser
Chair of the Remuneration Committee

 – Previously, the RRG target was set as a single 
figure at the total level including growth in 
absolute rents from developments and 
standing (existing) stock. In 2024, these 
elements will be separated. Whilst the 
overall portion of the bonus assigned to 
RRG will remain the same (37.5 per cent), 
there will now be separate targets assigned 
to standing (existing) stock (18.75 per cent) 
and development (18.75 per cent). The 
Committee recognises that the balance of 
RRG changes through the business cycle, 
particularly as developments can dominate 
RRG at times. As a result, the Committee has 
decided to split RRG between standing 
(existing) stock and new developments to 
ensure that the business as a whole is better 
incentivised to deliver growth from both 
sources. This change will make the overall 
RRG element more difficult to achieve, but 
in turn should help to drive the highest 
possible RRG for the Group. 

 – Having introduced ESG measures into 

remuneration in 2022, the Group has made 
significant progress in delivering its 
Responsible SEGRO ambitions. As a result, 
the Committee concluded that reducing the 
number of measures within this element 
(from six to four) would be appropriate to 
ensure continued focus on our more 
stretching goals. In 2024, the ESG measures 
will include a continued focus on carbon 
reduction, customer service and diversity 
and inclusion. The ESG measures will 
continue to make up 25 per cent of the 
overall bonus for Executive Directors. 

The 2024 bonus remains in line with Policy.

2024 LTIP awards
The Committee anticipates that the 2024 LTIP 
awards will be granted in March 2024 in line 
with the Policy. The level of award will be 
determined at the time of grant and the 
Committee will assess then whether a scale 
back in the normal LTIP grant level is 
appropriate based on the share price at the 
time of grant, compared to recent years’ 
prices. It will also consider whether a windfall 
gain assessment should be considered after 
the grant.

If the normal annual level remains appropriate 
then this is expected to be 300 per cent of 
salary for the Chief Executive and 250 per 
cent of salary for the Chief Financial Officer.

Stakeholder engagement
In November 2023, our Head of Investor 
Relations and Deputy Company Secretary met 
with the stewardship and governance teams 
at some of our largest shareholders to discuss 
governance related topics. This included the 
opportunity for shareholders to provide 
feedback on our current Executive Director 
remuneration structure, which will be 
considered as we develop the 2025 Policy. 
Our Chair of the Board, Andy Harrison, also 
wrote to ten of our largest shareholders to 
offer the opportunity to meet with him and 
me, as Committee Chair, in respect of any 
remuneration related matters. 

In May 2023, we also sought the views of our 
own workforce on Executive remuneration 
during a dedicated workforce engagement 
session which I led with our Audit Committee 
Chair, Carol Fairweather. Further details of this 
can be found on page 119.

Committee effectiveness
As part of the internal Board evaluation 
process, the operation of the Committee was 
considered and it was concluded that the 
Committee continues to operate effectively in 
accordance with its terms of reference, which 
are available to view at www.SEGRO.com. 

Looking ahead
The key areas of focus for the Committee in 
2024 will be:

 – developing the 2025 Policy and launching 
the shareholder consultation process later 
in the year; 

 – consideration of ongoing inflationary 
conditions and the impact of cost of 
living for the wider workforce; 

 – ensuring that the vesting of long-term 

incentives in 2024 accurately reflects the 
performance of the Executive Directors and 
the experience of stakeholders; 

What the Committee did in 2023

Throughout the year, the Committee has:
 – approved the Executive Directors’ annual 

salary increases, approved the 2022 
bonus payments and the outturn of the 
2020 LTIP awards, along with the 2023 
bonus and 2023 LTIP targets;

 – approved the 2023 SIP, GSIP and 

Sharesave awards and approved a new

Executive Directors

Salary

LTIP Award

Fees

Chair and Non-Executive Directors

From 1 April 2024, the Executive Directors will receive an increase in 
salary of approximately two per cent.

The 2024 LTIP award for Executive Directors will be subject to the 
following equally-weighted performance conditions:

Bonus

The maximum bonus opportunity in 2024 is 150 per cent of salary 
as at 31 December 2024 and is subject to the following three 
performance conditions:
 – Profit – Adjusted PBT against target (37.5 per cent)
 – Rent Roll Growth (RRG) against target (37.5 per cent), split 
between Standing (Existing) Stock (18.75 per cent) and 
Development (18.75 per cent)

 – ESG (25 per cent) 

The Committee amended the RRG element for the 2024 bonus 
target. Whilst the overall portion of the bonus assigned to RRG will 
remain the same (37.5 per cent), there will now be separate targets 
assigned to Standing (Existing) Stock (18.75 per cent) and 
Development (18.75 per cent). See page 109 for further details 
including the rationale for this change, which will be reflected 
through the Company-wide bonus scheme.

Any payments to be made under this bonus will be payable in 2025. 
As targets are commercially sensitive, they are not disclosed at this 
time but will be in next year’s Report. 

50 per cent of the 2024 bonus will be deferred into shares under the 
DSBP. The 2024 DSBP will vest in April 2028, on the third anniversary 
of the payment of the 2024 bonus.

Pension

Executive Directors will receive cash in lieu of pension to the 
value of 12 per cent of their base salaries, which is in line with 
the UK workforce.

Total Shareholder Return (TSR)
This benchmark is based on the market capitalisation weighted 
TSR of the FTSE 350 REIT index, excluding SEGRO.

20 per cent of this element vests if the Company’s TSR over the 
performance period is in line with benchmark TSR, rising on a 
straight line basis to 100 per cent vesting if the benchmark is 
exceeded by 6 per cent or more per annum.

Total Property Return (TPR)
This benchmark is based on the MSCI All Industrial Country 
benchmarks weighted to reflect the approximate geographical 
mix of the Group’s portfolio.

20 per cent of this element vests if the Company’s TPR over the 
performance period is in line with the MSCI benchmark, rising on 
a straight-line basis to 100 per cent if the MSCI benchmark is 
exceeded by 1.5 per cent or more per annum.

Total Accounting Return (TAR)
This benchmark is based on the market capitalisation weighted 
TAR of other FTSE 350 REITs.

20 per cent of this element vests if the Company’s TAR over the 
performance period is in line with benchmark TAR, rising on a 
straight-line basis to 100 per cent vesting if the benchmark is 
exceeded by 2.5 per cent or more per annum.

These awards will be calculated as a percentage of Executive 
Directors’ salaries as at 31 December 2023 and will be granted during 
2024. In line with the Policy, the Chief Executive will receive a 
maximum LTIP award of 300 per cent of salary and the Chief Financial 
Officer will receive a maximum award of 250 per cent of salary.

Dividends will accrue on the gross number of LTIP shares which are 
released. The Committee will decide whether this payment will be 
made in cash or shares.

Fees for the Chair and Non-Executive Directors are reviewed on an 
annual basis. The review of the fees paid to the Chair is within the 
remit of the Committee, whilst the review of Non-Executive 
Directors’ fees is a matter for the Board in the absence of the 
Non-Executive Directors. 

With effect from 1 January 2024, the Chair and Non-Executive 
Directors’ fees were increased by two per cent throughout, and 
were aligned to the Executive Directors’ pay increment. The Chair 
received a base fee of £374,900 and the Non-Executive Directors 
received a base fee of £71,100. There was also a two per cent 
increase to the additional fee for the role of the Senior Independent 
Director, which was increased to £17,700 per annum with effect 
from 1 January 2024. There was no increase to the additional fee for 
the roles of the Chair of the Audit and Remuneration Committees, 
which were aligned with benchmarking and remained at £20,000 
for the 2024 financial year.

Single year variable – Bonus, including DSBP (Audited)

The bonus is paid 50 per cent in cash with the remainder awarded as shares under the DSBP. Shares will vest in three years subject to continued employment or good leaver status.

2023 Bonus (Audited)

The 2023 bonus comprised of three components: Adjusted Profit Before Tax (PBT) 37.5 per cent; rent roll growth (RRG) 37.5 per cent; and ESG 25 per cent. The 2023 bonus payment will be 81.6 per cent of the maximum 
award and will be paid in April 2024.

The performance period for Adjusted PBT, RRG and ESG starts from 1 January. The Adjusted PBT and RRG 
outturns were calculated using a constant exchange rate and also include adjustments for specific items 
(including acquisitions and disposals made during the year) in accordance with the bonus scheme rules as 
approved by the Committee.

The ESG element comprises six equally-weighted Responsible SEGRO measures in accordance with the 
bonus scheme rules as approved by the Committee.

Bonus payments are calculated as a percentage of Executive Directors’ salaries as at 31 December of the 
relevant year. As explained on page 108, the Committee assessed the underlying performance of the 
business and concluded that no discretion should be exercised in respect of the 2023 bonus.

The 2023 DSBP will be awarded in April 2024 and will vest on the third anniversary of the award date. 
Details of the DSBP awards granted to Executive Directors are set out in Chart 14 on page 121.

Multiple year variable – LTIP (Audited)

LTIP awards are subject to a three-year performance period and a compulsory two-year post-vesting holding period for Executive Directors. 

LTIP vesting in 2024

The 2021 LTIP award will vest on 29 March 2024, subject to relative TSR, TPR and TAR over the three-year performance period to 31 December 2023. 

It is anticipated that the 2021 LTIP award will pay out 62.7 per cent (subject to the final TPR and TAR data being available).

1   The Company’s TSR over the performance period was -7.7 per cent and the benchmark TSR was -4.4 per 
cent. The Company’s TSR target is 6 per cent per annum above the benchmark, which equates to TSR 
of 13.8 per cent for this element to fully vest.

2  The estimated TPR calculation is based on the Company’s actual annualised TPR between 2021 and 2023 
of 8.0 per cent and an estimated MSCI Benchmark over the same period of 6.6 per cent. On this basis, the 
Company’s three-year TPR to 31 December 2023 has exceeded the estimated MSCI Benchmark by 1.28 per 
cent which would lead to 88.2 per cent of the TPR element vesting. The final benchmark will be available 
in quarter two 2024 and based on the information available at the time of this Report the Committee has 
estimated that 88.2 per cent of this element will vest. Any differences will be disclosed in next year’s Report.

3  100 per cent of the TAR element will vest if the benchmark is exceeded by 2.5 per cent per annum. The 

benchmark will be available in quarter two 2024 and based on the information available at the time of this 
Report the Committee has estimated that 100 per cent of this element will vest. Any differences will be 
disclosed in next year’s Report.

Chart 5: 2021 LTIP award to Executive Directors 

The Committee has the discretion to adjust awards downwards at vesting if it is not satisfied that the 
outcome is a fair reflection of underlying performance, or in the event of excessive risk taking or 
misstatement. As explained on page 108, the Committee assessed the underlying performance of the 
business and concluded that no such discretion should be exercised in respect of the vesting of the 
2021 LTIP.

Once vested, the underlying number of shares under the award will be subject to a further two-year 
post-performance holding period. The Executive Directors will continue to hold their award over the 
shares, and will be entitled to the value of any dividend payments during the holding period; during this 
time they will not be able to sell or transfer the shares under award. The award after vesting is not subject to 
any further conditionality and the normal leaver provisions would not apply, meaning that if the individual 
resigned during the holding period they would retain their award and be entitled to receive the underlying 
shares at the end of the holding period. Only if the individual was summarily dismissed (for gross 
misconduct) would the award lapse on termination of employment during the holding period.

Updated LTIP vesting in 2023 (estimated in 2022 Annual Report) (Audited)

Malus and clawback

The 2022 Directors’ Remuneration Report estimated that the TPR element for the 2020 LTIP would vest at 
100 per cent. 

Malus and clawback provisions apply to the bonus and awards made under the DSBP and LTIP over the time 
periods detailed below and may apply in the following circumstances:

The Company’s actual TPR over the performance period was 13.2 per cent and the MSCI benchmark was 
9.4 per cent. The Company’s TPR outperformance of 3.6 per cent compared with the MSCI benchmark led 
to 100 per cent of the TPR element vesting. Overall, this resulted in a total payout of 100 per cent for the 
2020 LTIP as estimated. 

In the 2022 Annual Report the estimated vesting share price for the 2020 LTIP was 783.4 pence, 
and the figure in Chart 1 has been re-presented to reflect the actual vesting share price of 807.7 pence.

2023 LTIP award (Audited)

The 2023 LTIP award was granted on 24 March 2023 and is subject to the following equally-weighted 
performance conditions: 

Total Shareholder Return (TSR)
This benchmark is based on the market capitalisation weighted TSR of the FTSE 350 REIT index.

 – fraud or serious misconduct on the part of the participant; 
 – a serious misstatement in the Company’s financial results; 
 – an error in assessing performance conditions, resulting in an overpayment; 
 – when Company performance was achieved as a result of excessive risk taking; 
 – serious reputational damage; or 
 – corporate failure.

Other - SIP and Sharesave (Audited)

The ‘other’ figure in Chart 1 includes SIP and Sharesave:

20 per cent of this element vests if the Company’s TSR over the performance period is in line with 
benchmark TSR, rising on a straight-line basis to 100 per cent vesting if the benchmark is exceeded 
by 6 per cent or more per annum.

Share Incentive Plan (SIP)
This is calculated as the number of shares awarded multiplied by the award price.

Total Property Return (TPR)
This benchmark is based on the MSCI All Industrial Country benchmarks weighted to reflect the 
approximate geographical mix of the Group’s portfolio.

20 per cent of this element vests if the Company’s TPR over the performance period is in line with the 
MSCI benchmark, rising on a straight-line basis to 100 per cent if the MSCI benchmark is exceeded by 
1.5 per cent or more per annum.

Total Accounting Return (TAR)
This benchmark is based on the market capitalisation weighted TAR of the other FTSE 350 REITs.

20 per cent of this element vests if the Company’s TAR over the performance period is in line with 
benchmark TAR, rising on a straight-line basis to 100 per cent vesting if the benchmark is exceeded 
by 2.5 per cent or more per annum.

The Chief Executive was awarded 300 percent of salary in respect of the 2023 LTIP and the Chief Financial 
Officer was awarded 250 per cent of salary. Further details can be found in Chart 15 on page 122.

During the year, SIP free share awards of £2,000 were made to eligible UK employees and Global Share 
Incentive Plan (GSIP) awards of £2,000 were made to eligible employees based outside of the UK.

The number of shares awarded was calculated using a share price of 813.2 pence, based on the five-day 
average share price prior to the date of award.

All eligible employees, including the Executive Directors, received 245 shares in respect of the 2023 SIP 
and GSIP.

Sharesave (SAYE)
This is the discount used to calculate the Option Price, multiplied by the Executive Directors’ annual 
savings each year.

All eligible UK employees are invited to join the SAYE annually, and can save up to a maximum of £500 
a month across all open schemes.

At the end of the three-year savings period they can purchase shares at the Option Price, based on a 
20 per cent discount to the share price on award.

The Option Price for the 2023 SAYE was 580.8 pence.

CEO pay ratio 
The table below shows how CEO pay compares to employees at the lower, median and upper quartiles. 
The ratios have been calculated in accordance with Option A of the The Companies (Miscellaneous 
Reporting) Regulations 2018. We have again opted for Option A as the preferred method of calculation, 
as it is the most statistically accurate as recommended by the legislation.

Supporting information for the CEO pay ratio 
The Chief Executive’s single total figure of remuneration for 2023, detailed further in Chart 1, and employee 
data as at 31 December 2023, have been used for the purposes of this calculation. 

The median CEO Pay Ratio has decreased when compared against last year (34:1) and this reduction can 
partially be attributed to the lower payout of the 2020 LTIP in 2023. Whilst this reduction was also observed 
for the median comparator, proportionally this had a much larger impact on the Chief Executive based 
on the payouts. Additionally, the salary increase received by the Chief Executive in April 2023 was 
approximately five per cent, which was below the average UK employee increase of seven per cent 
in the same period.

SEGRO’s median CEO Pay Ratio is 23:1, which remains below the 2022 FTSE 100 median of 80:1 (source: 
High Pay Centre). The Remuneration Committee considers that the median pay ratio is representative of 
the pay, reward and progression policies for our UK workforce.

Aligning remuneration outcomes to strategy and Company performance

Remuneration and strategy
Our ambition is to be the best property company and SEGRO’s remuneration structure is designed to align delivery of annual and long-term out-performance of the Company with the 
priorities of our major stakeholders. This performance is assessed based on financial and non-financial KPIs linked to the four pillars of our corporate strategy. The remuneration structure 
and KPIs are listed below and more detail including specifically how each KPI is linked to the strategic pillars and remuneration can be found on pages 32 to 35.

1  As there are only a very small number of employees in SEGRO plc, French branch, the 2023 average per employee figure is based on UK employees who have been continually employed for the entirety of 2022 and 2023 and 

are entitled to receive annual variable payment.

2   Between May 2020 and July 2020, all Directors waived 25 per cent of their salaries and fees and the Company matched a donation equivalent to this amount to the SEGRO Centenary Fund. This waiver is reflected in the 2020 

numbers and accounts for the appearance of the above average increase in 2021.

3  Andy Harrison joined the Board as Director on 1 April 2022 and was appointed as Chair on 30 June 2022, accordingly there is no comparator for the previous years.
4  Simon Fraser and Linda Yueh were appointed as Independent Non-Executive Directors on 1 May 2021, accordingly there is no comparator for the previous years. 
5  Carol Fairweather was appointed Senior Independent Director on 1 July 2023 and her fee increase to reflect the increased responsibilities has been prorated for the year.
6  Martin Moore stepped down as Senior Independent Director on 30 June 2023 and his fees have been prorated for the year. 
7  Fees for Non-Executive Directors have been annualised unless otherwise stated. Non-Executive Directors do not receive any taxable benefits and do not participate in the bonus scheme. 
8  Andy Gulliford retired from the Board and the Company on 30 June 2023.

Stakeholder Engagement

Employee share ownership

Shareholder engagement
The Committee values shareholder 
engagement and the Chair is available 
should shareholders wish to discuss the 
Company’s approach to remuneration or 
share their views on current practice or 
emerging issues. In November 2023, our 
Head of Investor Relations and Deputy 
Company Secretary met with the stewardship 
and governance teams at some of our largest 
shareholders to discuss governance related 
topics. This included the opportunity for 
shareholders to provide feedback on our 
current executive remuneration structure, 
which will be considered as we develop the 
revised Remuneration Policy for approval by 
shareholders at the 2025 AGM. In 2024, we 
will launch a dedicated consultation process 
with our shareholders and proxy advisory 
firms to discuss any proposed changes to the 
current Remuneration Policy and to offer the 
opportunity to provide feedback.

Workforce engagement
In addition to setting the remuneration for 
the Executive Directors, the Committee is 
responsible for setting the remuneration 
for the Group HR Director and the Company 
Secretary, reviewing the remuneration of 
the Leadership team and considering the 
remuneration policies and practices for the 
wider workforce. This ensures everyone is 
rewarded fairly and that workforce pay aligns 
with Executive remuneration. Further details 
on workforce engagement can be found on 
page 92 and a comparison of employee and 
executive remuneration can be found on 
page 118. 

Further details on stakeholder engagement 
can be found on pages 90 to 92.

 – SEGRO is proud to operate two types of all-employees share 
schemes. This encourages employees to own shares in the 
Company, aligning their interests with our shareholders.

 – SIP/GSIP: all eligible employees can receive an award of up to 

£3,600 worth of SEGRO shares each year. These are held in Trust 
on their behalf for a minimum of three years, following which they 
can be released subject to continued employment. 

 – Sharesave: all UK employees are invited to join Sharesave on an 
annual basis, where they can save up to £500 a month across all 
open schemes. After three years, they can use their savings to buy 
SEGRO shares at a 20 per cent discount to the share price when 
they started saving.

87%

of SEGRO employees participated in one or more all-employee share 
scheme, as at 31 December 2023.

£2,000

In May 2023, all eligible employees received £2,000 worth of SEGRO shares 
through the SIP or GSIP.

67%

of UK employees participate in Sharesave, saving on average 
£347 each month.

6.7m

As at 31 December 2023, there were 6.7 million SEGRO shares under award 
in employee share schemes, representing 0.6 per cent of our issued share 
capital.

Workforce engagement on Executive 
Remuneration

As detailed on page 92, during the year the Non-Executive Directors 
held a series of workforce engagement sessions with a cross-
section of employees from across the business. In May 2023, 
Remuneration Committee Chair, Simon Fraser, and Audit Committee 
Chair, Carol Fairweather, held a workforce engagement session 
focusing on Executive remuneration.  

Simon detailed the work of the Committee during the year including 
changes to the bonus structure, with the addition of non-financial 
ESG elements, and increasing the weighting of the personal 
performance element for more junior employees. Directors heard 
that the addition of ESG as a performance metric to the bonus for 
all employees was an impactful change and an important step for 
the delivery of the Responsible SEGRO strategy. The Responsible 
SEGRO targets were seen as tangible and authentic to SEGRO, 
and employees attending the engagement session expressed 
that frequent and consistent communication across the Group 
on the progress against meeting company performance targets, 
particularly the sustainability related targets, was helpful through 
the regular employee briefings which are held across the Group.

An area of improvement identified was around the visibility and 
understanding of remuneration levels across the business and the 
Company continues to make progress in increasing transparency 
around the remuneration structures, including share awards, for the 
benefit of the wider workforce. The reorganisation of the Executive 
Committee and Leadership team provided a good opportunity to 
review Company-wide policies and resources to ensure these 
included sufficient information to differentiate remuneration 
between levels. 

The Remuneration Policy was also summarised and employees 
were offered the opportunity to ask questions about the Executive 
remuneration structure. The Directors felt that these sessions 
remained invaluable in understanding employees’ views on 
Executive remuneration, and appreciated the insightful, open and 
honest feedback from the employee attendees. The employees 
valued the opportunity to share their views. Feedback from the 
session was relayed to the Board and discussed at the June 2023 
Board meeting and will inform plans on the communication of 
reward through 2024. 

  Further details can be found 
on page 92.

1  Beneficial interests represent shares beneficially held by each Executive Director, including any shares beneficially held by spouses as well as shares held on their behalf by the Trustees of the SIP. Between 31 December 2023 

and 15 February 2024, there were no changes in respect of the Executive Directors’ shareholdings. The Trustees of the SIP held a non-beneficial interest in 463,457 shares as at 1 January 2023, 432,659 shares as at 31 December 
2023 (2022: 463,457) and 427,960 shares as at 15 February 2024. The Trustees of the SEGRO plc Employees’ Benefit Trust held 54,640 shares as at 1 January 2023 and 254,076 shares as at 31 December 2023 (2022: 54,640). 
There was no change in their holding between 31 December 2023 and 15 February 2024. As with other employees, Executive Directors are deemed to have a potential interest in these shares, being beneficiaries under these 
two Trusts. The Trustees of the SEGRO plc Employees’ Benefit Trust have waived the right to receive dividends on these shares.

2  The number of shares which contribute towards the shareholding requirement comprise beneficial interests (including SIP shares), shares subject to deferral under DSBP and shares held under LTIP subject to the two-year post-

vesting holding period, net of Income Tax and National Insurance, but excludes shares subject to achievement of performance conditions under LTIP and options outstanding under Sharesave.

3  Value of shares calculated using a share price of 886.4 pence, as at 29 December 2023.
4  Andy Gulliford retired from the Board and the Company on 30 June 2023 and his share interests and share values are disclosed as at 30 June 2023.

Chart 12: Policy on shareholding guidelines (Audited)
The Chief Executive is expected to build a shareholding in the Company equivalent to 400 per cent of the 
value of his base salary, and the other Executive Directors are expected to hold shares equivalent to 250 per 
cent of their base salaries, which is calculated each year by reference to the share price as at 31 December. 

Chart 13: Post-cessation shareholding requirements: Andy Gulliford
Andy Gulliford retired from the Company and the Board on 30 June 2023. He is required to hold shares 
equivalent to 250 per cent of his salary until 30 June 2025, calculated by reference to his base salary and 
the share price on 30 June 2023.

Shares which qualify towards the shareholding guidelines comprise: beneficial interests; LTIP awards which 
have vested and are subject to a two-year post-vesting holding period, net of Income Tax and National 
Insurance; and unvested shares in the DSBP, net of Income Tax and National Insurance. 

Executive Directors are required to retain half of their LTIP and DSBP shares post vesting until the above 
guidelines have been met and are then maintained.

Remuneration Committee advisers
The Committee has access to sufficient resources to discharge its duties, which include 
access to independent remuneration advisers, the Company Secretary, the Group HR Director 
and other advisers as required. 

The Committee is responsible for appointing its external advisers and in 2018, following a 
competitive tender process, Korn Ferry was appointed. During 2023, Korn Ferry provided 
advice on the operation of the Policy, Executive Directors’ remuneration, and market and best 

practice guidance, including the provisions of the Code. Its total fees for advice to the 
Committee in 2023 were £61,563 (2022: £42,083), calculated on a time-cost basis.

The Committee determined that Korn Ferry provided independent remuneration advice and 
does not have any connections with the Company or its Directors. Korn Ferry provides services 
to the Company’s HR function and the Committee is satisfied that this does not impair its 
independence. Korn Ferry is a signatory to the Code of Conduct for Remuneration Consultants 
in the UK.

Remuneration 
Remuneration Committee Report continued

Directors’ Remuneration Policy – summary

The Remuneration Policy (the Policy) was approved by shareholders at the Annual General Meeting held on 21 April 2022 and became effective from this date. It applies to incentive awards 
with performance periods beginning on 1 January 2022.

The following is a summary of the Policy. The full Policy, as approved by shareholders, was included in the 2021 Annual Report and Accounts and is available at www.SEGRO.com. 

In determining the Policy, the Committee considered the following as set out in Provision 40 of the Code:

Clarity and simplicity

The Committee is of the opinion that the Policy and the remuneration framework for the wider workforce is transparent, simple and easy 
to understand. We believe that the framework is clearly communicated to and understood by our key stakeholders and our employees. 
Remuneration for our Executive Directors consists of the following elements as set out in Chart 1: 

 – salary;
 – pension benefits;
 – Bonus;
 – DSBP;
 – LTIP;
 – Sharesave;
 – SIP; and 
 – other benefits. 

Risk

Predictability

Proportionality

Alignment to culture

The Committee engaged extensively with key stakeholders, such as shareholders and representatives from the workforce, who confirmed 
this view.

The Company’s remuneration arrangements discourage both the Executive Directors and the wider workforce from excessive risk taking in the 
pursuit of achieving objectives. The bonus, DSBP and LTIP include malus and/or clawback provisions that apply when the Committee considers 
that performance is achieved as a result of excessive risk taking, as well as in other circumstances as set out on page 115 of the Directors’ 
Remuneration Report. 

Executive Directors are required to hold a percentage of their base salary in shares in the Company (as described further on page 120). 
Additionally, they are subject to post-cessation requirement to continue holdings shares in the event that they leave the Company.

Part of their annual bonus is subject to deferral under the DSBP and a compulsory post-vesting holding period applies for LTIP shares.

The Committee has the discretion to override formulaic outturns to ensure incentive payouts reflect underlying business performance, and is 
aligned to shareholder experience.

Potential values of rewards to the Executive Directors under the Policy are clearly stated in Chart 5 on page 161 of the 2021 Annual Report and 
Accounts, which sets out the minimum, maximum and on target scenarios. This chart also demonstrates the impact of share price appreciation 
on the 2022 LTIP award. Potential outcomes are regularly reviewed by the Committee.

In order to ensure outcomes do not reward poor performance, a significant portion of our remuneration framework is performance based and 
requires challenging performance targets and metrics to be achieved.

There is strong linkage between the structure of the Company’s incentive schemes, its Purpose and Values, and strategy. The Company’s 
Responsible SEGRO ambitions have identified net-zero carbon by 2030 as a key strategic objective, and the inclusion of ESG measures in the 
new annual bonus structure reinforces its importance. The chart on page 117 illustrates how variable remuneration is aligned with KPIs that 
measure performance against the Company’s strategy.

Chart 1: Remuneration policy table: Executive Directors

Element
Salary

Strategic purpose
To attract and motivate high-calibre 
leaders in a competitive market and to 
recognise their skills, experience and 
contribution to Group performance. 

Pension benefits

To provide a market competitive 
remuneration package.

Bonus

To focus on the delivery of annual 
goals, to strive for superior 
performance and to achieve specific 
targets which support strategy, in 
particular for income generation, ESG 
ambitions and recurring profit.

Operation
The Committee reviews Executive 
Directors’ base salaries each year in 
the context of total remuneration, 
taking into account the Directors’ 
responsibilities, experience and 
performance, pay across the Group 
and market competitiveness.

Maximum potential value
The maximum annual salary increase will not 
normally exceed the average increase which applies 
across the wider workforce. However, larger 
increases may be awarded in certain circumstances 
including, but not limited to: an increase in scope or 
responsibilities of the role; salary progression for a 
newly appointed Director; and where the Director’s 
salary has fallen significantly below the market 
positioning.

Performance metrics
Not applicable.

Retirement benefits are available to all 
UK employees and employees in 
certain Continental European 
jurisdictions dependent on local 
market practice and geographical 
differences.

Bonuses are awarded annually and 
paid for performance over the 
financial year. 

The bonus is reviewed each financial 
year to ensure performance measures 
and targets are appropriate and 
support the business strategy. 

Payment is based on the achievement 
of performance targets. 

The Committee retains discretion 
to reduce the amount of the bonus 
award in the light of underlying 
performance during the year. 

The rules of the bonus contain 
clawback provisions.

Currently, the Executive Directors receive 
20 per cent of salary in lieu of pension, this will 
reduce to the same level as the UK workforce by 
31 December 2022. 

None.

Future Executive Directors will receive the level 
received by the majority of the UK workforce 
(currently a contribution to their pension plan of 
12 per cent of salary). The cash allowance for 
Directors is offered in lieu of membership of the 
defined contribution Group Personal Pension Plan.

The maximum bonus opportunity for Executive 
Directors is 150 per cent of salary.

The bonus scheme is based on three elements 
which the Committee may review from time-to-
time, to ensure that they continue to reflect the 
Company’s strategic priorities: Adjusted PBT 
against budget, which supports the objective of 
delivering a sustainable, progressive dividend; rent 
roll growth which focuses on driving the future 
rental income of the business; and ESG metrics 
comprising target ranges related to (i) reducing 
our operating carbon emissions, (ii) reducing 
our embodied carbon in developments and (iii) 
customer, community and employee objectives.

The performance measures will initially be 
weighted as follows: Adjusted PBT 37.5 per cent; 
RRG 37.5 per cent; and ESG 25 per cent. 

Threshold performance will result in vesting of no 
more than 25 per cent of the relevant portion of 
the bonus (where the nature of the performance 
metric allows such an approach).

Performance metrics

Deferred Share Bonus 
Plan (‘DSBP’)

To encourage retention of senior 
managers and provide a long-term link 
between the bonus and share price 
growth so as to encourage long-term 
decision making.

Long Term Incentive 
Plan (‘LTIP’)

To reward the execution of strategy 
and drive long-term returns for 
shareholders. The performance 
measures are selected to align with 
business strategy. The awards are 
designed to align the most senior 
managers’ goals with the creation 
of sustainable growth in shareholder 
value. The awards will also increase 
retention of these senior managers.

50 per cent of any bonus awarded in 
the year is deferred into shares in the 
DSBP for three years before vesting. 
The award does not carry any 
entitlement to dividends, however 
the Committee may, at the time of the 
release of the shares, deliver shares or 
a cash sum equivalent to the value 
of the dividends that would have 
been paid over the three-year 
holding period. 

The rules of the DSBP contain 
malus provisions.

For LTIP awards, dividends will accrue 
on the LTIP shares which are released 
on vesting and will be paid in shares or 
cash. The Committee has discretion to 
adjust awards downwards at vesting if 
it is not satisfied that the outcome is a 
fair reflection of underlying 
performance, or in the event of 
excessive risk taking or misstatement. 

The rules of the LTIP contain malus 
and clawback provisions.

For Executive Directors, 50 per cent of the 
bonus earned in respect of the previous year’s 
performance.

Vesting of shares is dependent on continued 
employment or good leaver status.

Maximum 300 per cent of salary in performance 
shares for the Chief Executive only, other Executive 
Directors will continue to receive 250 per cent of 
salary and the Committee would not increase this 
without prior consultation with shareholders.

LTIP awards are subject to stretching performance 
conditions, which are measured over a three-year 
performance period. A two-year compulsory 
holding period applies to these LTIP shares after 
vesting and subject to payment of tax and 
statutory deductions. 

Awards to be granted in 2022 will be subject to 
equally weighted Total Shareholder Return, Total 
Property Return and Total Accounting Return 
performance conditions.

Subsequent grants may be subject to different 
performance conditions following consultation 
with shareholders.

Threshold performance will result in vesting of no 
more than 20 per cent of the relevant portion of 
the LTIP (where the nature of the performance 
metric allows such an approach).

Sharesave

To provide a market competitive 
remuneration package and to 
encourage employee share ownership 
across the Group.

Sharesave is a HMRC approved 
scheme open to all UK employees. 
Savings can be made over a 
three-year period to purchase shares 
in the Company at a price which is set 
at the beginning of the savings period. 
This price is usually set at a 20 per 
cent discount to the market price.

Employees may save up to the HMRC limit across all 
Sharesave grants.

None.

Share Incentive Plan 
(‘SIP’) and Global Share 
Incentive Plan (‘GSIP’)

To provide a market competitive 
remuneration package and to 
encourage employee share ownership 
across the Group.

SIP is a HMRC approved scheme open 
to all UK employees, subject to 
service. Eligible employees are 
awarded shares annually up to the 
HMRC limits. GSIP is designed on a 
similar basis to SIP, but is not HMRC 
approved and is operated for non-UK 
employees.

The maximum award is subject to the HMRC limit.

Award may be based on achievement of a target 
and is subject to a three-year holding period.

Other benefits

To provide a market competitive

–

Other benefits currently include: car 
allowance; life assurance; disability 
insurance; private medical insurance; 
and health screening. The Committee 
retains the discretion to offer 
additional benefits as appropriate, for 
example, assistance with relocation.

None.

Additional notes
Remuneration Policy: the policy for the Executive Directors is designed with regard to the pay and benefits for employees across the Group. All employees are eligible for an annual bonus on the 
same performance measures which are consistent with those of the Executive Directors, save that those below Board level have a fourth target based on their personal performance. The 
maximum bonus opportunity is fixed according to seniority banding across the Company. The LTIP performance conditions are the same for all participants and the size of awards are 
determined by seniority. 

The Committee retains certain discretions in respect of the operation and administration of the incentive plans under their rules, in addition to the discretions described elsewhere in the Policy. 

Subject to consultation with major shareholders, the Committee retains the ability to adjust and/or to set different LTIP and bonus performance measures if events occur (such as a change in 
strategy, a material acquisition and/or divestment of a Group business, or change in prevailing market conditions) which cause the Committee to determine that the measures are no longer 
appropriate and that amendment is required so that they achieve their original purpose. 

Payments from existing awards: Executive Directors are eligible to receive payment from any award made prior to the approval and implementation of the 2022 Policy. Any outstanding share 
awards made in accordance with a previous Remuneration Policy will remain in effect and will vest in accordance with the terms under which they were granted.

disclosure could be seriously prejudicial to the Company.

 – Borrowings and other financial instruments

generally include provisions that may require any outstanding borrowings to be repaid or 
the amendment or termination of the facilities upon the occurrence of a change of control 
of the Company.

Modern Slavery and Human Rights 
SEGRO operates a Human Rights Policy which brings together a number of our existing 
policies that relate to human rights such as our Modern Slavery and Labour Standards Supplier 
Code, and Anti-Slavery and Human Trafficking Policy. Copies of our policies that relate to 
human rights can be found on our website www.SEGRO.com.

Modern slavery awareness posters, which contain information on key signs of modern slavery, 
how and where to access help, and details of our whistleblowing reporting service are 
displayed on SEGRO development sites and in all our offices. During 2023, we also delivered 
targeted modern slavery awareness training to certain employees and teams who should 
receive further training due to the nature of their role. In particular, teams which deal with 
suppliers, visit sites and meet contractors more regularly are best placed to more effectively 
uncover potential instances of modern slavery and human trafficking. In addition, all employees 
have completed mandatory online training on modern slavery.

The Company publishes an annual Modern Slavery and Human Trafficking Statement in 
compliance with the UK Modern Slavery Act 2015. The Board approved the latest statement 
in June 2023 and it can be found on our website at www.SEGRO.com/modern-slavery.

Any employee who breaches our Anti-Slavery and Human Trafficking Policy or Human Rights 
Policy will face disciplinary action, which could result in dismissal for misconduct or gross 
misconduct. We reserve the right to terminate our relationship with other individuals and 
organisations working on our behalf if they do not comply with our Modern Slavery and 
Labour Standards Supplier Code.

Statement of Directors’ responsibilities in respect of the Financial Statements 

The Directors are responsible for preparing the Annual Report and the Financial Statements 
in accordance with applicable law and regulation.

Company law requires the Directors to prepare Financial Statements for each financial year. 
Under that law the Directors have prepared the Group and the Company Financial Statements 
in accordance with UK-adopted international accounting standards.

The Directors have also prepared the Group and the Company Financial Statements in 
accordance with international financial reporting standards adopted pursuant to Regulation 
(EC) No 1606/2002 as it applies in the European Union.

Under company law, Directors must not approve the Financial Statements unless they are 
satisfied that they give a true and fair view of the state of affairs of the Group and Company 
and of the profit or loss of the Group for that period. In preparing the Financial Statements 
the Directors are required to:
 – select suitable accounting policies and then apply them consistently;
 – state whether applicable UK-adopted international accounting standards and international 

financial reporting standards adopted pursuant to Regulation (EC) No 1606/2002 as it applies 
in the European Union have been followed, subject to any material departures disclosed and 
explained in the Financial Statements;

 – make judgements and accounting estimates that are reasonable and prudent; and
 – prepare the Financial Statements on the going concern basis unless it is inappropriate to 

presume that the Group and Company will continue in business.

The Directors are also responsible for safeguarding the assets of the Group and Company 
and hence for taking reasonable steps for the prevention and detection of fraud and 
other irregularities.

The Directors are responsible for keeping adequate accounting records that are sufficient 
to show and explain the Group’s and Company’s transactions and disclose with reasonable 
accuracy at any time the financial position of the Group and Company and enable them to 
ensure that the Financial Statements and the Directors’ Remuneration Report comply with the 
Companies Act 2006.

The Directors are responsible for the maintenance and integrity of the Company’s website. 
Legislation in the United Kingdom governing the preparation and dissemination of Financial 
Statements may differ from legislation in other jurisdictions.

Directors’ confirmations
The Directors consider that the Annual Report and Accounts, taken as a whole, is fair, balanced 
and understandable and provides the information necessary for shareholders to assess the 
Group’s and Company’s position and performance, business model and strategy.

Each of the Directors, whose names and functions are listed in the Governance section of the 
Annual Report confirm that, to the best of their knowledge:
 – the Group and Company Financial Statements , which have been prepared in accordance 
with UK-adopted international accounting standards and international financial reporting 
standards adopted pursuant to Regulation (EC) No 1606/2002 as it applies in the European 
Union, give a true and fair view of the assets, liabilities, financial position and loss of the 
Group; and

 – the Strategic Report includes a fair review of the development and performance of the 

business and the position of the Group and Company, together with a description of the 
principal risks and uncertainties that it faces.

Independent auditors’ report to the members of SEGRO plc

Report on the audit of the financial statements

Other than those disclosed in Note 6 to the Financial Statements, we have provided no 
non-audit services to the company or its controlled undertakings in the period under audit.

Opinion
In our opinion, SEGRO plc’s group financial statements and company financial statements 
(the “financial statements”):
 – give a true and fair view of the state of the group’s and of the company’s affairs as at 

31 December 2023 and of the group’s loss and the group’s and company’s cash flows 
for the year then ended;

 – have been properly prepared in accordance with UK-adopted international accounting 

standards as applied in accordance with the provisions of the Companies Act 2006; and

 – have been prepared in accordance with the requirements of the Companies Act 2006.

We have audited the financial statements, included within the Annual Report & Accounts 2023 
(the “Annual Report”), which comprise: the group and company Balance Sheets as at 31 
December 2023; the group Income Statement and the group Statement of Comprehensive 
Income, the group and company Cash Flow Statements, and the group and company 
Statements of Changes in Equity for the year ended 31 December 2023; and the notes to 
the financial statements, which include a description of the significant accounting policies.

Our opinion is consistent with our reporting to the Audit Committee.

Separate opinion in relation to international financial reporting standards adopted 
pursuant to Regulation (EC) No 1606/2002 as it applies in the European Union
As explained in note 1 to the financial statements, the group and company, in addition to 
applying UK-adopted international accounting standards, have also applied international 
financial reporting standards adopted pursuant to Regulation (EC) No 1606/2002 as it applies 
in the European Union.

In our opinion, the group and company financial statements have been properly prepared in 
accordance with international financial reporting standards adopted pursuant to Regulation 
(EC) No 1606/2002 as it applies in the European Union.

Basis for opinion
We conducted our audit in accordance with International Standards on Auditing (UK) (“ISAs 
(UK)”), International Standards on Auditing issued by the International Auditing and Assurance 
Standards Board (“ISAs”) and applicable law. Our responsibilities under ISAs (UK) and ISAs are 
further described in the Auditors’ responsibilities for the audit of the financial statements 
section of our report. We believe that the audit evidence we have obtained is sufficient and 
appropriate to provide a basis for our opinion.

Independence
We remained independent of the group in accordance with the ethical requirements that are 
relevant to our audit of the financial statements in the UK, which includes the FRC’s Ethical 
Standard, as applicable to listed public interest entities, and the International Code of Ethics 
for Professional Accountants (including International Independence Standards) issued by the 
International Ethics Standards Board for Accountants (IESBA Code), and we have fulfilled our 
other ethical responsibilities in accordance with these requirements.

To the best of our knowledge and belief, we declare that non-audit services prohibited by either 
the FRC’s Ethical Standard or Article 5(1) of Regulation (EU) No 537/2014 were not provided.

Our audit approach
Overview
Audit scope
 – We tailored the scope of our audit to ensure that we performed enough work to be able to 

give an opinion on the financial statements as a whole.

 – Audit procedures on Rental Income and Valuation of Investment Properties are performed 

centrally by the group audit team in the UK.

 – Full scope audit of SEGRO European Logistics Partnership (SELP) Joint Venture by 

component auditors and full scope audit of SEGRO plc by the group audit team in the UK.
 – In addition, component auditors performed the audit of specific balances and transactions 

in certain territories.

 – Over 95% coverage of total assets of the group.

Key audit matters
 – Valuation of investment properties (group)
 – Valuation of investments in and loans to subsidiaries (parent)

Materiality
 – Overall group materiality: £173 million (2022: £174 million) based on 1% of total assets.
 – Specific group materiality: £20 million (2022: £19 million), based on 5% of the group’s 

adjusted profit before tax.

 – Overall company materiality: £118 million (2022: £108 million) based on 1% of total assets.
 – Performance materiality: £130 million (2022: £ 130 million) (group) and £89 million 

(2022: £81 million) (company).

The scope of our audit
As part of designing our audit, we determined materiality and assessed the risks of material 
misstatement in the financial statements.

Key audit matters
Key audit matters are those matters that, in the auditors’ professional judgement, were of most 
significance in the audit of the financial statements of the current period and include the most 
significant assessed risks of material misstatement (whether or not due to fraud) identified by 
the auditors, including those which had the greatest effect on: the overall audit strategy; the 
allocation of resources in the audit; and directing the efforts of the engagement team. 
These matters, and any comments we make on the results of our procedures thereon, were 
addressed in the context of our audit of the financial statements as a whole, and in forming 
our opinion thereon, and we do not provide a separate opinion on these matters.

This is not a complete list of all risks identified by our audit.

Valuation of investments in and loans to subsidiaries is a new key audit matter this year. 
Estimation of variable performance fee income and large and/or complex transactions, which 
were key audit matters last year, are no longer included because of the expiry of the 10 year 
performance period in October 2023 and amounts due to SEGRO from SELP being settled in 
the year. There have been no transactions identified as large and/or complex during the year. 
Otherwise, the key audit matters below are consistent with last year.

Key audit matter

How our audit addressed the key audit matter

Valuation of investment properties (group)
Refer to the Audit Committee Report and the Financial 
Statements (including notes to the Financial Statements; 
Note 1, Significant Accounting Policies; Note 13, Properties; 
and Note 25, Property Valuation Techniques, Sustainability 
and Climate Change Considerations and Related 
Quantitative Information). 

We focussed on the valuation of investment properties 
because investment properties represent the principal 
element of the net asset value as disclosed in the Balance 
Sheet in the financial statements and is an area of significant 
estimation uncertainty. The portfolio is held by the group, 
and through joint ventures and includes warehouses and 
light industrial buildings, including data centres. These are 
concentrated in the UK, France, Germany and Italy. The 
remainder of the portfolio is located across other European 
countries including Poland, Spain, the Netherlands and the 
Czech Republic.

The portfolio includes completed investment properties and 
development properties. The valuation of the group’s 
portfolio is inherently subjective due to, among other 
factors, the individual nature of each property, its location 
and the expected future rentals for that particular property. 
The wider challenges currently facing the real estate sector 
as a result of inflation and resulting interest rate policies 
further contributed to the subjectivity at 31 December 2023. 
For development sites, factors include projected costs to 
complete, time until practical completion and the ability to 
let if no prelet agreement is in place. Valuations are carried 
out by third party valuers CBRE (the 'Valuers'). The Valuers 
were engaged by the Directors, and performed their work in 
accordance with the Royal Institution of Chartered 
Surveyors (‘RICS’) Valuation – Global Standards 2022. The 
valuations take into account the property-specific 
information including the current tenancy agreements and 
rental income, condition and location of the property, and 
future rental prospects, as well as prevailing market yields 
and market transactions. The valuation of investment 
properties may also impact the carrying value of investment 
in the subsidiaries within the Financial Statements of the 
company.

Given the inherent subjectivity involved in the valuation of investment properties, the need for deep market knowledge when 
determining the most appropriate assumptions, and the technicalities of the valuation methodology, we engaged our internal 
valuation experts (qualified chartered surveyors) to assist us in our audit of this matter. 

Assessing group's external Valuers’ expertise and objectivity 
We assessed the Valuers’ qualifications and expertise and read their terms of engagement with the group to determine 
whether there were any matters that might have affected their objectivity or may have imposed scope limitations upon their 
work. We also considered fees and other contractual arrangements that might exist between the group and the Valuers. We 
found no evidence to suggest that the objectivity of the Valuers was compromised. 

Testing the valuations assumptions and capital movement: 
We obtained and read the CBRE valuation reports covering all of the group's investment properties. We held meetings with 
management and the Valuers, at which the valuations and the key assumptions therein were discussed. We focused on the 
largest properties and any outliers (where the assumptions used and/or year on year capital value movement were out of line 
with our range of assumptions developed using externally published market data for the relevant sector). To verify that the 
valuation approach was suitable for use in determining the carrying value for investment properties in the Financial 
Statements, we: 
 – Confirmed that the valuation approach was in accordance with RICS standards; 
 – Obtained valuation details of every property held by the group and developed ranges for each key valuation assumption or 
capital value movement, determined by reference to published benchmarks and using our experience and knowledge of 
the market. Compared the investment yields used by the Valuers with the expected range of yields and the year on year 
capital movement to our expected range;

 – Assessed the reasonableness of other assumptions that are not readily comparable with published benchmarks, such as 

Estimated Rental Value;

 – With the support of our internal valuation experts, we also questioned the external valuers as to the extent to which recent 
market transactions and expected rental values used in deriving their valuations took into account the impact of climate 
change and related ESG considerations; and

 – Verified where there could be alternative use opportunities, that this had been appropriately taken into account.

In addition to the above, where assumptions were outside the expected range or otherwise appeared unusual, and/or 
valuations showed unexpected movements, we undertook further investigations and, when necessary, held further 
discussions with the Valuers and obtained evidence to support explanations received. We also undertook further 
investigations where properties within our expected ranges had high capital values .The supporting evidence and valuation 
commentaries provided by the Valuers, enabled us to consider the property specific factors that had or may have had an 
impact on value, including recent comparable transactions where appropriate.

Information and standing data 
We agreed the amounts per the valuation reports to the accounting records and from there we agreed the related balances 
through to the Financial Statements. We tested the standing data which the group provided to the Valuers for use in the 
performance of the valuation. This involved testing controls on a sample basis over the input of lease data for leases and 
testing the accuracy of lease and other property information. For development properties, we also confirmed that the 
supporting information for construction contracts and budgets was consistent with the group’s records, for example by 
inspecting construction contracts. For development properties, capitalised expenditure was tested on a sample basis to 
invoices, and budgeted costs to complete were compared with supporting evidence (for example construction contracts) to 
support the inputs included within their valuation at the year end. 

Overall outcome 
We concluded that the assumptions used in the valuations by the Valuers were supportable in light of the evidence obtained.

Key audit matter

How our audit addressed the key audit matter

Valuation of investments in and loans to subsidiaries (parent)
Refer to note 7 (Investments by the Company) to the 
financial statements which discloses the company's 
investments in and loans to subsidiaries as at 31 December 
2023. This is following the recognition of a provision for 
impairment on investments in and loans to subsidiaries 
recognised in the year. The company’s accounting policy for 
investments and loans is to hold them at cost less any 
impairment. Impairment of the loans is calculated in 
accordance with International Financial Reporting Standard 
9 (Financial Instruments). Investments in subsidiaries are 
assessed for impairment in line with International 
Accounting Standard 36 (Impairment of Assets). Given the 
inherent judgement in assessing both the carrying value of 
a subsidiary company and the expected credit loss of 
intercompany loan receivables, this was identified as a key 
audit matter.

We assessed the accounting policy for investments and loans to subsidiaries to ensure they were compliant with the 
applicable accounting standards. We obtained the directors’ impairment assessment for the recoverability of investments in 
and loans to subsidiaries as at 31 December 2023. We verified that the methodology used by the directors in arriving 
at the carrying value of each subsidiary, and the expected credit loss ‘simplified approach’ provision for intercompany 
receivables, was compliant with applicable accounting standards. We identified the key estimate within the assessment 
for impairment of both the investments and loans to subsidiaries to be the underlying valuation of investment property held 
by the subsidiaries. For details of our procedures over investment property valuations please refer to the group key audit 
matter above.

We have no matters to report in respect of this work.

How we tailored the audit scope
We tailored the scope of our audit to ensure that we performed enough work to be able to give 
an opinion on the financial statements as a whole, taking into account the structure of the 
group and the company, the accounting processes and controls, and the industry in which 
they operate.

The group’s reportable segments are the geographical Business Units: Greater London, 
Thames Valley, National Logistics, Northern Europe, Southern Europe and Central Europe. 
In establishing the overall approach to the group audit, we determined the type of work that 
needed to be performed at reporting components by us, as the group engagement team, 
or component auditors operating under our instruction.

The group operates a common IT environment, processes and controls for rental income and 
payroll across all its reported segments. The group’s valuation and treasury functions are also 
based at the corporate centre in the UK. The related balances were therefore largely audited 
by the group audit team in the UK. Additionally, audits of specific balances and specified 
procedures were performed by component audit teams, such that the total testing programme 
provided sufficient audit evidence over all financial statement line items.

The SELP Joint Venture was included as being in scope for a full scope audit. As noted above, 
the work on rental income and valuation of investment properties for the Joint Venture was 
performed by the group audit team. We determined the level of involvement we needed to 
have in the component auditor’s work to be able to conclude whether sufficient appropriate 
audit evidence had been obtained as a basis for our opinion on the group financial statements 
as a whole. We issued formal, written instructions to the component auditors setting out the 
work to be performed by each of them. Throughout the audit process, the group audit team 
has been in close contact with the audit teams on location in each business unit to oversee 
the audit process. Senior team members also attended the clearance meetings for each 
component. During the clearance meetings, the results of the work performed by all 
component teams were discussed. The group engagement team also evaluated the sufficiency 
of the audit evidence obtained by component teams. Taking into account the components and 
Joint Ventures subject to a full scope audit, the centralised and other testing performed, 
coverage over total assets of the the group was 95%.

For each component in the scope of our group audit, we allocated a materiality that is less 
than our overall group materiality. The range of materiality allocated across components was 
between £100 million and £135 million. Certain components were audited to a local statutory 
audit materiality that was also less than our overall group materiality.

We use performance materiality to reduce to an appropriately low level the probability that 
the aggregate of uncorrected and undetected misstatements exceeds overall materiality. 
Specifically, we use performance materiality in determining the scope of our audit and the 
nature and extent of our testing of account balances, classes of transactions and disclosures, 
for example in determining sample sizes. Our performance materiality was 75% (2022: 75%) of 
overall materiality, amounting to £130 million (2022: £ 130 million) for the group financial 
statements and £89 million (2022: £81 million) for the company financial statements.

In determining the performance materiality, we considered a number of factors - the history 
of misstatements, risk assessment and aggregation risk and the effectiveness of controls - 
and concluded that an amount at the upper end of our normal range was appropriate.
We agreed with the Audit Committee that we would report to them misstatements identified 
during our audit above £9 million (group audit) (2022: £9 million) and £6 million (company 
audit) (2022: £5 million) as well as misstatements below those amounts that, in our view, 
warranted reporting for qualitative reasons.

In addition we agreed with the Audit Committee that we would report to them misstatements 
identified during our group audit above £1 million (2022: £2 million) for misstatements related 
to adjusted profit before tax within the financial statements, as well as misstatements below 
that amount that, in our view, warranted reporting for qualitative reasons. 

The audit of the company Financial Statements was performed entirely by the group audit 
team in the UK, leveraging on the work performed on the group audit where appropriate 
with additional audit procedures performed on other company specific balances.

The impact of climate risk on our audit
In planning our audit, we made enquiries with management to understand the extent of the 
potential impact of climate change risk on the financial statements. Our evaluation of this 
conclusion included challenging key judgements and estimates in areas where we considered 
that there was greatest potential for climate change impact. We particularly considered how 
climate change risks would impact the assumptions made in the valuation of investment 
properties as explained in our key audit matter above. We also considered the consistency 
of the disclosures in relation to climate change made within the Annual Report, the financial 
statements and the knowledge obtained from our audit. 

Materiality
The scope of our audit was influenced by our application of materiality. We set certain 
quantitative thresholds for materiality. These, together with qualitative considerations, 
helped us to determine the scope of our audit and the nature, timing and extent of our audit 
procedures on the individual financial statement line items and disclosures and in evaluating 
the effect of misstatements, both individually and in aggregate on the financial statements 
as a whole.

Based on our professional judgement, we determined materiality for the financial statements 
as a whole as follows:

Overall materiality

How we determined it

Rationale for benchmark applied

Financial statements - company

£173 million (2022: £174 million).

£118 million (2022: £108 million).

The primary measurement attribute 
of the group is the carrying value of 
property investments. On this basis, 
we set an overall group materiality 
level based on total assets.

The primary measurement attribute 
of the company is the carrying 
value of investments in subsidiaries. 
On this basis, we set an overall 
company materiality level based on 
total assets.

In addition to overall group materiality, a specific materiality was also applied to group Income 
Statement line items that impact adjusted earnings, which is based on profit before tax, 
adjusted to exclude fair value gain/(losses) on investment property and derivatives, joint 
venture performance fee income and impairment loss on loan due from associate. We set 
a specific materiality level of £20 million (2022: £19 million), equating to 5% of adjusted profit 
before tax.

Conclusions relating to going concern
Our evaluation of the directors’ assessment of the group's and the company’s ability 
to continue to adopt the going concern basis of accounting included:
 – Procedures to identify events or conditions that may cast significant doubt on the ability 

to continue as a going concern and whether or not a material uncertainty related to going 
concern exists;

 – Obtaining the Directors’ assessment of going concern and assessing the current impact of 
severe, but plausible, downside scenarios and the basis for the downside stress scenarios 
that have been applied;

 – Evaluation and corroboration of management’s significant assumptions used to assess going 
concern, including whether or not they are appropriate in the context of changes from prior 
periods, and align with our understanding of the entity and other relevant areas of the entity’s 
business activities;

 – Review of potential financial or non-financial debt covenant defaults leading to acceleration 

of repayment of borrowing facilities; and

 – Assessing the group and company’s liquidity and whether the entity has adequately 

disclosed all required going concern events and conditions.

Based on the work we have performed, we have not identified any material uncertainties 
relating to events or conditions that, individually or collectively, may cast significant doubt on 
the group's and the company’s ability to continue as a going concern for a period of at least 
twelve months from when the financial statements are authorised for issue.

In auditing the financial statements, we have concluded that the directors’ use of the going 
concern basis of accounting in the preparation of the financial statements is appropriate.

However, because not all future events or conditions can be predicted, this conclusion is 
not a guarantee as to the group's and the company's ability to continue as a going concern.
In relation to the directors’ reporting on how they have applied the UK Corporate Governance 
Code, we have nothing material to add or draw attention to in relation to the directors’ 
statement in the financial statements about whether the directors considered it appropriate 
to adopt the going concern basis of accounting.

Our responsibilities and the responsibilities of the directors with respect to going concern 
are described in the relevant sections of this report.

Reporting on other information
The other information comprises all of the information in the Annual Report other than the 
financial statements and our auditors’ report thereon. The directors are responsible for the 
other information. Our opinion on the financial statements does not cover the other 
information and, accordingly, we do not express an audit opinion or, except to the extent 
otherwise explicitly stated in this report, any form of assurance thereon.

In connection with our audit of the financial statements, our responsibility is to read the other 
information and, in doing so, consider whether the other information is materially inconsistent 
with the financial statements or our knowledge obtained in the audit, or otherwise appears to 
be materially misstated. If we identify an apparent material inconsistency or material 
misstatement, we are required to perform procedures to conclude whether there is a material 
misstatement of the financial statements or a material misstatement of the other information. 
If, based on the work we have performed, we conclude that there is a material misstatement of 
this other information, we are required to report that fact. We have nothing to report based on 
these responsibilities.

With respect to the Strategic Report and Directors’ Report, we also considered whether the 
disclosures required by the UK Companies Act 2006 have been included.

Based on our work undertaken in the course of the audit, the Companies Act 2006 requires 
us also to report certain opinions and matters as described below.

Strategic report and Directors’ Report
In our opinion, based on the work undertaken in the course of the audit, the information given 
in the Strategic report and Directors’ Report for the year ended 31 December 2023 is consistent 
with the financial statements and has been prepared in accordance with applicable legal 
requirements.

In light of the knowledge and understanding of the group and company and their environment 
obtained in the course of the audit, we did not identify any material misstatements in the 
Strategic report and Directors’ Report.

Directors’ Remuneration
In our opinion, the part of the Directors’ Remuneration Report to be audited has been properly 
prepared in accordance with the Companies Act 2006.

Corporate governance statement
The Listing Rules require us to review the directors’ statements in relation to going concern, 
longer-term viability and that part of the corporate governance statement relating to the 
company’s compliance with the provisions of the UK Corporate Governance Code specified 
for our review. Our additional responsibilities with respect to the corporate governance 
statement as other information are described in the Reporting on other information section 
of this report.

Based on the work undertaken as part of our audit, we have concluded that each of the 
following elements of the corporate governance statement is materially consistent with the 
financial statements and our knowledge obtained during the audit, and we have nothing 
material to add or draw attention to in relation to:
 – The directors’ confirmation that they have carried out a robust assessment of the emerging 

and principal risks;

 – The disclosures in the Annual Report that describe those principal risks, what procedures 

are in place to identify emerging risks and an explanation of how these are being managed 
or mitigated;

 – The directors’ statement in the financial statements about whether they considered it 

appropriate to adopt the going concern basis of accounting in preparing them, and their 
identification of any material uncertainties to the group’s and company’s ability to continue 
to do so over a period of at least twelve months from the date of approval of the financial 
statements;

 – The directors’ explanation as to their assessment of the group's and company’s prospects, 

the period this assessment covers and why the period is appropriate; and

 – The directors’ statement as to whether they have a reasonable expectation that the company 
will be able to continue in operation and meet its liabilities as they fall due over the period of 
its assessment, including any related disclosures drawing attention to any necessary 
qualifications or assumptions.

Our review of the directors’ statement regarding the longer-term viability of the group and 
company was substantially less in scope than an audit and only consisted of making inquiries 
and considering the directors’ process supporting their statement; checking that the 
statement is in alignment with the relevant provisions of the UK Corporate Governance Code; 
and considering whether the statement is consistent with the financial statements and our 
knowledge and understanding of the group and company and their environment obtained 
in the course of the audit.

In addition, based on the work undertaken as part of our audit, we have concluded that each 
of the following elements of the corporate governance statement is materially consistent with 
the financial statements and our knowledge obtained during the audit:
 – The directors’ statement that they consider the Annual Report, taken as a whole, is fair, 

balanced and understandable, and provides the information necessary for the members 
to assess the group’s and company's position, performance, business model and strategy;

 – The section of the Annual Report that describes the review of effectiveness of risk 

management and internal control systems; and

 – The section of the Annual Report describing the work of the Audit Committee.

We have nothing to report in respect of our responsibility to report when the directors’ 
statement relating to the company’s compliance with the Code does not properly disclose a 
departure from a relevant provision of the Code specified under the Listing Rules for review by 
the auditors.

Responsibilities for the financial statements and the audit
Responsibilities of the directors for the financial statements
As explained more fully in the Statement of Directors’ responsibilities in respect of the Financial 
Statements, the directors are responsible for the preparation of the financial statements in 
accordance with the applicable framework and for being satisfied that they give a true and fair 
view. The directors are also responsible for such internal control as they determine is necessary 
to enable the preparation of financial statements that are free from material misstatement, 
whether due to fraud or error.

In preparing the financial statements, the directors are responsible for assessing the group’s 
and the company’s ability to continue as a going concern, disclosing, as applicable, matters 
related to going concern and using the going concern basis of accounting unless the directors 
either intend to liquidate the group or the company or to cease operations, or have no realistic 
alternative but to do so.

Auditors’ responsibilities for the audit of the financial statements
Our objectives are to obtain reasonable assurance about whether the financial statements 
as a whole are free from material misstatement, whether due to fraud or error, and to issue an 
auditors’ report that includes our opinion. Reasonable assurance is a high level of assurance, 
but is not a guarantee that an audit conducted in accordance with ISAs (UK) and ISAs will 
always detect a material misstatement when it exists. Misstatements can arise from fraud or 
error and are considered material if, individually or in the aggregate, they could reasonably 
be expected to influence the economic decisions of users taken on the basis of these 
financial statements.

Irregularities, including fraud, are instances of non-compliance with laws and regulations. 
We design procedures in line with our responsibilities, outlined above, to detect material 
misstatements in respect of irregularities, including fraud. The extent to which our 
procedures are capable of detecting irregularities, including fraud, is detailed below.

Based on our understanding of the group and industry, we identified that the principal risks 
of non-compliance with laws and regulations related to compliance with the Real Estate 
Investment Trust (REIT) status and SIIC regime and the UK regulatory principles, such as those 
governed by the Financial Conduct Authority, and we considered the extent to which non-
compliance might have a material effect on the financial statements. We also considered those 
laws and regulations that have a direct impact on the financial statements such as the 
Companies Act 2006. We evaluated management’s incentives and opportunities for fraudulent 
manipulation of the financial statements (including the risk of override of controls), and 
determined that the principal risks were related to journal entries to increase revenue, and 
management bias in accounting estimates and judgemental areas of the Financial Statements 
such as valuation of investment properties. The group engagement team shared this risk 
assessment with the component auditors so that they could include appropriate audit 
procedures in response to such risks in their work.

Audit procedures performed by the group engagement team and/or component 
auditors included:
 – Discussions with management and internal audit, including consideration of known or 

suspected instances of non-compliance with laws and regulations and fraud, and review 
of the reports made by internal audit;

 – Understanding management’s internal controls designed to prevent and detect irregularities;
 – Assessment of matters, if any, reported on the group’s whistleblowing helpline and the results 

of management’s investigation of such matters;

As part of an audit in accordance with ISAs, we exercise professional judgement and maintain 
professional scepticism throughout the audit. We also:
 – Identify and assess the risks of material misstatement of the financial statements, whether 
due to fraud or error, design and perform audit procedures responsive to those risks, and 
obtain audit evidence that is sufficient and appropriate to provide a basis for our opinion. 
The risk of not detecting a material misstatement resulting from fraud is higher than for 
one resulting from error, as fraud may involve collusion, forgery, intentional omissions, 
misrepresentations, or the override of internal control.

 – Reviewing the group’s litigation register in so far as it related to non-compliance with laws 

 – Obtain an understanding of internal control relevant to the audit in order to design audit 

and regulations and fraud;

 – Reviewing relevant meeting minutes, including those of the Board of Directors and the 

Audit Committee;

procedures that are appropriate in the circumstances, but not for the purpose of 
expressing an opinion on the effectiveness of the group’s and company’s internal control.

 – Evaluate the appropriateness of accounting policies used and the reasonableness 

 – Designing audit procedures to incorporate unpredictability around the nature, timing 

of accounting estimates and related disclosures made by management.

and extent of our testing;

 – Review of tax compliance with the involvement of our tax specialists in the audit;
 – Procedures relating to the valuation of investment properties described in the related key 

audit matter above; and

 – Identifying and testing journal entries, in particular any journal entries posted with unusual 

account combinations.

There are inherent limitations in the audit procedures described above. We are less likely to 
become aware of instances of non-compliance with laws and regulations that are not closely 
related to events and transactions reflected in the financial statements. Also, the risk of not 
detecting a material misstatement due to fraud is higher than the risk of not detecting one 
resulting from error, as fraud may involve deliberate concealment by, for example, forgery or 
intentional misrepresentations, or through collusion.

Our audit testing might include testing complete populations of certain transactions and 
balances, possibly using data auditing techniques. However, it typically involves selecting a 
limited number of items for testing, rather than testing complete populations. We will often 
seek to target particular items for testing based on their size or risk characteristics. In other 
cases, we will use audit sampling to enable us to draw a conclusion about the population 
from which the sample is selected.

A further description of our responsibilities for the audit of the financial 
statements in accordance with ISAs (UK) is located on the FRC’s website at: 
www.frc.org.uk/auditorsresponsibilities. This description forms part of our auditors’ report.

 – Conclude on the appropriateness of management’s use of the going concern basis of 

accounting and, based on the audit evidence obtained, whether a material uncertainty exists 
related to events or conditions that may cast significant doubt on the group’s and company’s 
ability to continue as a going concern. If we conclude that a material uncertainty exists, we 
are required to draw attention in our auditor’s report to the related disclosures in the financial 
statements or, if such disclosures are inadequate, to modify our opinion. Our conclusions are 
based on the audit evidence obtained up to the date of our auditor’s report. However, future 
events or conditions may cause the group to cease to continue as a going concern.

 – Evaluate the overall presentation, structure and content of the financial statements, including 
the disclosures, and whether the financial statements represent the underlying transactions 
and events in a manner that achieves fair presentation.

 – Obtain sufficient appropriate audit evidence regarding the financial information of the 

entities or business activities within the group and company to express an opinion on the 
financial statements. We are responsible for the direction, supervision and performance of 
the group and company audit. We remain solely responsible for our audit opinion.

We communicate with those charged with governance regarding, among other matters, the 
planned scope and timing of the audit and significant audit findings, including any significant 
deficiencies in internal control that we identify during our audit.

We also provide those charged with governance with a statement that we have complied with 
relevant ethical requirements regarding independence, and to communicate with them all 
relationships and other matters that may reasonably be thought to bear on our independence, 
and where applicable, actions taken to eliminate threats or safeguards applied.

From the matters communicated with those charged with governance, we determine those 
matters that were of most significance in the audit of the financial statements of the current 
period and are therefore the key audit matters. We describe these matters in our auditor’s 
report unless law or regulation precludes public disclosure about the matter or when, in 
extremely rare circumstances, we determine that a matter should not be communicated in 
our report because the adverse consequences of doing so would reasonably be expected to 
outweigh the public interest benefits of such communication.

Notes to the Financial Statements For the year ended 31 December 2023

1. Material Accounting Policies
General information
SEGRO plc (the Company) is a public limited company, limited by shares, incorporated, 
domiciled and registered in England in the United Kingdom under the Companies Act. 
The address of the registered office is given on the inside back cover.

New and amended standards adopted by the Group
The Group has applied the following standards and amendments for the first time for their 
annual reporting period commencing 1 January 2023:
 – Amendments to IAS 1, ‘Presentation of financial statements’, disclosure of accounting policies 
 – Amendments to IAS 8, ‘Accounting Policies, changes in accounting estimates and errors’, 

The principal activities of the Company and its subsidiaries (the Group) and the nature 
of the Group’s operations are set out in the Strategic Report on pages 20 to 21.

These Financial Statements are presented in pounds sterling to the nearest million because 
that is the currency of the primary economic environment in which the Group operates and 
is the functional currency of the Company. 

Basis of preparation
The Financial Statements have been prepared in accordance with UK-adopted International 
Accounting Standards (IAS) and the requirements of the Companies Act 2006 as applicable to 
companies reporting under those standards and International Financial Reporting Standards 
(IFRS) adopted pursuant to Regulation (EC) No 1606/2002 as it applies in the European Union. 
UK adopted International Accounting Standards differs in certain respects from International 
Financial Reporting Standards as adopted by the EU. The differences have no material impact 
on the Financial Statements for the periods presented, which therefore also comply with 
International Reporting Standards as adopted by the EU. In addition, the Group has also 
disclosed additional measures relating to the Best Practice Recommendations Guidelines 
issued by the European Public Real Estate Association (EPRA) as appropriate, as discussed 
further in Note 2 and Note 12.

The Financial Statements have been prepared on a going concern basis. As discussed in the 
Financial review on page 50, the Directors have a reasonable expectation that the Company 
and Group have adequate resources to continue in operational existence for a period of at 
least 12 months from the date of approval of the Financial Statements. At 31 December 2023 
the Group held cash and available committed facilities of £1.5 billion with a long-dated debt 
maturity profile. This provides significant liquidity to meet the Group’s operational requirements 
and capital commitments for the foreseeable future. The financial covenants have been stress 
tested and substantial headroom exists against the gearing and interest cover covenants at 
31 December 2023 and the covenants are not expected to be breached for a period of at least 
12 months from the date of approval of the Financial Statements.

The Directors have taken advantage of the exemption offered by section 408 of the Companies 
Act 2006 not to present a separate income statement and statement of comprehensive 
income for the Company. The Financial Statements have been prepared under the historical 
cost convention as modified by the revaluation of properties and certain financial assets and 
liabilities including derivatives.

The accounting policies set out below have, unless otherwise stated, been applied consistently 
to all periods presented in these Group Financial Statements.

definition of accounting estimates

 – Amendments to IAS 12, ‘Deferred tax related to assets and liabilities arising from a single 

transaction’

 – Amendments to IAS 12, ‘Pillar II and deferred tax’
 – IFRS 17, ‘Insurance contracts’

The impact of the new IFRS 17 ‘Insurance contracts’ standard has been assessed, particularly 
in consideration of the financial and performance guarantees provided by the Group. There is 
no material impact from the new standard.

The disclosure requirements from the amendments to IAS 12 ‘Pillar II and deferred tax’ is set out 
in Note 10(vi).

The other amendments did not have a material impact on the amounts recognised in the prior 
or current period and are not expected to significantly affect future periods. 

New standards and amendments not yet adopted
Certain new accounting standards and amendments are effective for annual periods beginning 
after 1 January 2023, and have not been applied in preparing these Financial Statements:
 – Amendments to IAS 1, ‘Presentation of financial statements’, on classification of liabilities
 – Amendments to IFRS 16, Leases on sale and leaseback
 – Amendments to IAS 7 Statement of Cash Flows and IFRS 7 Financial Instruments: Disclosures: 

Supplier Finance Arrangements

 – Amendments to IAS 21 The Effects of Changes in Foreign Exchange Rates: Lack of 

Exchangeability

The amendments that are not yet effective are not expected to have a material impact on the 
Group in the current or future reporting periods and on the foreseeable future transactions.

Basis of consolidation
The consolidated Financial Statements comprise the Financial Statements of the Company 
and the Subsidiaries (‘the Group’), plus the Group’s share of the results and net assets of its 
joint ventures and associates.

Subsidiaries
Subsidiaries are entities controlled by the Group. The Group controls an entity when it is 
exposed to, or has rights to, variable returns from its involvement with the entity and has the 
ability to affect those returns through its power over the entity. In assessing control, the Group 
takes into consideration potential voting rights. The acquisition date is the date on which 
control is transferred to the acquirer. The Financial Statements of subsidiaries are included in 
the consolidated Financial Statements from the date that control commences until the date 
that control ceases. Losses applicable to the non-controlling interests in a subsidiary are 
allocated to the non-controlling interests even if doing so causes the non-controlling interests 
to have a deficit balance.

Investments and loans in subsidiaries held by the Company
Investments and loans in subsidiaries held by the Company are stated at cost less any 
impairment. Impairment of loans is calculated in accordance with IFRS 9 and impairment of 
investments is calculated in accordance with IAS 36 with further details provided in Note 7(iv). 

Joint ventures
A joint venture is a contract under which the Group and other parties undertake an activity or 
invest in an entity, under joint control. The Group uses equity accounting for such entities, 
carrying its investment at cost plus the movement in the Group’s share of net assets after 
acquisition, less impairment.

Associates 
Associates are all entities over which the Group has significant influence but not control or joint 
control. This is generally the case where the Group holds between 20 per cent and 50 per cent 
of the voting rights. The Group uses equity accounting for such entities, carrying its investment 
at cost plus the movement in the Group’s share of net assets after acquisition, less impairment.

Where the Group’s share of losses in an equity accounted investment equals or exceeds its 
interest in the entity, the Group does not recognise further losses, unless it has incurred 
obligations or made payments on behalf of the other entity. 

Transactions eliminated on consolidation
Intra-group balances and transactions, and any unrealised income and expenses arising 
from intra-group transactions, are eliminated. Unrealised gains arising from transactions with 
equity-accounted investees are eliminated against the investment to the extent of the Group’s 
interest in the investee. Unrealised losses are eliminated in the same way as unrealised gains, 
but only to the extent that there is no evidence of impairment on the asset transferred.

Business combinations
The acquisition of subsidiaries is accounted for using the acquisition method. The cost of the 
acquisition is measured at the aggregate of the fair values of assets given, liabilities incurred or 
assumed, and equity instruments issued by the Group in exchange for control of the acquiree. 
Acquisition related costs are recognised in the Income Statement as incurred. The acquiree’s 
identifiable assets, liabilities and contingent liabilities that meet the conditions for recognition 
under IFRS 3 are recognised at their fair value at the acquisition date, except for non-current 
assets (or disposal groups) that are classified as held for sale in accordance with IFRS 5 ‘Non 
Current Assets Held for Sale and Discontinued Operations’, which are recognised and 
measured at fair value less costs to sell.

Goodwill arising on acquisition is recognised as an asset measured at cost, being the excess 
of the cost of the business combination over the Group’s interest in the net fair value of the 
identifiable assets, liabilities and contingent liabilities recognised. If, after reassessment, 
the Group’s interest in the net fair value of the acquiree’s identifiable assets, liabilities and 
contingent liabilities exceeds the cost of the business combination, the excess is recognised 
immediately in the Income Statement.

When the consideration transferred by the Group in a business combination includes a 
contingent consideration arrangement, the contingent consideration is measured at its 
acquisition-date fair value. Changes in fair value of the contingent consideration that qualify 
as measurement period adjustments are adjusted retrospectively, with corresponding 
adjustments against goodwill. Measurement period adjustments are adjustments that 
arise from additional information obtained during the ‘measurement period’ (which cannot 
exceed one year from the acquisition date) about facts and circumstances that existed at 
the acquisition date.

Contingent consideration that is classified as an asset or a liability is re-measured at 
subsequent reporting dates in accordance with IFRS 9, as appropriate, with the corresponding 
gain or loss being recognised in the Income Statement.

If the business combination is achieved in stages, the acquisition date carrying value of the 
acquirer’s previously held equity interest in the acquiree is remeasured to fair value at the 
acquisition date. Any gains or losses arising from such remeasurement are recognised in 
the Income Statement within realised and unrealised property gains and losses. The same 
treatment is applied for acquisitions of a subsidiary achieved in stages that meet the IFRS 3 
concentration test to be treated as an asset acquisition.

For acquisitions of a subsidiary that meet the IFRS 3 concentration test to be treated as an 
asset acquisition, the Group allocates the cost between the individual identifiable assets 
and liabilities in the Group based on their relative fair values at the date of acquisition. Such 
transactions do not give rise to goodwill, generally no deferred tax is recognised on initial 
temporary differences and transaction costs are capitalised. The Group has elected to initially 
measure the interest of non-controlling interest shareholders in the acquiree at their proportion 
of the acquisition date net fair value of the assets, liabilities and contingent liabilities 
recognised. 

Foreign currency transactions
Foreign currency transactions are translated to the respective functional currency of Group 
entities at the foreign exchange rate ruling on the transaction date. Foreign exchange gains 
and losses resulting from settling these, or from retranslating monetary assets and liabilities 
held in foreign currencies, are booked in the Income Statement. The exception is for foreign 
currency loans and derivatives that hedge investments in foreign subsidiaries, where exchange 
differences are booked in equity until the investment is realised.

Consolidation of foreign entities
Assets and liabilities of foreign entities are translated into sterling at exchange rates ruling at the 
Balance Sheet date. Their income, expenses and cash flows are translated at the average rate 
for the period or at spot rate for significant items. Resultant exchange differences are booked 
in Other Comprehensive Income and recognised in the Group Income Statement when the 
operation is sold.

The principal exchange rates used to translate foreign currency denominated amounts in 
2023 are:

The interest of non-controlling interest shareholders in the acquiree is initially measured at their 
proportion of the net fair value of the assets, liabilities and contingent liabilities recognised.

Balance Sheet: £1 = €1.15 (2022: £1 = €1.13). Income Statement: £1= €1.15 (2022: £1 = €1.17).

Investment properties
These properties include completed properties that are generating rent or are available for 
rent, and development properties that are under development, available for development 
or income-producing properties acquired with the explicit intention to take back for 
redevelopment ('covered land'). Investment properties comprise freehold and leasehold 
properties and are first measured at cost (including transaction costs), then revalued to market 
value at each reporting date by professional valuers. Lease liabilities associated with leasehold 
properties are accounted for under IFRS 16, see the Leases accounting policy. If a valuation 
obtained for a property held under a lease is net of all payments expected to be made, any 
related lease liability recognised separately in the Balance Sheet is added back to arrive at the 
carrying value of the investment property for accounting purposes. Valuation gains and losses 
in a period are taken to the Income Statement. As the Group uses the fair value model, as per 
IAS 40 ‘Investment Property’, no depreciation is provided. An asset will be classified as held for 
sale within investment properties, in line with IFRS 5 ‘Non-Current Assets Held for Sale and 
Discontinued Operations’, where the asset is available for immediate sale in its present 
condition and the sale is highly probable.

Investment properties are transferred to trading properties when there is a change in use 
and the property ceases to meet the definition of investment property. 

Other interests in property
Other interests in property include the cost and related fees in respect of land options, which 
are initially capitalised and regularly tested for impairment. The impairment review includes 
consideration of the resale value of the option and likelihood of achieving planning consent.

Other investments
Other investments are initially measured at cost, and then revalued to fair value. Gains and 
losses arising from valuation are recognised in the Income Statement within realised and 
unrealised property gains and losses.

Trading properties
These are properties being developed for sale or being held for sale after development is 
complete, and are shown at the lower of cost and net realisable value. Cost includes direct 
expenditure and capitalised interest.

Trading properties are transferred to investment properties when there is a change in use 
usually evidenced by the commencement of an operating lease to another party, together 
with the intention to hold the property to generate rent, or for capital appreciation, or for both.

Property acquisitions and disposals
Properties are treated as acquired at the point when the Group assumes the control of 
ownership and as disposed when transferred to the buyer. Generally, this would occur on 
completion of the contract. Any gain or loss arising on de-recognition of the property, which 
is calculated as the difference between the net disposal proceeds and the carrying amount 
of the asset at the commencement of the accounting period plus capital expenditure in the 
period, is included in profit or loss in the period in which the property is derecognised. Gains or 
losses on disposal of investment properties are shown in the Income Statement within realised 
and unrealised property gains and losses. 

Leases
At inception, the Group assesses whether a contract is or contains a lease. This assessment 
involves the exercise of judgement about whether the Group obtains substantially all the 
economic benefits from the use of that asset, and whether the Group has the right to direct 
the use of the asset. 

The Group recognises a right-of-use (ROU) asset and the lease liability at the commencement 
date of the lease. 

Lease liabilities include the present value of payments which generally include fixed payments 
and variable payments that depend on an index (such as an inflation index). When the lease 
contains an extension or purchase option that the Group considers reasonably certain to be 
exercised, the cost of the option is included in the lease payments. 

Each lease payment is allocated between the liability and finance cost. The lease payments are 
discounted using the interest rate implicit in the lease if that rate can be readily determined or 
if not, the incremental borrowing rate is used. The finance cost is charged to profit or loss over 
the lease period so as to produce a constant rate of interest on the remaining balance of the 
liability for each period. 

Cash payments relating to the principal portion of the lease liabilities are presented as cash 
flows from financing activities and cash payments for the interest portion are presented as 
cash flows from operating activities. 

The ROU asset is measured at a cost based on the amount of the initial measurement of the 
lease liability, plus initial direct costs and the cost of obligations to refurbish the asset, less 
any incentives received. 

The ROU asset (other than the ROU assets that relate to land or property that meets the 
definition of investment property under IAS 40) is depreciated over the shorter of the 
lease term or the useful life of the underlying asset. The ROU asset is subject to testing for 
impairment if there is an indicator of impairment. ROU assets are included in the heading 
property, plant and equipment, and the lease liability included in the headings current and 
non current trade and other payables on the Balance Sheet. 

Where the ROU asset relates to land or property that meets the definition of investment 
property under IAS 40, after initial recognition the ROU asset is subsequently accounted for 
as investment property and carried at fair value (see Investment properties accounting policy). 
Valuation gains and losses in a period are taken to the Income Statement. The ROU assets are 
included in the heading Investment properties, and the lease liability in the headings current 
and non-current trade and other payables on the Balance Sheet.

The Group has elected not to recognise ROU assets and liabilities for leases where the total 
lease term is less than or equal to 12 months, or for low value leases. The payments for such 
leases are recognised in the Income Statement on a straight-line basis over the lease term.

Revenue
Revenue includes gross rental income, joint venture management and performance fee 
income, income from service charges and other recoveries from tenants and proceeds 
from the sale of trading properties. 

Rental income
Rental income from properties let as operating leases is recognised on a straight-line basis 
over the lease term. Lease incentives and initial costs to arrange leases are capitalised, then 
amortised on a straight-line basis over the lease term (‘rent averaging’). Surrender premiums 
received in the period are included in rental income.

Property, plant and equipment
Plant and equipment are stated at historic cost less accumulated depreciation. Cost includes 
purchase price and any directly attributable costs.

Depreciation is recognised so as to write off the cost or valuation of assets (other than 
investment properties) less their residual values, using the straight-line method, on the 
following bases:

Plant and equipment

Solar panels

20% per annum

5% per annum 

Changes in the scope or the consideration for a lease, that was not part of the original terms 
and conditions, which might arise as a result of lease concessions, are accounted as a lease 
modification. Lease modifications are accounted for as a new lease from the effective date of 
the modification, considering any prepaid or accrued lease payments relating to the original 
lease as part of the lease payments for the new lease. Concessions granted to tenants after the 
date the conceded rent fall due are accounted for as an expected credit loss and not as a lease 
modification, on the basis there is no change to the consideration or scope of the lease.

Service charges and other recoveries from tenants
These include income in relation to service charges, directly recoverable expenditure and 
management fees. Revenue from providing services is recognised in the accounting period 
in which the services are rendered. Revenue from services is recognised based on the actual 
service provided to the end of the reporting period as a proportion of the total services to be 
provided and recognised over time. The Group generally acts as the principal in service charge 
transactions as it directly controls the delivery of the services at the point they are provided to 
the tenant. Where the Group acts as a principal, service charge income is presented gross 
within revenue and service charge expense presented gross within costs. 

Joint venture management and performance fees 
Joint venture management and performance fees are recognised as income in the period 
to which they relate. Management fees are recognised in the accounting period in which 
the services are rendered. Revenue from services is recognised based on the actual service 
provided to the end of the reporting period as a proportion of the total services to be provided 
and recognised over time. Performance fees are based on the joint venture’s performance over 
the performance period and payable subject to meeting certain criteria and hurdle rates at the 
end of the period (further details are given in Note 7). Performance fees are recognised during 
and at the end of the performance period to the extent that it is highly probable there will not 
be a significant future reversal and the fee can be reliably estimated.

Sale of trading properties
Proceeds from the sale of trading properties are recognised at the point in time at which 
control of the property has been transferred to the purchaser. Therefore, revenue is 
recognised at a point in time and generally occurs on completion of the contract.

The estimated useful lives, residual values and depreciation method are reviewed at the 
end of each reporting period, with the effect of any changes in estimate accounted for on 
a prospective basis.

Property relates to the ROU asset recognised for office leases entered into by the Group. The 
ROU asset is initially measured based on the present value of lease payments, plus initial direct 
costs and the cost of obligations to refurbish the asset, less any incentives received. The ROU 
asset is depreciated over the shorter of the lease term or the useful life of the underlying asset. 

Financial instruments
Borrowings
Borrowings are recognised initially at fair value less attributable transaction costs. Subsequent 
to initial recognition, borrowings are stated at amortised cost with any difference between the 
amount initially recognised and the redemption value being recognised in the Income 
Statement over the period of the borrowings, using the effective interest rate method.

General and specific borrowing costs that are directly attributable to expenditure on properties 
under development are capitalised. Expenditure includes the purchase cost of a site if it has 
been purchased with the specific intention to redevelop. Interest is capitalised from the 
commencement of the development activity until the date of practical completion. The 
capitalisation of borrowing costs is suspended if there are prolonged periods when 
development activity is interrupted. The interest capitalised is calculated using the Group’s 
weighted average cost of borrowing for the relevant currency, or, if appropriate, the rate on 
specific associated borrowings.

Derivative financial instruments and hedging activities
The Group uses derivatives (principally interest rate swaps, currency swaps, forward foreign 
exchange contracts and interest caps) in managing interest rate risk and foreign currency risk, 
and does not use them for trading. They are recorded, and subsequently revalued, at fair value, 
with revaluation gains or losses being immediately taken to the Income Statement (fair value 
through profit or loss ‘FVPL’). The exception is for derivatives qualifying as hedges, when the 
treatment of the gain/loss depends upon the item being hedged, and may go to other 
comprehensive income within the Statement of Comprehensive Income (fair value 
through other comprehensive income ‘FVOCI’).

151

Derivatives with a maturity of less than 12 months or that expect to be settled within 12 months 
of the Balance Sheet date are presented as current assets or liabilities. Other derivatives are 
presented as non-current assets or liabilities.

Share capital
Ordinary shares are classified as equity. Incremental costs directly attributable to the issue 
of new shares or options are shown in equity as a deduction, net of tax, from the proceeds.

Hedge accounting is applied to net investments in foreign operations in non-functional 
currencies using forward foreign exchange derivatives and foreign currency denominated 
debt. Changes in the fair value on remeasurement of derivatives and exchange differences 
on foreign currency denominated debt are recorded in other comprehensive income and 
accumulated in the translation reserve within equity to the extent that the hedges are effective. 
Any ineffectiveness is recognised in the Income Statement within net finance costs. The 
cumulative gains and losses remain in equity until the associated hedged item is disposed 
of, at which point they are reclassified to the income statement.

Trade and other receivables and payables
Trade and other receivables are booked at fair value and subsequently measured at amortised 
cost using the effective interest method. Trade and other payables are initially measured at fair 
value, net of transaction costs and subsequently measured at amortised costs using the 
effective interest method. 

The Group applies the IFRS 9 simplified approach to measuring expected credit losses (ECLs) 
which uses a lifetime expected loss allowance for all trade receivables. Note 17(vi) details the 
Group’s calculation for measuring ECLs.

Cash and cash equivalents
Cash and cash equivalents comprise cash on hand and call deposits, and other short-term 
highly liquid investments with original maturities of three months or less that are readily 
convertible to a known amount of cash and are subject to an insignificant risk of changes 
in value.

Share-based payments
The cost of granting share options and other share-based remuneration is measured at their 
fair value at the grant date. The costs are expensed straight-line over the vesting period in 
the Income Statement, based on estimates of the shares or options that will eventually vest. 
Charges are reversed if it appears that non-market-based performance conditions will not 
be met.

The fair value excludes the effect of non-market-based vesting conditions.

At each Balance Sheet date, the Group revises its estimate of the number of equity instruments 
expected to vest as a result of the effect of non-market-based vesting conditions. The impact 
of the revision of the original estimates, if any, is recognised in the Income Statement such that 
the cumulative expense reflects the revised estimate, with a corresponding adjustment to 
equity within the share-based payment reserve.

When shares recognised as equity are repurchased, the amount of the consideration paid, 
which includes directly attributable costs, is recognised as a deduction from equity. 
Repurchased shares are classified as treasury shares and are presented in the treasury share 
reserve. When treasury shares are sold or reissued subsequently, the amount received is 
recognised as an increase in equity and the resulting surplus or deficit on the transaction 
is presented within share premium.

Shares held by Ocorian Limited and Equiniti Limited to satisfy various Group share schemes 
are disclosed as own shares held and deducted from contributed equity.

Income tax
Income tax on the profit or loss for the year comprises current and deferred tax. Current tax is 
the tax payable on the taxable income for the year and any adjustment in respect of previous 
years. Current tax is calculated on the basis of the tax laws enacted or substantively enacted 
at the end of the reporting period in the countries where the Company’s subsidiaries and 
associates operate and generate taxable income.

Deferred tax is provided in full using the Balance Sheet liability method on temporary 
differences between the carrying amounts of assets and liabilities for financial reporting 
purposes and the amounts used for taxation purposes. Deferred tax is determined using tax 
rates that have been enacted or substantively enacted by the reporting date and are expected 
to apply when the asset is realised or the liability is settled.

No provision is made for temporary differences (i) arising on the initial recognition of assets 
or liabilities, other than a business combination and leases that affect neither accounting nor 
taxable profit and (ii) relating to investments in subsidiaries to the extent that they will not 
reverse in the foreseeable future.

Deferred tax assets are recognised to the extent that it is probable that suitable taxable profits 
will be available against which deductible temporary differences can be utilised.

Critical accounting judgements and key sources of estimation uncertainty
In the application of the Group’s accounting policies, the Directors are required to make 
judgements, estimates and assumptions about the carrying amount of assets and liabilities 
that are not readily apparent from other sources. The estimates and associated assumptions 
are based on historical experience and other factors that are considered to be relevant. 
Actual results may differ from these estimates. The estimates and underlying assumptions are 
reviewed on an ongoing basis. Revisions to accounting estimates are recognised in the period 
in which the estimate is revised if the revision affects only that period, or in the period of the 
revisions and future periods if the revision affects both current and future periods.

Significant areas of estimation uncertainty
Property valuations
Valuation of property is a central component of the business. In estimating the fair value, the 
Group engages third-party qualified valuers to perform the valuation. Information about the 
valuation techniques and inputs used in determining the fair value of the property portfolio 
is disclosed in Note 25 property valuation techniques and related quantitative information.

In the Financial Statements for the year ended 31 December 2022, the performance fee 
payable from the SELP joint venture to SEGRO was disclosed as a significant area of estimation 
uncertainty. As detailed further in Note 7, the 10-year performance fee period ended during 
2023 and the fee was agreed and paid in the year. Therefore no estimation uncertainty exists 
over the recognition of the fee. 

Significant areas of judgements in applying the Group’s accounting policies
Accounting for significant property transactions
Property transactions are complex in nature. Management considers each material transaction 
separately, with an assessment carried out to determine the most appropriate accounting 
treatment and judgements applied. The judgements include whether the transaction 
represents an asset acquisition or business combination and the cut-off for property 
transactions on recognition of property assets and revenue recognition. In making its 
judgement over the cut-off for property transactions, management considers whether the 
control of ownership of the assets acquired or disposed of has transferred to or from the Group 
(this consideration includes the revenue recognition criteria set out in IFRS 15 for the sale of 
trading properties). 

In making its judgement on whether the acquisition of property through the purchase of 
a corporate vehicle represents an asset acquisition or business combination, management 
considers whether the integrated set of assets and activities acquired contain both inputs 
and processes along with the ability to create outputs. Management also applies the optional 
‘concentration test’ allowed under IFRS 3. When applying the optional test, management 
considers if substantially all of the fair value of gross assets acquired is concentrated in a single 
asset (or a group of similar assets). Where management judge that substantially all of the fair 
value of the gross assets acquired are concentrated in a single asset (or a group of similar 
assets) and the ‘concentration test’ met, the assets acquired would not represent a business 
and the purchase would be treated as an asset acquisition. 

There were no property transactions during the current or prior year requiring significant 
judgement.

REIT status
The Company has elected for UK REIT and French SIIC status. To continue to benefit from 
these tax regimes, the Group is required to comply with certain conditions as outlined in Note 
10. Management intends that the Group should continue as a UK REIT and a French SIIC for the 
foreseeable future.

Uncertain tax positions 
The Group is subject to periodic challenges by local tax authorities on a range of tax matters 
during the normal course of business. The tax impact can be uncertain until a conclusion is 
reached with the relevant tax authority or through a legal process. Management judgement is 
required in assessing the likelihood of whether a liability, including any associated penalties, will 
arise and the significant assessment relating to the recognition of withholding tax in France 
and is discussed further in Note 10.

2. Adjusted Profit
Adjusted profit is a non-GAAP measure and is the Group’s measure of underlying profit, which 
is used by the Board and senior management to measure and monitor the Group’s income 
performance.

It is based on the Best Practices Recommendations Guidelines of European Public Real Estate 
Association (EPRA), which calculate profit excluding investment and development property 
revaluations and gains or losses on disposals. Changes in the fair value of financial instruments 
and associated close-out costs and their related taxation, as well as other permitted one-off 
items, are also excluded. Refer to the Supplementary Notes for all EPRA adjustments.

The Directors may also exclude from the EPRA earnings measure additional items (gains and 
losses) which are considered by them to be non-recurring, unusual or significant by virtue of 
size and nature. In excluding such items going forward, management believe this gives a better 
measure of the underlying performance of the business.

Historically SELP performance fees were included in Adjusted Profit. They were not excluded 
because it was anticipated that further fees would subsequently be recognised throughout the 
latter part of the performance period and therefore these would not be considered unusual. 
The market volatility that was seen in the latter half of 2022 significantly impacted property 
valuations and, consequentially management’s consideration of SELP performance fees, 
leading to no performance fee being recognised for the year ended 31 December 2022. Based 
on this volatility, these fees are now considered unusual as they are inherently uncertain and 
sensitive to movements in property valuations (which themselves are excluded from the EPRA 
earnings metric). For the year ended 31 December 2023, the net profit after tax impact of the 
SELP performance fee recognised of £42 million has been excluded from the calculation of 
Adjusted profit and treated as a Company specific adjustment, see footnote 3 below and Note 
7(ii) for further details. 

As detailed further in Note 17(vi) an impairment loss of £28 million (2022: £nil) on a loan due 
from an associate has been recognised for the year ended 31 December 2023. The impairment 
of the loan is directly related to a wider property transaction entered into by the Group and has 
arisen due to a fair value deficit on land held by an associate. As the size and nature of the 
impairment does not reflect the underlying performance of the business this has been treated 
as a Company specific adjustment. 

No Company specific adjustments to underlying profits were made in the year ended 
31 December 2022.

As detailed further in the Audit Committee Report on page 104, PwC are the auditors of the 
SEGRO European Logistics Partnership (SELP), which is a non controlled joint venture of the 
Group, and were paid audit fees of £0.9 million in respect of the year ended 31 December 2023 
(2022: £0.8 million). There were £0.2 million of non-audit fees paid in respect of SELP 
(2022: £0.1 million). The appointment of the SELP auditors and agreement of their fees is a 
matter for the SELP Board acting independently from SEGRO. Accordingly, the fees do not 
form part of the SEGRO Group audit fees detailed in the table above nor are they included 
in the ratio of audit to non-audit fees detailed on page 104 of the Audit Committee Report.

The Group has not recognised cumulative losses totalling £14 million at share (2022: £12 million) 
in relation to its interests in associates, because the Group has no obligation in respect of 
these losses.

Fees
SEGRO provides certain services, including venture advisory and asset management, 
to the SELP joint venture and receives fees for doing so. 

There was no other comprehensive income included in the Group Statement of Comprehensive 
Income (2022: £nil).

SELP is a SPPICAV in France, and does not pay tax on its French property income or gains on 
property sales, provided that at least 85 per cent of the French subsidiaries’ property income 
is distributed to their immediate shareholder. In addition, SELP has to meet certain conditions 
such as ensuring the property rental business of each French subsidiary represents more 
than 60 per cent of its assets. Any potential or proposed changes to the SPPICAV legislation 
are monitored.

A 10-year performance fee, denominated in euros, was due from SELP to SEGRO in October 
2023 based on SELP’s internal rate of return (IRR) subject to certain hurdle rates. The IRR 
calculation is based on a 10-year performance period from the inception of SELP in October 
2013 to October 2023. 

The total 10-year performance fee of £115 million (€132 million) has been agreed with SELP. 
The balancing payment of £89 million (€103 million) was received during the year ended 
31 December 2023 (£26 million (€29 million) was paid in 2018). As the fee has now been agreed 
and settled the previous estimation uncertainty on the fee to be received has fallen away. 

7(ii) – Summarised Balance Sheet information in respect of the Group’s joint ventures 
and associates

Up to 31 December 2022, SEGRO had recognised a cumulative fee income for the 10-year 
performance period of £26 million (€29 million).

This means SEGRO has recognised further performance fee income of £89 million 
(€103 million) (being the total fee of £115 million less the cumulative fee recognised to 
31 December 2022 of £26 million) in its 31 December 2023 Income Statement. An equivalent 
performance fee expense at share of £45 million has been recognised within the share of 
profit from joint ventures and associates and shown in Note 7(i).

The total performance fee received be SEGRO over the 10-year period from the inception of 
SELP in October 2013 to October 2023 is £141 million (€161 million). The total fee includes 
£26 million (€29 million) for the 5 year performance fee period recognised and paid in the year 
ended 31 December 2018 and £115 million (€132 million) for the 10-year performance fee period 
as detailed above.

Subsequent performance fee
Under the Venture Advisor Agreement with SELP, future performance fees could be payable to 
SEGRO over a new performance period. The performance fee is based on a similar IRR subject 
to certain hurdle rates to the previous fee. It is too early to reliably estimate the performance 
fees that could be payable to SEGRO, and no fee has been recognised in the year. As at 
31 December 2023 the fee for the subsequent performance period is not considered to 
be a significant area of estimation uncertainty.

7(iii) – Investments by the Group 

1  The external borrowings of the joint ventures and associates are non-recourse to the Group. 

At 31 December 2023, the fair value of £2,143 million (2022: £2,005 million) of borrowings was 
£2,046 million (2022: £1,759 million). This results in a fair value adjustment increase in EPRA NDV 
of £97 million (2022: £246 million), at share £48 million (2022: £123 million), see Table 5 of the 
Supplementary Notes. 

2  Other non-current liabilities of £34 million (2022: £41 million) relates to a loan due from an associate to the 
Group. See Note 17(vi) for details on the impairment of the loan receivable held by the Group in the year.

The total valuation deficit on investment and trading properties are £809 million 
(2022: £2,191 million). This comprises £647 million deficit from investment properties 
(2022: £1,970 million), £nil impairment from trading properties (2022: impairment reversal 
of £15 million) and £162 million deficit from joint ventures and associates at share 
(2022: £236 million).

The total property loss on investment and trading properties are £760 million 
(2022: £2,175 million). This comprises of the total valuation deficit on investment properties 
and trading properties of £809 million (2022: £2,191 million) plus £46 million profit on sale of 
investment properties and other investment income (2022: £9 million) and £3 million profit on 
sale of trading property (2022: £7 million).

1  During 2023, £303 million (2022: £1,211 million) of non-current loans were recapitalised and converted into 

equity. This is reflected within additions and a reduction in loan movement in the table above.

Details of profit on sale of trading properties are given in Note 13(ii).

Included in cost or valuation of subsidiaries at 31 December 2023 are investments of £6,401 
million (2022: £6,126 million) and non-current loans of £5,012 million (2022: £4,471 million). 
Loans held with subsidiaries are classified as non-current as there is no intention from the 
Company to require the loan to be repaid, in whole or in part, within 12 months. 

Subsidiary entities are detailed in Note 26. 

In measuring expected credit losses (ECLs) of the intercompany loans under IFRS 9 the ability 
of each subsidiary to repay the loan at the reporting date if demanded by the Company is 
assessed. For the purpose of the impairment review the manner for recovering the loan is 
assumed to be through the sale of the investment properties held by the subsidiary. 
Investment properties are held at fair value at each reporting date and the assumptions and 
inputs used in determining their fair value are shown in Note 25. Therefore, the net asset value 
of the subsidiary is considered to be a reasonable approximation of the available assets that 
could be realised to recover the loan balance and the requirement to recognise expected 
credit losses. The requirement for impairment of investments under IAS 36 follows the same 
assessment and the net asset value of the subsidiary is considered to be a reasonable 
approximation of the recoverable amount.

Net finance costs (including adjustments) in Adjusted profit (Note 2) are £106 million 
(2022: £74 million). This excludes net fair value gains and losses on interest rate swaps and 
other derivatives of £24 million gain (2022: £199 million loss) and the cost of early close out 
debt of £1 million (2022: £nil).

The interest capitalisation rates for 2023 ranged from 2.6 per cent to 6.5 per cent 
(2022: 1.9 per cent to 4.0 per cent). Interest is capitalised gross of tax relief. Further analysis 
of exchange differences is given in Note 17 within the forward foreign exchange and currency 
swap contracts section.

1  The joint venture and associates’ tax adjustment is required because the loss on ordinary activities before tax 

includes share of loss from joint ventures and associates’ after tax, whereas the total tax balance excludes joint 
ventures and associates.

2  The UK corporation tax rate for the financial year beginning 1 April 2023 increased to 25 per cent (previously 19 

per cent in the financial year beginning 1 April 2022).

10(iii) – REIT and SIIC regimes and other tax judgements
SEGRO is a Real Estate Investment Trust (REIT) and does not pay tax on its UK property income 
or gains on property sales, provided that at least 90 per cent of the Group’s UK property 
income is distributed as a dividend to shareholders, which becomes taxable in their hands. 
In addition, the Group has to meet certain conditions such as ensuring its worldwide property 
rental business represents more than 75 per cent of total profits and assets. Any potential or 
proposed changes to the REIT legislation are monitored and discussed with HMRC. It is 
management’s intention that the Group will continue as a REIT for the foreseeable future.

SEGRO is also a SIIC in France, and does not pay corporation tax on its French property income 
or gains on property sales, provided that at least 95 per cent of the relevant Group French 
subsidiaries’ property income is distributed to their immediate shareholder. In addition, the 
Group has to meet certain conditions such as ensuring the property rental business of each 
French subsidiary represents more than 80 per cent of its assets. Any potential or proposed 
changes to the SIIC legislation are monitored. It is management’s intention that the Group will 
continue as a SIIC for the foreseeable future.

In 2021 a formal tax assessment in relation to the applicability of a 25 per cent withholding tax 
on distributions from the SIIC was received from the French tax authorities and a tax charge 
was recognised. A legal conclusion has not been reached and communication with the French 
tax authorities remains ongoing. As a result, a tax charge for the 25 per cent withholding tax on 
results generated from the French business has been recognised in the current and prior year, 
this includes withholding tax on unremitted earnings. As noted below, until a legal conclusion 
has been reached, it is possible further tax charges may arise in relation to this matter.

The Group operates in a number of jurisdictions and is subject to periodic challenges by 
local tax authorities on a range of tax matters during the normal course of business. The tax 
impact can be uncertain until a conclusion is reached with the relevant tax authority or through 
a legal process. The Group uses in-house expertise when assessing uncertain tax positions 
and seeks the advice of external professional advisors where appropriate. The Group believes 
that its provisions for tax liabilities and associated penalties are adequate for all open tax 
years based on its assessment of many factors, including tax laws and prior experience. 
The significant assessment relating to the recognition of withholding tax in France 
is discussed above.

10(v) – Factors that may affect future tax charges
Other than France no deferred tax is recognised on the unremitted earnings of international 
subsidiaries, joint ventures and associates. In the event of their remittance to the UK, no net UK 
tax is expected to be payable. As detailed in Note 10(iii) a tax charge for probable withholding 
tax due on results generated from the French business has been recognised, this includes 
withholding tax on unremitted earnings.

10(vi) – OECD Pillar Two model rules
Pillar Two legislation was enacted in the UK during 2023, the jurisdiction in which the Company 
is incorporated, and will come into effect from 1 January 2024. Management have engaged tax 
specialists to assist with applying the legislation and assessing the impact. Based on the initial 
assessment of this enacted legislation, management do not believe that the legislation will 
have a material impact on the Company or the Group due to its UK REIT status, which should 
result in the majority of the Group companies being excluded from the rules.

Notwithstanding the legislation is not expected to have a material impact, under the current 
assessment, since the Pillar Two legislation was not effective at the reporting date, the Group 
has no related current tax exposure. The Group applies the exception to recognising and 
disclosing information about deferred tax assets and liabilities related to Pillar Two income 
taxes, as provided in the amendments to IAS 12 issued in May 2023.

The Board recommends a final dividend for 2023 of 19.1 pence which is estimated to result in a 
distribution of up to £234 million. The total dividend paid and proposed per share in respect of 
the year ended 31 December 2023 is 27.8 pence (2022: 26.3 pence). 

The total dividend in 2023 of £327 million (2022: £301 million) was paid: £198 million as cash 
(2022: £222 million) and £129 million in scrip dividends (2022: £79 million). For details on scrip 
dividends see Notes 18 and 19.

The Group has recognised revenue tax losses of £94 million (2022: £99 million) available for 
offset against future profits (reflected in ‘Valuation surpluses and deficits on properties/
accelerated tax allowances’ in the table above). Further unrecognised tax losses of £757 million 
also exist at 31 December 2023 (2022: £748 million) of which £1 million (2022: £4 million) 
expires within nine years. The majority of the unrecognised tax loss balance relates to historic 
capital losses that arose on property disposals and on losses generated from debt close-out 
costs. The Directors do not consider it probable that there will be sufficient future taxable profit 
for the relevant losses to be utilised and so no deferred tax asset has been recognised for 
unused tax losses. 

For the purposes of measuring deferred tax liabilities or deferred tax assets arising from 
investment properties that are measured using the fair value model, the Directors have 
reviewed the Group’s investment property portfolios and concluded that the Group’s 
investment properties are not held under a business model whose objective is to consume 
substantially all of the economic benefits embodied in the investment properties over time, 
rather than through sale. Therefore, in determining the Group’s deferred taxation on investment 
properties, the Directors have determined that the presumption that the carrying amounts of 
investment properties measured using the fair value model are recovered entirely through sale 
is not rebutted. As a result, the Group has recognised deferred taxes on changes in fair value of 
investment properties for all jurisdictions, with the exception of the UK, where the Group is not 
subject to any corporate income taxes on the fair value changes of the investment properties 
on disposal due to its REIT status.

12. Earnings and Net Assets Per Share
The earnings per share calculations use the weighted average number of shares in issue during 
the year and the net assets per share calculations use the number of shares in issue at year 
end. Earnings per share calculations exclude 0.3 million shares (2022: 0.2 million) being the 
average number of shares held on trust for employee share schemes and net assets per share 
calculations exclude 0.4 million shares (2022: 0.2 million) being the actual number of shares 
held on trust for employee share schemes at year end.

Table 5 of the Supplementary Notes provides a reconciliation from IFRS NAV for each of the 
three EPRA net asset value metrics.

1  50 per cent of deferred tax in respect of depreciation and valuation surpluses has been excluded in calculating 

Adjusted NAV in line with option 3 of EPRA Best Practices Recommendations Guidelines.

12(ii) – Net assets per share (NAV)
The EPRA Net Tangible Assets (NTA) metric is considered to be most consistent with the nature 
of SEGRO’s business as a UK REIT providing long-term progressive and sustainable returns. 
EPRA NTA acts as the primary measure of net asset value and is also referred to as Adjusted 
Net Asset Value (or Adjusted NAV).

A reconciliation from IFRS NAV to Adjusted NAV is set out in the table below along with the net 
asset per share metrics.

Investment properties are stated at fair value as at 31 December 2023 based on external 
valuations performed by professionally qualified, independent valuers. The Group’s wholly-
owned, joint venture and associate property portfolio is valued by CBRE Ltd on a half-yearly 
basis. The valuations conform to International Valuation Standards and were arrived at by 
reference to market evidence of the transaction prices paid for similar properties. In estimating 
the fair value of the properties, the valuers consider the highest and best use of the properties. 
There has been no change to the valuation technique during the year.

CBRE Ltd also undertakes some professional and agency work on behalf of the Group. This is 
carried out by departments separate from the Valuation team in CBRE and overall the total fees 
earned from the Group are below 5 per cent of CBRE’s total income. This work does not 
therefore lead to a conflict of interest for the properties being valued by CBRE at the period 
end.

Completed properties include buildings that are occupied or are available for occupation. 
Development properties include land available for development (land bank), land under 
development, construction in progress and covered land. The carrying value of covered 
land held within Development properties as at 31 December 2023 is £645 million (2022: 
£656 million). 

The carrying value of investment properties situated on land held under leaseholds is 
£186 million (excluding head lease ROU assets) (2022: £209 million).

Further details on property valuation techniques, sustainability and climate change 
considerations and related quantitative information are set out in Note 25.

see Note 5.

Trading properties were externally valued, as detailed in Note 13(i), resulting in no provision 
for impairment during the year (2022: decrease of £15 million). Based on the fair value at 
31 December 2023, the portfolio has unrecognised surplus of £1 million (2022: £2 million). 
Further information on valuation techniques and related quantitative information is given 
in Note 25.

1  Group Cash and cash equivalents also include tenant deposits held in separate designated bank accounts of 
£61 million (2022: £50 million), the use of the deposits is subject to restrictions as set out in the tenant lease 
agreement and therefore not available for general use by the Group.

There are no early settlement or call options (greater than three months prior to maturity) 
on any of the borrowings. Financial covenants relating to the borrowings include maximum 
limits to the Group’s gearing ratio and minimum limits to permitted interest cover. Financial 
covenants are discussed in more detail in the ‘Gearing and financial covenants’ section in the 
Financial review on page 48.

Bank loans and overdrafts include capitalised finance costs on committed facilities. 

In January 2023, SEGRO drew down its €195 million and €97.5 million term loan facilities, 
maturing in 2025 and 2027, respectively. 

In April 2023, SEGRO drew down its £300 million and €115 million term loans, both originally 
maturing in 2025. The maturity of these term loans was extended for a further year, to 2026, 
in August 2023.

In May 2023, SEGRO extended the maturity of €200 million of its revolving credit facilities for 
a further year to 2028. 

In June 2023, SEGRO entered into two term loan facilities. The first facility has a commitment 
of £100m, maturing in 2026. The second facility has a commitment of €150m, also maturing 
in 2026. Both term loan facilities were subsequently drawn in November 2023.

1  Represents the carrying value of tenant lease incentives held in Investment properties at the year end. This 

amount is included within the ‘tenant lease incentives and letting fees’ balance in Note 13(i).

2  Group excludes non-financial assets of £90 million (2022: £81 million) included within total other receivables per 

Note 14 and non-financial liabilities of £108 million (2022: £103 million) included within total trade and other 
payables per Note 15.

The carrying values of these financial assets and liabilities approximate their fair value, 
with the exception of unsecured bonds and unsecured US Private Placement notes classified 
as borrowings. At 31 December 2023, the fair value of £2,709 million of unsecured bonds 
issued was £2,480 million (2022: £2,813 million compared with £2,412 million fair value). At 
31 December 2023, the fair value of £1,409 million of unsecured US Private Placement notes 
was £1,281 million (2022: £1,433 million compared with £1,162 million fair value). This results in a 
fair value adjustment increase in EPRA NDV of £357 million (2022: £672 million), see Table 5 of 
the Supplementary Notes. The fair value of unsecured bonds is estimated using quoted prices 
(level 1) and the fair value of US private placement notes is estimated by discounting 
contractual future cash flows (level 2).

The fair values of financial assets and financial liabilities are determined as follows:

 – Forward foreign exchange contracts are measured using quoted exchange rates and yield 
curves derived from quoted interest rates with maturities matching the contracts (level 2).

 – Interest rate swaps, currency swap contracts and interest rate caps are measured at the 

present value of future cash flows estimated and discounted based on the applicable yield 
curves derived from quoted interest rates and the appropriate exchange rate at the Balance 
Sheet date (level 2).

 – The fair value of other investments classified as fair value through profit or loss which are not 

traded on active liquid markets is determined by management (level 3).

Fair value measurements recognised in the Balance Sheet
The Group and Company financial instruments that are measured subsequent to initial 
recognition at fair value are unlisted investments, forward exchange and currency swap 
contracts, interest rate swaps and interest rate caps as detailed above. As defined by IFRS 13, 
unlisted investments are classified as level 3 fair value measurements, where inputs are not 
based on observable market data. All other financial instruments are classified as level 2 fair 
value measurements, being those derived from inputs other than quoted prices (included 
within level 1) that are observable for the asset or liability, either directly (i.e. as prices) or 
indirectly (i.e. derived from prices). There were no transfers between categories in the current 
or prior year.

17(iii) Capital risk management
The Group manages its capital to ensure that entities in the Group will be able to continue 
as a going concern and as such it aims to maintain a prudent mix between debt and equity 
financing. Our intention for the foreseeable future is to maintain our mid-cycle LTV (including 
joint ventures and associates at share) at around 30 per cent. This provides the flexibility to take 
advantage of investment opportunities arising and ensures significant headroom compared to 
our tightest gearing covenants should property values decline. The current capital structure of 
the Group consists of a mix of equity and debt. Equity comprises issued capital, reserves and 
retained earnings as disclosed in the Statement of Changes in Equity and Notes 18 to 19. 
Debt primarily comprises long-term debt issues, term loans and drawings against short-term 
committed revolving credit facilities from banks as disclosed in Note 16.

The Group is not subject to externally imposed capital requirements. 

17(iv) Foreign currency risk management
The Group’s transactional foreign exchange exposures mainly arise as a result of treasury 
financing and hedging activities. These hedging activities are carried out in SEGRO plc on 
behalf of the Group and the resulting transactional exposures to euro are not routinely hedged. 
The Group does not have any significant transactional foreign currency exposures resulting 
from cross-border flows in the operating business. The Group does however have operations 
in Continental Europe which transact business denominated mostly in euros, hence there is 
currency exposure caused by translating the local trading performance and local net assets 
into sterling for each financial period and at each Balance Sheet date. 

The Group’s approach to managing Balance Sheet translation exposure is described in the 
Foreign Currency Translation Risk section in the Financial review on page 49.

2023 Group gross currency liabilities include €2,226 million (£1,926 million) designated as net 
investment hedges.

2022 Group gross currency liabilities include €2,206 million (£1,952 million) designated as net 
investment hedges.

The remaining gross currency liabilities of the Group shown in the table above that are not 
designated as net investment hedges are either held directly in a euro functional currency 
entity or passed down to such an entity from a sterling functional currency company through 
inter-company funding arrangements.

Foreign currency sensitivity analysis
The Group’s main currency exposure is the euro. The sensitivity of the net assets of the 
Group to a 10 per cent appreciation in the value of sterling against the euro would decrease 
net assets by £151 million (2022: £137 million). The sensitivity of the Group to a 10 per cent 
depreciation in the value of sterling against the euro would increase net assets by £184 million 
(2022: £167 million).

The 10 per cent sensitivity rate is used when reporting foreign currency risk internally to 
management and represents management’s assessment of the reasonably possible change in 
foreign exchange rates. The sensitivity analysis adjusts the translation of net assets (after taking 
account of external loans, currency swap contracts and forward foreign exchange contracts) at 
the period end for a 10 per cent change in the value of sterling against the euro. A 10 per cent 
appreciation in the value of sterling against the euro would decrease the Group’s loss for the 
year ended 31 December 2023 by £22 million (2022: £24 million). A 10 per cent depreciation in 
the value of sterling against the euro would increase the Group’s loss for the year ended 
31 December 2023 by £27 million (2022: £30 million).

For the Company, the sensitivity of the net assets to a 10 per cent appreciation in the value of 
sterling against the euro would increase net assets by £175 million (2022: £179 million). The 
sensitivity of the net assets to a 10 per cent depreciation in the value of sterling against the 
euro would decrease net assets by £220 million (2022: £219 million).

Forward foreign exchange and currency swap contracts
Some of the forward foreign exchange and currency swap contracts held by the Group are 
designated as net investment hedges of euro denominated subsidiaries, where exchange 
differences are booked in reserves and recognised in the Income Statement when the 
operation is sold. The remaining foreign exchange and currency swap contracts are effectively 
economic cash flow hedges, for example using surplus cash in one currency to provide 
(typically through intercompany debt funding arrangements with overseas subsidiaries) funds 
to repay debt, or to fund development expenditure or acquisitions in another currency. These 
instruments have not been designated as hedges. As a consequence, exchange movements in 
respect of these instruments are taken through the Income Statement. Offsetting these 
movements are net exchange losses of £7 million (2022: £3 million gain) arising on 
intercompany debt funding arrangements (discussed above) and exchange movements arising 
from external borrowings not designated as hedges. This has resulted in exchange differences 
of £nil (2022: £1 million) within net finance costs in Note 9.

The Group seeks to limit its exposure to volatility in foreign exchange rates by hedging its 
foreign gross assets using either borrowings or derivative instruments. The Group targets a 
hedging range of between the last reported LTV ratio (34 per cent at 31 December 2023) and 
100 per cent. At 31 December 2023, the Group had gross foreign currency assets, which were 
74 per cent hedged by gross foreign currency denominated liabilities (2022: 76 per cent).

Further details are provided within the Foreign Currency Translation Risk section of the 
Financial review on page 49.

Forward foreign exchange contracts
The Group designated euro denominated forward foreign exchange contracts as net 
investment hedges during 2023 (2022: euro denominated).

There was no ineffectiveness to be recorded from net investments in foreign entity hedges in 
2023 and 2022 where the hedging instrument was forward foreign exchange contracts. This is 
because the critical terms of both the net investment in foreign entity and the hedging 
instrument match, and at each Balance Sheet date both are revalued to the closing spot rate. 
Any forward points in the foreign exchange contract are taken to the Income Statement.

The total fair value movements on derivatives and borrowings in effective hedge relationships 
shown in Other Comprehensive Income for the year ended 31 December 2023 is a gain of 
£35 million (2022: £98 million loss) and consists of the gain on Euro forward foreign exchange 
of £9 million (2022: £33 million loss) and gain on US private placement notes of £26 million 
(2022: £65 million loss) shown in the tables above. 

17(v) Interest rate risk management
The Group is exposed to interest rate risk as entities in the Group borrow funds at both fixed 
and floating interest rates. The risk is managed by maintaining an appropriate mix between 
fixed and floating rate borrowings. The current Group policy states that 50 to 100 per cent of 
net borrowings should be at fixed rate provided by long-term debt issues attracting a fixed 
coupon or from floating rate bank borrowings converted into fixed rate or hedged via interest 
rate swaps, forwards, caps, collars or floors or options on these products. Hedging activities 
require approval and are evaluated and reported on regularly to ensure that the policy is being 
adhered to. The Board reviews the policy on interest rate exposure annually with a view to 
establishing that it is still relevant in the prevailing and forecast economic environment.

Interest rate sensitivity analysis
The sensitivity analysis below has been determined based on the exposure to interest rates 
for both derivative and non-derivative instruments at the Balance Sheet date. For floating rate 
liabilities, the analysis is prepared assuming that the amount of liability outstanding at the 
Balance Sheet date was outstanding for the whole year. A two per cent increase or decrease is 
used when reporting interest rate risk internally to key management personnel and represents 
management’s assessment of the reasonable possible change in interest rates.

If interest rates had been two per cent higher and all other variables were held constant, 
the Group’s loss for the year ended 31 December 2023 would increase by £10 million 
(2022: £27 million). If interest rates had been two per cent lower and all other variables were 
held constant, the Group’s loss for the year ended 31 December 2023 would decrease by 
£17 million (2022: £32 million). This is attributable to the Group’s exposure to interest rates on 
its variable rate borrowings and cash deposits. Fixed rate debt issues are held at amortised cost 
and are not re-valued in the Balance Sheet to reflect interest rate movements. 

At 31 December 2023, all of the Group’s interest rate caps have been triggered and therefore 
the Group is more sensitive to a fall in interest rates, as opposed to a rise. 

Interest rate swap contracts
Under interest rate swap contracts, the Group agrees to exchange the difference between 
fixed and floating rate interest amounts calculated on agreed notional principal amounts. Such 
contracts enable the Group to manage the interest rate risk of the Group’s borrowings. The fair 
value of interest rate swaps at the reporting date is determined by discounting the future cash 
flows using the yield curves at the reporting date and the credit risk inherent in the contract, 
and is disclosed below. The average interest rate is based on the outstanding balances at the 
end of the financial year.

The following tables detail the notional principal amounts and remaining terms of interest rate 
swap contracts, based on their contractual maturities (excluding mandatory break clauses), 
outstanding as at the reporting date:

The above are effective economic hedges although the Group has not elected to adopt hedge 
accounting for them, hence their change in fair value is taken direct to the Income Statement.

The interest rate swaps settle on either a three-month or six-month basis with the floating rate 
side based on the EURIBOR or sterling SONIA rate for the relevant period. The Group will settle 
or receive the difference between the fixed and floating interest rate on a net basis.

Such contracts enable the Group to manage the interest rate risk of the Group’s floating rate 
borrowings. The fair value of interest rate caps at the reporting date is determined by 
discounting the future cash flows using the yield curves at the reporting date and the credit 
risk inherent in the contract, and is disclosed below. The average interest rate is based on the 
outstanding balances at the end of the financial year.

The following tables detail the notional principal amounts and remaining terms of interest rate 
cap contracts, based on their contractual maturities, outstanding as at the reporting date:

The above are effective economic hedges although the Group has not elected to adopt hedge 
accounting for them, hence their change in fair value is taken direct to the Income Statement.

The interest rate caps settle on either a three-month or six-month basis based on the EURIBOR 
or sterling SONIA rate for the relevant period. The Group will receive the difference between 
the floating rate and the specified strike rate.

17(vi) Credit risk management 
Credit risk refers to the risk that a counterparty will default on its contractual obligations 
resulting in financial loss to the Group. Potential customers are evaluated for creditworthiness 
and where necessary collateral is secured. There is no concentration of credit risk within the 
lease portfolio to either business sector or individual company as the Group has a diverse 
customer base with no one customer accounting for more than seven per cent of rental 
income. Trade receivables were less than one per cent of total assets at 31 December 2023 
and at 31 December 2022.

Gross trade receivables mainly consists of amounts invoiced for rent, service charge and 
management fees, which form part of Revenue (see Note 4) and are inclusive of VAT. Trade 
receivables at 31 December 2023 includes amounts due for 2023 rent and amounts billed in 
advance for 2024 rent. Both amounts have been considered in measuring expected credit 
losses (ECLs) detailed further below. The amounts billed in advance for 2024 rent are included 
within the ‘Not due’ category in the table above. 

Total gross trade receivables ‘past due’ at 31 December 2023 were £18 million (2022: £15 million), 
three per cent of total gross rental income for the year (2022: three per cent). 

Trade receivables are presented in the balance sheet net of loss allowances. The Group applies 
the IFRS 9 simplified approach to measuring expected credit losses (ECLs) which uses a 
lifetime expected loss allowance for all trade receivables. Expected loss rates are based on the 
historic credit loss experienced and adjusted for current and forward information affecting the 
ability of the individual customers to settle receivables. Trade receivables are written off when 
there is no reasonable expectation of recovery.

In determining the ECLs an analysis of various factors has been performed on a customer 
by customer basis and considers the impact of economic conditions. These factors include 
an assessment of the customer’s default risk based on: industry and geographic location; 
and payment record, which includes how many days past due the receivable is, payment 
concessions granted and credit rating. ECLs are recognised net of securities held for 
the customer.

As at 31 December 2023, the Group held a loss allowance provision for trade receivables 
of £10 million (2022: £9 million) and the impairment risk remains low with the loss allowance 
of £10 million representing two per cent of total gross rental income for the year 
(2022: two per cent).

Total impairment losses on trade receivables of £3 million were recognised in the Income 
Statement for the year ended 31 December 2023 (2022: £3 million). The impairment losses on 
trade receivables include the net impact from loss allowances, receivables written off and 
recoveries of receivables previously written off and are presented within operating profit 
(see Note 5).

The Group holds a gross loan due from an associate of £34 million as at 31 December 2023 
(2022: £41 million). The associate used the proceeds from the loan to acquire land in November 
2022. The Group expects to recover the loan either through the granting of planning 
permission on the land which will trigger the other shareholder to acquire the Group’s share in 
the associate and repay the loan; or, if planning permission is not gained on the land, the Group 
would acquire the other shareholder's share in the associate for nominal consideration and it 
will become wholly owned. In this event the extent of the recovery of the loan would be 
through the fair value of the land. The carrying value of the associate as at 31 December 2023 
is £nil (2022: £nil).

During the second half of 2023 the likelihood of gaining planning permission reduced and the 
market conditions deteriorated sufficiently to conclude that there is a significantly increased 
probability that the Group will take ownership of the associate. For purposes of the impairment 
review of the loan under IFRS 9 the recovery of the loan is now assumed to be based on the fair 
value of the land held by the associate which was £6 million as at 31 December 2023 (at 100 
per cent). This has resulted in the loan being impaired by £28 million down to a carrying value 
of £6 million as at 31 December 2023. 

The loan balance arose as part of a wider property transaction which also included the 
acquisition of an investment property by the Group disclosed within acquisitions in 2022. 
When considered together the overall transaction has had an accretive impact on net assets 
since inception.

As set out in Note 2, the impairment charge has been treated as a Company specific 
adjustment to EPRA earnings to determine Adjusted profit. This is due to the size and that the 
nature of the loan impairment relates to a wider property transaction and changes in the fair 
value of the related land held by an associate. 

The other financial assets and lease incentive balances held by the Group have been 
considered for impairment based on historical default rates over the expected life and are 
adjusted for forward-looking information. Based on that analysis, no material loss allowances 
are held against these assets in the current and prior period.

Investment in financial instruments is restricted to banks and short-term liquidity funds with a 
good credit rating. Derivative financial instruments are transacted via International Swaps and 
Derivatives Association (ISDA) agreements with counterparties with a good investment grade 
credit rating. The Group’s exposure and the credit ratings of its counterparties are continuously 
monitored and the aggregate value of transactions concluded is spread among approved 
counterparties.

17(vii) Liquidity risk management 
Ultimate responsibility for liquidity risk management rests with the Board, which has built an 
appropriate liquidity risk management framework for the management of the Group’s short, 
medium and long-term funding and liquidity management requirements. The Group manages 
liquidity risk by requiring that adequate cash and committed bank facilities are available to 
cover and match all debt maturities, development spend, trade related and corporate cash 
flows over a rolling 18-month period. This is achieved by continuously monitoring forecast and 
actual cash flows and matching the maturity profiles of financial assets and liabilities. Liquidity 
risk management is discussed in more detail in the Financial review on pages 48 and 49.

Share-based payments
The Group operates the share-based payments schemes set out below.

18(i) – Deferred Share Bonus Plan (DSBP)
The DSBP is for Executive Directors and senior managers. A percentage of any payment made 
under the Bonus Scheme is deferred to shares and held in trust for three years. The percentage 
subject to deferral for Executive Directors is 50 per cent of the Bonus payment. This scheme is 
detailed in the Remuneration Report on page 128. If a participant ceases to be employed by the 
Group, the award will lapse unless the participant is deemed to be a ‘good leaver’, in which 
case the award will be released on the vesting date.

The 2022 DSBP grant was made on 28 April 2023, based on a 27 April 2023 closing mid-market 
share price of 810.6 pence.

18(ii) – Long Term Incentive Plan (LTIP) 
The LTIP is a discretionary employee share scheme for Executive Directors and senior 
managers. Vesting of awards is subject to three-year performance conditions and is at the 
discretion of the Remuneration Committee. The performance conditions of the LTIP are 
detailed in the Remuneration Report on page 128.

If a participant ceases to be employed by the Group, the award will lapse, unless the participant 
is deemed to be a ‘good leaver’, in which case the award will be reduced pro-rata on length of 
employment in relation to the award date. For Executive Directors a mandatory two-year 
holding period follows the three-year performance period.

21. Contingent Liabilities
The Group has given performance guarantees to third parties amounting to £54 million 
(2022: £146 million) in respect of development contracts of subsidiary undertakings. It is 
unlikely that these contingencies will crystallise.

The Company has guaranteed loans, bank overdrafts and eurobonds of subsidiary 
undertakings and has indicated its intention to provide the necessary support required by 
its subsidiaries.

Capital redemption reserve
The capital redemption reserve of £114 million arose in 2009 where shares were reclassified, 
cancelled and consolidated in connection with a rights issue.

Own shares held reserve
The own shares held reserve represent the cost of shares in SEGRO plc bought in the open 
market and held by Ocorian Limited and Equiniti Limited, to satisfy various Group share 
schemes.

Other reserves
Other reserves shown on the Group Balance Sheet of £204 million (2022: £227 million) is made 
up of the following reserves:

The merger reserve of £169 million (2022: £169 million) arose in 2009 in connection with the 
acquisition of Brixton plc where the Group acquired 100 per cent of the voting equity of Brixton 
plc in a share for share exchange.

The Group translation, hedging and other reserves of £7 million surplus (2022: £33 million) 
comprises all foreign exchange differences arising from the translation of the Financial 
Statements of foreign operations, as well as from the translation of liabilities that hedge the 
Group’s net investment in foreign denominated subsidiaries.

The Group share-based payment reserve of £28 million (2022: £25 million) reflects the increase 
in equity in connection with share-based payment transactions accounted for under IFRS 2.

20. Commitments
Contractual obligations to purchase, construct, develop, repair, maintain or enhance assets are 
as follows:

GROUP
Properties1

2023 
£m

236

2022 
£m

439

1   As detailed on page 40 of the Strategic Report, the Group (including joint ventures and associates at share) is 

expected to invest in excess of £600 million in development capex during 2024. This amount includes 
committed and uncommitted capex.

In addition, commitments in the Group’s joint ventures and associates at 31 December 2023 
(at share) amounted to £19 million (2022: £81 million). The Group also has a £6 million 
commitment to property related investment funds at 31 December 2023 (2022: £8 million).

The Group and joint ventures are subject to claims and litigation generally and provides 
guarantees, representations and warranties arising in the ordinary course of its business. 
Provision is made when liabilities are considered likely to arise and the expected quantum of 
the exposure is estimatable. The risk in relation to such items are monitored on an ongoing 
basis and provisions amended accordingly. It is not expected that contingent liabilities existing 
at 31 December 2023 will have a material adverse effect on the Group’s financial position.

22. Leases
The Group as a lessor
The investment properties are leased to tenants under operating leases with rentals payable on 
a monthly or quarterly basis. Lease payments for some contracts include inflationary index 
increases, but there are no significant levels of variable lease payments that do not depend on 
an index or a rate. Where considered necessary to reduce credit risk, the Group may obtain 
bank guarantees or tenant deposits for the term of the lease. The Group is exposed to changes 
in the residual value of properties at the end of current lease agreements. The residual value 
risk born by the Group is mitigated by active management of its property portfolio and 
discussed further in the Asset Management update on pages 42 to 43. The Group does not 
hold significant finance leases as a lessor.

Future aggregate minimum rentals receivable under non-cancellable operating leases are:

Not later than one year

Later than one year, not later than two years

Later than two years, not later than three years

Later than three years, not later than four years

Later than four years, not later than five years

1  During the year investment properties with a carrying value of £18 million were sold to SELP (2022: £215 million). 

Total proceeds (and total cash proceeds) received by SEGRO was £18 million (2022: £218 million). The 
transaction resulted in the net assets of the Group increasing by £nil (2022: £3 million). The net cash impact 
on a proportionally consolidated basis was an inflow of £9 million (2022: inflow £109 million) once the 50% 
ownership in SELP is taken into account.

Company
The Company’s financial liabilities and assets arising from financing activities comprise 
Company total borrowings shown in Note 24(iii) of £3,925 million (2022: £3,439 million) and 
the Group derivatives shown in the table above of £12 million (asset) (2022: £2 million liability).

25. Property Valuation Techniques, Sustainability and Climate Change Considerations 
and Related Quantitative Information
All of the Group’s properties are level 3, as defined by IFRS 13, in the fair value hierarchy as at 
31 December 2023 and there were no transfers between levels during the year. Level 3 inputs 
used in valuing the properties are those which are unobservable, as opposed to level 1 (inputs 
from quoted prices) and level 2 (observable inputs either directly, i.e. as prices, or indirectly, i.e. 
derived from prices).

Valuation techniques 
Based on different approaches for different properties, the following valuation techniques can 
be used for the same class of assets:

The yield methodology valuation technique is used when valuing the Group’s assets which 
uses market rental values capitalised with a market capitalisation rate. The resulting valuations 
are cross-checked against the initial yields and the fair market values per square metre derived 
from actual market transactions for similar assets.

For properties under construction and the majority of land held for development, properties 
are valued using a residual method valuation. Under this methodology, the valuer assesses the 
investment value (using the above mentioned methodology for completed buildings). 
Deductions are then made for the total estimated costs to complete, including notional finance 
costs and developer’s profit, to take into account the hypothetical purchaser’s management of 
the remaining development process and their perception of risk with regard to construction 
and the property market (e.g. as regards potential cost overruns and letting risk). Land values 
are cross-checked against the rate per hectare derived from actual market transactions. Other 
land is also valued on this comparative basis. Land values per hectare range from £0.1 million 
– £41.5 million (2022: £0.1 million – £43.3 million) for the UK and £0.1 million – £12.7 million 
(2022: £0.1 million – £16.0 million) for Continental Europe.

Sensitivity analysis
An increase/decrease to ERV will increase/decrease valuations, while an increase/decrease to 
yield will decrease/increase valuations. Sensitivity analysis showing the impact on valuations of 
changes in yields and ERV on the property portfolio (including joint ventures and associates at 
share) and the impact on valuations of changes in development costs on the development 
property and land portfolio (including joint ventures and associates at share) is shown below. 

On the basis inflation has fallen during the latter half of 2023 and the expectation interest rates 
may have peaked, management expect market conditions to be less volatile and consider a 
+/- 25bp change in yield, a +/- 5% change in ERV and a +/- 10% change in development costs 
to be reasonably possible changes to the assumptions.

Sustainability valuation considerations
The Group’s valuers, CBRE, note in their valuation report that the impact of sustainability factors 
on valuations have been considered. In a valuation context, ‘sustainability’ encompasses a 
wide range of physical, social, environmental, and economic factors that can affect value of an 
asset, even if not explicitly recognised. The valuers consider the following areas to have the 
most potential to impact on the value of an asset: Energy Performance; Green Certification; 
Sources of Fuel and Renewable Energy Sources and Physical Risk/Climate Risk. The valuers 
have considered in particular the EPC ratings and have discussed with management the 
appropriate capital expenditure which will be required to obtain the necessary EPC rating to 
attract and maintain the tenants required in the future. The valuers are also aware of the impact 
of flood risk and have noted the impact this has had on potential purchasers.

Climate risk legislation
The UK Government and the EU is currently producing legislation on the transition to net zero. 
The UK Government is currently producing legislation which enforces the transition to net zero 
by 2050, and the stated 78 per cent reduction of greenhouse gases by 2035. This is 
understood to include an update to the Minimum Energy Efficiency Standards, stated to 
increase the minimum requirements for non-domestic properties from an E to a B in 2030. The 
UK Government also intends to introduce an operational rating. It is not yet clear how this will 
be legislated, but fossil fuels used in building, such as natural gas for heating, are incompatible 
with the UK’s commitment to be Net Zero Carbon by 2050. This upcoming legislation could 
have a potential impact to future asset value.

The introduction of mandatory climate-related disclosures in the UK and EU (including ‘Task 
Force on climate-related Financial Disclosures’ (TCFD) in the UK and ‘Sustainable Finance 
Disclosure Regulations’ (SFDR) and ‘Corporate Sustainability Reporting Directive’ (CSRD) in the 
EU), including the assessment of physical and transition climate risks, may potentially have an 
impact on how the market views such risks and incorporates them into the sale and letting of 
assets.

Sustainability and climate risk legislation has an impact on the value of an asset, even if not 
explicitly recognised. Valuers reflect markets, they do not lead them. Where the valuers 
recognise the value impacts of sustainability and legislation, they are reflecting their 
understanding of how market participants include sustainability and legislation requirements 
in their bids and the impact on market valuations.

There are inter-relationships between all these inputs as they are determined by market 
conditions. The existence of an increase in more than one input would be to magnify the 
impact on the valuation. The impact on the valuation will be mitigated by the inter-relationship 
of two inputs in opposite directions, for example, an increase in rent may be offset by an 
increase in yield. The yield sensitivity is based on the equivalent yield which closely aligns with 
the net true equivalent yield inputs shown in the table below. The table below includes the 
Group’s wholly-owned and joint venture and associate assets at share in order to include the 
entire portfolio. The equivalent analysis for the range of inputs on a wholly-owned basis would 
not be significantly different.

The portfolio valuation deficit of 4.0 per cent shown on page 36 of the Strategic Report cannot 
be directly derived from the Financial Statements and is calculated to be comparable with 
published MSCI Real Estate indices against which SEGRO is measured. Based on the Financial 
Statements there is a valuation deficit of £809 million (see Note 8) and property value of 
£17,762 million (see Note 25) giving a valuation deficit of 4.4 per cent. The primary differences 
are that the portfolio valuation deficit shown on page 36 of £749 million excludes the impact of 
rent free incentives (£10 million, 0.1 per cent), capitalised interest (£68 million, 0.4 per cent) and 
other movements (-£18 million, -0.1 per cent ).

Total assets under management of £20,677 million (2022: £20,947 million) includes Group total 
properties of £14,847 million (2022: £14,903 million) (see Note 25) and 100 per cent of total 
properties owned by joint ventures and associates of £5,830 million (2022: £6,044 million) (see 
Note 7(ii)).

1  Total tax credit in respect of adjustments per Note 2 of £20 million (2022: £48 million) comprises tax credit on 

profits on disposals of £1 million (2022: £15 million charge), deferred tax credit of £29 million (2022: £63 million) 
and tax charge on joint venture performance fee income of £10 million (2022: £nil). The tax charge on joint 
venture performance fee income is recognised within the Company specific adjustments in the table above.
2  See Note 2 for further details on the Company specific adjustments to exclude the net impact of joint venture  

performance fees and impairment of loan from associate from Adjusted earnings.

3  Adjustments to the share of loss from joint ventures and associates after tax above of £121 million (2022: £215 
million) includes the impact of the performance fee expense of £45 million (2022: £nil) and an associated tax 
credit of £8 million (2022: £nil) which are shown as a Company specific adjustment in the table above within 
'Joint venture performance fee income (net after tax)'. The Adjustments to share of loss from joint ventures and 
associates per Note 7(i) of £158 million (2022: £215 million) excludes the impact of the performance fee.

Table 5: EPRA Net asset measures
The European Public Real Estate Association (‘EPRA’) best practice recommendations (BPR) for 
financial disclosures by public real estate companies sets out three net asset value measures: 
EPRA net tangible assets (NTA), EPRA net reinstatement value (NRV) and EPRA net disposal 
value (NDV).

The EPRA Net Tangible Assets (NTA) metric is considered to be most consistent with the nature 
of SEGRO’s business as a UK REIT providing long-term progressive and sustainable returns. 
EPRA NTA acts as the primary measure of net asset value and is also referred to as Adjusted Net 
Asset Value (or Adjusted NAV).

A reconciliation of the three EPRA NAV metrics from IFRS NAV is shown in the table below.

million) (see Note 5 for further detail on the nature of costs capitalised).

2  Total deduction of £36 million (2022: £37 million) from costs includes: joint venture management fees income of 

£29 million (2022: £30 million) and management fees and other costs recovered through rents but not 
separately invoiced, including joint ventures and associates, of £7 million (2022: £7 million). These items have 
been represented as an offset against costs rather than a component of income in accordance with EPRA BPR 
Guidelines as they are reimbursing the Group for costs incurred. Gross rental income of £547 million (2022: 
£488 million) does not include joint venture management fees income of £29 million (2022: £30 million) and 
management fees income of £4 million (2022: £4 million). These fees are not required to be included in the total 
deduction to income of £3 million (2022: £3 million).

million, excludes share of assets acquired by SELP from SEGRO of £9 million, (see Note 23). 

1  Like-for-like change by Business Unit: Greater London 7.3%, Thames Valley 3.5%, National Logistics 0.3%, 

Total disposals completed in 2023 of £356 million shown on page 39 of the Strategic Report 
includes: Carrying value of investment properties disposed by SEGRO Group of £287 million 
(see Note 13) and profit generated on disposal of £39 million (see Note 8); proceeds from the 
sale of trading properties by SEGRO Group of £35 million (see Note 4); carrying value of lease 
incentives and letting fees disposed by SEGRO Group and joint ventures and associates (at 
share) of £4 million; and excludes 50 per cent of the disposal proceeds for assets sold by 
SEGRO to SELP JV of £9 million (see Note 23).

Northern Europe 11.3%, Southern Europe 7.3%, Central Europe 7.5%.

2  Other includes the corporate centre and other costs relating to the operational business which are not 

specifically allocated to a geographical Business Unit. 

3  Percentage change has been calculated using numbers accurate to one decimal place.
4  The like-for-like net rental growth metric is based on properties held throughout both 2023 and 2022 on a 

proportionally consolidated basis. The value of these properties as at 31 December 2023 on a proportional basis 
was £13,149 million (2022: £13,916 million). This provides details of net rental income growth excluding the 
distortive impact of acquisitions, disposals and development completions. Where an asset has been sold into a 
joint venture (sales to SELP, for example) the 50 per cent share owned throughout the period is included in like-
for-like calculation, with the balance shown as disposals.

2  Net solar income is calculated as Solar energy income shown in Note 4, less Solar energy shown in Note 5.
3  The composition of gross and net rental income changed in 2022 to provide a better measure of the underlying 
rental income from the property portfolio. Management and development fee income; service charge income 
and expense; and solar energy income and expense are now presented outside of gross and net rental income. 
There was no impact on Adjusted operating profit before interest and tax from this change and the prior year 
comparatives in the table above have been represented to reflect this change. 

4  As set out in Note 2, SELP performance fees are now recognised outside of Adjusted profit, the 2021 

comparative has been represented to reflect this change.

Shareholder information

Shareholder enquiries
Our Registrar, Equiniti Limited (Equiniti), provides a range of services to our shareholders. If you 
have any questions about your shareholding or if you require further guidance (e.g. to notify a 
change of address) please contact our Registrar on the details below or register for a free 
Shareview portfolio at www.shareview.co.uk or by scanning the QR code provided.

Withholding tax – PIDs
SEGRO is required to withhold tax at source from its PIDs at the basic tax rate (20 per cent). UK 
shareholders need take no immediate action (unless they qualify for exemption as described 
below) and will receive with each dividend payment a tax deduction certificate stating the 
amount of tax deducted.

Equiniti Limited, Aspect House, Spencer Road, Lancing, West Sussex, BN99 6DA.
Telephone: +44 (0) 371 3842 186

Electronic communications
Shareholders have the opportunity to elect to receive shareholder communications 
electronically, e.g. Annual Reports, Notice of the Annual General Meeting and Proxy Forms. 
You can elect to receive email notifications of shareholder communications by registering for a 
Shareview portfolio as detailed above, where you can also submit proxy votes for shareholder 
meetings and update your bank details for dividend payments. Receiving the Company’s 
communications electronically allows the Company to communicate with its shareholders 
in a more environmentally friendly, cost effective and timely manner.

AGM 
The 2024 AGM will be held at 11.00 a.m. on 18 April 2024 at RSA House, 8 John Adam Street, 
London WC2N 6EZ.

UK shareholders who fall into one of the classes of shareholder able to claim an exemption 
from withholding tax may be able to receive a gross PID payment if they have submitted a valid 
relevant Exemption Declaration form, either as a beneficial owner of the shares, or as an 
intermediary if the shares are not registered in the name of the beneficial owner, to Equiniti. The 
Exemption Declaration form is available at www.SEGRO.com under Investors/Shareholder 
Information/REIT. A valid declaration form, once submitted, will continue to apply to future 
payments of PIDs until rescinded, and so it is a shareholder’s responsibility to notify SEGRO if 
their circumstances change and they are no longer able to claim an exemption from 
withholding tax.

Shareholders resident outside the UK may be able to claim a full or partial refund of 
withholding tax (either as an individual or as a company) from HMRC, subject to the terms of a 
double tax treaty, if any, between the UK and the country in which the shareholder is resident.

Ordinary dividends
Ordinary, non-PID dividends will be treated in exactly the same way by shareholders as ordinary 
dividends paid before the Company became a REIT. From 6 April 2016 the notional 10 per cent 
tax credit has been abolished and replaced with a tax-free dividend allowance, which will apply 
to the ordinary, non-PID dividends received by UK resident shareholders who are subject to UK 
income tax. This allowance does not apply to the PID element of dividends. Further information 
is available from HMRC at https://www.gov.uk/tax-on-dividends.

Please check our 2024 Notice of Meeting for the most up to date information. Shareholders are 
also advised to check our website at www.SEGRO.com, which will be updated if there are any 
changes to the arrangements.

Chequeless dividends from January 2021
Since January 2021, SEGRO has withdrawn the option for shareholders to receive payments by 
cheque. For more information on how to receive dividends directly into your bank or building 
society account, please visit www.SEGRO.com/investors/shareholder-information/shareholder-faq.

ShareGift
ShareGift is a charity (registered under the name The Orr Mackintosh Foundation, registered 
charity number 1052686) which specialises in accepting donations of small numbers of shares 
which are uneconomic to sell on their own. Shares which have been donated to ShareGift are 
aggregated and sold when practicable, with the proceeds passed on to a wide range of UK 
charities. ShareGift can also help with larger donations of shares. Further details about 
ShareGift can be obtained from its website at www.sharegift.org or by writing to ShareGift 
at ShareGift, PO Box 72253, London, SW1P 9LQ, email: help@sharegift.org, telephone: 
+44 (0)207 930 3737.

Dividends 
A requirement of the REIT regime is that a REIT must distribute to shareholders by way of 
dividend at least 90 per cent of its profits from its tax-exempt UK property rental business 
(calculated under UK tax principles after the deduction of interest and capital allowances and 
excluding chargeable gains). Such distributions are referred to as Property Income 
Distributions, or PIDs. Any further distributions may be paid as ordinary dividends, which are 
derived from profits earned by its UK, non-REIT taxable business, as well as its overseas 
operations (including the SIIC in France and SOCIMI in Spain).

Scrip Dividend 
Shareholders approved the re-introduction of a scrip dividend option (Scrip) in respect of cash 
dividends (including those treated as Property Income Distributions) at the 2021 AGM. This 
authority will expire at the 2024 AGM.

The Board has decided to recommend the renewal of the Directors’ authority to offer a Scrip 
which, if approved by shareholders at the forthcoming AGM, will allow shareholders who elect 
to receive the Scrip to take the final dividend in shares rather than in cash. If shareholders 
approve the re-introduction of the Scrip, it will run from three years ending on the earlier of 
18 April 2027 and the beginning of the third AGM of the Company following the date of the 
2024 AGM. 

Details of the proposed Scrip, together with information on how shareholders can elect to 
receive it subject to shareholder approval, will be provided in the Notice of Meeting and full 
terms and conditions of the Scrip will be set out in the Scrip Dividend Scheme Booklet, which 
will be available on the Company’s website www.SEGRO.com.

divided by the property valuation plus notional purchasers’ costs. This is in accordance with 
EPRA’s Best Practices Recommendations.

Net rental income: Gross rental income less ground rents paid, net service charge expenses 
and property operating expenses.
