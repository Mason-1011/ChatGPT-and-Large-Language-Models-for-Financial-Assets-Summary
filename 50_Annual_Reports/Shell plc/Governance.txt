Strategic Report | Principal decisions and stakeholders
Section 172(1) statement continued

Investing in new business, acquisitions and divestments, and closures 

What was the outcome
Agreed sale of SPDC 
The Board approved the implementation of the strategic intent to 
exit onshore Nigerian oil exposure by agreeing to the divestment 
of Shell Petroleum Company Limited's 100% equity interest in 
SPDC to Renaissance, a consortium of five companies comprising 
four exploration and production companies based in Nigeria and 
an international energy group. During Board discussions, the 
impact for staff was considered and it was noted that SPDC's 
staff will continue to be employed by the company as it transitions 
to new ownership. Board discussions also covered how the 
divestment aligned with Group strategy, the value of the 
divestment, and impact for a number of stakeholders including 
shareholders. Furthermore, the Board considered how the 
divestment would contribute to reducing Shell's Scope 1 and 2 
emissions and recognised the importance of this step in achieving 
no routine flaring, a commitment made at the CMD23. 

Investment in deep-water Sparta Project
The Board approved the development of Sparta, a deep-water 
development in the US Gulf of Mexico, owned by Shell Offshore 
Inc. (51% operator) and Equinor (49%) The Board considered the 
investment in the deep-water project would support sustained 
liquids production, capital returns and free cash flow delivery 
through to 2030 at low GHG intensity. Additionally, the Board 
reviewed the assessment that the development opportunity 
aligned with CMD23 commitments, alongside consideration for 
the project-specific stakeholders and Shell's wider stakeholders. 

Over the course of the year, the Board considered and approved new opportunities and 
projects and proposed divestments or closures. The Board continued to review Shell's 
withdrawal from Russian activities.

How stakeholders were considered
The Board considered the impact of decisions related to new business opportunities and 
divesting from existing opportunities in the context of sustainability, supply, regulations 
and carbon intensity. Critically, the Board reviewed the various proposals' alignment with 
Shell's strategy. Particular focus was given to potential benefits of certain divestments, 
including their potential to: create returns for shareholders; further strengthen the balance 
sheet; de-risk future cash flow; and avoid significant additional capital investment. As part 
of the discussions, the Board considered the strategic drivers for the intended divestments, 
including the Scope 1 and 2 emissions of each asset, anticipated regulatory changes 
expected to lead to value erosion, and any value opportunities afforded by the 
macro environment. 

As part of each proposal, the respective business unit will undertake effective due 
diligence on prospective purchasers from a financial, reputational, as well as operating 
philosophy standpoint to ensure future obligations are met, or suitable mitigating 
measures are in place, to protect Shell and its people.

Within each divestment proposal, the Board considered if the Company was being a 
responsible seller of its assets and if the purchasers have the capability to manage our 
assets/people appropriately. Staff matters are explicitly considered during negotiations 
and the due diligence process for acquisitions and divestments. Comprehensive 
engagement plans are developed as appropriate in parallel to the negotiations.

As part of Shell's intercompany approval process, the following investments/
divestments were discussed and supported by the Board.

Agreed sale of The Shell Petroleum Development Company of Nigeria 
Limited (SPDC)
The sale of the 100% equity interest in SPDC to Renaissance Africa Energy Company 
Limited (Renaissance). Completion of the transaction is subject to approvals by the 
Federal Government of Nigeria and other conditions. 

Investment in deep-water Sparta project in the Gulf of Mexico
Development of Sparta, a development opportunity, with Equinor Gulf of Mexico 
LLC (Equinor).

Prior to joining Shell, Sir Andrew Mackenzie was CEO of BHP from 2013 to 2019 after joining BHP

From 2004 to 2007 at Rio Tinto, Sir Andrew was Head of Industrial Minerals, then Head of Industrial 
Minerals and Diamonds. Prior to this, Sir Andrew spent 22 years with BP, joining in 1982 in research

Chief Reservoir Engineer and Chief Technology Officer. Sir Andrew was also Vice President for 
Chemicals in the Americas, then Olefins and Polymers globally.

From 2005 to 2013, Sir Andrew served as a Non-executive Director of Centrica. He has also served

Relevant skills and experience
Sir Andrew has led international FTSE 100 businesses, and has more than 30 years' experience 
in the mining and energy industries. Following early academic distinction, Sir Andrew made 
important contributions to geochemistry, including groundbreaking methods for oil exploration 
and recovery. He was recognised as "one of the world's most influential earth scientists" and 
made a Fellow of the Royal Society in 2014.

Sir Andrew has applied his deep understanding of the energy business and geopolitical outlook to 
create public-private partnerships and advise governments around the world. He has consistently 
pursued sustainable action on climate change in the interests of access to affordable energy and 
global development. His expertise is helping Shell navigate the energy transition. Sir Andrew also 
champions gender balance, the rights of Indigenous Peoples, and the power of large companies 
to make a positive contribution to society – all of which align closely with Shell's purpose, strategy 
and values.

Shell Annual Report and Accounts 2023

Introduction
from the Chair

In 1834, Marcus Samuel Sr began importing seashells 
to the UK, laying foundations for a global import-export 
business. By the 1880s, the energy industry offered 
great opportunities. The "Shell" Transport and Trading 
Company seized these opportunities, with Marcus 
Samuel Jr commissioning the construction of safer and 
more efficient steam tankers for oil transportation. His 
tankers were the first permitted to navigate the Suez 
Canal in 1892, opening global oil markets to greater 
competition. Joining forces with the Royal Dutch 
Petroleum Company in 1907, what is now Shell, one of 
the world's leading energy companies, was established.

Since those early beginnings, Shell has pioneered ways of providing 
energy to people. In addition, the use of the oil and gas has 
revolutionised other industries, from fertilisers to preservatives, textiles 
to beauty products, and medical supplies to road materials. Now, Shell 
is at another turning point in its history. We are working to profitably 
transform our portfolio to meet our target of becoming a net-zero 
emissions energy business by 2050. 

Shell has a vision and a strategy to transform, and the implementation 
of this strategy, although under way, will take time. This transformation 
is not just about the use of oil and gas, but goes to the root of how 
people live -- the products we use and the foods that we eat. This 
journey of transformation is also not the same for everyone, there are 
still many in the world without access to affordable energy. The energy 
transition must be balanced and consider all parts of society.

At our 2024 Annual General Meeting (AGM), Shell's updated energy 
transition strategy will be put to shareholders for an advisory vote. This 
vote will indicate if our shareholders believe we are on the right track 
and that Shell is transforming fast enough.

The Board engaged in discussions with the Executive Committee 
throughout 2023 and into 2024 as the Shell energy transition strategy 
was reviewed, refined and aligned with the commitments made to 
stakeholders at Capital Markets Day in June 2023. Specific time was 
allocated to the topic at the Board's annual strategy days in June, and 
the Board discussed the energy transition at each of its Board meetings 
throughout 2023. In addition, when considering the appointments 
for new Non-executive directors, each appointment was considered 
alongside Shell's Principles for the Strategic Composition of the Board, 
which includes, amongst other criteria, specific consideration of the 
skills and strengths needed for the energy transition.

Board leadership and Shell's purpose
Shell's purpose is set out in the early pages of this Annual Report. 
Throughout this Governance report we focus on how Shell's 
governance operates in practice, and why we believe this is the 
best approach for us. 

The Governance report is structured around the key themes of the 
UK Corporate Governance Code. Our narrative seeks to explain 
how governance supports and protects Shell and our stakeholders. 

Shell applies the principles and the spirit of the Code. There is one 
instance where we adopt an approach slightly different from that 
suggested by one of the Code's provisions, namely Provision 5 which 
concerns workforce engagement. We explain this on page 159. We 
consider our governance processes are appropriate, given the specific 
circumstances and range of factors particular to Shell, such as its global 
nature, size, complexity and history. 

Our AGM continues to reach a wider audience through its hybrid 
format, allowing our global shareholder base to easily participate in 
proceedings. However, disruptive and unsafe behaviour from some 
attendees requires us to assess how we conduct this meeting in a way 
that provides a safe environment and meaningful engagement with 
those in attendance.

Information on how the Board discharges its duty in relation to key 
stakeholder interests, including those of our workforce, and an 
explanation of how it considered these when making principal 
decisions are set out on pages 141-145. On pages 162-165 we provide 
information about our Board activities and highlight which stakeholders 
we considered.

Our workforce engagement methods can be found on pages 170-171. 
We continue to believe that constructive relationships built on mutual 
respect and transparency help Shell attract and retain employees, 
while supporting greater productivity and operational safety and 
efficiency. Ensuring that the employee voice is heard on relevant 
matters in the boardroom in practical ways is key to understanding 
the broader impact of business decisions, including with respect to 
organisational culture. 

The Board recognises the importance of culture in delivering Shell's 
purpose and strategy. In December 2023 and January 2024, the 
Board received updates on the annual employee survey and the 
conduct and culture within the organisation, along with the associated 
risk areas (see pages 25-27 for more information on this risk), and how 
the management team is seeking to evolve the Shell culture, placing 
people at the heart of transforming Shell's performance. Shell's culture 
reflects the long-held values of the organisation – honesty, integrity 
and respect for people. These underpin all the work we do and are 
embedded in our strategy and purpose. The Board will continue to 
increase its focus on Shell's culture to make sure it continues to align 
with the business strategy.

Introduction from the Chair continued

Division of responsibilities
More information on how the Board and its Committees support 
business operations is provided on pages 160-161. In 2023, in line with 
the outcome of the 2022 Board evaluation, the Terms of Reference for 
the Board committees were reviewed and updated. Further detail on 
this is contained on page 166 and the full Terms of Reference for each 
committee, and the Matters Reserved for the Board are provided 
on our website. 

Composition, succession and evaluation
In 2023, the following changes to the Board were implemented: 

The appointment of Wael Sawan as CEO was effective January 1, 2023.

Cyrus Taraporevala joined the Board as a Non-executive Director 
of the Company, effective March 2, 2023, and Sir Charles Roxburgh 
and Leena Srivastava were appointed as Non-executive Directors 
of the Company, with effect from March 13, 2023.

Euleen Goh stood down from her role as Deputy Chair and Senior 
Independent Director at the 2023 AGM after nearly nine years' 
service. Following the departure of Euleen, Dick Boer became Deputy 
Chair and Senior Independent Director with effect from the conclusion 
of the 2023 AGM.

Martina Hund-Mejean stood down from her role as Non-executive 
Director from the conclusion of the 2023 AGM. 

Changes were made to the membership of our Board 
committees. These changes are reflected in the biographies
of the respective Directors. 

Audit, Risk management and Internal control
Throughout the year the Audit and Risk Committee (ARC) assisted 
the Board to implement sound systems of risk management and 
internal control, oversight over Shell's financial reporting and 
consideration of ethics and compliance matters. A variety 
of standing matters and more specific topics are discussed
by the ARC throughout the year, more on this can be found
on pages 179-190.

Looking ahead
Shell is an evolving business and the vote on our energy transition 
strategy at the 2024 AGM, our performance against the commitments 
from Capital Markets Day 2023, and our acquisitions and divestments 
or investment in new business operations are some of the more visible 
steps that we have taken. Less visible steps, like internal organisational 
changes or policy change are also being implemented. 

158

We are cognisant, yet accept, that not all of our stakeholders will be 
fully supportive of the decisions that we take, and some stakeholders 
will choose different methods of communicating their views and their 
concerns. We will continue to engage with stakeholders, and we will 
continue to have the humility to listen, learn and adapt as we focus 
and frame our strategy on the long-term success of the Company. 

Like Marcus Samuel Jr did close to 150 years ago, I, and my fellow 
Directors on the Board, and our colleagues across the business, are 
working to transform Shell to meet the needs of society today and 
for the future while delivering strong financial returns. Your Board 
remain confident that Shell is up to the task ahead.

Shell Annual Report and Accounts 2023Governance
Statement of compliance with the UK
Corporate Governance Code

The Board confirms that, throughout the year, the Company has 
applied the principles, both in spirit and in form, and complied with the 
provisions set out in the UK Corporate Governance Code issued by the 
Financial Reporting Council (FRC) in July 2018 (the "Code"), with the 
exception of Provision 5 noted below. A copy of the Code can be 
found on the FRC's website: frc.org.uk. 

Shell's governance arrangements have been considered alongside 
the Code. The information set out in the Directors' Report, including 
the Board committee reports on (pages 172-210), is intended to 
provide an explanation of how the Code's principles were applied 
practically throughout the year. We also provide clear and meaningful 
explanation below where we believe stakeholders may benefit from 
more specific information on a particular Code provision.

Workforce engagement (Provision 5)
The size and diversity of our employee base and wider workforce have 
complicated the feasibility of implementing any of the three specific 
workforce engagement methods recommended in the Code. The Board 
believes that its current approach to workforce engagement continues 
to be pragmatic and effective, particularly when considered against 
the required coverage needed for a global organisation, such as 
Shell. Elsewhere in this Annual Report, we explain how our people are 
essential to the successful delivery of the Shell strategy, and how the 
Board recognises the importance of understanding their views through 
engagement. During the year, the Board, committees and individual 
Directors were able to visit our sites across the world, which helped 
the Board engage with parts of the workforce and gain insight into 
the work, culture and impact of Shell in communities. While some 
engagements could be held physically, others were held virtually, and 
there were opportunities for the Board to speak with our stakeholders 
and obtain feedback. The Board also intends to keep the effectiveness 
of the engagements under review. Stakeholder engagement also 
continues to be enhanced in management reporting.

More information on the current approach and a description of the channels used by 

the Board, its Committees, and the Executive Committee are outlined in "Workforce 

engagement" on pages 170-171. 

AGM voting (Provision 4)
At the 2023 AGM, 20% of shareholders supported a resolution which 
the Board had recommended voting against. Shareholders also voted 
20% against a resolution proposed by the Board. Both resolutions 
related to the approach Shell was taking with regard to its energy 
transition strategy. Provision 4 of the Code requires certain actions to 
be undertaken if 20% or more of shareholders vote in a way which is 
different to what the Board recommended. There are three stages to 
these actions. First, explain when announcing the voting results what 
actions the Company intends to take to consult shareholders to 
understand the reasons behind the voting result. Shell included this 
explanation with its voting results, published on May 23, 2023. 
Second, an update on the engagement with shareholders should 
be published no later than six months after the shareholder meeting. 
This statement was added to the Shell website on October 30, 2023. 
Third, a final summary of the engagement and the actions taken should 
be included within the Annual Report. This information is provided 
on page 167.

Corporate governance requirements outside the UK
In addition to complying with applicable corporate governance 
requirements in the UK, the Company complies with the rules of 
Euronext Amsterdam and Dutch securities laws because of its listing 
on that exchange. The Company, likewise, adheres to US securities 
laws and the New York Stock Exchange (NYSE) rules and regulations 
because its securities are registered in the USA and listed on the NYSE.

to support the Board in its oversight of the Group's operations and 
management. Standing agenda items include reports from the CEO, 
the CFO and the Chair of each Board committee. Other updates

shareholder distributions and the associated announcements, and, 
at most meetings, considers investment, divestment and/or financing 
proposals. It also conducts post-investment reviews and performance 
tracking, as and when required. Additionally, the Board reviews 
the Group's annual operating plan, including activities undertaken 
designed to meet the Group's carbon reduction targets. To enable 
purposeful debates and focus on particular aspects of agenda 
topics, including the impact on key stakeholders, Directors have 
an opportunity to specify information they require to be provided 
in advance of Board meetings.

During the year, where possible, certain Non-executive Directors 
conduct site visits. The visits are designed to provide them with a 
deeper insight into certain business operations.

More detail on these can be found in the table below and on pages 162-165.

Some of the activities and areas of Board focus over the year are 
summarised in the table below. The information below is not 
exhaustive. Information on other topics discussed by the Board and 
details of the resulting decisions are covered elsewhere, primarily in 
the Section 172 statement provided earlier in this report on pages 
141-145. In some cases, a brief outline has been provided below, 
and page references are provided for additional and more 
comprehensive information.

Board Strategy Days
The Board held its Strategy Days during June 2023. These were held in 
person in Canada over three days. The programme for the event aimed 
at having engaging and interactive sessions with both internal and 
external stakeholders. These included employees, customers, suppliers, 
regional country chairs and other key stakeholders.

The event focused on Shell's energy transition strategy in Canada. 
The Board and EC members conducted a deep dive on the strategic 
elements that would inform Shell's Energy Transition Strategy 2024 
(ETS24). Around this theme, the event provided for the following 
key discussion and engagement opportunities:

Director induction and training
After being appointed to the Board, Directors receive a comprehensive induction tailored to their individual needs. This normally includes site visits and meetings 
with Senior Management to enable them to build up a detailed understanding of Shell's business and strategy, and the key risks and issues that Shell faces. 
Existing Directors are also able to join these visits to keep abreast of business developments and progress. In 2023, we continued with a hybrid format, making 
the best use of the Directors' time through digital and physical engagements. Onboarding will continue to be phased and prioritised based on forthcoming 
Board agenda items to ensure new Non-executive Directors hit the ground running. 

A digital onboarding book is provided to each new Non-executive Director. These onboarding books complement the existing digital Directors' Handbook 
and feature: 
￮ Overviews of scheduled briefing meetings customised to the Non-executive Directors' needs and linked to upcoming Board agenda items;
￮ Hyperlinks to key Shell publications (external and internal);
￮
￮ Key current materials on:

Lists of common Shell acronyms;

– Shell's safety and core values; 
– Board governance;
– Group strategy and portfolio; 
– Key businesses and functions; and
– Climate change and energy transition.

￮ Biographies of key executives;
￮ Other elements of the onboarding programme for Non-executive Directors include:

– Briefing meetings with key executives (both business and functional) customised to Non-executive Directors' needs and phased based on forthcoming 

Board agenda items;

– Pairing up new Non-executive Directors in onboarding briefings to optimise learning while also providing opportunities for collegial relationship-building 

and increasing efficiencies for the executives; and

– Virtual and physical site visits (either specifically for onboarding or by inviting the new Directors to committees' site visits).

Board evaluation

The 2023 Board evaluation was facilitated internally, led by 
the NOMCO and managed by the Company Secretary.

NOMCO reviewed 
questionnaires for in-house 
Board and committee
performance evaluation.

Questionnaires made
available for Directors and 
Executive Committee (EC) 
members to complete via
a secure digital platform.

[A] Separate reports were provided for the responses from the Board and the Executive 
Committee. The reports in relation to the ARC, NOMCO, SUSCO and REMCO were 
sent to the respective committee chairs.

Board review process
For 2023, it was recommended that the NOMCO conduct an 
internally facilitated questionnaire-based Board and committee 
evaluation. This was because of several Board effectiveness initiatives 
under way and an in-depth Board dynamics exercise, to be conducted 
in 2024.

Board members responded to questionnaires shared at the end of 
2023, with the results being discussed at the January 2024 Board and 
committee meetings. Separate questionnaires were produced for the 
evaluation of the Chair, and the Board committees. In addition, the 
Chair held separate one-to-one discussions with each of the Directors 
to assess their individual performance during the year. To broaden the 
inputs into the evaluation process, members of the EC participated in 
the evaluation process, also completing questionnaires relating to their 
attendance at Board meetings.

The Company Secretary produced a feedback summary providing 
recommendations to the Directors. This report was shared with the 
Chair and committee Chairs and subsequently all Board members.

Insight
The feedback from the Board Directors was positive throughout their 
responses to the evaluation. Views were provided on: composition and 
dynamics; skills, capabilities and competencies; support and challenge; 
atmosphere in the room; the support the Board and Board committees 
receive; strategic focus; risk management and oversight; stakeholder 
engagement; and any priorities for change.

Board dynamics
In 2024, the Board plans to undertake a Board dynamics review. The 
review will be structured to identify the current state of Board practices, 
focusing on what works well and any factors which could be improved 
to accelerate effectiveness. Our Chief Human Resources and 
Corporate Officer and the Company Secretary will lead the review. 
The approach will be structured to provide ongoing maintenance and 
improvement of Board dynamics with continued support and input 
from the Directors.

Management and focus of meetings
The output from the 2023 Board evaluation highlighted the need for 
the Board's collective continued focus on the implementation of ETS24, 
and the continued delivery of plans outlined at Capital Markets Day 
(CMD) in June 2023. The continued optimisation and integration of the 
work of both the Board and the ARC on risk-related matters were also 
noted as continued areas of focus for 2024.

Overall, the Board was found to be functioning well, with a high level 
of commitment from both the Non-executive and Executive Directors. 
Improvements identified were to fine-tune an already effective Board. 
There are good personal relationships, amid a collegial spirit, with a

high degree of mutual respect. Directors are able to share opinions and 
guidance and feel that they are heard. The agenda has been broad 
and the committees have complemented the Board agenda to ensure 
that the Board has covered the areas viewed to be key.

Feedback themes for the committees 
The committees were considered to be well-chaired and well-operated 
and received excellent input from Senior Management. All committee 
reviews provided focus on the meeting management and effectiveness, 
oversight, and performance improvement. Each individual committee 
analysed topics specific to the forum. The committees also provided 
feedback on the implementation of recommendations from the 2022 
evaluation process. 

Chair evaluation
The Chair was considered to have built and maintained strong 
relationships with the CEO, CFO and the Non-executive Directors. 
He was also thought to be very good at drawing out individual views 
in the room and keen to listen to views from all Directors. References 
to his knowledge, accessibility and support were made and these 
are valued across the Board.

Delivery against the 2023 ambitions
Several Board effectiveness initiatives were implemented and undertaken 
in 2023. The Board continued to focus on being a well-functioning Board 
and spent additional time on strategic matters. It placed an even greater 
focus on Shell's key stakeholders around the world. In line with this, the 
Board refreshed its agendas. It also implemented an initiative to enhance 
the quality of Board pre-reading materials to better support its priorities 
on strategy and enable it to use its time as effectively as possible.

Leadership changes to both the composition and structure of the EC 
were implemented, which has simplified the organisation structure.

The Board undertook a more strategic review of the committees' 
agendas and remit to ensure alignment with the Board's priorities and 
longer-term aspirations. The composition and the terms of reference of 
each committee were updated as a result of this work with the Audit 
Committee being redesignated the Audit and Risk Committee, and the 
Safety, Environment and Sustainability Committee being redesignated 
the Sustainability Committee. In addition, the Board reviewed the 
general information provided to Directors during their onboarding 
and throughout the year to ensure that all Directors achieve sufficient 
knowledge and understanding of the organisation, while balancing 
this against the volume of the materials provided. 

Further, the NOMCO reviewed its Principles for the Strategic 
Composition of the Board to ensure these continue to reflect 
the strategic and diversity requirements of the Board.

Shell Annual Report and Accounts 2023Governance
Understanding and engaging with our stakeholders

The Board continues to value and recognise the importance 
of engagement and cooperation with our stakeholders. Time 
is dedicated to listening to different stakeholder views and 
our commitment to stakeholder engagement is built upon 
the understanding that knowledge-sharing, widening of 
experiences and adopting a learner mindset will help us
achieve our commercial, environmental and social objectives.

The Board remains grateful for the engagement opportunities
it has had, including the 2023 AGM. 

The Shell website also provides contact details for our Registrar, 
Equiniti, shareholder queries, our media team, requests for copies
of the Annual Report, and general customer enquiries. 

The Company's Registrar operates an internet access facility for 
registered shareholders, providing details of their shareholdings. 
Facilities are also provided for shareholders to lodge proxy 
appointments electronically. The Corporate Nominee service, 
facilitated by Equiniti, provides a facility for investors to hold their 
shares in the Company in paperless form.

The Directors have continued to consider stakeholders' views in 
Board discussions and decision-making, as described on pages 
141-145. 

Engagement with our stakeholders also goes beyond the Board
and is continuous. Our broader businesses regularly engage with 
stakeholders throughout the year, and in the build-up to or during 
many Shell projects, activities, acquisitions and divestments. This 
engagement is often governed by formulated policies, control 
frameworks, regulation and legislation. It may differ by region.

Site visits
The Chair, certain Board committees and Non-executive Directors 
traditionally visit several Shell operations and overseas offices in 
a given calendar year. The objective of these visits is to provide the 
Directors with local context and deepen their understanding in the 
following ways, where relevant:
￮ provide insights into asset operations and portfolio positions; 
￮ opportunity to engage directly with stakeholders, including staff, 

business partners, communities;

￮ improve the Board's oversight of top risks; and
￮ assess the Company's culture first-hand.

Visits provide a good opportunity for Board members to engage with 
each other and, in 2023 in particular, with three new Board members, 
the visits formed an important part of their induction. 

Shareholders
The Chair, the Deputy Chair, the CEO, the CFO and the Executive 
Vice President Investor Relations each meet regularly with major 
shareholders and report the views of such shareholders to the 
Board. Committee chairs also seek engagement with shareholders 
on significant matters related to their areas of responsibility. During 
the year, Sir Andrew Mackenzie, in his capacity as Chair, met with 
more than 50 major shareholders, including during four days of 
roadshows. A variety of topics were discussed with the Chair, including 
performance, capital discipline and simplification of Shell; governance 
and Board priorities; and the Company's role in the energy transition. 
In the early part of the year, the REMCO Chair met with over 25 
shareholders and discussed 2022 pay outcomes and remuneration 
policy changes ahead of the 2023 AGM.

Shareholders can contact Shell directly via the "Contact us" section of 
the Shell website. This allows investors' questions to be directed to the 
appropriate Shell team that can assist. Shareholders are also able to 
make use of our automated question response tool. Investors can also 
access information via the frequently asked questions section of the 
Shell website.

Shareholder engagement on AGM resolutions
At the 2023 AGM, shareholders voted on two climate-related 
resolutions: (i) Resolution 25, which was an advisory vote on Shell's 
Energy Transition Progress – shareholders showed strong endorsement, 
with 80% of shareholders who voted casting votes in favour of our 
progress; and (ii) Resolution 26, a shareholder resolution, submitted 
by an organisation called Follow This on behalf of a small group of 
shareholders. The resolution from Follow This was broadly unchanged 
from their 2022 submission, which was also rejected by shareholders, 
as its variations have been every year since first being submitted in 
2016. The resolution urged Shell to align its medium-term carbon 
emissions reduction targets with the Paris Climate Agreement, including 
emissions from fuels burnt by consumers, known as Scope 3 emissions. 
We remain committed to constructive engagement with our 
shareholders, and we believe our climate targets are aligned with the 
more ambitious goal of the Paris Agreement. The Board believed the 
proposal from Follow This was not in the best interest of the Company 
and its shareholders as a whole. Resolution 26 received support from 
20% of shareholders who voted. Shell is aware that some shareholders 
voted in support of both Resolutions 25 and 26, despite their 
conflicting content.

In 2023, the Chair, CEO and CFO hosted meetings with some of 
our large shareholders. These meetings covered many topics. We 
recognise and value the importance of stakeholder engagement when 
considering our energy transition progress. The Board is grateful for the 
time and contribution of all those stakeholders who provided feedback, 
and for the overall indications of support for Shell's strategy. 

Following the AGM, we engaged with our largest shareholders offering 
further opportunities to discuss the progress made against Shell's 
energy transition strategy and to understand the reasons behind 
various voting decisions. The Chair subsequently had an opportunity 
to engage directly with our large institutional shareholders during his 
roadshow in September 2023.

These discussions showed that our large shareholders that did not
vote in line with the Board recommendation on Resolution 25 and 
Resolution 26 were predominantly focused on Shell's energy transition 
strategy and not the 2022 progress, to which Resolution 25 related. 
Some shareholders continue to outline societal pressure influencing 
media coverage and expectations from beneficial owners as reasons 
for not aligning with the Board recommendation. Others raised 
questions related to medium-term targets, including a desire for 
a Scope 3 absolute emissions target.

This feedback was added to the ongoing internal considerations of the 
Company's climate targets, along with the outcome of the Dutch court 
case, the Powering Progress strategy, Capital Markets Day, and the 
commitments that Shell had made within its energy transition strategy.

Audit and Risk Committee visits

Director attendance Outcome/insight

These site visits deepen the 
ARC's understanding of the 
risks and opportunities arising 
as well as its understanding of 
how the Company's Powering 
Progress strategy is 
implemented. 

The Board gained an insight into 
the development and culture of the 
operations and maintenance teams. 
The use and impact of digitalisation 
tools were highlighted, and the 
future environmental capabilities 
of the site were discussed.

Engagement prior to the 
visits helped to formulate 
the agenda and refine the 
areas of focus for the 
respective visits.

Director visits

Discussions were held with 
the respective Directors 
ahead of the visit to 
formulate the agenda and 
encourage a natural, open 
dialogue in the group 
sessions.

During 2023, the ARC conducted a site visit to the USA where it visited a 
number of operations, including Shell Polymers Monaca, the Shell Norco 
facility, the Shell-operated Vito floating production facility in the Gulf of 
Mexico (virtual visit from New Orleans) and the Houston trading floor. 

ARC

In February 2023, the Chair of the Board visited the Shell Business 
Operations offices in Bangalore, to deepen his understanding of 
operations and meet staff. 

Directors

In March 2023, one Director visited Nature Energy and met with 
operators of the plant, and also visited the office in Odesund meeting 
with the Nature Energy's CEO and CFO for an overview of 
the company. 

In June 2023, the Chair of the Board visited NAM, Shell Energy and 
Chemicals Park Rotterdam and Shell Chemicals Park Moerdijk. The visit 
entailed staff engagement sessions in all three locations, and with the 
NL leadership team in The Hague. Additionally in June 2023, the 
Directors held their Strategy Days off site in Vancouver and visited LNG 
Canada, in Kitimat, where they saw the asset under construction, met 
with staff and engaged with local communities and authorities. 

In October 2023, the Chair of the Board visited China and attended the 
Tsinghua University School of Economics and Management Advisory 
Board, the Shell Eco-marathon in Beijing, meetings with external 
stakeholders including a senior Chinese government delegation, 
and a staff engagement session. 

At the start of January 2024, several Directors visited Oman and Qatar.

Workforce engagement

As with all the Code's provisions, boards must consider the size and 
structure of their business, including its international scope, and select 
an approach to engaging with the workforce that most practically 
delivers the underlying spirit and ambition of the Code. 

The Code states that its use of the term "workforce" is not meant to 
align with legal definitions of workforce, employee, worker or similar 
terms. But for a global organisation bound by the laws of more than 
70 countries, blurring the clearly prescribed legal definitions that affect 
complex issues (such as local health, safety, security and environment 
(HSSE) requirements, work contract terms, legal accountability, 
employment rights) or merging two definitions of the same term 
could have a notable impact on the business, its operations and its 
stakeholder relationships (including with suppliers). As a result, Shell 
considers its workforce to be employees of companies in the Shell 
Group. The Board also engages with others outside this group (for 
example, on site visits), and some of this engagement is shared 
on page 167.

Although our reporting and formal engagement focuses predominantly 
on our employees, all individuals working on Shell sites (including Shell 
offices) are required to undertake certain Shell training (for example, 
on matters relating to HSSE and the Code of Conduct). Adhering to the 
Life-Saving Rules and the Code of Conduct compliance obligations is 
included within our contracts with suppliers. The Shell Global Helpline 
is available for all workers to report matters of concern.

For many years, Shell has recognised the importance of engaging with 
its workforce. Engagement is especially important in maintaining strong 
business delivery in volatile times of change. We strive to maintain a 
dialogue between management and our workforce – both directly 
and, where appropriate, through employee representative bodies. 
Management regularly engages with the workforce through a range 
of formal and informal channels, including via webcasts and emails 
from the Chief Executive Officer (CEO) and other senior executives, 
webcasts, town halls, team meetings, face-to-face gatherings, 
interviews with Senior Management, internal social platforms 
and online publications via our intranet.

The Board considers effective engagement a key element of its 
understanding of the Company's ability to create value, because it 
recognises that our people are our greatest asset. Workforce views 
can help inform the Board on matters such as operational effectiveness, 
Shell culture, diversity, equity and inclusion, identifying risk and 
opportunity, and developing and delivering strategy.

The Board considers the current workforce engagement approach 
effective, and feedback from employees indicates that they too 
find the interactions valuable and worthwhile. The information 
provided in the following table gives examples of various methods 
of Board engagement.

Board's direct engagements with the workforce

Informal engagement – Board

NOMCO members met with various senior leaders and high-potential 
individuals throughout the year. 

Off-site visits

Workforce engagements during Board and/or meetings off site.

Meeting talent/leadership teams.

The Chair undertaking staff engagement sessions.

Through these more formal engagements, the Chair and other Non-executive 
Directors (either individually or in groups) have deepened their understanding 
of how the Company's purpose, strategy and values are embedded in particular 
businesses, sites and countries. This continues to give insight into progress made, 
risks and opportunities. The benefits are mutual. The Board obtains direct insight 
into local business operations and projects, and local strengths and challenges. 
Our people have a chance to better understand the Board and to provide direct 
feedback on topics of importance to them, their business or function and their 
location.

Shell Netherlands

In June 2023, the Chair met with a cross section of employees representing 
different businesses, locations, tenture, and job groups at Shell sites in the 
Netherlands (NAM, Pernis, and Moerdijk). The purpose of the meetings 
was to see and hear about operations and their perspectives, including 
the implementation of Powering Progress in the Netherlands. 

The two-way dialogue offered participants the opportunity to ask questions and 
provide feedback. The Chair also had dinner with approximately 20 members 
of the leadership of Shell Netherlands to hear their views on the longer-term 
opportunities for the Company strategy in the country.

Shell Canada

The Board and Executive Committee (EC) visited Canada in June for their annual 
off-site visit and Board meeting. The visit provided significant opportunities for 
workforce engagement over three days.

On the first day, the Board and EC met several Shell Canada leaders and staff 
during business-focused discussions covering each of the core businesses in Shell 
Canada. On the second day, the Board and EC visited LNG Canada in Kitimat 
BC where they met with a cross section of 50 Shell staff during a site tour and a 
lunch. The site tour provided opportunity to engage frontline employees in the 
field. Feedback received after the event suggested that employees enjoyed the 
opportunity to engage informally with the Board and EC members. On the third 
day, over lunch, the Board and EC met a cross section of 50 Shell Canada 
leaders representing different businesses, locations, tenure, and job groups. 

Shell China

In September 2023, the Chair undertook his first visit to China in his capacity as 
Chair of the Board of Shell. This presented an opportunity for employees to meet 
him, and he took part in a panel-style staff engagement session with 100 Shell 
China staff. 

On the same day, he presented the awards to the finalists of the Shell Eco-
marathon in Beijing, and attended a dinner with Shell employees involved 
in the Shell Eco-marathon. 

Shell Energy and Chemicals Park Rheinland, Germany 

In November 2023, the Chair and members of the SUSCO visited Shell Energy 
and Chemicals Park Rheinland in Germany. They reviewed progress against the 
sustainability and non-financial aspects of the Company's strategy and engaged 
with employees.

Formal reports and information updates to the Board

Risks

Shell People Survey (anonymous survey facilitated externally)

Through the results of the Shell People Survey, the Board was provided with 
an update on employee engagement levels, and the quality and resilience 
of leadership across Shell's workforce. The Board was informed of a broad 
range of subjects, including principal metrics, with particular focus on rewards, 
working conditions/workload and reputation.

The Board considers the Shell People Survey to be one of its principal tools for 
measuring employee engagement, motivation, affiliation and commitment to 
Shell. It provides insights into employee views and has a consistently high 
response rate. In 2023, the response rate reached an all-time high of 88%, 
(up 1% from 2022). The Board also considers this engagement to understand, 
for example, how Shell is using the survey outcomes in: i) data analytics, for 
example, to identify potential correlative relationships between employee 
engagement and safety or ethics and compliance incidents; and ii) 
strengthening Company culture and values.

Senior Succession and Resourcing Review

The annual Senior Succession and Resourcing Review focused on the strength 
of senior leadership and plans for its development and succession, while 
highlighting the breadth, depth and diversity of its pipeline, the developing 
profile of the leadership cadre, and recruitment and attrition levels.

The Senior Succession and Resourcing Review also highlighted the effectiveness 
of succession planning, the impact of its associated execution, and the data-
driven, integrated approach to leadership and leadership development. The 
review continues to focus on proactive management of Shell's talent pipeline, 
and on advancing Shell's diversity agenda with increased attention on gender, 
race and ethnicity, LGBT+ and disabilities.

Assessment of key trends and material incidents

Presented by Chief Ethics and Compliance Officer. This is based on the 
established channels for staff and others to file complaints or report on 
suspected breaches in relation to the Shell General Business Principles (SGBP), 
the Code of Conduct or any breaches of laws or regulations, including 
accounting control and auditing concerns.

The update covers Shell employees and our wider stakeholder base. The Board 
(also via the ARC and the SUSCO) obtains insight into incidents and reporting 
levels and remediation. These provide indicators of conduct risks and, together 
with the related Board reports noted below, suggest the strength of embedding 
and awareness of the Code of Conduct and SGBP obligations and employees' 
comfort levels in raising incidents.

The Board reviewed reports on Shell's top risks, external and internal trends and 
emerging risks.

Organisational culture

The Board has continued its discussion on the Powering Progress strategy, 
including powering lives. The Board also focused on diversity, equity and 
inclusion commitments.

Chief Ethics and Compliance Officer Report

Data and insights include information from the Global Helpline, the Shell 
Ethics and Compliance organisation and the Shell People Survey. The SUSCO 
continues to strongly support the work of the Chief Ethics and Compliance 
Officer, including the efforts to ensure a safe working environment where staff 
feel confident to raise any concerns in good faith.

The ARC is kept updated when matters highlighted through the Global Helpline 
are investigated. The ARC is also informed about the associated remediation. 
For more information see "Audit and Risk Committee Report".

Assurance activities

Assurance activities, including items raised by businesses and functions (through 
the Group Assurance Letters process) and assurance (from Internal Audit, HSSE, 
Ethics and Compliance, Reserves Assurance and Reporting), provide additional 
evidence to the Board of the commitment to high standards of risk management 
and internal control. The assurance activities ensure that work can be done 
safely, within regulatory frameworks.

The information provided within these reports further supports the Board's 
annual review of the effectiveness of the Group's system of risk management 
and internal control, and feeds into the Group scorecard, against which staff 
bonuses are calculated.

The Shell Performance Framework

In 2023, the Shell Performance Framework replaced the Shell Control 
Framework. More information on this can be found on pages 223-224. 

Significant HSSE, Ethics and Compliance, and more broadly, business control 
incidents are brought to the attention of Senior Management and the Board 
through regular reporting.

During these discussions, the Board seeks to learn more from incidents and 
ensure that the business continues to drive safety performance.

Purpose
The Nomination and Succession Committee (the "NOMCO") leads the 
process for appointments to the Board and Senior Management [A] 
positions, ensures plans are in place for orderly, well-planned 
succession, and oversees the development of a diverse succession 
pipeline of candidates. It also reviews the Company's policy, targets 
and strategy on diversity, equity and inclusion (DE&I), and monitors 
the effectiveness of these initiatives. It makes recommendations to 
the Board on corporate governance guidelines, as referred to in 
the Chair's introduction.
[A] In this section of the report, "Senior Management" refers to the Executive Committee 
and the Company Secretary, as defined by the UK Corporate Governance Code.

Talent management and succession
The NOMCO is fully engaged with the end-to-end talent management 
and senior succession planning approach that is deployed within Shell. 
It plays a key role in senior succession and resourcing. Retaining in-
depth knowledge of the individuals within the talent pipeline is a 
NOMCO priority. The NOMCO makes time to personally meet and 
engage with numerous individuals within the pipeline. The NOMCO's 
oversight and input extend from recruitment to leadership identification 
and from leadership development to leadership appointment, all of 
which are underpinned by clearly articulated talent priorities and a 
commitment to advancing DE&I across Shell.

The NOMCO manages Board and supports Senior Management 
succession under a structured, proactive methodology. The processes 
have clear and agreed selection principles for short-, medium- and long-
term succession and are aligned with Shell's strategic priorities.

For Non-executive Director succession, the NOMCO continues to 
follow its Principles for the Strategic Composition of the Board, adding 
factors as they evolve. These principles include both quantitative and 
qualitative principles, considering:
￮ the overall aspired Board composition and diversity of age; gender; 
race; ethnicity; educational, social, geographical and professional 
backgrounds; skills; knowledge; and experience that align with the 
Company's strategy including amongst other criteria consideration 
of the skills and strengths needed for the energy transition; and

￮ the values, attitudes, and behaviours expected of Directors.

Shell Annual Report and Accounts 2023 
 
Governance
Nomination and Succession Committee continued

During the year, the Principles for the Strategic Composition of the 
Board were reviewed and updated. The NOMCO also focused on the 
future needs for the Board's composition, including size and tenure, 
skills and experience, and the DE&I requirements of the UK Listing 
Rules, FTSE Women Leaders and the Parker Review. The current size of 
the Board was considered to be appropriate, also taking account of 
Committee memberships. Greater flexibility around Non-Executive 
tenure was also discussed. Although Shell does not publish its Principles 
for the Strategic Composition of the Board, it has published its updated 
Board and Senior Management Diversity Policy on the Company's 
website. This Policy highlights that Shell aims for a gender balance on 
the Board, with at least one senior Board position (Chair, CEO or CFO) 
held by a woman. In addition, Shell's target is to maintain the 
representation of both men and women at, or above, a minimum of 
40%. We believe that this allows Shell to be truly representative of all 
genders and gender identities and provides flexibility during periods of 
change. Further, Shell aims to maintain or exceed having at least one 
Board member from an ethnic minority background.

See "Other regulatory and statutory information" on page 222.

For Senior Management succession, the selection principles include 
process-specific elements, such as a clear and proactive approach to 
identifying and developing succession candidates. The principles also 
outline the long-term structured nature of the succession planning 

process. There is also strong focus on ensuring that the principles reflect 
the leadership qualities required for future business success and that 
they advance the progress of diversity in all its forms.

Senior Management principles feature in the NOMCO's review of the 
succession plans which occurs in every Committee meeting. Using the 
principles, the NOMCO implements any changes through a well-
defined and diligent process with overall Board engagement. The 
NOMCO agrees on candidate profiles and meets prospective 
candidates well ahead of any selection decision being necessary. 
It also engages the Board early in the process to ensure all Directors 
have an opportunity to meet and assess prospective candidates. 
Consequently, some of the leaders whom the NOMCO and Board 
engaged with extensively in the past became members of the Board 
(Wael Sawan and Sinead Gorman) or the Executive Committee 
(Philippa Bounds and Robin Mooldijk, and with Rachel Solway's 
appointment effective January 1, 2024, announced during the year).

During 2023, the NOMCO's annual in-depth look at the status and 
succession plans for Senior Management within Shell, along with the 
review of the talent pipeline in line with the business, was undertaken 
by the full Board. The Board reflected on the simplification of the senior 
leadership structure with clear accountabilities achieved in 2023 with a 
view to the further evolvement of the composition of the total workforce 
and of the organisation's culture as an enabler for performance.

Diversity of leadership
The NOMCO recognises that continuing to improve all types of 
diversity at each level of the Shell Group is crucial. Shell aims to be an 
inclusive workplace where everyone feels valued and respected and 
has a strong sense of belonging. The NOMCO's review of diversity 
objectives and strategies for the Shell Group as a whole also monitors 
the impact of diversity and inclusion initiatives. 

representation has steadily improved in recent years, with a two 
percentage point increase over the last year. Among experienced 
recruitment in 2023, Shell companies recruited 38% women, and 
among graduates 40%. Women representation in the top 1,200 roles 
("Senior Leadership" positions) has strengthened by 2% during 2023 to 
32%, and we continue to progress towards our aim of achieving 35% 
women senior leadership representation by 2025. 

In February 2021, Shell published its aspirations for diversity, equity 
and inclusion (DE&I) under the powering lives goal, with a focus on four 
areas of gender, race and ethnicity, LGBT+ and disability inclusion. 
When looking at our progress against our ambitions, women 

"Senior Leadership" is a Shell-specific measure and different from 
that which we are required to report under the Code, being female 
representation in Senior Management and their direct reports, 
where the percentage is 27%.

Nomination and Succession Committee continued

To this end, the NOMCO is responsible for engaging an independent 
executive search consultant, who assists in preparing shortlists 
of candidates, coordinating interviews and seeking references. 
In accordance with the Board DE&I policy, the NOMCO only 
engages with external search firms who are able to align with 
Shell's approach to DE&I in identifying suitable individuals from 
diverse pools of candidates.

Under the DE&I policy, the Board commits to: 
￮ Ensuring an inclusive environment: Through inclusive behaviours and 
practices, we aim to create a board environment where every Board 
member feels valued, respected, and empowered to contribute fully;
￮ Ensuring support for External Best Practices: The Board endorses and 
supports external best practices, such as the FTSE Women Leaders 
Review, Parker Review, and others, to maintain and enhance 
diversity within the Board;

￮ Ensuring that Board appointments are managed with rigour and 
transparency: Candidates are evaluated based on merit, skills, 
experience, qualifications, performance, and business 
considerations, with due regard for diversity factors;

￮ Ensuring regular Board composition reviews: The Board regularly 

assesses the composition of the Board, including age, gender, race, 
ethnicity, educational, social, geographical, and professional 
backgrounds, skills, knowledge, and experience, making 
recommendations for necessary adjustments.

Shell has an inclusive Board environment, comprising individuals that 
are suitably qualified. They have the required skills, industry expertise, 
breadth of perspective and high-quality decision-making capabilities 
to support the strategy and overall direction of Shell. 

See "The Board of Shell plc" on pages 147-154 for details about the skills and backgrounds 

of individual members. 

From a gender perspective, the Board is comprised of five female 
directors and seven male directors, representing 42% female 
representation (2022: 55%, 2021: 50%). Two of the four main 
Board committees are chaired by a female director.

While the Board aspires to achieve gender parity, progress against 
diversity targets is sensitive to the size of the Board. In respect of other 
forms of diversity, three members of the Board self-identify as being 
from an ethnic minority background. In accordance with the Board's 
DE&I policy, the Board firmly believes that diversity fosters a broader 
range of perspectives, resulting in improved Board effectiveness, 
decision-making, and outcomes.

Nationality diversity, such as Asian and American talent, continues to 
be managed in accordance with the business outlook and we have a 
strong focus on progressing race and ethnic minority representation, 
beginning in the UK and the USA and followed by the Netherlands. 
The representation of people of colour among Shell's senior leaders in 
the USA has been actively tracked for many years. It stood at 26.9% 
at the end of 2023, compared with 17.3% in 2016. In the UK, race and 
ethnic minority representation among senior leaders was 18.3% [A].
[A] UK specific: the ethnicity declaration is voluntary, our ethnicity declaration rate is not 100% 

and all calculations are based on declaration rate of 76.6%. The 23.4% of our workforce 
who have not provided data or chosen not to declare their ethnicity were not included in 
our calculations.

In line with the recommendations from the 2023 Parker Review, Shell 
has reviewed its ambitions for ethnic minority representation at the 
senior management level and aims for 15% senior management 
positions [B] to be occupied by ethnic minority executives by 
December 2027.
[B] The 2023 Parker review defines Senior Management as the Executive Committee and the 

senior managers who report directly to them.

Although the NOMCO monitors Shell's organisational DE&I strategies 
and initiatives, it also holds itself accountable for the Board's own 
diversity and inclusion. Back in 2020, the Board's diverse composition 
met the Hampton Alexander requirements (now FTSE Women Leaders) 
and, in 2023, it met the Parker Reviews' objectives by reflecting 42% 
women representation with one ethnic minority director. Shell's Board 
diversity is aligned with the targets set by UK Listing Rules. The position 
of CFO is held by a woman and three Directors are from an ethnic 
minority group.

More information on DE&I in Shell is provided in the "Powering lives" section on page 130.

The People Strategy and diversity, equity and inclusion
Diversity continued to be a key area of focus during the year and is 
encompassed in the powering lives pillar of our Powering Progress 
strategy. The Board has developed and approved a new board DE&I 
policy further to a recommendation by the NOMCO. The policy is 
aligned to the requirements of the UK Corporate Governance Code 
and includes our targets for Board diversity, as well as complementing 
Shell's wider diversity policies and embracing Shell's values, code of 
conduct and sustainability goals. Currently, this policy is not applied 
to the individual Committees, although we strive to apply diverse 
representation across the Committees. DE&I across Committee 
membership remains an ongoing consideration. A copy of the 
DE&I policy is available on our website, shell.com/investors/
environmental-social-and-governance/board-of-directors.

In relation to Board director appointments and diversity, the NOMCO 
oversees the development of a diverse pipeline for succession to 
the Board and monitors that all board appointments are subject 
to a formal, rigorous, and transparent procedure and that such 
appointments are based on merit and objective criteria taking into 
account (among other things) factors such as diversity of gender, 
age, educational and professional background, social, ethnic and 
geographical background and cognitive and personal strengths.

In addition to its considerations regarding succession (some 
of which were in the early part of 2023), the NOMCO made 
recommendations on corporate governance guidelines, monitored 
compliance with corporate governance requirements and made 
recommendations on corporate-governance-related disclosures. 

The NOMCO continues to monitor and review this area, considering 
whether and how current Company governance matters should be 
strengthened. Further insight on some of the NOMCO's areas of

Executive Committee succession
During the year, robust and effective succession planning supported the appointment of a number of new members to the Executive 
Committee. Some of the NOMCO activities in supporting these appointments are outlined below.

The NOMCO undertakes comprehensive engagement to understand who the candidates are for senior roles, what personally 
drives them and how they will ensure Shell achieves its strategic ambitions. 

Succession for senior roles is planned well in advance and reviewed regularly. Succession planning is a crucial, ongoing 
consideration and not just an area of focus when an Executive Committee (EC) member is nearing the end of their tenure. The Board 
oversees Shell's succession planning process in which selection is the final step of a rigorous, sophisticated and well-planned process.

For Executive Director and EC appointments, the NOMCO has set a structured process:
￮ Before any potential decision on resourcing, it explicitly describes the requirements of the role and the candidate profile.
￮ By working in a planned, consistent manner, last-minute surprises are avoided and well-considered decisions are made in line with 

evolving business requirements.

￮ It also plans for the unexpected and maintains a list of candidates capable of stepping into senior roles to provide cover if necessary.

The NOMCO spends time getting to know the candidates to ensure that the pipeline is robust, diverse and adaptive. The NOMCO 
ensures it has visibility of today's and tomorrow's leaders. Over the last few years, the NOMCO has met many leaders and had extensive 
engagements with each of them. Some of these leaders now sit on the EC, others were appointed to the Board (Wael Sawan and Sinead 
Gorman).

The NOMCO engages across the Executive talent pipeline to ensure it interacts with and becomes familiar with talent at different 
levels of the organisation; for example, on a regular basis informal engagements are held with employees from a range of businesses, 
functions and backgrounds prior to a Board meeting. Not only does this engagement support senior succession, it also provides a helpful 
element of the NOMCO's workforce engagement.

The Board is proud that candidates for the most senior leadership roles have primarily come from within the business, proving that the 
leadership development and succession process remains effective.

Purpose
The Sustainability Committee [A] ("SUSCO") assists the Board of 
Directors in fulfilling its responsibilities by reviewing the progress of 
Shell with respect to sustainability and reviewing the non-financial 
elements of Shell's Powering Progress strategy.
[A] The Sustainability Committee was previously the Safety, Environment and Sustainability 

Committee.

Overview
The SUSCO meets regularly to review and discuss a wide range of 
topics, which include progress on Shell's Powering Progress strategic 
themes of net zero emissions, respecting nature and powering lives.

The SUSCO also reviews selected sustainability topics and matters 
of public concern, such as biodiversity and plastic waste. 

As directed by the Board, the SUSCO provides input to Shell's annual 
reporting and disclosures on energy transition and sustainability. 

Catherine J. Hughes

Sustainability Committee continued

The SUSCO also reviews and considers external stakeholder 
perspectives on sustainability issues of relevance to the 
Group's businesses. 

The sustainability topics and matters of public concern discussed 
in particular depth by the committee included biodiversity, plastic 
waste and methane emissions.

In line with the strategic importance of the SUSCO's agenda, 
the Chair of the Board and the CFO attend committee meetings. 

Shell's CEO and the EC hold overall accountability for sustainability 
within Shell. In February 2023, Shell announced the new role of 
Executive Vice President of Carbon and Sustainability, reporting 
to the CFO.

Activities
During 2023, the SUSCO refocused its agenda on the areas of 
greatest strategic importance to Shell, in line with its updated terms 
of reference. This allowed the SUSCO to more effectively oversee 
Shell's progress with respect to sustainability.

The SUSCO reviewed the progress made against the non-financial 
elements of Shell’s Powering Progress strategy, including progress 
against the ambitions and targets under the goals of achieving
net-zero emissions, respecting nature and powering lives.

The SUSCO provided input to Shell's annual reporting and disclosures 
on energy transition and sustainability. The SUSCO Chair held 
meetings during the year with senior leaders to discuss specific topics.

See our website shell.com for details on SUSCO and how Shell manages sustainability.

Site visits
The SUSCO visited the Energy and Chemicals Park Rheinland in 
Germany, in November 2023. The visit included a review of energy 
transition projects that are part of the site's transformation, a review 
of operational safety and process safety performance, a tour of the 
facility, meetings with site staff, and an engagement with the Director 
General at the Ministry for Economic Affairs, Innovation, Digitalization 
and Energy of the state of North Rhine-Westphalia.

Two members of the SUSCO visited the Olympus offshore platform in 
the Gulf of Mexico in April 2023. The visit included a review of safety 
performance, production operations, the offshore business and Shell's 
approach to sustainability.

Audit and Risk Committee Report

Dear Shareholders,
I am pleased to present our Audit and Risk Committee (the "ARC") 
Report for 2023. 

I was delighted to welcome new ARC members, Cyrus Taraporevala, 
Sir Charles Roxburgh and Catherine Hughes. They joined the ARC 
on March 2, 2023, March 13, 2023 and May 23, 2023 respectively 
and bring valuable insight and experience. I would also like to thank 
Martina Hund-Mejean for her contribution as a committee member 
since May, 2020. 

The ARC assists the Board in fulfilling its oversight responsibilities in 
areas such as the integrity of financial reporting, the effectiveness of 
risk management and internal controls, as well as the consideration 
of ethics and compliance matters. We are responsible for assessing 
the quality of the audit performed by, and the independence 
and objectivity of, the external auditor. The ARC also makes a 
recommendation to the Board on the appointment or reappointment 
of the external auditor. In addition, we oversee the work and quality 
of the internal audit function. During the year, the ARC's core duties 
remained largely unchanged and our usual cadence of activities 
remained in place. However, in recognition of the ARC's increased 
focus on risk management, we refreshed our Terms of Reference, 
formalising our role in assisting the Board in this area and revised our 
committee name to include "Risk". Detail on our oversight activities 
in relation to risk management can be found on page 183.

Our work programme over the course of a year focuses on a variety of 
matters that involve a high degree of judgement and/or are significant 
to Shell's consolidated financial statements. We review with 
management the sources of estimation uncertainty and other key 
assumptions against the backdrop of economic and market uncertainty 
and volatility, climate risk and the energy transition and evolving 
stakeholder expectations. In addition, we consider the robustness 
of the risk and internal control framework, results of internal control 
testing performed throughout the year, and remediation activities. 

Topics addressed in 2023 included: updates on Shell's announced 
withdrawal from Russian oil and gas activities; deferred taxes and tax 
exposures; the impact on tax balances and disclosures as a result of 
windfall and minimum taxes around the world; significant portfolio 
developments; litigation; impairment trigger assessments; impairment 
charges and reversals; accounting for complex contracts; dividend 
distribution capacity; and mark-to-market derivatives accounting, 
including the impact of volatile gas and power markets. 

We received briefings from the Chief Internal Auditor on the 
effectiveness of Shell's risk management and internal control system 
and on the outcomes of significant audits and notable control matters. 

The impacts of climate change and the energy transition continue 
to touch on many aspects of the ARC's work, including the financial 
statement impacts as well as data assurance challenges of meeting 
expanded climate-related disclosures. In order to obtain feedback 
to continuously improve carbon-related disclosures, management 
engaged with Sarasin & Partners and Carbon Tracker during 2023.

The ARC, recognising the evolving nature of climate change risks and 
responses, concluded that climate change has been appropriately 
considered by management in key judgements and estimates and 
agreed with the disclosure made by management.

“The primary role of the ARC is to assist 
the Board in fulfilling its oversight 
responsibilities in areas such as the integrity 
of financial reporting, the effectiveness 
of risk management and internal controls, 
as well as the consideration of ethics 
and compliance matters.“

Ann Godbehere
Chair of the Audit and Risk Committee

Audit and Risk Committee Report continued

During 2023, the ARC was briefed on the implementation of the 
Shell Performance Framework which replaced the former Shell Control 
Framework with effect from July 1, 2023. Other focus topics for 2023 
included Trading and Supply; regulatory developments, for example 
audit reform and corporate governance proposals and new 
sustainability reporting regulations; and new business ventures 
and controls.

As part of its oversight of compliance with applicable legal and 
regulatory requirements, including monitoring ethics and compliance 
risks, the ARC discussed with the Group Chief Privacy Officer activities 
undertaken in the ethics and compliance programme related to 
compliance with data privacy laws and regulations, and steps 
taken to manage those risks. 

In 2023, the ARC conducted a site visit to the USA where it visited 
a number of operations and more recently, some members of the 
ARC visited Oman and Qatar. These site visits deepen the ARC's 
understanding of risks and opportunities, as well as its understanding of 
how the Company's Powering Progress strategy is being implemented.

The external audit tender process also commenced in 2023 and will 
continue in 2024 as set out later in this report. 

On a final note, the ARC recognises the strong commitment and 
dedication of the financial reporting team and would like to thank 
them for all their efforts during 2023.

Audit and Risk Committee Report continued

All ARC members are financially literate, independent Non-executive 
Directors. In respect of the year ended December 31, 2023, for the 
purposes of the UK Corporate Governance Code, Ann Godbehere 
qualifies as: a person with "recent and relevant financial experience" 
and competence in accounting, and, for the purposes of US securities 
laws, an "audit committee financial expert".

The experience of the ARC members outlined on pages 147-154 
demonstrates that the ARC as a whole has competence relevant to 
the sector in which Shell operates, and the necessary commercial, 
regulatory, financial and audit expertise required to fulfil its 
responsibilities. The ARC members have gained further knowledge 
and experience of the sector as a result of their Board membership 
and through various in-person and virtual site visits since their 
respective appointments. 

The ARC invites the CFO, the Legal Director, the Chief Internal Auditor, 
the Executive Vice President (EVP) Controller, the Vice President Group 
Appraisal and Reporting and Deputy Controller and the external 
auditor to attend each meeting. The CEO, the Chair of the Board 
and the Company Secretary may also attend ARC meetings. Other 
members of management attend when requested on specific topics or 
to provide input on more detailed technical matters that may arise. The 
ARC regularly holds private sessions separately with the Chief Internal 
Auditor and the external auditor without members of management, 
except for the Legal Director, being present. Outside of the formal 
ARC meetings, the Chair of the ARC meets regularly with each of the 
following: the CFO, EVP Tax, EVP Controller, the Chief Internal Auditor, 
the external auditor, and the Chief Information Officer.

Committee remit
The roles and responsibilities of the ARC, as set out in its Terms of 
Reference, are reviewed annually (last reviewed in July 2023 and 
a copy of which can be found at shell.com) taking into account 
relevant regulatory changes and recommended best practice. 
The key responsibilities of the ARC include, but are not limited to:

Risk Management and Internal Control
￮ assisting the Board in reviewing the emerging, principal, and other 

significant risks facing the Group;

￮ monitoring the effectiveness of the system of risk management 

and internal control;

Financial Reporting
￮ reviewing the integrity of the financial statements, including annual 

reports, half-year reports, and quarterly financial statements; 
￮ reviewing the potential impacts on the consolidated financial 
statements of the implementation of the Company's strategy, 
climate change and the energy transition;

￮ advising the Board whether, in the ARC's view, the Annual Report 

taken as a whole is fair, balanced and understandable and provides 
the information necessary for shareholders to assess the Company's 
position and performance, business model and strategy;

￮ reviewing and discussing with management the appropriateness 
of judgements involving the application of accounting principles 
and disclosure rules; 

Compliance and Governance
￮ reviewing the functioning of the Shell Global Helpline and reports 

arising from its operation; 

￮ overseeing compliance with applicable legal and regulatory 

requirements, including monitoring ethics and compliance risks; 

Internal Audit
￮ monitoring the qualifications, expertise, resources and independence 

of the internal audit function; 

181

￮ approving the internal audit function's charter and the annual 
internal audit plan to ensure alignment with the key risks of 
the business;

￮ reviewing any significant matters arising from internal audits with 
the Chief Internal Auditor, and the Company's management and 
assessing management's response to internal audit findings and 
control weaknesses as appropriate, including potential 
improvements and agreed actions;

￮ assessing internal audit's performance and effectiveness each year; 

External Audit
￮ reviewing and monitoring the independence and objectivity of the 

external auditor; 

￮ considering the annual external audit plan and approving related 
remuneration, including fees for audit and non-audit services; 

￮ assessing the performance and effectiveness of the external auditor 
and the audit process, including an assessment of the quality of the 
audit; and 

￮ recommending to the Board for it to put to the Company's 

shareholders for approval at the Annual General Meeting ("AGM") 
a resolution to appoint, reappoint, or remove the external auditor.

These responsibilities form the basis of the ARC's annual work plan, 
which is adjusted as necessary throughout the year. In addition, the 
ARC annually identifies certain business and function areas to focus on 
during that year. The focus areas generally encompass aspects of risk 
management and internal control, financial reporting and compliance. 
The ARC is authorised to seek any information it requires from 
management and external parties and to investigate issues or 
concerns as it deems appropriate. The ARC may also obtain 
independent professional advice at the Company's expense.
No such independent advice was requested in 2023. 

The ARC keeps the Board informed of its activities and 
recommendations, and the Chair of the ARC provides an update to the 
Board after every ARC meeting. The ARC discusses with the Board if it 
is not satisfied with or believes that action or improvement is required 
concerning any aspect of financial reporting, risk management and 
internal control, compliance or audit-related activities.

Site visits
During the year, the ARC conducted a site visit to the USA where 
ARC members visited a number of operations including Shell Polymers 
Monaca, the Shell Norco facility, the Shell-operated Vito floating 
production facility in the Gulf of Mexico (virtual visit from New 
Orleans) and the Houston trading floor. Recently, some members 
of the ARC also visited Oman and Qatar. 

Site visits are an important part of the ARC's annual work plan, as they 
provide the opportunity for the ARC to gain a deeper understanding of 
the various businesses and functions at each location, the local external 
and risk environment within which those activities take place and how 
they contribute to Shell achieving its strategic ambitions. In addition to 
in-depth examinations of specific business areas, site visits enable the 
ARC members to interact with a diverse group of employees and learn 
about their experiences, challenges they face and their opportunities 
for career development. The ARC is also briefed on the impact of the 
energy transition at a local level, how risks associated with climate 
change are managed, and the results of the Shell People Survey.

Focus areas for 2023

14%

of ARC time and activities

The ARC met with senior leaders from various business and function 
areas to discuss the adequacy, design and operational effectiveness 
of risk management and controls related to the critical activities carried 
out by their respective business or function. The discussions included 
information on any enhancements to strengthen controls and how 
areas identified for improvement had been addressed; the monitoring 
of activities around key risks; and the steps being taken to identify 
new or emerging areas of risk. 

In addition to the significant accounting and reporting considerations 
discussed on pages 185-186, the business and function areas reviewed 
by the ARC in 2023 included the following:
￮ Trading and Supply – the ARC was provided with updates on 
Trading and Supply activities, particularly in the light of market 
volatility. Topics included transformation programmes, and 
management of credit and market risk. The ARC also visited the 
trading floor in Houston where ARC members received various 
briefings, including in relation to the trading and IT platforms used 
by the Shell Energy Americas Gas & Power Trading team. 

￮ Shell Performance Framework – the ARC reviewed the introduction 
of the Shell Performance Framework which replaced the existing 
Shell Control Framework with effect from July 1, 2023. The new 
framework retains the core strengths of the previous Shell Control 
Framework, while placing greater focus on achieving the right 
commercial outcomes by emphasising the value of using a "whole 
systems" approach to business activities including the role that 
performance culture plays in achieving Shell's objectives. The ARC 
discussed with management how the framework is being applied 
in practice.

￮ Regulatory developments – the ARC was regularly updated with 

respect to regulatory developments and their potential implications 
for Shell, including in relation to the draft Audit Regulation (which 
was subsequently withdrawn) and the Corporate Governance Code 
consultation. The ARC was briefed in relation to UK, US and EU 
sustainability reporting developments, including the CSRD, and their 
implications for Shell, in particular potential assurance requirements.

￮ New business ventures and controls – the ARC met with the 

management of Sprng Energy (which Shell acquired in August 2022) 
and discussed the integration process.

Risk Management
and Internal Control

27%

of ARC time and activities

The ARC assists the Board in reviewing the emerging, principal, and 
other significant risks facing the Group and in fulfilling its responsibilities 
in relation to risk management and internal control. In order to monitor 
the effectiveness of the procedures for internal control over financial 
reporting, compliance and operational matters, the ARC reviews 
reports on risks, controls and assurance, including the annual 
assessment of the system of risk management and internal control. 
The ARC also reviews the Company's evaluation of the internal control 
over financial reporting as required under Section 404 of the Sarbanes-
Oxley Act (SOX 404). The ARC updated the Board on compliance 
with internal controls across the Shell Group and on any major 
matters for which action or improvement was recommended.

The ARC regularly reviews the status of management's SOX 404 
testing of controls and remediation actions to address any identified 
weaknesses. For 2023, these reviews included consideration of how 
the volatile external environment affected the controls and assurance 
landscape, including the financial reporting process. The ARC and 
management discussed the steps taken to maintain an effective 
control environment and to demonstrate "management in control" 
during the year. 

It is important that the ARC monitors and learns about evolving 
external developments in a timely fashion. Accordingly, the ARC 
is regularly briefed on developments in the legal, regulatory and 
financial reporting landscape that could affect the Company.

Throughout the year, the ARC and management discuss Shell's 
overall approach to risk management and internal control, including 
compliance, tax, and information risk management matters and the 
adequacy of disclosure controls and procedures. The ARC receives 
regular reports from the EVP Controller on the status of actions to 
address control weaknesses identified via business control incidents 
and the trends in other measures used to monitor the robustness of 
the risk management framework and internal control systems.

The ARC is also briefed on litigation and other matters (see Note 31 to the "Consolidated 

Financial Statements" on pages 312-314 and "Other regulatory and statutory information" 

on page 226).

In 2023, the ARC dedicated time to the following topics:
￮ Tax risks – In addition to the regular review of Shell's tax provisions, 
management also briefed the ARC regarding developments in the 
external tax landscape, including windfall and minimum taxes and 
how different jurisdictions are seeking to incentivise investment when 
entering new markets and businesses. Management outlined for the 
ARC the steps being taken to manage tax risks and exposures 
arising from differing viewpoints on complex tax laws. 

￮ Information risk management, including cyber security – The ARC 
was briefed in relation to Shell's Information and Risk management 
framework, particularly in the light of the deterioration of the 
external threat environment and evolving global regulatory 
landscape (including SEC cybersecurity disclosure rules). 

￮ Oil and gas reserves control framework – The ARC annually reviews 
the framework that supports Shell's internal reporting and external 
disclosures of oil and gas reserves. The ARC also reviews the 
processes and controls that prevent and/or mitigate the risks of
non-compliance with regulatory reporting requirements. This annual 
review of Shell's oil and gas reserves control framework supports 
the ARC's review of Shell's reported proved oil and gas reserves 
discussed later in this report.

In addition to the above, the ARC also had quarterly discussions with 
the Chief Internal Auditor regarding the Company's risk management 
and internal control system, significant matters arising from the internal 
audit assurance programme and management's response to internal 
audit findings and control weaknesses, including potential 
improvements and agreed actions.

The ARC similarly holds discussions with EY, the external auditor, on a 
quarterly basis regarding how risks to audit quality are addressed, key 
accounting and audit judgements, results from audit procedures and 
management's response to any significant audit findings and any 
material communications between EY and management.

Shell's Annual Report and Accounts for the year ended December 31, 
2022 was selected by the Financial Reporting Council (FRC) for review 
[A] in accordance with Part 2 of the FRC's Corporate Reporting Review 
Operating Procedures. The FRC raised some queries in relation to 
determination of discount rates used in impairment testing and 
provided some observations to take into account when considering 
whether any improvements can be made to future financial reporting. 
Following correspondence, the review was closed on January 19, 
2024 and some disclosure enhancements have been made to the 
Consolidated Financial Statements for the year ended December 31, 
2023. The ARC reviewed Shell's correspondence with the FRC and 
discussed with management the disclosures incorporated in the 
Consolidated Financial Statements in response to the FRC review.
[A] The FRC noted that their review is based solely on the annual report and accounts and 
does not benefit from detailed knowledge of Shell's business or an understanding of the 
underlying transactions entered into, but that it is, however, conducted by staff of the 
FRC who have an understanding of the relevant legal and accounting framework. The FRC 
correspondence provides no assurance that Shell's annual report and accounts for the year 
ended December 31, 2022 are correct in all material respects; the FRC's role is not to 
verify the information provided but to consider compliance with reporting requirements.

The ARC reviewed the Company's 2023 quarterly unaudited interim 
financial statements, half-year report, Annual Report and Form 20-F 
with management and the external auditor. 

Shell uses alternative performance measures (APMs) to provide greater 
insights into its financial and operating results. The ARC regularly 
considers the APMs used in Shell's reporting, the reconciliations to IFRS 
financial statements and explanations for changes from the previous 
quarter and year. The ARC reviews the overall presentation of APMs 
with management to ensure they are not given undue prominence. 
The ARC discusses adjusting items with management including any 
changes to methodology. 

The APMs disclosed by Shell are subject to the same internal control 
process as applied for other financial reporting. 

Fair, balanced and understandable assessment
The ARC advised the Board that in its view the 2023 Annual Report 
including the financial statements for the year ended December 31, 
2023, taken as a whole, is fair, balanced and understandable and 
provides the information necessary for shareholders to assess Shell's 
position and performance, business model and strategy (see "Other 
regulatory and statutory information" on page 227). To arrive at this 
conclusion, the ARC critically assessed drafts of the 2023 Annual 
Report including the financial statements and discussed with 
management the process undertaken to ensure that the relevant 
requirements were met. This process included: verifying that the 
contents of the 2023 Annual Report are consistent with the information 
shared with the Board during the year to support their assessment of 
Shell's position and performance; ensuring that consistent materiality 
thresholds are applied for favourable and unfavourable items; 
considering observations from the external auditor; and receiving 
assurance from the Executive Committee (EC).

Going concern and viability statement
The ARC reviewed the Directors' half-year and full-year statements 
with respect to the going concern basis of accounting. As noted in the 
viability statement, the Board reviews the strategic plan which takes 
account of longer-term forecasts and a wide range of outlooks. Key 
assumptions included: the impact of commodity prices; exchange rates; 
future carbon costs; agreements such as liquid natural gas contract 
renewals; production levels, product demand and schedules of growth 
programmes; the financial framework; Shell's business portfolio 
developments including consideration of the impacts of various possible 
energy pathways and scenarios for changes in societal expectations 
in relation to climate change and Shell's commitment to the Paris 
Agreement goals; the project funnel to support future growth; and using 
severe but possible scenarios to run models of the financial impact if 
certain of Shell's principal risks materialised. The ARC considered the 
mitigating measures and sensitivities that management had applied 
to the modelling of scenarios when evaluating the viability statement. 
The ARC also considered the merits of extending the viability statement 
beyond a period of three years and concluded that the three-year 
period selected by the Board for the review of Shell's prospects, in line 
with the operating plan, remained appropriate. Particularly noting that 
assumptions do go well beyond the three-year period and do take into 
account climate change and energy transition, the ARC supported the 
going concern basis of accounting and the inclusion of Shell's viability 
statement in "Other regulatory and statutory information" on page 220 
and considered such statement to be in line with best practice guidance 
issued by the FRC.

Significant accounting and reporting considerations
The ARC assessed the following significant accounting and reporting areas, including those related to Shell's 2023 Consolidated Financial 
Statements. The ARC was satisfied with how each of the areas below was addressed. As part of this assessment, the ARC received reports, 
requested and received clarifications from management, and sought assurance and received input from the internal and external auditors. 

Issue

Committee activity and outcome

Climate change and energy transition

Risks related to climate change and the energy 
transition are continually monitored to ensure impacts 
are reflected within Shell's financial statements.

The external landscape related to non-financial 
disclosures continues to evolve. In the absence of one 
global standard for climate-related reporting there 
are growing demands from various regulatory and 
voluntary bodies all with their own expectations 
for disclosures.

Impairment and impairment reversals

The carrying amount of an asset should be tested 
for impairment or impairment reversal whenever 
events or changes in circumstances indicate that 
the recoverable amount for that asset may have 
changed, for example if there is a change in the 
outlook for commodity prices or refining margin 
assumptions, or in the event of revisions to future 
activity plans and developments. On classification 
as held for sale, the carrying amounts of property, 
plant and equipment (PP&E) and intangible assets 
must also be reviewed.

The ARC discussed with management key regulatory requirements including (but not limited to) the FRC, 
ISSB, SEC and EU disclosure requirements and their implications for Shell's external disclosures. The ARC 
also received an update on the outcome of management's engagement with Sarasin & Partners and 
Carbon Tracker.

The ARC reviewed Note 4 to the "Consolidated Financial Statements" summarising the key climate risk 
impacts on the Consolidated Financial Statements as well as the impairment sensitivity disclosures using 
price outlooks based on different climate change scenarios, including external scenarios.

See Note 4 to the "Consolidated Financial Statements" on pages 259-269.

The ARC was briefed on the non-financial reporting external landscape developments and regulatory 
requirements. In this connection, the ARC considered the potential implications required for Shell's external 
disclosures going forward. The ARC reviewed the TCFD disclosure in the "Our journey to net zero" section, 
including covering aspects of ETS24, and other non-financial disclosures as part of the Annual Report review 
and was briefed on the EU Taxonomy voluntary disclosures included as supplementary information to the 
Annual Report.

Updates regarding climate change and energy transition have been included in the risk factors section on 
page 15.

The ARC reviewed the impairment assessments that were performed each quarter, and the methodology 
applied in conducting impairment assessments.

The ARC considered increases in global risk-free interest rates, alongside other input assumptions, in 
assessing market expectations of the expected rate of return on various assets. As a result, weighted 
average cost of capital ("WACC") assumptions have been updated with effect from June 2023, reflecting 
management's conclusion that a structural increase in expected rates of return could be observed. This 
resulted in an increase in the discount rate applied for impairment testing purposes and a trigger for 
impairment assessment. The ARC reviewed the outcome of this assessment and the resulting impairment 
which has been recognised in the 2023 Consolidated Financial Statements. The ARC also reviewed 
the outcomes of periodic reassessments of the WACC during the remainder of the year, including 
management's conclusion on the reasonability of the discount rate applied as at December 31, 2023. 

The ARC considered the updated oil and gas price outlooks against market developments and benchmarks. 
The 2023 commodity price outlook was reassessed to determine whether revised price premises would 
result in a trigger for impairment or impairment reversal. Based on the analysis performed, no triggers 
were identified.

The ARC also reviewed other circumstances that may indicate that the recoverable amount of assets have 
changed, such as those related to revision of future plans and developments, exploration and evaluation 
assets, held-for-sale classification for asset disposals and margin assumptions. The ARC also reviewed the 
outcomes of goodwill testing, including for new acquisitions. 

See Notes 2, 10, 11 and 12 to the "Consolidated Financial Statements" on pages 249-259, 278, 279-280 
and 281-283.

Gas & Power markets and derivatives accounting

External events during the year, such as the Russia-
Ukraine war and uncertainties over Russian gas 
supplies, affected trading activities. The impacts on 
financial outcomes of Integrated Gas and Renewable 
and Energy Solutions included, for example, 
significant derivatives movements.

The ARC reviewed Trading and Supply activities and developments, including detailed analysis of the 
trading strategies employed, their impact on financial metrics, and the associated accounting treatment 
applied.

The ARC reviewed the impacts of volatile gas and power markets including the impact on mark-to-
market valuation of derivatives, income for the period and adjusted earnings, as well as the resulting 
cash flow movements.

The ARC received updates on the enhancement of reporting processes within Trading and Supply, with 
a focus on the accuracy and efficacy of these processes.

See Note 25 to the "Consolidated Financial Statements" on pages 302-308.

Taxation

Committee activity and outcome

The determination of tax assets and liabilities requires 
the application of judgement as to the ultimate 
outcome, which can change over time. In particular, 
uncertain tax treatments require management to assess 
the more-likely-than- not outcome, and the recognition 
of deferred tax assets requires management to make 
assumptions regarding future profitability. As a result, 
they are inherently uncertain.

The ARC considered the uncertain tax positions and discussed management's assumptions of future 
taxable profits. The ARC also evaluated the appropriateness of the recognition of deferred tax assets 
and tax liabilities. The ARC recognises that assumptions regarding future taxable profits are inherently 
uncertain because they involve assessing factors such as the potential impacts of climate change and 
the energy transition. The ARC deemed the assessments of uncertain tax exposures and the recognition 
of deferred tax assets and tax liabilities to be reasonable.

The ARC also reviewed the impact of IAS 12 amendments that required a change to the Group's deferred 
tax treatment of decommissioning and restoration (D&R) obligations.

See Notes 2 and 22 to the "Consolidated Financial Statements" on pages 249-259 and 292-294.

Portfolio activities 

In implementing the Powering Progress strategy, several 
portfolio developments occurred in 2023. 

Provisions

Provisions, including decommissioning and restoration 
provisions, are one of the main components of the 
balance sheet liabilities. The quantification of these 
provisions requires judgements on input parameters 
which include, but are not limited to, discount rates and 
estimated future decommissioning and restoration costs.

The ARC discussed the accounting implications of these developments and the recognition of: (i) 
decommissioning and restoration provisions; (ii) deferred tax balances; (iii) impairment; and (iv) assets 
held for sale. The ARC also considered complex accounting treatments arising from acquisitions and 
divestments, including the acquisition of Nature Energy Biogas. 

See Notes 2 and 24 to the "Consolidated Financial Statements" on pages 249-259 and 301-302.

The ARC reviewed provisions, including onerous contracts and litigation. The ARC also reviewed 
the input parameter assumptions and judgements used in arriving at the decommissioning and 
restoration provisions. 

The discount rate is reviewed regularly and the ARC considered the change in discount rate to be applied 
prospectively from the fourth quarter 2023, following an observable increase in US Treasury yields. The 
impact of the change in discount rate on non-current decommissioning and other provisions was disclosed 
in the fourth quarter 2023 quarterly results announcement.

The ARC has continued to receive updates on the withdrawal from Russian oil and gas activities 
throughout 2023 including implications for the financial statements.

Retirement benefit obligations

Retirement benefits are an important component 
of both assets and liabilities on the balance sheet. 
The quantification of these assets and liabilities requires 
judgements on input parameters which include, but are 
not limited to, actuarial assumptions and discount rates.

The ARC reviewed the management of risks in relation to retirement benefits in 2023, including financial, 
operational, and regulatory developments. The ARC reviewed the key assumptions (including discount 
rates and inflation) and sensitivities as part of the Annual Report review and the enhanced disclosures 
made in this Report.

See Note 23 to the "Consolidated Financial Statements" on pages 294-300.

Other matters
The ARC reviewed: the year-end reported proved oil and gas reserves, including management judgements and adjustments made to reflect 
changes in geological, technical, contractual and economic information (including yearly average price assumptions) and the effectiveness of 
financial controls. An explanation of the Group's accounting policies is provided on pages 249-259.

Ethics and compliance 
In 2023, the ARC received an update from the Chief Ethics and 
Compliance Officer on how a range of macro factors and external 
trends and developments were affecting conduct risk at Shell. The Chief 
Ethics and Compliance Officer summarised the specific emerging ethics 
and compliance risks, with a particular focus on trade compliance and 
data privacy, and management's actions to manage and mitigate 
them. The Chief Ethics and Compliance Officer briefed the ARC 
on communications to staff from both senior leaders and mid-level 
management reinforcing the importance of adherence to and affirming 
Shell's commitment to the Ethics and Compliance framework and 
Code of Conduct throughout the year.

As part of the annual assessment of the system of risk management 
and internal control, the ARC discussed with the Chief Ethics and 
Compliance Officer their annual report on compliance matters. The 
report included an overview of the effectiveness of the Shell ethics and 
compliance programme in managing ethics and compliance risk in 
Shell's business activities, regulatory developments and compliance 
activities. The ARC also reviewed investigations of cases involving 
ethics and compliance concerns. The ARC discussed management's 
findings in such cases to satisfy itself that a rigorous process had been 
followed, with appropriate disciplinary action being taken where 
necessary, and that management had embedded learnings into 
Shell's systems and controls. 

Whistleblowing investigations
The ARC is responsible for establishing and monitoring the 
implementation of procedures for the receipt, retention, investigation 
and follow-up actions of complaints received, including those from the 
Shell Global Helpline. The ARC reviewed whistleblowing reports and 
internal audit reports and considered management's responses to the 
findings in these reports. In 2023, 2,134 allegations and inquiries were 

187
187

Shell Annual Report and Accounts 2023

made through the Shell Global Helpline (2022: 1,790), of which 
approximately 41% were submitted anonymously (2022: 41%). In 
2023, a total of 470 investigations were closed (2022: 412), of which 
54% were found to have some level of substantiation (2022: 44%) and 
were primarily in the areas involving harassment, conflicts of interest 
and protection of assets. 

Regulatory developments
The ARC was briefed on regulatory developments in areas including:
(i) sustainability and climate-related disclosures (in particular 
management's responses to proposals from the International 
Sustainability Standards Board and FRC/EU disclosure requirements); 
(ii) the Audit Committees and the External Audit: Minimum Standard 
and the proposed new Audit Regulation (which was subsequently 
withdrawn); (iii) accounting and reporting developments; (iv) 
environmental liabilities; and (v) treasury activities. In May 2023, 
the FRC launched a consultation in relation to the UK Corporate 
Governance Code and subsequently issued a revised version in 
January 2024. The ARC and management discussed the consultation 
proposals, including potential implications for the Company, the Board 
and the ARC. The ARC reviewed management's proposed response to 
the consultation and supported the response.

ARC annual evaluation 
The ARC undertakes an annual evaluation of its performance and 
effectiveness. This year the ARC's performance evaluation was 
facilitated by the Company Secretary. Each ARC member responded to 
a confidential anonymised questionnaire about the ARC's performance 
covering questions on: the management of the ARC in areas such as 
the annual cycle of work and the agenda for meetings; the quality of 
the information provided to the ARC; the effectiveness of the ARC's 
oversight in areas such as financial reporting, risk management policies 
and practices and internal controls, and the work of internal and 
external audit; rating the ARC's performance in reviewing and 
assessing significant accounting/reporting issues; and how to improve 
the ARC's performance. Progress against the ambitions identified 
during the 2022 evaluation is provided in the Board evaluation section 
on page 166. Three themes from the 2023 evaluation process were 
identified as areas of focus for 2024, including risk management 
and presentation; structure of internal audit updates and further 
enhancement of pre-read for ARC meetings. The ARC concluded that 
its performance in 2023 had been effective and that it had fulfilled 
its role in accordance with its Terms of Reference. 

In preparing its work plan for 2024, the ARC has included the 
following focus areas in addition to the standing items: information 
risk management, including cyber security; regulatory developments, 
mainly those in relation to climate change and the energy transition, 
including non-financial reporting requirements and preparation for 
reporting under the CSRD and ISSB disclosure requirements; Trading 
and Supply; Shell Performance Framework; and external audit tender.

Each quarter, the ARC discusses with the Chief Internal Auditor 
the Company's risk management and internal control system, any 
significant matters arising from the internal audit assurance programme 
and management's response to significant audit findings and notable 
control weaknesses, including planned improvements and agreed 
actions. The ARC also holds private sessions separately with the Chief 
Internal Auditor without members of management, except for the Legal 
Director, being present. The ARC's time for these activities is included in 
Risk Management and Internal Control described earlier in this report. 
Outside of the formal ARC meetings, the Chair of the ARC meets 
regularly with the Chief Internal Auditor.

Internal audit remit
The internal audit function is an independent assurance function 
which supports Shell's continuous efforts to improve its overall control 
framework. The internal audit function contributes to the maintenance 
of a systematic and disciplined approach to evaluate and improve the 
design and effectiveness of Shell's risk management, and control and 
governance processes. The primary role of the internal audit function's 
assurance and investigation activities is to safeguard value by 
protecting Shell's assets, reputation and sustainability in relation 
to the organisation's defined goals and objectives. 

The ARC defines the responsibility and scope of the internal audit 
function and approves its annual plan. The Chief Internal Auditor 
reports functionally to the Chair of the ARC and administratively 
to the Chief Financial Officer. The Chair of the ARC approves, in 
consultation with the Chief Financial Officer, all decisions regarding 
the performance evaluation, appointment or removal of the Chief 
Internal Auditor. A new Chief Internal Auditor was appointed 
with effect from August 2023.

Annual internal audit plan and assessment of internal 
audit's effectiveness
The ARC considered and approved the internal audit function's annual 
audit plan, including focus areas for 2023 consisting of:
￮ talent and capability (professional audit development and technical 

capabilities); 

￮ quality (developing first-line staff competence and clarity on self-

verification and supervisory controls); 

￮ alignment (improved integration of risk management and alignment 

of assurance processes across Shell); and 

￮ engagement (mainly in the area of keeping staff and Shell 

stakeholders engaged and informed on effective risk management 
and internal control). 

The Chief Internal Auditor updated the ARC quarterly on the approved 
2023 internal audit plan and discussed whether the plan remained 
fit for purpose in addressing the most critical areas of risk. The ARC 
assessed the performance of the internal audit function as effective. 
The ARC also assessed the performance of the Chief Internal Auditor 
as effective.

The Chief Internal Auditor periodically assesses whether the purpose, 
authority and responsibilities of the internal audit function continue 
to enable it to accomplish its objectives. The results of this periodic 
assessment are communicated to the EC and the ARC. The Chief 
Internal Auditor also confirms to the ARC the continued validity of 
the charter of the internal audit function or puts forward proposals 
for updates to it. The Chief Internal Auditor maintains an internal 
quality assurance and improvement programme, including an annual 
assessment of the effectiveness and efficiency of the internal audit 
function's activities and evaluations of conformance with the standards 
of the Chartered Institute of Internal Auditors (CIIA). The Chief Internal 
Auditor discusses the results of this annual assessment with the EC and 
the ARC. At least every five years, the effectiveness and quality of the 
internal audit function are independently assessed externally, and the 
Chief Internal Auditor reviews the report with the EC and the ARC. 
An independent assessment of the internal audit was conducted at the 
end of 2022, following up on the previous review in 2018. The 2022 
assessment confirmed that the internal audit conformed with the CIIA 
standards and the 2020 Internal Audit code of practice and identified 
some opportunities for further improvement. The next external 
assessment is planned to take place in 2027.

Annual external audit plan and assessment of external 
audit's effectiveness
EY reviewed with the ARC its audit strategy, scope and plan for 
the 2023 audit, highlighting areas which would receive special 
consideration. In particular, the ARC and EY discussed how the 
audit would take into consideration risks associated with: 
￮ Trading and Supply deal complexity; 
￮ Revenue recognition fraud risk (unauthorised trading and 

management override);

￮ Climate change and the energy transition; 
￮ Oil and gas reserves;
￮ Impairment assessments; 
￮ Decommissioning and restoration obligations;
￮ Exploration assets;
￮ Goodwill recoverability;
￮ Pensions; and
￮ Taxation, specifically deferred tax assets and uncertain 

tax treatments. 

EY defines significant audit risks as those areas where there is a higher 
likelihood of a material error and which therefore require special audit 
attention. In EY's view, the significant audit risks are Trading and Supply 
deal complexity and the risk of unauthorised trading or 
management override.

The ARC considered the annual audit plan, which included assessing 
whether the planned materiality levels and proposed resources to 
execute the audit plan were consistent with the scope of the audit.

EY regularly updated the ARC on the status of its procedures and 
preliminary findings, providing an opportunity for the ARC to monitor the 
execution and results of the audit. The ARC and EY discussed how risks 
to audit quality were addressed, key accounting and audit judgements, 
material communications between EY and management and any issues 
arising from them. At least quarterly, the ARC met privately with EY 
representatives without management (except for the Legal Director) being

Shell Annual Report and Accounts 2023

As part of its oversight of the external auditor, the ARC annually 
assesses the performance and effectiveness of the external auditor and 
the audit process. This includes assessing the quality of the audit, how 
the auditor handled key judgements, and the auditor's response to the 
ARC's questions. The assessment also involves the ARC evaluating the 
objectivity and independence of EY and the quality and effectiveness 
of the external audit process. 

The ARC's evaluation of the performance and effectiveness of the 
external auditor and the audit process includes the following key 
criteria:
￮ professionalism, competence, integrity and objectivity during the 

audit, including handling of areas involving judgement and 
estimates; 

￮ EY's quality assurance procedures and internal quality control 

procedures; 

￮ audit quality priorities and actions taken as part of maintaining 

a sustainable audit quality programme;

￮ constructive challenge of management and key judgements; 
￮ efficiency, covering aspects such as service level and innovation 

in the audit process, use of data analytical and digital audit tools, 
and opportunities for improvement; 
￮ quality of the audit team's leadership;
￮ the most recent EY Transparency Report; 
￮ thought leadership and actions, especially in the areas of climate 

change; and 

￮ compliance with relevant legislative, regulatory and professional 

requirements.

In addition to reflecting on its own experiences, including interactions 
with the external auditor throughout the year, the ARC considered 
and discussed the results of management's internal survey relating 
to EY's performance over the financial year 2023, which reflected 
a broadly comparable performance to 2022 and the views and 
recommendations from management and the Chief Internal Auditor. 
The ARC also considered the FRC Audit Quality Review ("AQR") team's 
inspection of EY's audit of the financial statements for the year ended 
December 31, 2022.

As part of the current assessment of effectiveness, the ARC has taken 
into consideration the guidance issued by the FRC, including the 
guidance on oversight of the external audit set out in "Audit 
Committees and the External Auditor: Minimum Standard".

Taking into account the above, the ARC is satisfied that EY continued to 
provide a high-quality and effective audit in its eighth year as auditor and 
maintained its objectivity, integrity and impartiality. As required under UK 
and US auditing standards, the ARC received a letter on independence-
related matters from EY. EY also informed the ARC in writing of any 
significant relationships and matters that may reasonably be thought to 
affect its objectivity and independence. The ARC and EY discussed such 
relationships and matters and determined that they did not impair EY's 
objectivity, integrity and impartiality.

External Auditor
continued

During 2023, EY's audit of Shell's Consolidated Financial Statements 
for the financial year ended December 31, 2022 was selected for 
inspection by the AQR team of the FRC. Following the AQR team's 
inspection of EY's audit of the financial statements for the year ended 
December 31, 2022, the FRC wrote to the Chair of the ARC setting out 
the scope of its inspection, its audit quality assessment, good practice, 
and other findings. The inspection report was shared with all ARC 
members and discussed at an ARC meeting in December 2023. 
The ARC noted the inspection did not raise any key findings 
and highlighted five audit areas of good practice. 

Audit Committees and the External Audit: 
Minimum Standard
In May 2023, the FRC published the Audit Committees and the 
External Audit: Minimum Standard. This Audit and Risk Committee 
Report describes how the ARC has complied, to the extent applicable, 
with the provisions of the Minimum Standard during the year (in 
particular the "External Auditor" section of this report).

Reappointment and external audit tender 
The ARC is responsible for considering whether there should be a 
rotation of the independent registered public accounting firm in order 
to ensure continuing auditor quality and/or independence, including 
consideration of the advisability and potential impact of conducting 
a tender process for the appointment of a different independent 
public accounting firm. The ARC is also responsible for making 
a recommendation to the Board, for it to put to the Company's 
shareholders for approval in the General Meeting, on the 
appointment, reappointment, or removal of the external auditor.

At the AGM in May 2023, the shareholders approved a resolution to 
reappoint EY as external auditor until the conclusion of the next AGM. EY 
was first appointed at the AGM in May 2016 after a competitive tender 
process. The lead audit partner, Gary Donald, has been in post since the 
start of the 2021 audit. Under UK legal requirements, the Company may 
retain EY as its external auditor for 20 years. For the 2023 financial year, 
the Company has complied with The Statutory Audit Services for Large 
Companies Market Investigation (Mandatory Use of Competitive Tender 
Processes and Audit Committee Responsibilities) Order 2014. 

In its oversight of the external audit, the ARC considered whether it would 
be appropriate to conduct an audit tender in respect of the 2024 audit.

The ARC reflected on: 
￮ its continued satisfaction with the quality and independence

of EY's audit; 

￮ any new external auditor would need a transition period to develop 

sufficient understanding of the business given Shell's size and complexity; 
￮ frequent changes of external auditor would be inefficient and could 

lead to increased risk and the loss of cumulative knowledge; 

￮ a change in auditor would be expected to have a significant impact 

on Shell, including on the Finance function; and 

￮ any change in auditor should be scheduled to limit operational 

disruption. 

The ARC also considered EY's leadership and activities in the area 
of climate change. 

After due consideration the ARC determined that it would not be 
appropriate to re-tender for the external audit at this time. The ARC has 
recommended to the Board that at the 2024 AGM the Board should 
propose that EY be reappointed as the external auditor of the Company for 
the year ending December 31, 2024. The ARC's recommendation is free 
from third-party influence and there are no contractual obligations that 
restrict the ARC's ability to make such a recommendation.

Shell Annual Report and Accounts 2023

The ARC acknowledges the UK legal requirements relating to mandatory 
audit rotation (maximum 20-year engagement) and audit tendering (with 
a requirement to undertake a formal process after ten years). As EY was 
appointed in 2016 after a competitive tender process, the Company 
is required to tender for the audit no later than the financial year 
commencing January 1, 2026. During 2023, the ARC considered the 
proposed approach to the Group audit tender and the tender process 
was commenced, with a view to reaching a conclusion before the end 
of 2024. The ARC believes that this timeline for the re-tender is in the 
best interests of shareholders in order to prepare for orderly transition 
in the event that a new audit firm is selected. In conducting the tender 
process, the ARC will consider insofar as practical the guidance on 
tendering set out in the FRC's "Audit Committees and the External 
Auditor: Minimum Standard".

Non-audit services
The ARC maintains an auditor independence policy (AIP) in respect 
of the provision of services by the external auditor. Under the AIP, 
the ARC will only approve services to be carried out by the external 
auditor or its affiliates where such services do not present a conflict 
of interest risk in fact or in appearance. The ARC regularly reviews 
this policy for necessary changes in response to changes in related 
standards and regulatory requirements. 

This policy is designed to safeguard auditor objectivity and 
independence. It addresses the provision of audit services, audit-related 
services and other non-audit services and stipulates which services 
require specific prior approval by the ARC. 

The policy also defines prohibited services in line with applicable rules 
and regulations. Our external auditors are not allowed to provide 
prohibited services due to independence concerns. For certain non-
prohibited services, because of the knowledge and experience of the 
external auditor and/or for reasons of confidentiality, it may be more 
efficient or prudent for the external auditor to provide such services.

The ARC reviews quarterly reports from management on the audit and 
non-audit services reported in accordance with the policy or for which 
specific prior approval from the ARC is being sought. Under the AIP, no 
prior approval by the ARC is required for any additional audit service 
contract not individually exceeding $500,000. All non-audit services 
where the fee for an individual contract exceeds $100,000, including 
audit-related services, require individual prior approval by the ARC. 
For audit or non-audit service contracts that do not exceed the relevant 
threshold, the matter is approved by management by delegated 
authority from the ARC and is subsequently presented for approval by 
the ARC. The ARC is mindful of the overall proportion of fees for audit 
and non-audit services in determining whether to approve such services.

The scope of the non-audit services contracted with the external 
auditor in 2023 consisted mainly of interim reviews and other audit-
related assurance services. The associated compensation for these 
audit-related services and other non-audit services amounted to 
5% and 3%, respectively, of the external auditor's audit and audit-
related remuneration.

Fees
After due consideration, the ARC approved the auditor's remuneration, 
satisfying itself that the level of fees payable in respect of the audit and 
non-audit services provided was appropriate and that an effective, 
high-quality audit could be conducted for such fees.

see Note 34 to the "Consolidated Financial Statements" on page 316 provides details of the 

auditor's remuneration.

Shell Annual Report and Accounts 2023 
Dear Shareholders, 
As always, the remuneration decisions by the Remuneration Committee 
(REMCO) for 2023 have been framed by the Group's broader 
performance context.

Wael Sawan became Chief Executive Officer (CEO) on January 1, 
2023. Very soon after, he streamlined the EC to further simplify the 
organisation as we seek to create more value with less emissions, 
and deliver increased shareholder returns through a balanced 
energy transition.

Shell delivered another set of strong financial results in 2023, despite 
lower commodity prices, with income of $19.6 billion, cash flow 
from operations (CFFO) of $54.2 billion, and free cash flow* of 
$36.5 billion. We delivered our second-highest Adjusted Earnings 
in a decade, after a record last year. This shows strong management 
performance, improved operational delivery and the resilience of our 
portfolio, despite external uncertainty and volatility. We were guided 
by our principles of performance, discipline and simplification as we 
reduced our net debt* to $43.5 billion, around half of what it was in 
2019, and as we continued to demonstrate prudence in our capital 
expenditure and reduction in structural costs.

Our financial results in 2023 were underpinned by strong operational 
performance across our portfolio. In the Gulf of Mexico, turnaround 
operations at Appomattox, Perdido and Olympus were safely 
completed ahead of schedule and below budget. In the second 
quarter, Prelude delivered its highest quarterly production since its
start-up in 2018. In December 2023, Shell and Eneco's CrossWind 
joint venture completed construction of the Hollandse Kust (Noord) 
wind farm. Capacity is anticipated to increase in the coming months 
to eventually reach 3.3 TWh a year, which is around 3% of the 
Netherlands' total demand for electricity. In Shenzhen, China, together 
with BYD, we have opened Shell's largest global charging site for 
electric vehicles, serving more than 3,300 customers a day. We are 
also making good progress across the targets outlined at Capital 
Markets Day (CMD) in June. Our strong performance in 2023 has 
allowed us to deliver shareholder distributions*of $23 billion for the 
year, exceeding the 30-40% of CFFO range set out at CMD 2023.

During the year, we reviewed our approach to considering fatalities, 
in order to support consistent and fair judgment of safety performance 
over time. I am saddened that we experienced three tragic incidents 
in 2023 at Shell-operated ventures, which resulted in four recordable 
fatalities that year. We reflected on these and Shell's broader safety 
performance, as we always do, when we determined the final pay 
outcomes for 2023, and we applied downward discretion to the 
annual bonus outcome. A fourth incident in late 2023 resulted in a 
further fatality in 2024. This will be assessed as part of the REMCO's 
considerations of safety performance outcomes for 2024. Further 
information is on page 197.

* Non-GAAP measure (see page 365).

Governance
Directors' Remuneration Report

“2023 was again a year
of strong leadership, with a 
renewed focus on performance, 
discipline, and simplification.”

This Report
The Directors' Remuneration Report for 2023 has been prepared 
in accordance with relevant UK corporate governance and legal 
requirements, in particular Schedule 8 of The Large and Medium-sized 
Companies and Groups (Accounts and Reports) Regulations 2008 
(as amended). The Board has approved this report.

As in previous years, this report is split into three sections: this 
Chair's letter, the Annual Report on Remuneration, and the Directors' 
Remuneration Policy (Policy). The Policy was last approved by 
shareholders at the 2023 AGM with 94.6% support. No changes are 
being proposed to the Policy this year, though it is reproduced in full 
on pages 211-218 for ease of reference and in order to provide context 
to the decisions taken by the Remuneration Committee (REMCO) 
during the year.

2023 remuneration outcomes
2023 annual bonus
The overall mathematical outcome of the annual bonus scorecard 
was above target at 1.58. The REMCO carefully considered the tragic 
incidents which resulted in fatalities in 2023. One contractor colleague 
in Malaysia died during scaffolding work and one in the Philippines 
died after a fall from height. In Nigeria, an armed ambush resulted in 
the death of two contractor colleagues, as well as four government 
agents. After careful consideration of the factors leading to the events 
and reflection on Shell's overall performance in 2023, including overall 
safety performance and the record performance in process safety, the 
REMCO used downward discretion to determine a final bonus outcome 
for Executive Directors of 1.55.

See page 198 for the complete scorecard with all targets, ranges and weightings, and a 

detailed discussion of performance against targets.

Vesting of the 2021 LTIP awards
Overall, the mathematical outcome of the Long-term Incentive Plan 
(LTIP) was 94% of target. The REMCO was satisfied that no windfall 
gain had arisen. The REMCO also believes the vesting outcome to 
be representative of Shell's performance over the period.

See page 199 for full details of LTIP targets and weightings, and a discussion of performance 

against targets. 

Finalising the 2023 pay outcomes 
In finalising pay outcomes, the REMCO considered Shell's wider 
performance and context during 2023 and over the LTIP performance 
period, paying particular attention to:
￮ The strong financial performance in 2023, with CFFO of 

$54.2 billion and free cash flow* (FCF) of $36.5 billion, which has 
enabled Shell to invest in our businesses, reduce debt and enhance 
shareholder distributions;

￮ The shareholder experience, including total shareholder 

distributions* of $23 billion in 2023 and $58 billion over the LTIP 
performance period, and absolute and relative total shareholder 
return (TSR) performance over the same periods;

￮ Shell's performance beyond the formulaic outcomes of the variable 

pay structures, including safety (and fatalities), reputation, ethics and 
compliance, and feedback from the Audit and Risk Committee (ARC) 
and the Sustainability Committee (SUSCO);

￮ Shareholders' views on remuneration matters, as shared with the 

REMCO during engagements in March 2023; 

￮ The employee experience, where the REMCO noted the above-

target vesting outcome for 2023 under the Performance Share Plan 
(PSP), used to make discretionary share awards below Senior 
Executive level, and the average employee salary increases; 

￮ Comparisons between the 2023 outcomes and historical 

remuneration levels; and

￮ The alignment of the 10-year average outcomes of the annual 

bonus scorecard (1.11) and LTIP (91% of target) to the target level, 
demonstrating the effective design of the structures and the integrity 
of the target-setting process.

This resulted in a single figure outcome of £7.9 million for the CEO and 
£3.9 million for the CFO, noting that both individuals' 2021 LTIP awards 
were made prior to their appointment to the Board. The REMCO was 
satisfied that the shareholder-approved Remuneration Policy had operated 
as intended, and these outcomes were appropriate in the context of 
Company performance and the target pay opportunity.

Directors' Remuneration Report continued

2024 remuneration
The 2023 Remuneration Policy was submitted to shareholders at 
the 2023 AGM, and received strong support. I would like to thank 
shareholders for their valued input and engagement prior to the AGM. 
The REMCO has appreciated the diverse range of views from our 
shareholders and they were invaluable in shaping our Remuneration 
Policy and design.

2024 salaries
Effective January 1, 2024, Wael Sawan and Sinead Gorman received 
a salary increase of 3.9% and their salaries for 2024 are £1,455,000 
and £961,000, respectively. In reviewing their salaries, the REMCO 
considered carefully the external environment, including the increases 
provided to the Shell workforce in the key markets of the UK (4.5%), 
the USA (3.1%), and the Netherlands (4.3%). The Executive Directors' 
increases for 2024 were positioned below the average UK increase 
and in line with the average increases across the key markets. The 
REMCO also recognised the multiplier effect on total remuneration.

2024 annual bonus
The REMCO is satisfied that the current mix of financial and non-
financial measures remains well-aligned with our strategic and 
operational priorities. The "Shell's journey in the energy transition" 
measure has been updated for Energy Transition Strategy 2024 
(ETS24). See section below for further details.

In the interest of simplification and alignment of the two Executive 
Directors in delivering the operating plan (which is the primary focus 
of the annual bonus), the CFO's target bonus will be aligned to that 
of the CEO from 2024, at 125% of salary. This is within the confines 
of the existing shareholder-approved Remuneration Policy.

2024 LTIP performance conditions 
The performance conditions and weightings will be unchanged for the 
2024 LTIP awards. The measures will be cash generation, TSR, organic 
free cash flow*(OFCF) and "Shell's journey in the energy transition", 
and they will be weighted equally. Cash generation and TSR 
performance will be measured against the energy majors as before, 
and OFCF will be measured on an absolute basis against annual 
operating plans. The "Shell's journey in the energy transition" 
performance condition has been updated for ETS24. See section 
below for further details.

* Non-GAAP measure (see page 365).

"Shell's journey in the energy transition" in variable 
remuneration
The achievement of Shell's plans for the energy transition has been 
linked to the annual bonus and LTIP for a number of years with "Shell's 
journey in the energy transition" currently forming 15% of the annual 
bonus scorecard and 25% of the LTIP. These weightings will continue 
in 2024 and the REMCO has adjusted the performance metrics in light 
of ETS24, continuing to align to Shell's strategic objective of becoming 
a net-zero emissions business by 2050, supporting a balanced energy 
transition by responsibly delivering the oil and gas people need today, 
while helping to build the clean energy system of the future.

Shell's strategy sets out its objectives for reducing operational emissions 
while supporting our customers to reduce their emissions. Shell's plans 
cover all its businesses: growing its world-leading LNG business; 
reducing emissions from oil and gas production; and growing sales of 
low-carbon products. These objectives are reflected in the scorecard, 
where a measure of LNG volumes, focussing on the operational 
performance of the LNG business, will be introduced for 2024. LNG is 
a critical fuel for the energy transition. It provides energy security and 
flexibility, and is the lowest-carbon fossil fuel, producing around 50% 
less carbon emissions than coal when used to generate electricity. 
Shell's intent is to grow LNG and the REMCO will reflect this by 
measuring LNG liquefaction volumes. The existing GHG abatement 
metric, targeting the operational actions Shell can take to reduce 
emissions in support of our target to halve Scope 1 and 2 emissions 
under our operational control by 2030 on a net basis (compared with 
2016 baseline), is retained. Our ambitions to develop new lower-
carbon offerings for our customers is represented by the existing 
electric vehicle charge point rollout measure, aligning to Shell's plan to 
become a global leader in public charging for electric vehicles.

In the LTIP, the REMCO's determination of the extent to which awards 
will vest will be based on the REMCO's holistic assessment of progress 
towards reducing Shell's operational emissions and supporting our 
customers to reduce their emissions. This will be based on our journey to 
net-zero climate targets for our own operations, progress in 
developments that support the energy transition to 2030 and beyond, 
such as the development of our Power business (including renewables), 
lower-carbon LNG, biofuels, advanced biofuels, electric vehicle charging, 
hydrogen, and carbon, capture and storage (CCS). We will also take 
into account progress towards achieving a 15-20% reduction in net 
carbon intensity (NCI) by 2030 (compared with 2016 baseline) and a 
15-20% reduction in customer emissions from the use of our oil products 
by 2030 (compared with 2021 baseline), as well as any other factors the 
REMCO may consider relevant.

Looking ahead
I hope that you find this report presents a clear account of the 
REMCO's decisions for the year. I look forward to continuing 
to engage with our shareholders in the coming months.

policies, and how pay and benefits align with culture. In exercising 
its responsibilities, the REMCO takes into account a variety of 
stakeholder considerations.

The REMCO operates within its Terms of Reference, which are 
reviewed annually (last reviewed in July 2023), and are available 
on shell.com.

Advice from within Shell was provided by:
￮ Chief Executive Officer (CEO);
￮ Chief Human Resources and Corporate Officer and Secretary

to the REMCO; and 

￮ Executive Vice President Performance and Reward.

The Chair of the Board was consulted on remuneration proposals 
affecting the CEO. The CEO was consulted on proposals relating

[A] Wael Sawan was appointed CEO and a Board Director effective January 1, 2023.
[B] Sinead Gorman was appointed CFO and a Board Director effective April 1, 2022. Accordingly, her remuneration for 2022 relates to the period April 1 to December 31, 2022. See 2022 

Directors' Remuneration Report for further details.

[C] Base salary: Wael Sawan's base salary was set at £1,400,000 on his appointment to the Board. Sinead Gorman's base salary for 2023 was set at £925,000 (+2.8% from 2022).
[D] Benefits: in respect of 2023, Wael Sawan's benefits included time-limited relocation-related costs (£334,778), car allowance (£29,890), and gross-up costs (£9,829). Sinead Gorman's 

benefits included time-limited relocation-related costs (£128,319), car allowance (£29,890), and gross-up costs (£36,082).
[E] Pension: Wael Sawan and Sinead Gorman received cash in lieu of pension contributions equal to 20% of base salary in 2023.
[F] Annual bonus: the full value of the bonus in respect of performance in 2023, comprising both the 50% delivered in cash and 50% bonus delivered in shares. For 2024, the market price of 

shares on February 26, 2024 for London-listed shares (£24.94) was used to determine the number of shares delivered, resulting in 28,796 ordinary shares for Wael Sawan and 18,276 
ordinary shares for Sinead Gorman, net of tax.

[G] LTIP: the amounts reported for 2023 relate to the 2021 LTIP award, which vested on March 7, 2024, at the market price of €29.27 and £24.75 for Amsterdam-listed and London-listed 

ordinary shares, respectively. The value in respect of the LTIP is calculated as the product of: (i) the number of shares of the original award multiplied by the vesting percentage, plus accrued 
dividend shares, and (ii) the market price of ordinary shares at the vesting date. The market price of the Amsterdam-listed shares is converted into GBP using the exchange rate on the vesting 
date. Share price appreciation accounted for €1,026,217 for Wael Sawan and £324,230 for Sinead Gorman. The amounts shown for Wael Sawan and Sinead Gorman both relate to 
awards made prior to their appointment to the Board, and are shown here for transparency. The performance measures are the same as those applying to LTIP awards made to Executive 
Directors.

[H] Incremental remuneration in respect of 2022 for services as CEO Designate, in anticipation of becoming CEO in 2023. Wael Sawan did not perform the role of CEO during the CEO 

Designate time period. Amount includes pro rata salary and performance bonus, plus time-limited relocation-related costs.

Operational excellence (35%): a key underpin of our performance, 
operational excellence ensures we deliver for our customers and drive 
financial performance:
￮ Asset management excellence: Upstream controllable availability 
was outstanding with excellent performance in Gulf of Mexico 
(GOM), Kashagan, Petroleum Development Oman (PDO) and 
Bonga. Midstream availability was below target. Chemicals and 
Refining availability was also below target as a result of challenges 
at Shell Polymers Monaca (USA) as well as the recovery after a fire 
in Deer Park (USA) earlier in the year. 

￮ Project delivery excellence: project delivery was above target. 

Highlights for the year include the successful start-ups of Vito (USA) 
and Oman Gas (Block 10) Phase 1 in the first quarter, with Timi 
(Malaysia) coming on stream in the second half of the year. The year 
ended on a high note with Mero-2 (Brazil) coming on stream in late 
December.

￮ Customer excellence: Customer Satisfaction Index was above target. 
This was driven by continued improvements in our customer platform 
and coordinated efforts to proactively communicate with our 
customers and manage demand during supply chain challenges, as 
well as dynamic pricing changes. Our Brand Share Preference was 
also above target.

Overall the outcome for operational excellence was above target.

Notes to the table: Single figure of total remuneration
for Executive Directors (audited) 
Pension
During the year, Wael Sawan and Sinead Gorman were eligible 
to participate in the defined contribution UK Shell Pension Plan with 
an employer contribution rate of up to 20% of salary, or take this as 
a pension cash alternative. The UK Shell Pension Plan or associated 
pension cash alternative is available to new Shell employees in the 
UK at the same contribution levels and currently around half of UK 
employees participate in these arrangements. The majority of the 
remainder participate in a legacy defined benefit plan, which closed 
to new members in March 2013.

Annual bonus
The annual bonus is intended to reward the delivery of short-term 
targets derived from the operating plan. The REMCO reviews the 
bonus measures, weightings and targets annually to evolve with Shell's 
strategy and circumstances, and to ensure that the targets remain 
stretching but realistic. For 2023, the mathematical bonus outcome 
was 1.58. The REMCO reviewed performance against the scorecard, 
as below.

Financial delivery (35% weighting): we delivered $54.2 billion of 
CFFO against our target of $44 billion, helped by a robust macro 
and operational performance as well as working capital inflows. 
This exceeded our outstanding performance threshold of $54 billion, 
leading to a maximum outcome on this measure. As a reminder, the 
REMCO has a long-standing policy of not adjusting remuneration 
measures to take account of changes in energy prices and currency 
fluctuations, which supports alignment between pay outcomes and 
the shareholder experience.

Annual Report on Remuneration continued

"Shell's journey in the energy transition" (15%): 
￮ Selling lower-carbon products: performance is measured based on 
the proportion of earnings in the Marketing segment coming from 
lower-carbon energy products, as well as non-energy products (see 
page 198 for the list of products included in this metric). We are 
below target for a range of reasons including lower lubricants 
demand and higher costs for lower-carbon Mobility products.

￮ Reducing operational emissions: performance is assessed based on 

GHG abatement projects that result in ongoing Scope 1 and 2 GHG 
reductions such as flare reduction and energy efficiency projects, site 
closures, decommissioning and transformations, and increasing the 
use of renewable electricity in our operations. This metric does not 
include the impact of divestments and acquisitions. The 2023 
outcome was outstanding, reflecting the cumulative effects of actions 
across the portfolio, which support our target to halve Scope 1 and 2 
operational emissions by 2030 on a net basis (2016 baseline). 
This includes abatement projects, use of renewable energy, and 
permanent shutdowns or conversions ("right-sizing") of assets.

￮ Partnering to decarbonise: we are building an electric vehicle charging 
business to help decarbonise road transport. In 2023 we opened 60 
new electric vehicle hubs in China, Belgium, the Netherlands, and 
Germany, including our biggest electric vehicle site in the world in 
China, together with our joint-venture partner BYD.

Overall the score on the "Shell's journey in the energy transition" 
measure was above target.

Safety (15%): it remains our priority to run our day-to-day operations 
safely and ensure the well-being of all our people.
￮ Process safety continues to be measured through the number of

Tier 1 and 2 operational safety incidents and was above maximum, 
with 63 events recorded compared with 66 in 2022, setting a new 
record for Shell, confirming our top-tier performance in the industry.
￮ Personal safety SIF-F performance is assessed based on the number of 
serious incidents which might occur in Shell's businesses based on the 
work plan for the year and our knowledge of industry incident rates. 
Our ultimate goal is zero harm to people working for Shell. Overall, 
2023 SIF-F performance was of a similar magnitude to 2022 (which 
was itself a marked improvement from prior years), which is testament 
to the ongoing focus of our employees in keeping colleagues safe.

Overall, the score on the safety measure was at maximum. While 
underlying safety performance was strong, we tragically lost contractor 
colleagues during 2023. The REMCO reflected carefully on these 
events and Shell's broader safety performance and determined 
that the bonus outcome should be adjusted downwards to 1.55 
(see "The REMCO's reflections on safety" below).

The REMCO's reflections on safety
Safety is Shell's first priority and our Powering Progress strategy is 
underpinned by this. It is critical that our operations run safely every 
day and that we strive to ensure the well-being of all of our people.

Shell uses Serious Injury and Fatality Frequency (SIF-F) as our 
scorecard measure for personal safety performance. SIF-F tracks 
the frequency at which injuries with life-changing consequences 
occur under Shell operational control. This allows us to focus 
management and organisation attention on the most serious 
incidents. We assess process safety using the number of Tier 1 and 
2 events. This tracks the frequency of unplanned or uncontrolled 
releases of materials from Shell's operations.

Some shareholders have asked how we approach target-setting 
for the SIF-F metric. To be clear, our ultimate target is zero harm to 
people. We have made good progress in reducing the number of 
personal safety events over a long period of time, with reductions 
in the number of fatalities and injuries (see chart below).

SIF-F is an important tool to drive further improvement in safety 
and take us closer to our goal of zero harm. The metric focuses 
management and organisational attention on those incidents with 
the potential to cause most damage. To assess performance, the 
REMCO sets clear performance ranges based on historical 
outcomes, industry benchmarks, and taking account of our 
planned activities for the year.

Shell Annual Report and Accounts 2023

Following discussions with shareholders in 2023, the REMCO 
reviewed its approach to considering fatalities. It determined to 
retain SIF-F and to avoid formulaic mechanisms. The REMCO 
chose to adopt a discretionary framework which takes account 
of multiple reflection points, including the circumstances of the 
fatalities, consideration of systemic issues, the wider safety 
context, and any safety events outside of the reporting framework. 
This framework supports holistic and detailed consideration of 
the circumstances arising, and consistent and fair judgement 
of safety performance over time.

In 2023, four contractors under Shell operational control lost their 
lives in tragic incidents. Four government security agents also died 
in one of those incidents. With two of the incidents, the root causes 
have been identified as design and human factors during the 
operation of physical assets: one contractor colleague in Malaysia 
tragically died during scaffolding work and one contractor 
colleague in the Philippines died after a fall from height. The other 
incident in Nigeria, where a contractor convoy which included the 
government agents was ambushed by unknown gunmen in late 
December 2023, remains under investigation.

In 2023, aside from fatalities, the outstanding personal and 
process safety performance achieved in 2022 was sustained. The 
portion of incidents where barriers and controls were effective in 
avoiding tragic outcomes (i.e. "failed safe") was higher than in the 
prior year. Process safety performance as measured by API Tier 1 
& 2 events was the lowest on record and at top quartile of the 
industry benchmark.

After careful consideration of Shell's holistic safety performance 
in 2023 including the outcome of the formal metrics, the four 
recordable fatalities that occurred during 2023, and Shell's long-
term progress on safety using the discretionary framework, the 
REMCO has determined that the scorecard outcome for Executive 
Directors should be adjusted downwards from 1.58 to 1.55. The 
reduction in the bonus outcome as a result of the adjustment is 
equal to c.4% of salary for both Executive Directors.

In February 2024, a contractor injured in a December 2023 
tugboat fire incident in Nigeria sadly died. While this is reflected 
in the 2023 SIF-F outcome, it will be assessed as part of the 
REMCO's considerations of safety performance outcomes for 2024.

Long-term Incentive Plan vesting: 2021 LTIP
In 2021, Ben van Beurden and Jessica Uhl, at the time Executive 
Directors, were granted conditional share awards under the LTIP. The 
vesting of these awards is discussed in the "Payments to past Directors" 
section on page 205.

Wael Sawan and Sinead Gorman's 2021 LTIP awards are also 
disclosed for transparency, although they were not Executive Directors 
at the time of the award.

In determining the vesting outcome, the REMCO considered Shell's 
performance over the three-year period January 1, 2021 to December 
31, 2023:
￮ Relative CFFO: on a relative basis as compared against the 2020 

base year, Shell ranked fifth, resulting in 0% vesting for this 
performance condition. 

￮ Relative TSR: over the performance period, Shell returned around 
$58 billion to shareholders in the form of dividends and share 
buybacks, whilst TSR was 92%. Relative to the other energy majors, 
Shell's TSR ranked second, resulting in 150% vesting for this 
performance condition.

2021 LTIP vesting outcomes – performance measures

￮ Relative ROACE: Shell's absolute 2023 ROACE for LTIP purposes 
was 7.2% (note that ROACE for the LTIP calculation is based on 
disclosed net income and is not adjusted for the after-tax interest 
expense and therefore differs from ROACE as calculated for 
purposes other than remuneration). On a relative growth basis 
compared with the 2020 base year, Shell ranked fourth, resulting 
in 0% of vesting for this performance condition.

￮ Absolute FCF: strong performance in all three years resulted in total 
FCF of $122.8 billion, above our maximum threshold of $71 billion. 
This resulted in a 200% of target vesting outcome on this 
performance condition.

￮ Absolute energy transition: the outcome of this performance 

condition is determined holistically by the REMCO, taking account of 
Shell's performance against defined performance indicators and also
Shell's wider performance as it transitions to a net-zero emissions 
energy business. Overall, the REMCO determined the vesting 
outcome as 120% of target. Commentary on energy transition 
performance is provided below.

2021 LTIP energy transition performance condition: outcome

Outcomes for the energy transition performance condition are determined by the REMCO based on quantitative performance and a qualitative 
assessment focused on Shell's short-term NCI reduction target and those elements that we understood at the time would make the most impact 
on achieving our goals over the three-year performance period relating to NCI: the growth of our power business, the growth of lower-carbon 
products, and the development of systems to absorb, capture and store carbon. This approach to the LTIP is intended to support experimentation 
and learning as to what actions will help deliver net-zero emissions in a profitable way. Accordingly, the REMCO uses the performance indicators 
as guidance, rather than applying a formulaic vesting outcome, when making its decisions.

Net carbon intensity (NCI) - performance indicator met
We achieved our short-term target for the 2021-23 LTIP cycle to reduce our NCI by 6-8% compared with the 2016 baseline, with a 6.3% reduction 
by 2023. In making its decision, the REMCO reviewed how the target was met including changing product sales, the use of emission offsets, such 
as carbon credits, and the retirement of Renewable Energy Certificates, recognising the importance of these in the energy transition.

Growing the power business - performance indicator substantively met
A key element of the purpose of the early cycles of the LTIP was to encourage learning about how to profitably decarbonise and the REMCO paid 
close attention to management's work to refine the strategic direction for the Power business over the performance cycle. This has changed from an 
emphasis on growth in the customer base to a more selective focus on those areas where Shell has competitive advantages in the optimisation and 
marketing of molecules, enabling Shell to generate returns and create shareholder value. For example, in 2023 Shell undertook a strategic review of 
its consumer power retail business in Europe, which was determined not fitting for that revised strategy and hence was divested with a connected 
reduction in sales volumes. Stretching targets around growing Shell's power sales were set (original target 340 TWh/year with 279 TWh/year 
achieved in 2023), with attention also on decarbonising those power sales, with targets for creating a pipeline of renewable power generation 
capacity options (target of 5-10 GW well exceeded with 41.4 GW at the close of 2023) and generating renewable power sales (offtake volumes 
target of 3 GW also exceeded with 4.9 GW). A target was also set for a 16-22% reduction in carbon intensity for the Power Portfolio against the 
2020 base year. Changes in reporting methodology mean it is not possible to compare 2023 intensities against 2020 on a like-for-like basis. 
However, the REMCO noted the steady decrease in carbon intensity for the Power Portfolio over the cycle (2021: 66 gCO2e/MJ; 2022: 58 gCO2e/
MJ; 2023: 49 gCO2e/MJ). In assessing the outcome, the REMCO also noted the strong wider progress made over the performance period, and in 
particular the strategic acquisitions of Sprng in 2022 and Savion in 2021 which provide important platforms for growing future low-carbon offerings in 
solar. Meanwhile in wind, 2023 saw the significant milestone of our CrossWind offshore wind joint venture in the Netherlands becoming operational.

Growing new lower-carbon product offerings - performance indicator partially met
Shell is investing in low- and zero-carbon products such as renewable electricity, hydrogen and biofuels, working closely with customers to help 
identify the products they need to decarbonise. Metrics for the performance cycle were designed to encourage development across this range of 
offerings, against which the REMCO noted a number of successes. Shell is one of the world's largest traders of biofuels and our Brazilian joint venture 
Raizen (Shell interest 44%) is one of the world's largest producers and blenders of biofuels. This is a position that has been further developed over the 
performance period with the acquisition of Nature Energy, making Shell Europe's largest producer of renewable natural gas (RNG), and with 
commencing construction of the Shell Rotterdam Biofuels hydro-processed esters and fatty acids (HEFA) facility, which will be amongst the largest in 
Europe when on stream. The REMCO also set a target for 8,000 out-of-home electric vehicle charge points which was well exceeded with more than 
54,000 as Shell looks to leverage its global network of service stations and existing strengths of the marketing business to generate returns. Balancing 
this, the REMCO also reflected on the fact that many of the commercial pathways for these offerings are emerging more slowly than anticipated. 
Holland Hydrogen 1 provides 200 MW of production capacity and is an important platform for future hydrogen development. This is below the 
ambitious target of 500 MW originally set for this LTIP cycle. However, on balance, the REMCO considered this a strong outcome as customer 
demand, technology de-risking and proven business models for hydrogen continue to develop. A target of 6 mtpa of carbon abated through the 
deployment of low-carbon fuels was also narrowly missed (5.3 mtpa achieved). Finally, a target was set for three investments in commercial-scale 
advanced biofuels projects. While two were achieved (LanzaJet and Enerkem Varennes), technology platforms and commercially viable pathways 
proved slower to develop than anticipated and CAPEX was redeployed.

Develop emissions sinks - performance indicator not met
The development of systems that capture and store or absorb carbon is required as part of the global response to climate change to reduce and 
compensate for emissions where there are not currently scalable low-carbon alternatives. The REMCO originally set a target of 25 mtpa CO2 offset by 
carbon credits through carbon-neutral customer offerings. 4 mtpa was achieved as customer demand and willingness to pay for these types of offering 
failed to materialise at the rate anticipated. Targets were also set for maturing carbon, capture, utilisation, and storage projects to final investment 
decision. Against the original target of three projects, two were achieved, highlighting the high degree of stretch in the original targets. The REMCO 
was comfortable that the outcome reflected commercial decision-making by the business in support of appropriate value creation.

Overall, the REMCO determined that the energy transition measure (accounting for 20% of the award) should vest at 120% of target.

The REMCO considered the Company's share price at the time of the 
awards, and determined to reduce the 2021 LTIP awards by 11.8% 
and 8.0% from the usual target award levels for Ben van Beurden 
and Jessica Uhl, respectively. The REMCO was cognisant of possible 
windfall gains arising from share price volatility in 2020, and took 
decisive action upfront to reduce awards at the start of the cycle to 
moderate the potential impact on LTIP award values. Notwithstanding 
the REMCO's proactive approach at the time of award, following the 
conclusion of the performance period, the REMCO further reflected on 
the share price at award and on vesting, noting that share price 
appreciation accounted for 34% of the total value of Wael Sawan's 
LTIP at vest. Taking this and the reduction to the initial awards into 
account, the REMCO was satisfied that the potential for windfall gains 
had been appropriately addressed.

The REMCO decided that the LTIP outcome was consistent with the 
target opportunity and intended operation of the plan under the Policy 
and appropriate, and therefore no adjustment to the vesting outcome 
was required. Accordingly, the REMCO decided that the LTIP should 
vest at 94% of target (equivalent to 47% of maximum).

The overall LTIP vesting outcomes for Wael Sawan and Sinead 
Gorman, including an illustration of the impact of share price 
movements and accrued dividends, are set out below. Wael Sawan 
was an Executive Committee member during 2021, and therefore his 
vested 2021 award is subject to a further three-year holding period 
which extends beyond his tenure as Executive Director, in line with the 
policy for Executive Committee members (and Executive Directors). 
Sinead Gorman was a Senior Executive during 2021, and therefore 
her vested 2021 award is not subject to further holding, though the 
shareholding guideline policy is applicable.

Consideration of 2023 single figure outcomes
In determining the final single figure outcomes for 2023, the REMCO also considered the personal performance of the Executive Directors.

Personal performance 

The Executive Directors have demonstrated strong leadership in 2023. 
CEO Wael Sawan has made changes early in his tenure to simplify the 
Executive Committee for greater alignment, focus and accountability, 
enabling faster and better decision-making. Together with CFO Sinead 
Gorman, he has brought organisational focus on performance, 
discipline and simplification, driving an approach of creating more 
value while reducing emissions.

Key successes are noted throughout this report, particularly on page 
196 on the 2023 annual bonus and page 199 on the 2021 LTIP vesting 
outcome, and additional comments are provided below.

The sector faces many challenges. Critical to a successful 2023 has 
been Wael's leadership of the organisation, setting out an agenda to 
deliver increased shareholder returns through a balanced energy 
transition, helping to provide the secure energy the world needs whilst 
making progress towards our net-zero emissions targets. Demonstrating 
this focus, Capital Markets Day (CMD) in June 2023 set out a plan to 
operationalise the Powering Progress strategy with a clear and concise 
set of targets presented to the market. The Energy Transition Strategy 
2024 (ETS24), worked on extensively by the leadership team in 2023, 
is another example of clear focus and effective collaboration (see the 
Shell Energy Transition Strategy 2024 on shell.com). By the end of 
2023, key achievements also included:
￮ Delivery of strong financial results with net income of $19.6 billion 

and Adjusted Earnings* of $28.3 billion, and CFFO of $54.2 billion 
against plan target of $44 billion, reflecting continuous high-grading 
of our upstream assets and the strength of our trading businesses;
￮ Delivery of $23 billion of shareholder distributions* in 2023, 2% 

above the 30-40% of CFFO promised at CMD 2023;

￮ Reduction of net debt* to $43.5 billion;

* Non-GAAP measure (see page 365).
