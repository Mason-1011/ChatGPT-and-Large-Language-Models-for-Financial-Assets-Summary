Letter from the Chair

2023 was a year of continued geopolitical 
instability and macroeconomic challenges. 
More than ever, companies need to 
build resilient business models, manage 
supply chain risks and stay agile 
in fast-changing environments.  

Philip Yea
Chair

Welcome to Mondi’s Integrated report 
for 2023. I have written in the past about 
the resilience of Mondi, and it was evident 
again in the past year in the face of 
external challenges, most significantly the 
uncertain global economic environment 
where central banks and financial markets 
were torn between the steps required 
to reduce inflation and the risk of 
self-inflicted recession. The geopolitical 
environment became even more uncertain 
given the continuing conflict in Ukraine 
and the shocking and polarising events 
in the Middle East in the last quarter. 

Following the reversal of the energy 
squeeze the industry faced in 2022, many 
of our input costs have fallen, yet overall 
the economic uncertainties have had a 
significant impact on our margins as some 
producers have chosen to reopen their 
temporarily mothballed production facilities 
in an environment where overall demand 
has been cyclically soft. Market pricing has 
generally been at significantly lower levels 
than in 2022, falling more than input costs, 
in part due to new capacity being brought 
on stream at this relatively weak point 
in the cycle. 
A resilient performance 
Mondi’s resilience is based on our scale, 
our quality asset base, our integrated 
model and the breadth and depth of our 
customers and end-markets. So our 
continuing businesses remained 
appropriately profitable, although the 
slowdown in global demand for goods 
throughout 2023 put pressure on Mondi’s 
performance, resulting in underlying 
EBITDA of €1,201 million 
(2022: €1,848 million). Cash flow remains 

strong and our balance sheet robust, 
enabling us to continue our capacity 
expansion projects which remain on 
track and on budget. ROCE was 12.8% 
(2022: 23.7%).

Together with the Board, I would like to 
thank all our colleagues who have worked 
hard to continue delivering value for 
all Mondi’s stakeholders against this 
challenging backdrop. Thanks to them we 
have continued to build strong relationships 
with customers, improve efficiency and 
productivity across our extensive asset 
base, and make excellent progress with our 
significant investment projects. I have no 
doubt that their efforts ensure Mondi is 
well positioned for a sustainable future.

Capital allocation focused 
on returns
One of Mondi’s key strengths is the quality 
of our through-cycle cash generation, 
which remained strong with cash generated 
from operations at €1,312 million 
(2022: €1,292 million). Our robust financial 
position, with leverage (net debt to 
underlying EBITDA) of 0.3 times, and 
disciplined capital allocation provide 
us with strategic flexibility to continue 
investing through-cycle for sustainable 
growth and deliver attractive returns, 
while supporting the ordinary dividend.

With our confidence in Mondi’s future, 
the Board has recommended a final 
dividend of 46.67 euro cents per share. 
The final dividend, together with the 
interim dividend, amounts to a total 
ordinary dividend for the year of 
70.0 euro cents per share.

It was a disappointment that the conditional 
agreement to dispose of our operation in 
Syktyvkar in Russia announced in August 
2022 did not receive the requisite regulatory 
approvals within the target timetable. 
However, our management are to be 
congratulated on delivering an acceptable 
alternative. This, together with the sale of the 
converting operations, created a loss on 
disposal of €756 million which mainly 
comprised the reclassification of the foreign 
currency translation reserves and contributed 
to an overall loss after tax for the Group, 
attributable to shareholders, of €153 million. 

Total cash proceeds of €806 million were 
received before year end. Following 
approval by shareholders, the net proceeds 
were distributed by way of a special 
dividend of €1.60 per share on 13 February 
2024. Further details of the transaction can 
be found in note 28 in the notes to 
the consolidated financial statements.
Investing through-cycle for 
value accretive growth
The Board is pleased with the progress made 
in 2023 on our growth capital investment 
programme, which will support an increase in 
our capacity, lower our cost base and reduce 
our environmental footprint.

As part of our capacity expansion pipeline, 
we are making excellent progress on the 
project to install our new kraft paper 
machine at Štětí (Czech Republic) to 
increase our kraft paper capacity and are 
on track to commence operations in 2025. 
Our two containerboard debottlenecking 
projects in Kuopio (Finland) and Świecie 
(Poland) will be contributing additional 
capacity from 2024.

Acquisitions continue to be a key part 
of our investment strategy. Opportunities 
are rigorously assessed in terms of both 
financial metrics and strategic fit, with 
a focus on those opportunities that 
complement our existing footprint and 
capabilities. An important new opportunity 
for us comes through the acquisition of the 
Hinton Pulp mill in Alberta (Canada) in early 
2024 which is now part of our Flexible 
Packaging business unit. After the intended 
investment in a new kraft paper machine, 
Hinton will be capable of producing 
low-cost, high-quality kraft paper for 
industrial and eCommerce bags, and fully 
integrate our North American paper bag 
operations, strengthening our competitive 
advantage and providing our customers 
with security of supply (see page 41).

Contributing to a better world  
Mondi has an ambitious purpose that 
guides our decisions: to contribute to a 
better world by making packaging and 
paper solutions that are sustainable by 
design. We are committed to leading the 
way in circular driven solutions and are 
focused on ensuring our customers have 
sustainable packaging that is reusable, 
recyclable or compostable. 

Consequently, sustainability is at the heart 
of our strategy. The Mondi Action Plan 
2030 (MAP2030), our sustainability framework, 
sets out how progress in our three key 
action areas - Circular Driven Solutions, 
Created by Empowered People, 
Taking Action on Climate - can drive 
the prosperity of the people, places and 
ecosystems that matter to our business 
and stakeholders. 

Since the launch of MAP2030, Mondi 
has continued to make good progress 
in our commitments, and ownership of 
our sustainability goals is widely shared 
across the business.

Since 2019, the base year for our Net-Zero 
targets, we have reduced our absolute 
Scope 1 and 2 greenhouse gas (GHG) 
emissions by 22% and our absolute Scope 
3 GHG emissions by 21%. In the near term, 
our targets commit us to reduce absolute 
Scope 1 and 2 GHG emissions by 46.2% 
and Scope 3 GHG emissions by 27.5% 
by 2030 from a 2019 base year.
Advancing our offering of 
sustainable products
One of Mondi’s strengths is our ability to 
offer our customers a choice of paper, 
plastic or hybrid solutions for their 

packaging requirements, creating 
partnerships with our customers on their 
journey towards a circular economy. 
Today, 85% of our paper and packaging 
products are reusable, recyclable or 
compostable and we continue the 
necessary work towards our target 
of 100%. 

We are excited about the range of 
innovative products released during the 
year; for example, our paper MailerBAGs 
support eCommerce customers looking to 
transition away from plastic when shipping 
goods worldwide, while Hug&Hold is a 
paper-based solution that aims to replace 
plastic shrink wrap for PET bottle bundle 
packs (see page 28). 

Empowering our people
Delivering value for our stakeholders relies 
on a talented and motivated workforce and, 
together with other members of the Board, 
I have greatly benefitted from visiting our 
operations during the year, including the 
Richards Bay mill (South Africa) in 
February 2023 and Świecie mill (Poland) 
in June 2023, seeing first hand the 
commitment and energy of our colleagues. 
As part of her role leading employee 
engagement on behalf of the Board, 
non-executive director Sue Clark 
participated in Mondi’s European 
Communication Forum, alongside 
representatives from our European plant 
network, where she discussed Group 
priorities and performance. We have 
22,000 colleagues across more than 
30 countries and we aim to be an employer 
of choice, supporting our people 
to realise their potential and contribute 
to Mondi’s ongoing success.

The results of our Employee Survey in 2023 
reiterated the feedback given to us on our 
site visits. Colleagues across the Group 
particularly value the sense of meaning 
and purpose their jobs give them, and the 
opportunities offered to learn and grow. 
We know this as we measure progress 
against our MAP2030 commitments, 
represented by the Purposeful Workplace 
Index (79%), Inclusiveness Index (77%) 
and – for the first time in 2023 – our 
Wellbeing Index (77%).

Keeping people safe is our top priority 
and we have been building on our 
traditional safety focus to address the 
social psychology of risk, as well as 
deepening our engagement with our 
contractors. Although we are among the 
safety leaders in our industry, most 
regrettably we experienced a fatality 

towards the end of the year at our 
Ružomberok mill (Slovakia), which has left 
the Board deeply saddened. A key part of 
our philosophy is to ensure that every 
incident is fully investigated and procedures 
and practices further revised if we can 
avoid the same or similar 
situation recurring.
Board developments
The Board is committed to the highest 
standards of corporate governance, a key 
factor being the effective combination 
of skills, experience and judgement 
of our directors. In April, we welcomed 
Anke Groth as an independent non-
executive director. Anke has a strong 
financial and commercial background, 
having operated in large international listed 
companies across the energy and industrial 
sectors. She brings valuable new insights 
to the Board and strengthens the 
Audit Committee.
Looking ahead
As we enter 2024, it is clear that 
geopolitical uncertainties remain high and 
that it is going to be another challenging 
year for the world economy. However, I am 
confident that Mondi has the resilience 
to navigate these challenges. We intend 
to push through the tough macroeconomic 
environment relying on our scale, quality 
asset base, integrated operations and 
excellent customer proposition. Our strong 
balance sheet provides the opportunity 
to continue investing through-cycle, staying 
alert to growth opportunities and ensuring 
Mondi is well positioned to deliver 
attractive returns long into the future.

Market context
Our structurally growing packaging markets

The global packaging market

Global packaging demand is estimated 
at around $1 trillion per annum, roughly 
half of which is accounted for by 
Europe and North America. From a 
materials perspective, paper-based 
packaging comprises about 40% of 
the global market, while plastic-based 
packaging represents another 40%. 
Metal and glass make up most of the 
remaining portion. Around 60% of the 
global packaging market is directed 
at consumer end-uses (including food, 
drink, healthcare and cosmetics) 
with the remaining 40% comprising 
industrial, transport and other 
applications.

Packaging demand is linked to 
macroeconomic indicators such as 
GDP and consumption trends which 
form the majority of GDP in developed 
markets. In addition, the increase 
in demand for sustainable products 
and the growth in eCommerce also 
contribute to growth in the packaging 
market, resulting in structural growth 
through-cycle in the region of 2-4%.

In the past few years, growth has been 
volatile. It was positive in 2020 and 2021 
during the COVID-19 outbreak and 
subsequent lockdowns when packaging 
demand grew substantially, primarily as 
a result of consumers prioritising the 
purchase of goods over services and 
inventory levels increasing following

heightened availability risks. After a 
short period of normalised consumer 
spending, the recent slowdown in 
macroeconomic activity and customer 
destocking have contributed to 
weaker demand.

As a Group, we are strongly positioned. 
We operate in faster growing 
packaging segments of corrugated 
(paper-based) and flexible (paper, 
plastic and hybrid-based) packaging, 
which benefit from structural growth 
drivers, including the growing demand 
for sustainable packaging. We see 
opportunities to leverage our leading 
market positions and innovation 
capabilities to deliver sustainable 
packaging solutions for our customers.

Growing demand for sustainable solutions

Population growth and 
economic development 
are increasing 
consumption, adding 
pressure on natural 
resources and driving 
efforts to build circular 
models. Climate change-
related concerns are 
fuelling demand for 
alternative solutions with 
lower carbon emissions. 
Consumer awareness 
about how their choices 
impact the environment 
is pressuring companies 
to deliver positive change. 
These developments are 
supporting the growing 
demand for sustainable 
products and practices 
as our customers and 
end-consumers make 
more sustainable choices.

Recent developments

Our response

1. Rapidly evolving legislation

A number of legislative initiatives 
under the EU Green Deal and 
which are highly relevant to our 
industry are driving the transition 
to more sustainable products, 
including the Packaging and 
Packaging Waste Regulation 
and Green Claims guidance.

2. Responsible and efficient production

Through Scope 3 emissions reporting 
and the increased use of life 
cycle-based product assessments, 
the scrutiny of products will continue 
to grow as suppliers and customers 
demand responsibly sourced, carbon 
efficient manufacturing across their 
value chains.

With a focus on circular driven 
solutions and delivering products 
that are sustainable by design, we 
remain well positioned to respond 
to regulatory changes and continue 
to help our customers make more 
sustainable choices. 

We have a long track record of 
delivering against our sustainability 
targets. As part of MAP2030, we 
remain focused on keeping materials 
in circulation, preventing waste and 
reducing our emissions along the value 
chain. Together with our innovation 
efforts, we develop solutions with 
superior sustainability credentials 
as seen in our life cycle-based 
product assessments.

3. Demand for renewable and recyclable materials

The demand for products containing 
recycled content continues to grow. 
However, in paper-based packaging, 
some applications require a fresh fibre 
(virgin) product due to its superior 
strength and purity properties. For 
other applications, recycled solutions 
can be used which are more cost 
effective. For plastic-based solutions, 
most products are virgin based as the 
availability of recycled plastic is limited.  

We offer a broad range of solutions 
including virgin and recycled 
paper-based packaging, as well as 
hybrid- and plastic-based packaging. 
Our paper-based solutions are either 
from renewable sources (fresh fibre 
products) or contain recycled content 
(recycled-based products). We are 
also continuing our efforts to develop 
mono-material plastic-based solutions 
in order to increase recyclability. 

4. Fit-for-purpose packaging

Optimal packaging is dependent 
on the packaged goods' required 
properties including shelf life, durability, 
barrier properties and quality, which 
in many cases can only be provided 
by producers with the knowledge, 
expertise and capacity to manufacture 
at scale. In addition, overpacking 
continues to be a challenge as goods 
of varying sizes are packaged in 
standardised solutions.

With a broad range of solutions, 
we provide our customers with the 
optimal solution that avoids waste 
and protects the packaged goods. 
Our innovation efforts are driving 
the development of adaptable 
and adjustable solutions to ensure 
right-sizing of packaging.

What we do 

What makes us sustainable by design

Responsibly sourced
raw materials

Efficient production

– We require materials such as wood, 
paper for recycling, chemicals and 
resins, access to natural resources 
(most notably water), and energy 
in our manufacturing processes.
– Based on revenue, over 80% of our 
packaging and paper solutions are 
fibre based with wood as the primary 
raw material.

– More than 90% of our wood is sourced in 
the countries where our mills are located. 
Our European mills procure wood 
regionally from responsible external 
sources while our South African mills 
primarily source wood from our own 
sustainably managed certified plantations.

– We use around 1.3 million tonnes 

of paper for recycling for our recycled 
fibre-based products.

– Our pulp and paper mills produce pulp, 

containerboard, kraft paper and 
uncoated fine paper.

– All of our key mills have integrated pulp 
and paper processes which provide 
efficient and cost-competitive 
production as well as energy generation. 

– Our box plants and other converting 

operations use containerboard and kraft 
paper respectively (sourced internally 
and externally) together with resins, 
chemicals and other raw materials to 
produce a broad range of corrugated 
and flexible packaging products.

– 100% of our wood is responsibly sourced 
with 75% FSCTM- or PEFC-certified fibre 
and the remainder meeting FSC's 
Controlled Wood standard. 

– We partner with scientific organisations 
to promote climate-fit, resilient forests.

– We conduct water stewardship and 
biodiversity assessments providing 
insights on our impact and information 
for developing subsequent action plans.

– 92% of the water we use is returned 
back to the ocean or rivers after use 
and treated in compliance with 
regulatory quality standards. 

– We engage with suppliers to promote 
greater transparency, mitigate risk 
and reduce our Scope 3 emissions 
in our supply chain.

– 78% of fuels used by our mills are 
biomass based, a renewable fuel 
generated on site by our mills (63%) 
and purchased externally (15%).

– Our training and upskilling programmes 
support our employees to reach their 
full potential and drive productivity 
and efficiency gains.

– We remain focused on safety with 

our Social Psychology of Risk approach 
to drive continuous improvement in 
our safety performance.

– We engage and support surrounding 
communities to understand their 
concerns and partner with them to find 
solutions for our joint success.

– Our focus is on reducing air, water and 
greenhouse gas emissions across our 
production processes and supply chain 
and eliminating waste.

Sustainable packaging
and paper solutions

– We produce a broad and unique 

– We design products to have a 

range of packaging and paper solutions 
for consumer and industrial end-uses 
including paper, plastic and hybrid 
products. 

– We partner with our customers to 

understand their needs, providing an 
opportunity to innovate and develop 
new, fit-for-purpose solutions that 
contribute to a circular economy.

– Our converted corrugated solutions and 

flexible packaging products are 
predominantly delivered to customers 
regionally while the majority of our pulp, 
containerboard, kraft paper and 
uncoated fine paper is sold globally.

sustainable end-of-life.

– As a Group, we continue to increase 

the proportion of our products that are 
reusable, recyclable or compostable, 
achieving 85% in 2023.

– Our continued engagement in 

cross-value chain initiatives provides 
an opportunity for us to contribute 
towards the development of 
industry-wide guidelines for recycling 
and design for circularity.

– We identify opportunities to use waste 
as a secondary raw material for other 
industrial applications such as in the 
cement industry and agricultural sector.

We produce virgin containerboard at our 
mills in Świecie (Poland), Kuopio (Finland), 
Richards Bay (South Africa) and 
Ružomberok (Slovakia).

Recycled containerboard
Around 20% of our containerboard 
production is recycled with most 
production at our cost-competitive mill 
in Świecie (Poland). We are integrated 
with our corrugated solutions plants as 
we produce the majority of the recycled 
containerboard they need for converting, 
which secures supply. Our ongoing capital 
investment project at Duino (Italy) will 
increase our recycled containerboard 
production and integration to meet the 
growing demand from our plant network 
for sustainably produced recycled 
containerboard in the region.  

Corrugated solutions
We are a leading corrugated solutions 
producer in the faster growing emerging 
European region. Together with our 
strong customer relationships and security 
of supply, we create fully recyclable, 
paper-based corrugated boxes and 
packaging (made from virgin and recycled 
containerboard) for our customers’ 
consumer, eCommerce, transit and 
industrial packaging needs in the region. 
We utilise a high percentage of recycled 
content in our products.

Corrugated Packaging
Virgin containerboard
Mondi is the leading virgin 
containerboard producer in Europe 
with around 80% of our overall 
containerboard production virgin based. 
The European market is however 
predominately recycled based with only 
around 20% derived from virgin grades. 
Virgin containerboard is made from 
fresh fibres, and used for applications 
requiring strength, moisture resistance, 
hygiene and other unique properties 
such as fresh fruit packaging and 
transport packaging for heavy and 
fragile goods. Most of our offering is 
produced at our European mills which 
are extremely cost competitive. 

Our virgin containerboard product 
offering is diverse with a range of 
high-quality grades including unbleached 
kraftliner, white top kraftliner and 
semi-chemical fluting. 

While the majority of our customer 
base is in Europe, a significant amount 
of our virgin containerboard is sold 
to customers around the globe and 
converted into a range of packaging 
solutions by regional players.

Flexible Packaging trading review
Page 31

As a global leader in both sack kraft 
paper and paper bag production, 
and with our high level of integration 
across the value chain, our customers 
come to us for scale, security of supply, 
in-depth paper making expertise, quality, 
reliability and global reach.

Speciality kraft paper
We produce a broad range of speciality 
kraft paper that is versatile and strong, 
and used in a wide range of end-uses 
including paper-based consumer 
products, retail shopper bags, pallet 
wrapping and other industrial solutions. 
Some of this paper is used in our 
consumer-focused converting 
operations (as outlined below); 
however, the majority of our speciality 
kraft paper is converted by our 
customers across Europe.

Consumer flexibles and 
functional paper and films
We are a leading producer of flexible 
packaging products for consumer 
end-uses with leading positions 
in food and pet food applications 
across Europe, and extensive customer 
relationships with large FMCGs 
and major retailers.

We are well positioned to meet our 
customers’ needs and take advantage 
of the growing demand for sustainable 
packaging solutions with our unique 
product portfolio. We can provide 
paper- or hybrid-based products by 
leveraging our paper making expertise 
and extensive coating capabilities, or 
mono-material plastic-based solutions, 
ensuring we can deliver the optimal 
solution that is sustainable by design.

Flexible Packaging
Our Flexible Packaging business unit 
produces kraft paper and paper bags 
(which together contribute around 60% 
of the business unit’s revenue) as well 
as consumer flexibles and functional 
paper and films. Kraft paper, which 
comprises sack kraft and speciality 
kraft, is produced at our mills in 
Štětí (Czech Republic), Frantschach 
(Austria), Dynäs (Sweden), Stambolijski 
(Bulgaria) and Ružomberok (Slovakia). 
Our converting operations are located 
across the globe and have leading 
positions in the regions where 
we operate.

Sack kraft paper and paper bags
We are the global leader in the sack 
kraft paper and paper bag value chain. 
Our well-invested European mills 
produce kraft paper of which around 
two-thirds is sack kraft paper, a niche 
and high-quality product made from 
fresh fibres that is strong, porous 
and with high elasticity and high tear 
resistance. These properties make it 
an ideal solution for packaging of 
medium to large goods which demand 
strength and durability such as cement 
and other building materials as well 
as animal food, feed and seed. 
More recently, the growth in 
eCommerce has increased demand 
for our MailerBAGs, a paper-based 
flexible packaging solution for consumer 
eCommerce packaging made of sack 
kraft paper, which is providing an 
additional growth driver for our business 
as it replaces traditional plastic mailers.

Sack kraft paper is a globally traded 
product which is converted by paper 
bag plants located in close proximity 
to their customers around the world. 
As a Group, we have a global paper bag 
plant footprint, with leading positions in 
Europe, North America, the Middle East 
and North Africa.

Market pulp
We produce and sell market pulp 
to our customers around the world. 
The majority of the Group’s market 
pulp is produced at our mill in Richards 
Bay (South Africa) which is accounted 
for in the Uncoated Fine Paper business 
unit. In addition to providing pulp 
for packaging and paper production 
to our South African operations, the 
mill produces market pulp for sale both 
into domestic and export markets. 

Forestry assets
We own and manage forestry 
landholdings in South Africa that 
produce sufficient wood volumes 
to meet our own requirements for 
production in the country, thereby 
securing our supply. We recognise 
changes in the fair value of these 
assets in the consolidated income 
statement through the fair value gain 
or loss on forestry assets.

Uncoated Fine Paper
Uncoated fine paper 
(Europe)
We are the second largest uncoated 
fine paper producer in Europe. 
The majority of our uncoated fine paper 
production in this region is from our 
integrated mill in Ružomberok (Slovakia). 
As an integrated producer, we benefit 
from a lower cost of production and 
higher energy self-generation, which 
provides cost competitiveness 
compared to non-integrated producers.

Our Neusiedler operations (Austria) 
complement our offering with highly 
diversified, value added and sustainable 
paper options enabling us to offer a full 
range of products to our customers. 

Together, and with our scale, reliability, 
extensive operational capabilities and 
financial strength, we continue to 
be the supplier of choice with our 
comprehensive customer offering.

Uncoated fine paper 
(Southern Africa)
We are the leading uncoated fine 
paper producer in the region, with 
most competition coming from 
import volumes. We operate one 
paper machine at our Merebank mill 
(South Africa) which produces 
uncoated fine paper for our customers 
in the region.

Key performance indicators 
Tracking our performance

Our key performance indicators (KPIs) provide 
a broad measure of the Group’s performance. 
We set individual targets for each of our 
business units in support of these Group KPIs.

Presentation basis
Financial KPIs are presented for a five-year period and based on 
the Group’s continuing operations from 2021, while sustainability 
metrics are presented from their respective baseline years and 
therefore either cover a four- or five-year period (with all years, 
including baselines, based on the Group’s continuing operations). 

Underlying EBITDA
(€ million)

Why this is a KPI
Underlying EBITDA provides a measure 
of the cash-generating ability of the Group 
that is comparable from year to year. 

Tracking our cash generation is one of the 
components we measure when we assess 
our value creation through the cycle.

2023 performance
Underlying EBITDA was lower at €1,201 million 
due to lower sales volumes and selling prices 
falling more than input costs. The Group’s 
underlying EBITDA margin was 16.4%.

Link to strategy

Return on capital employed (ROCE)
% (12-month trailing)

Why this is a KPI
ROCE provides a measure of the efficient 
and effective use of capital in our operations. 
We compare ROCE to our current estimated 
Group pre-tax weighted average cost of 
capital to measure the value we create.

2023 performance
The Group achieved a ROCE of 12.8%, ahead 
of cost of capital although lower than 2022, 
reflecting the lower profitability in the year.

Link to strategy

Investment grade credit rating
(at 31 December 2023)

Standard & Poor’s

Why this is a KPI
We aim to maintain investment grade credit 
ratings to ensure we have access to funding 
for value accretive investment opportunities 
through the business cycle.

2023 performance
The Group maintained its investment grade 
credit ratings. In May 2023, Standard & Poor’s 
upgraded the Group's credit rating from BBB+ 
to A- (stable outlook). Moody’s Investors 
Service reaffirmed the Group's credit rating 
at Baa1 (stable outlook) during the year.

Total shareholder return (TSR)
(%)

Why this is a KPI
TSR provides a market-related measure of 
the Group’s progress against our objective 
of delivering long-term value for our 
shareholders.

TSR measures the total return to Mondi’s 
shareholders, including both share price 
movement and dividends paid.

2023 performance
The Group achieved a TSR of 14% in the year 
and recommended a total ordinary dividend 
per share for the year of 70.0 euro cents, 
in line with last year.

Using KPIs to measure the success of our strategy
Our strategy is to deliver value accretive growth, sustainably. 
This is underpinned by four strategic value drivers which build 
on the competitive advantages we enjoy today and set a clear 
roadmap for investment and operational decisions into the 
future. We use KPIs to provide a measure of Mondi’s strategic 
performance and value creation. Each KPI has been linked 
to the relevant strategic value drivers below.

Aligning KPIs to remuneration
Our executive directors are assessed against specific performance 
targets. For the LTIP, these performance measures, assessed over 
a three-year period, are ROCE and TSR (and basic underlying 
earnings per share from the performance period ending in 2025). 
For the Group annual bonus, in which more than 3,000 employees 
participate (including the Group CEO and Group CFO), performance is 
assessed against ROCE, underlying EBITDA, sustainability metrics 
(safety, GHG emissions and waste to landfill) and personal objectives.

Scope 1 and 2 GHG emissions
(million tonnes CO2e)

Why this is a KPI
Our focus is to reduce our GHG emissions 
to address climate-related impacts and secure 
the long-term success of our business.

2023 performance
We have reduced our absolute Scope 1 and 2 
GHG emissions by 22% compared to our 
2019 baseline and remain on track to meet 
our targets. Our GHG emission intensity 
from our pulp and paper mills was higher at 
0.39 t/t (or 0.43 t/t for the Group including 
converters) mainly due to market-related 
lower production volumes.

Why this is a KPI
Our goal is to keep materials in circulation. 
We are focused on reducing our waste 
and reusing or recycling unavoidable waste 
generated in our production processes 
instead of disposing of it to landfill. 

2023 performance
We continue to make progress against 
our ambition to eliminate waste to landfill 
and have successfully reduced our specific 
waste to landfill by 44% compared to our 
2020 baseline. 

Link to strategy

Why this is a KPI
The demand for sustainable packaging 
continues to rise, with brands and consumers 
looking for solutions to help meet their 
sustainability pledges and support the 
transition to a circular economy.

2023 performance
We continue to make progress on our 
ambitious target. In 2023, 85% of our revenue 
was from products that were reusable, 
recyclable or compostable, up from 74% 
in 2020, our baseline year for this target. 
Link to strategy

Why this is a KPI
Keeping people safe and healthy is a moral 
and a business imperative that applies 
to all who work for and on behalf of Mondi. 
Our Social Psychology of Risk approach 
supports our goal of sending everybody 
home safely, every day.

Strategic review 

Mondi delivered a resilient performance in 
2023 as a result of our compelling 
customer service and delivery, supported 
by our scale, quality asset base, integrated 
model and breadth of products, customers 
and end-markets. As always, my thanks 
to colleagues around the world for 
their commitment. 

Underlying EBITDA

€1.2 billion

Cash generated from operations

€1.3 billion

Ordinary dividend per share

70.0 euro cents

Strong cash generation
While underlying EBITDA of €1,201 million 
was lower than the very strong performance 
in the prior year, our cash generation 
remained ahead of last year at €1,312 million.

Investing for value accretive growth
This strong cash generation gives us the 
strategic flexibility to continue investing in 
our business through-cycle, supported by 
our confidence in the long-term structural 
growth of the markets we operate in and 
our leading positions within them. We 
continue to make good progress in 
delivering our organic growth projects, 
which remain on track and on budget. We 
expect these projects to deliver a 
meaningful EBITDA contribution from 2025.

Outlook
In the first quarter of 2024, selling prices 
are generally lower than the averages 
achieved in the second half of 2023. 
However, we are seeing improvements in 
our order books and are implementing 
price increases across our range of paper 
grades. Input costs remain elevated 
compared to historical levels but have 
broadly stabilised since the end of 2023. 

We remain well positioned to capitalise as 
demand improves with our strong 
operational leverage and organic growth 
investment projects.

Shareholder returns
It is our continued confidence in the future 
of our business which has resulted in the 
Board recommending a total ordinary 
dividend for the year of 70.0 euro cents per 
share, in line with 2022.

Group performance review
Mondi delivered underlying EBITDA of 
€1,201 million in the year (2022: 
€1,848 million). Group revenue was down 
on lower selling prices and sales volumes 
as a result of softer market demand and 
the impact of customer destocking, which 
abated over the course of the year. The 
Group's underlying EBITDA margin was 
16.4% (2022: 20.8%).

Corrugated Packaging delivered underlying 
EBITDA of €310 million in the year, down 
53% on the prior year (2022: €662 million). 
Underlying EBITDA margin was lower at 
13.6% as a result of selling prices declining 
more than input costs. Containerboard 
sales volumes were broadly stable despite 
the backdrop of softer market demand, 
while in Corrugated Solutions, good margin 
management supported a stable year on 
year financial performance.

Flexible Packaging's underlying EBITDA 
was €637 million, 20% lower than the 
previous year (2022: €797 million), mainly 
as a result of lower sales volumes. 
Underlying EBITDA margin was 16.5%. 
Although profitability was lower than the 
very strong performance in 2022, the 
business showed resilience due to its high 
level of integration across the kraft paper 
and paper bag value chain together with its 
exposure to consumer-focused markets.

Uncoated Fine Paper delivered underlying 
EBITDA of €289 million in the year, down 
32% (2022: €427 million) largely due to 
lower selling prices. Underlying EBITDA 
margin was 22.4%. Our geographic and 
product diversification supported our 
performance with higher uncoated fine 
paper and pulp sales volumes in South 
Africa mitigating lower European volumes.

Return on capital employed (ROCE) was 
lower at 12.8% (2022: 23.7%), reflecting the 
lower profitability in the year. This lower 
profitability, together with lower net finance 
costs, resulted in basic underlying earnings 
per share of 107.8 euro cents (2022: 195.6 
euro cents). 

The Group continued to exhibit its strong 
cash-generative characteristics with cash 
generated from operations increasing in the 
year to €1,312 million (2022: €1,292 million). 
This strong through-cycle cash generation 
continues to support our ongoing 
investment in the business and ensures we 
are well positioned to meet future demand 
for sustainable packaging and paper 
products.

Investing at Kuopio for  
sustainable growth
We recently started up our 
€125 million modernisation 
investment at our Kuopio mill in 
Finland. The investment will increase 
semi-chemical fluting capacity 
by 55,000 tonnes per annum 
and meet the growing demand 
for the high-performing, top quality 
containerboard grade produced 
at the mill which is used in fresh 
fruit and vegetable boxes and trays. 
It will furthermore enhance product 
quality and cost competitiveness.

The investment will also contribute 
towards our ambitious MAP2030 
sustainability commitments including 
reduced greenhouse gas, noise, 
odour and effluent emissions, 
enhancing resource and energy 
efficiency, and improving 
occupational safety.

Investing for value accretive 
growth
Our capital investment programme is focused 
on meeting the growing demand for 
sustainable packaging; enhancing our product 
offering, quality and service to customers; 
strengthening our cost competitiveness; and 
improving our environmental footprint. Given 
our confidence in the long-term structural 
growth of the packaging markets we operate 
in, and our leading positions within them, we 
seek to invest through the cycle to deliver 
value accretive growth.

We are making good progress on our €1.2 
billion of approved investments in organic 
growth projects, which remain on track and on 
budget. These projects are diversified across 
our value chain, products and geographic reach 
and comprise €0.6 billion of investments in 
Corrugated Packaging and €0.6 billion of 
investments in Flexible Packaging. By the end 
of 2024, we expect to have invested around 
80% of the approved amount. We expect 
these projects to deliver a meaningful EBITDA 
contribution from 2025. 

Investing for growth
Page 30-31

In Corrugated Packaging, most of these 
projects are at, or close to, start up including 
investments at our Kuopio mill (Finland), 
Świecie mill (Poland) and Polish corrugated 
solutions plants. Our Duino mill (Italy) is 
expected to start up in 2025 as planned. In 
Flexible Packaging, we continue to make 
progress on our pipeline, with most projects, 
including the new paper machine at Štětí 
(Czech Republic), expected to ramp up from 
2025. We expect our projects to take two to 
three years to achieve full production 
following their commissioning, delivering mid-
teen returns through-cycle when fully 
operational.

In addition, we have recently completed the 
acquisition of the Hinton Pulp mill in Alberta 
(Canada) for a total consideration of USD 5 
million. The mill has the capacity to produce 
around 250,000 tonnes of pulp per annum 
and will provide the Group with access to 
local, high-quality fibre from a well-established 
wood basket. We intend to invest in the mill 
to improve productivity and sustainability 
performance and, subject to pre-engineering 
and permitting, expand the facility primarily 
with a new kraft paper machine which will 
integrate our paper bag operations in the 
Americas and support future growth.

Prioritising growth in our 
packaging businesses
In 2023, our packaging businesses 
contributed 77% of the Group’s underlying 
EBITDA (excluding corporate costs). 
These businesses operate in structurally 
growing packaging markets and are 
supported by increasing demand for more 
sustainable packaging solutions. To 
capture this future growth, and build on 
our leading market positions where 
we operate, we invest in our asset 
base through-cycle with our growth 
investments directed towards packaging. 

Over the past five years in our continuing 
operations, total capital expenditure and 
acquisitions have exceeded depreciation 
and disposals by €1.2 billion. Over this 
period, capital expenditure as a 
percentage of depreciation was 163%, 
with our organic growth capital 
expenditure and all acquisitions focused 
on the Group’s packaging businesses. 
Acquisitions continue to be a key part 
of our investment strategy. Opportunities 
are rigorously assessed in terms of both 
financial metrics and strategic fit, with 
a focus on those opportunities that 
complement our existing footprint 
and capabilities.

Our current organic growth pipeline 
is outlined on the previous page.

Circular Driven Solutions
We offer our customers a broad range 
of sustainable packaging and paper 
products. These contribute towards 
addressing the global challenges of 
climate change and plastic pollution 
with the efficient use of natural 
resources, to keep materials in 
circulation and eliminate waste in a 
circular bioeconomy. In 2023, 85% of 
our packaging and paper revenue was 
from reusable, recyclable or 
compostable products, up from 74% in 
2020, our baseline year for this target. 
Our Corrugated Packaging and 
Uncoated Fine Paper product portfolios 
are already at 100%, while in Flexible 
Packaging we currently have 
sustainable packaging solutions 
available, or identified and in 
development, for 94% of their product 
portfolio based on revenue, and are 
continuing our efforts to develop 
sustainable solutions for the small 
number of remaining products. 

In addition, we collaborate across our 
business to identify opportunities to 
achieve our long-term target of 
eliminating waste to landfill from our 
manufacturing processes. In 2023, we 
successfully reduced our specific 
waste to landfill by 44% compared to 
the 2020 baseline mainly by finding 
alternative uses for waste that was 
previously landfilled.

Innovating to deliver 
sustainable solutions
Our product innovation initiatives 
focus on developing fit-for-purpose 
packaging solutions for our 
customers. We continue to receive 
recognition for our products, 
including being awarded four 2024 
WorldStar Packaging Awards. 

As one of our award-winning 
products, Hug&Hold is a paper-
based and fully recyclable 
packaging solution that replaces 
plastic shrink wrap for PET 
beverage bottle bundle packs. It 
comprises a kraft paper sleeve and 
a corrugated clip to secure the 
bottles and offer a comfortable 
handle for transportation.

As part of a critically reviewed life 
cycle assessment, the carbon 
footprint of Hug&Hold was 43% 
less than plastic shrink wrap made 
without recycled material and 15% 
less than plastic shrink wrap made 
from 100% recycled content.

Created by Empowered People
Our goal is to be an employer of 
choice by empowering our people to 
realise their potential and contribute to 
Mondi's ongoing success. Through 
engagement, such as the Group-wide 
Employee Survey and development 
initiatives, including training and 
upskilling programmes, we support our 
employees to build skills that support 
long-term employability and provide 
purposeful employment in a diverse 
and inclusive workplace. 

The safety and health of our people 
always comes first. We have 
committed to reduce our Total 
Recordable Case Rate (TRCR) by 15% 
by 2030 against a 2020 baseline, along 
with targets for zero fatalities and life-
altering injuries. We continue to be 
among industry leaders with a 0.64 
TRCR performance in 2023, which 
represents a 4% improvement on our 
2020 baseline. We however deeply 
regret the fatality at our Ružomberok 
facility (Slovakia) in late November. In 
addition, there were four life-altering 
injuries at our operations in the year. 
Our thoughts go out to those involved, 
and to their families, friends and work 
colleagues. All incidents are 
investigated and actions taken where 
necessary to prevent reoccurrence.

Taking Action on Climate
We have a long track record of 
delivering on climate action and 
continue to make good progress 
towards achieving our Net-Zero 
commitment by 2050. In the near 
term, our targets, approved by the 
Science Based Targets initiative, 
commit us to reduce absolute 
Scope 1 and 2 greenhouse gas 
(GHG) emissions by 46.2% and 
Scope 3 GHG emissions by 27.5% 
by 2030 from a 2019 base year. In 
2023, compared to our 2019 
baseline, we have reduced our 
absolute Scope 1 and 2 GHG 
emissions by 22% and our Scope 3 
emissions by 21%, on track to meet 
our 2030 targets. 

We continue to focus on climate 
resilience, maintaining zero 
deforestation in our wood supply, 
sourcing wood responsibly, and 
safeguarding biodiversity and water 
resources in our operations and 
beyond.

What we produce
Mondi is a leading producer of corrugated 
packaging with a cost-competitive asset 
base and strong customer offering focused 
on quality and reliability. We are the leading 
virgin containerboard producer in Europe 
and the largest containerboard producer in 
emerging Europe. Our virgin 
containerboard is a high-quality product 
with excellent properties for specialised 
end-use applications, ideal to meet our 
customers' needs around the globe. 

We are also a leading corrugated solutions 
producer across central and emerging 
Europe. We leverage our integrated 
production network and partner with 
our customers to create fully recyclable 
corrugated boxes and packaging.

Performance during the year
Corrugated Packaging delivered underlying 
EBITDA of €310 million in the year, down 
53% on the prior year (2022: €662 million). 
Underlying EBITDA margin was lower at 
13.6% as a result of selling prices declining 
more than input costs. 

Examples of our products
Snug&Strong
A custom-made, fit-for-purpose 
corrugated solution designed to 
replace expanded polystyrene (EPS) 
components in household appliance 
packaging with a more sustainable 
alternative.

ProVantage KraftTop LinerX
A recyclable, lightweight and high-
strength containerboard solution with 
a wide range of end-uses, from food 
and beverage to luxury packaging.

Containerboard sales volumes were broadly 
stable despite the backdrop of softer 
market demand and the impact from our 
project-related shuts in the fourth quarter 
of the year, a reflection of our strong cost 
position, strength in niche products, and 
global reach of our sales infrastructure. 
Selling prices were lower in the year with 
sharp declines during the first half followed 
by a period of stabilisation in the second 
half. In response to improved demand 
reflected in strong order books, we 
announced price increases in February 
2024 across our range of containerboard 
grades. 

In Corrugated Solutions, good margin 
management supported a stable year on 
year financial performance despite 3% 
lower box volumes compared to the prior 
year in the face of lower demand.

Investing for growth
At the end of the year, we started up the 
€125 million investment project at our 
Kuopio mill (Finland). This project will 
increase semi-chemical fluting capacity by 
55,000 tonnes when fully ramped up, 
enhance product quality, drive cost 
competitiveness, and strengthen the mill’s 
environmental performance. 

We also have several other capital investment 
projects that are expected to start up during 
2024. These projects include our €95 million 
debottlenecking project at Świecie (Poland) 
which will increase capacity by 55,000 tonnes 
per annum when fully ramped up, together 
with expansion projects at our Simet and 
Warsaw corrugated solutions plants in Poland 
that will support growth and enhance our 
product and service offering.

Our €200 million investment at Duino 
(Italy) to convert the existing paper 
machine into a high-quality, cost-
competitive recycled containerboard 
machine with an annual capacity of 420,000 
tonnes is ongoing. Start-up of the machine 
is expected, as planned, for 2025.

What we produce
We are a global flexible packaging 
producer, integrated across the value chain 
with a unique portfolio of solutions. As a 
global leader in the production of kraft 
paper and paper bags, our well-invested 
mills produce high-quality kraft paper that 
is converted into strong, lightweight paper-
based packaging. With our high level of 
integration across the value chain, our 
customers come to us for scale, security of 
supply and global reach. 

We are also a leading producer of 
consumer flexible packaging in Europe and 
have broad coating capabilities which 
together provide an extensive and unique 
range of paper, plastic and hybrid 
packaging solutions.

Performance during the year
Flexible Packaging's underlying EBITDA 
was €637 million, 20% lower than the 
previous year (2022: €797 million), mainly 
as a result of lower sales volumes. 
Underlying EBITDA margin was 16.5%. 
Although profitability was lower than the 
very strong performance in 2022, the 
business showed resilience due to its high 
level of integration across the kraft paper 
and paper bag value chain together with its 
exposure to consumer-focused markets. 

Examples of our products
MailerBAG
A sustainability-focused, patented 
paper bag for eCommerce shipments 
that offers cost efficiency and 
customer experience. Available in 
a wide range of designs and sizes.

FlexiBag Recyclable
A fully recyclable, mono-material bag 
with convenient features and barrier 
properties suited for dry food and 
pet food.

Sales volumes across our kraft paper and 
paper bag value chain were lower in the 
year as a result of weaker demand in line 
with softer economic conditions. While 
prices declined over the course of the year, 
our service and product offering, and high 
level of integration resulted in 2023 pricing 
remaining, on average, similar to 2022 
levels. Current pricing is below average 
2023 price levels. In kraft paper, we are 
implementing price increases on the back 
of improving order books which we expect 
to take effect from the second quarter of 
2024.

Consumer Flexibles and Functional Paper 
and Films delivered a stable financial 
performance as we continue to offer our 
customers a broad range of innovative 
packaging solutions.

Investing for growth
We continue to invest across our platform. 
We are making good progress with our 
€400 million investment in a new 210,000 
tonne per annum kraft paper machine at 
Štětí (Czech Republic) with start-up 
expected in 2025 and ramp up to 2027, 
together with a number of investments 
across our converting plant network which 
remain on track and on budget. These 
projects include expanding and upgrading 
the global reach of our paper bag network, 
investments to consolidate our leading 
position in European pet food packaging, 
and projects to enhance our European 
coating capabilities.

In addition, we have recently completed the 
acquisition of the Hinton Pulp mill in Alberta 
(Canada) for a total consideration of USD 5 
million. The mill has the capacity to produce 
around 250,000 tonnes of pulp per annum 
and will provide the Group with access to 
local, high-quality fibre from a well-
established wood basket.

What we produce
Our Uncoated Fine Paper business 
produces a wide range of home, office, 
converting and professional printing papers 
at our mills in central Europe and South 
Africa. We are the supplier of choice for 
our customers, leveraging our leading 
positions in these regions. In South Africa, 
we also produce and sell market pulp to 
customers around the world.

Performance during the year
Uncoated Fine Paper delivered underlying 
EBITDA of €289 million in the year, down 
32% (2022: €427 million) largely due to 
lower selling prices. Underlying EBITDA 
margin was 22.4%. Our geographic and 
product diversification supported our 
performance with higher uncoated fine 
paper and pulp sales volumes in South 
Africa mitigating lower European volumes.

European uncoated fine paper market 
demand was significantly lower compared 
to the prior year driven by weak economic 
conditions. Selling prices declined during 
the year, however the rate of decline 
slowed as we progressed through the 
period. We successfully implemented price 
increases in early 2024. 

In response to the ongoing structural 
decline in demand for uncoated fine paper 
in Europe, we streamlined production by 
permanently closing an uncoated fine 
paper machine at our unintegrated 
Neusiedler operations in Austria during the 
year.

In South Africa, uncoated fine paper market 
conditions were broadly stable on the prior 
year. The business received income from 
an insurance claim in the year relating to 
the floods in South Africa during 2022.

Pulp sales volumes were higher following 
the start-up of the rebuilt recovery boiler at 
our integrated Richards Bay mill (South 
Africa) in the prior year. Market pulp prices 
declined sharply during the year followed 
by modest increases towards the end of 
the year.

The non-cash forestry fair value gain was 
lower in the year at €128 million (2022: 
€169 million).

Our Uncoated Fine Paper business remains 
well placed, with our customers valuing us 
as a supplier of choice and recognising the 
strength of our leadership positions, 
underpinned by a broad product portfolio, 
integrated asset base and excellent service.

Embedding sustainability across our business units

Sustainability is central to our strategy and intrinsic in the way we operate. We promote an entrepreneurial culture that empowers each 
business unit to take the necessary actions to contribute towards meeting our ambitious MAP2030 sustainability targets. Some of our 
recent initiatives include:

Turning residues into resources 
Corrugated Packaging
We have an ambition to eliminate waste to landfill. 
We aim to find alternative uses for by-products from 
our manufacturing processes including as secondary raw 
materials. At our Kuopio mill in Finland, we partnered with 
Soilfood, a manufacturer of soil improvement products for 
agriculture, to utilise the fibre residues produced by the mill 
for landscaping, with around 42,000 tonnes of fibre residues 
used in 2023.

Fo(u)r Safety programme at Štětí 
Flexible Packaging
Our approach to safety includes physical, psychological 
and cultural elements, ensuring we can anticipate, 
prepare and react accordingly through balancing safety 
controls, people and culture. During the year, our Štětí mill 
in Czech Republic reviewed and updated its Fo(u)r Safety 
programme by engaging with young colleagues from our 
future leaders programme and selected line managers to 
promote the programme and increase awareness of it. 
Since the update, the participation rate in group intervention 
and stopping each other from unsafe acts almost doubled, 
contributing to an improvement in our culture across the mill. 

Promoting sustainable forestry 
in South Africa
Uncoated Fine Paper 
In South Africa, we continue to maintain our FSC and PEFC 
certification for 100% of our forestry landholdings and have 
an opportunity to lead the way in developing best practice 
silviculture and other forest management practices to 
promote tree growth and resilience. We go beyond our 
own landholdings and empower other landowners, especially 
smallholders, through our Mondi Zimele programme. In 2023, 
192,801 tonnes of wood were sourced from small growers 
(1-10 ha. landholdings) and 2.4 million seedlings distributed 
in the planting season.

The underlying tax charge for the year was 
€167 million (2022: €296 million) giving an 
effective tax rate of 23.6% (2022: 22.5%). In 
2024, we expect an effective tax rate of 
around 23-24%.

Basic underlying earnings per share were 
107.8 euro cents (2022: 195.6 euro cents) 
reflecting the lower profitability in the year 
mitigated by lower net finance costs. After 
taking the effect of special items into account, 
basic earnings per share were 103.5 euro 
cents (2022: 244.5 euro cents).

Group performance 
Mondi delivered Group revenue of €7,330 
million (2022: €8,902 million) and 
underlying EBITDA of €1,201 million (2022: 
€1,848 million) resulting in a lower 
underlying EBITDA margin at 16.4% (2022: 
20.8%).

Overall sales volumes and selling prices 
were lower compared to the previous year. 
So far in 2024, selling prices are lower than 
average 2023 prices levels. We are seeing 
improvements in our order books and 
implementing price increases across our 
range of paper grades. 

Input costs were lower compared to the 
prior year with higher wood unit costs more 
than offset by lower energy and paper for 
recycling costs. Wood prices declined over 
the course of the year from their peak 
levels recorded in early 2023 but remained, 
on average, higher than the prior year. 
Following record levels in 2022, energy 
prices in Europe reduced and remained 
materially lower in 2023. Paper for recycling 
prices were also significantly lower. As we 
enter 2024, input costs are broadly stable 
compared to the end of 2023, and below 
average 2023 price levels. 

Personnel, maintenance and other net 
operating expenses were lower in the year 
with ongoing cost reduction initiatives and 
insurance income more than offsetting 
inflationary cost pressures. The non-cash 
forestry fair value gain was €128 million 
(2022: €169 million). 

Depreciation, amortisation and impairment 
underlying charges of €411 million were 
broadly similar to the prior year (2022: 
€405 million). We expect a charge in 2024 
of around €425-450 million.

Net finance costs of €73 million were lower 
than the prior year (2022: €143 million) 
driven by an increase in investment income 
as a result of higher cash balances and 
interest rates, and currency mix effects. In 
2024, following the special dividend 
distribution and related decrease in 
investment income, we expect net finance 
costs of around €100 million.

The Group recognised a €27 million special 
item charge (before tax) in the year in 
respect of the closure of a paper machine 
and streamlining capacity of the finishing 
lines at the Neusiedler operations in Austria 
(2022: €242 million gain before tax in 
respect of the sale of the Personal Care 
Components business).

Financial review continued

Cash flow 
Cash generated from operations was 
€1,312 million (2022: €1,292 million), 
reflecting the Group's continued strong 
cash-generating capability. Working capital 
improved with a net inflow of €229 million 
in the year on the back of lower inventory 
levels (2022: outflow of €419 million). As a 
percentage of revenue, working capital 
ended the year at 14.8% (2022: 14.4%), 
slightly above our 12-14% through-cycle 
range, as expected at this point in the 
cycle.

Capital expenditure was in line with our 
expectations, at €830 million (2022: 
€508 million) as a result of investing in our 
organic growth projects directed towards 
growing our packaging businesses. We 
expect our total capital expenditure in 2024 
to be €800-900 million as we continue to 
invest in our organic growth projects. 
Thereafter, in the absence of further 
significant organic growth opportunities, we 
would expect capital expenditure to trend 
towards depreciation levels following the 
completion of our current approved 
projects.

Tax paid was €178 million (2022: €196 
million) and total interest paid was €103 
million (2022: €127 million) including 
derivative interest. We paid ordinary 
dividends to shareholders of €345 million 
(2022: €321 million) in the year. 

The Group received proceeds of 
€806 million from the disposal of its 
Russian operations in the year. After taking 
into account the associated transaction and 
other costs, the Group distributed the net 
proceeds by way of a €1.60 per share 
special dividend to shareholders on 13 
February 2024.

Discontinued operations' 
disposal and distribution of net 
proceeds with share 
consolidation
The Group's previously owned Russian 
operations were, since June 2022, 
accounted for as discontinued operations. 

In June 2023, the Group received proceeds 
of €30 million following the completion of 
the sale of its three Russian packaging 
converting operations and in October 2023, 
the Group completed the sale of the 
Syktyvkar mill, its most significant facility in 
the country, and received proceeds of 
€776 million from the disposal. These 
disposals concluded the Group's exit from 
Russia.

The loss after tax from discontinued 
operations was €655 million in the year. 
This included a loss on disposal, net of 
related transaction costs and tax, of 
€756 million, of which €633 million related 
to the reclassification of the foreign 
currency translation reserve, which was 
recycled through the income statement on 
the date of disposal.

per share. The final dividend, together with 
the interim dividend, amount to a total 
dividend for the year of 70.0 euro cents 
per share, in line with 2022 (70.0 euro cents 
per share). Maintaining the dividend per 
share in line with last year reflects our 
strong cash flow, robust balance sheet and 
the Board’s confidence in the future of the 
business.

The net proceeds, comprising total 
proceeds as outlined above of 
€806 million, less the associated 
transaction and other costs, were 
distributed to shareholders on 13 February 
2024 by way of a special dividend of €1.60 
per share.

The final dividend is subject to the approval 
of the shareholders of Mondi plc at the 
Annual General Meeting scheduled for 
Friday 3 May 2024 and, if approved, will be 
paid on Tuesday 14 May 2024 to 
shareholders on the register at the close of 
business on Friday 5 April 2024.

Refer to note 28 in the notes to the 
consolidated financial statements for 
further information.

Following the approval of the special 
dividend in early 2024, and in order to 
maintain comparability of Mondi’s share 
price before and after payment so far as 
possible, the Group completed a share 
consolidation on 29 January 2024 whereby 
shareholders received 10 new ordinary 
shares for every 11 existing ordinary shares 
held. 

Disciplined capital allocation
Strategic financial priorities 
We believe that a strong and stable 
financial position, supported by an 
investment grade credit rating, increases 
our flexibility and provides access to capital 
markets through the business cycle. This in 
turn allows us to invest through the cycle 
and take advantage of strategic 
opportunities when they arise. To deliver on 
our strategy, we maintain an appropriate 
capital structure with a balance between 
equity and net debt. 

We are focused on undertaking selective 
organic capital investment opportunities in our 
packaging businesses and supporting the 
ordinary dividend. To the extent we have 
capacity beyond these requirements, we are 
able to consider acquisitions and/or additional 
shareholder distributions. We remain focused 
on allocating capital while maintaining solid 
investment grade credit metrics.

Ordinary dividend
We have a disciplined capital allocation 
policy ensuring we can invest in the 
business through the cycle for long-term 
growth and deliver attractive returns, while 
supporting the ordinary dividend.

The Board has recommended a final 2023 
ordinary dividend of 46.67 euro cents 

Managing our financial risks
Our capital structure
Capital employed is used to fund our 
business and is managed on a basis that 
enables the Group to continue trading as 
a going concern, while delivering attractive 
returns to shareholders. 

We maintain an appropriate capital 
structure, with a balance between equity 
and net debt, in order to sustain our 
investment grade credit rating. We have 
diverse sources of funding with various 
debt maturities. 

The primary sources of the Group’s liquidity 
include our €3 billion Guaranteed Euro 
Medium Term Note Programme, our €750 
million syndicated revolving credit facility 
and financing from various banks and other 
credit agencies, thus providing us with 
access to diverse sources of debt financing 
with varying debt maturities.

Liquidity, treasury and borrowings
Mondi retains a strong financial position.  
Including receipt of the proceeds from the 
disposal of the Group's Russian operations, 
net debt at 31 December 2023 was 
€419 million, with net debt to underlying 
EBITDA at 0.3 times (31 December 2022: 
€1,011 million, 0.5 times). Adjusting for the 
special dividend paid in February 2024, the 
pro-forma net debt and net debt to 
underlying EBITDA was €1,195 million and 
1.0 times, respectively.

At 31 December 2023, Mondi's liquidity 
position was €2.3 billion, comprising €754 
million of undrawn committed debt facilities 
and cash and cash equivalents of €1,592 
million. Adjusting for the special dividend 
paid in February 2024, the Group retains a 
strong liquidity position of €1.6 billion. The 
weighted average maturity of the Group's 
committed debt facilities was 2.8 years at

Our approach to tax is formalised in our 
publicly available tax strategy, which the 
Board reviews and approves each year. 

While ultimate responsibility for the tax 
affairs of the Group rests with the Board, 
the Executive Committee ensures that the 
tax governance framework is aligned with 
the principles of financial management 
applied throughout the Group. At both 
Board and Executive Committee level, the 
Group CFO is accountable for the Group’s 
tax affairs. 

We have dedicated internal tax resources 
throughout the organisation, supported by 
a centralised Group Tax function that takes 
day-to-day responsibility for management 
of the Group’s tax affairs. We maintain 
a detailed set of operational guidelines 
aimed at ensuring a robust tax control 
environment. In addition, we seek regular 
professional advice to ensure that we 
remain up to date with changes in tax 
legislation, disclosure requirements and 
best practice. 

Tax risks are monitored on a continuous 
basis and are more formally reviewed on a 
half-yearly basis by the Audit Committee 
as part of our half-yearly reporting 
process. The Board formally reviews tax 
management activities on an annual basis. 
As Mondi operates in a number of 
countries, each with a different tax system, 
the Group is regularly subject to routine tax 
audits and tax authority reviews which 
may take a considerable period of time 
to conclude. We maintain a constructive 
dialogue with tax authorities, working in 
a transparent manner to resolve disputes. 
Where necessary, provision is made for 
known issues and the expected outcomes 
of any negotiations or settlements.

the end of the year with the only significant 
short-term repayment relating to the 
Group's €500 million Eurobond that 
matures in April 2024. Our financing 
agreements do not contain financial 
covenants.

The Group maintained its investment grade 
credit ratings. In May 2023, Standard & 
Poor’s upgraded the Group's credit rating 
from BBB+ to A- (stable outlook). Moody’s 
Investors Service reaffirmed the Group's 
credit rating at Baa1 (stable outlook) during 
the year.

Currencies
Our global presence results in exposure to 
foreign exchange risk in the ordinary course 
of business. Currency exposures arise from 
commercial transactions denominated in 
foreign currencies, financial assets and 
liabilities denominated in foreign currencies 
and translational exposure on our net 
investments in foreign operations.

Our policy is to fund subsidiaries in their 
local functional currency wherever practical. 
External funding is obtained in a range of 
currencies and, where required, converted 
into the subsidiaries’ functional currencies 
through the swap market.

We hedge material net balance sheet 
exposures and committed capital 
expenditure. We do not hedge our 
exposures to projected future sales or 
purchases. We do not take speculative 
positions with derivative contracts.

Tax
We aim to manage our tax affairs in 
accordance with national legislative 
provisions and within the guidelines set 
down by the Organisation for Economic 
Co-operation and Development (OECD). 
Our objective is to structure our operations 
tax efficiently and take advantage of 
available incentives and exemptions 
provided by governments for eligible 
capital investments, R&D and similar 
expenditure. We do not enter into any 
artificial arrangements and tax decisions 
are made in response to business 
transactions and activities.

Stakeholder engagement and Section 172
How stakeholder considerations
shape decision-making

Listening to and partnering with our diverse stakeholder groups helps us to better understand 
external developments and market expectations as well as to identify opportunities and risks. 
Our ongoing engagements support transparency and enable us to build strong, trusting relationships.

More than 16,800 employees participated 
in our 2023 Employee Survey, providing 
feedback on positive experiences and 
areas for improvement. We continued 
supporting individual career development, 
with programmes such as the 
International Graduate Programme, 
NEXGEN and Mondi Academy. 
Employees and contractors across Mondi 
completed 503,000 hours of training. 
Around 31% of all employees took part 
in the Performance and Development 
Review process.

We continued with D&I initiatives, such 
as Curious Community and launched 
Employee Resource Groups. Making a 
Difference Day took place again across 
most of Mondi’s locations. 94% of our 
employees worldwide were able to access 
the Employee Assistance Programme or 
equivalent for support. Safety continued 
to be a key priority, but sadly an employee 
in our Świecie Corrugated plant (Poland) 
and an employee in our Frantschach mill 
(Austria) experienced a life-altering injury 
this year.

Our employees
Key topics raised in 2023 
and our response
Themes highlighted centred around 
feedback and recognition, diversity 
and inclusion, personal development 
opportunities, and mental health.

In 2023, we conducted Product Impact 
Assessments on 1,145 products and 
calculated 146 product carbon footprints. 
To deepen our understanding of our 
customers’ expectations, over 1,700 
customers took part in our Customer 
Survey. Mondi hosted the ‘Let’s Paper the 
World 2023 Summit’ in Sofia (Bulgaria), 
with over 110 guests (including industry 
professionals, equipment manufacturers, 
brand owners, retailers and suppliers).

Mondi also convened the first ever 
Roundtable for the Circularity of 
Paper Bags in Madrid (Spain), with 
representatives from the industry 
and value chain. We continued our 
customer collaboration to develop 
solutions to meet customers’ sustainability 
goals and maintained our ongoing 
collaborations with multi-stakeholder 
initiatives, such as 4evergreen, CEFLEX, 
and the Ellen MacArthur Foundation.

We sadly report that during normal 
operation, we experienced a fatality of a 
contractor at Ružomberok (Slovakia) while 
operating mobile equipment. A contractor 
in our Świecie Corrugated plant (Poland) 
and a contractor in our Ružomberok mill 
(Slovakia) experienced a life-altering injury 
during normal operation. 

In 2023, we ran the Responsible 
Procurement campaign with a pilot group 
of 460 Mondi suppliers using EcoVadis. 
We hosted our first Supplier Virtual Event 
on Net-Zero and our Flexible Packaging 
business organised an event on the 
future for barrier materials. The safety 
of our contractors remained a priority, 
particularly during maintenance shuts. 
Annual maintenance shuts saw over 
22,000 contractors working on our sites, 
during which we reported zero 
life-altering injuries and more than 
2.2 million hours worked. 

Our customers
Key topics raised in 2023 
and our response
Our customer engagement continued 
to focus on topics including security 
of supply, product quality, the circular 
economy, legislative developments, 
competitive advantage, carbon emissions 
and life cycle-based assessments.

Our suppliers and contractors
Key topics raised in 2023 
and our response
Local sourcing, secure contracts and fair 
and transparent tender processes are key 
topics for our supplier engagement. 
There is increasing attention on the 
environmental and social performance of 
suppliers and contractors.

Mondi Świecie (Poland) established a 
programme in which 36 local projects 
received a grant. Together with the 
Austrian Development Agency and other 
partners, we supported the development 
of a dual educational programme in 
Côte d’Ivoire that combines theoretical 
school education with practical training 
in companies. We also hosted open 
Stakeholder Engagement Conversations 
with various local stakeholder groups 
in our mill in Ružomberok (Slovakia). 

Our discussions included the Group’s  
organic investment projects to capture 
future growth through capacity expansion 
together with investments to improve 
our sustainability performance and drive 
productivity and efficiency gains.

Our mills continued to serve local 
communities with power supply, 
wastewater treatment and waste disposal 
services. In 2023, following earthquakes in 
Türkiye and Syria, Mondi produced over 
200,000 corrugated boxes to help 
governmental organisations providing 
relief aid. We also donated €500,000 
to help the UN World Food Programme’s 
humanitarian aid work in affected areas.

In South Africa, Mondi Zimele continues 
to support livelihoods, having helped 
34 small and medium enterprises 
and supported over 2,240 jobs to date.

In addition, the divestment of the Group’s 
previously owned Russian assets were 
discussed. The Group completed the 
sale of its operations in the country 
in October 2023 with net proceeds 
distributed to shareholders in 
February 2024 by way of a special 
dividend of €1.60 per share. 

The Board recommended a final ordinary 
dividend for the year which, together with 
the interim dividend was in line with last 
year at 70.0 euro cents per share.

Our communities
Key topics raised in 2023 
and our response
We invested €7.3 million in social initiatives 
supporting health, environmental protection, 
education, local enterprise and 
infrastructure.

Our investors
Key topics raised in 2023 
and our response
During investor meetings, discussions 
focused on strategy, capital allocation, 
the investment in new capacity expansion 
projects and returns. 

We maintained our membership of 
the WBCSD’s Forest Solutions Group 
and actively supported the development 
of the forest sector nature positive 
roadmap and catalogue of key 
carbonisation actions. 

The second version of 4evergreen’s 
Circularity by Design Guideline for 
fibre-based packaging was released, 
which informed our Path to Circularity 
Scorecard update, as well as its updated 
Guidance on Collection and Sorting. 

Partners and industry 
associations
Key topics raised in 2023 
and our response
Our partnerships aim to promote solutions 
for climate change, biodiversity and water 
stewardship, responsible sourcing, circular 
economy and food waste.

We continued to engage with IUFRO, 
focusing on a joint synthesis study on the 
drivers for the future supply of forest 
goods and services. In 2023, Mondi South 
Africa launched a partnership with the 
EWT and together worked on an initial 
assessment of the biodiversity footprint 
of Mondi’s South African plantations. 

Together with industry associations such 
as Cepi, FPE and FEFCO, we worked to 
shape the industry position and advocacy 
strategy towards the Packaging and 
Packaging Waste Regulation.

Stakeholder engagement and Section 172 continued

Mondi’s strategic decision-making framework focuses on delivering sustainable value for key 
stakeholders, and relies on the quality of the relationships it has with them. The Board’s deliberations 
take into account the long-term interests of our stakeholders, along with the impact of our business 
and the balance of actions required to deliver sustainable growth.

Our approach
Mondi categorises its stakeholders into six key groups 
described in the preceding pages and reviews these annually. 
As part of the Board’s responsibilities and as a methodology 
for maximising the effectiveness of their decisions, the directors 
debate stakeholder considerations in the short, medium and 
long term, taking account of four key principles:

1. Local and personal engagement
The Board has determined the most effective and scalable way 
of engaging stakeholders is to embed responsibilities throughout 
the organisation, while facilitating regular feedback from 
colleagues who maintain strong day-to-day relationships with 
our stakeholders. The Executive Committee and Sustainable 
Development Committee are important mechanisms for 
reporting these insights to the Board on a regular basis.
2. Informed decision-making
The Board seeks to understand the material issues relevant 
to stakeholders as they evolve. In addition to the regular 
feedback it receives from stakeholders and colleagues, the 
Group carries out an established materiality assessment, 
which is conducted every three years or more often if needed.
3. Long-term horizons
To grow and protect value, the Board maintains a long-term 
view that stretches beyond the projected tenure of the 
directors and considers impacts far into the future. This can be 
seen with the longer-term focus of our MAP2030 framework, 
the Group's investment pipeline and approach to acquisitions.

4. Two-way dialogue
Long-term decision-making, trade-offs and the nuances 
of local relationships mean it is important not only to take 
stakeholders into account at Board level, but to effectively 
communicate our actions to them. This is integral to how 
Mondi communicates and manages its reputation, supporting 
the Board’s focus on promoting the strongest standards 
of business ethics and governance.

Two-way dialogue
Understanding the experience and views of employees 
and keeping them abreast of the latest business 
developments is a key area of focus for the Board. 

Corporate governance report – Stakeholder engagement 
Page 92-95

Mondi’s biennial Employee Survey is the primary tool for 
the Board to gain cross-sectional, Company-wide insights 
on employee views and issues. This is supported by a 
number of engagement mechanisms at more regular 
touchpoints which include: employee forums, site visits, 
SpeakOut reports from the Group's anonymous 
whistleblowing and grievance platform, a rolling programme 
of Board presentations and safety reports. In addition 
to this, and to further facilitate engagement, independent 
non-executive director Sue Clark is responsible for leading 
employee engagement on behalf of the Board.

As an example of our approach, during the year Sue Clark 
participated in Mondi’s European Communication Forum, 
a yearly event that includes employee representatives from 
across our plant network in Europe. Senior management 
gives presentations on key focus areas and answers 
colleagues' questions on the priorities and performance 
of the Group.

Topics of interest included the Group's:

– Russian operations (which were divested in 2023)
– Future growth prospects 
– Focus on safety
– Approach to sustainability

Sue Clark attended the meeting to understand the views 
of employees, later sharing these insights with other non-
executive directors to identify priority areas going forward. 
Ongoing meetings were held throughout the year to monitor 
developments and gauge progress.  

Further details of how the Board approaches stakeholder 
engagement can be found on pages 92-95 of the 
Integrated report 2023 and on page 93 of the Sustainable 
Development report 2023.

Pages 38-41 of this report aim to provide a snapshot of how this approach works and, in doing so, serve as a statement 
summarising how Mondi’s directors have fulfilled their Section 172 duty in 2023. This includes a summary of who our key 
stakeholders are, how we engage with them and how we respond to their interests.

Mondi Action Plan 2030
Our sustainability framework

The Mondi Action Plan 2030 (MAP2030) sets out the actions, targets and milestones we need 
to achieve to meet our ambitious 2030 sustainability commitments. It is a framework built on our 
purpose of contributing to a better world by making innovative packaging and paper solutions 
that are sustainable by design.

Our approach
By concentrating on circular driven solutions, 
created by empowered people, taking action 
on climate we can have the most positive 
impact through our business.

These three action areas are supported 
by a set of responsible business practices 
covering human rights, communities, 
responsible procurement and 
environmental performance. Each area 
has commitments and targets for 2030, 
with some milestones set for 2025.

We engage with our stakeholders 
to ensure we remain focused on the 
most important topics, including through 
our materiality process.

We conducted our most recent materiality 
assessment in 2023, details of which can 
be found on the next page.

Our double materiality assessment

Focusing on what matters most
Our materiality approach helps us 
to gain insights on our stakeholders’ 
views on key environmental, social 
and governance topics. We respond 
to and report on the most important 
sustainability risks and opportunities 
across our business.

In 2023, we conducted a double 
materiality assessment to prepare 
for the reporting requirements of 
the European Union’s Corporate 
Sustainability Reporting Directive 
(CSRD). This new framework, based 
on the European Sustainability 
Reporting Standards (ESRS), 
significantly expands the scope of 
topics that companies must report 
on and aligns with our longstanding 
commitment to comprehensive 
and transparent disclosure.

We consider sustainability topics as 
material when they meet the criteria 
under the double materiality concept 
of being either or both:

– Impact material: our actual or 
potential impacts on people 
or the environment.

– Financially material: sustainability 

information, risks and opportunities 
which, if left out, misrepresented 
or hidden, could influence 
financial decisions.

Read more about our double 
materiality process in our 2023 
Sustainable Development report 
www.mondigroup.com/sd23

External assurance
Environmental Resources Management 
Certification and Verification Services 
(ERM CVS) provides assurance on 
selected information and KPIs, as 
well as checking that our Sustainable 
Development report is in accordance 
with the GRI Universal Standards (2021) 
and the SASB: Containers & Packaging 
Industry Standard, and that information 
included in our Integrated report is 
consistent and comparable.

The signed ERM CVS Independent 
Assurance Report will be found in our 
2023 Sustainable Development report.

Methodology
The double materiality process involved 
compiling an issues list, conducting 
desk-based research, and engaging 
with stakeholders to validate topics.

Circularity was most important topic 
for our customers. They see Mondi as a 
trusted supplier of fibre-based products 
and rely on our policies for responsible 
sourcing and human rights practices.

This included interviews with external 
stakeholders and a survey with a 
77% response rate from internal 
and external parties. We conducted 
a financial materiality assessment 
to identify material effects for each 
topic, considering impacts on our 
resources and relationships. Outcomes 
were reviewed with Mondi experts 
to ensure they are aligned with their 
understanding of our business.

Outcomes
Our material topics are relatively 
consistent with our 2021 assessment, 
but several have grown in importance, 
such as working conditions and human 
rights, and water.

We have identified 10 material topics: 
six are environmental; the remaining 
four are: working conditions 
and human rights; diversity, equity 
and inclusion; product safety 
and quality; and business conduct.

Environmental topics are highlighted 
in our outward impacts, given our 
reliance on natural resources and 
energy consumption in manufacturing. 
Climate change mitigation was the top 
priority, particularly for customers 
and investors paying close attention 
to our Net-Zero progress.

Our ambition is to keep materials in 
circulation, eliminate waste and support a 
regenerative, low-carbon circular economy. 
We innovate and design products that 
navigate the complexity of transitioning 
to sustainable packaging.

Commitment: Make our packaging and paper solutions reusable, recyclable or compostable

Target
100% of our packaging and paper products 
are reusable, recyclable or compostable 
by 2025

Sustainability is at the centre of our 
innovation and R&D. We develop 
packaging and paper solutions with 
a sustainable end-of-life to address 
the global challenges of climate change 
and plastic pollution by using natural 
resources wisely, keeping materials 
in circulation and eliminating waste.

As increasing regulation and customer 
demand accelerate the transition to circular 
solutions, we are doing everything in 
our power to support this evolution. 
We believe we can help drive a circular 
economy for packaging and maximise our 
impact by focusing on areas in our control. 

In 2023, 85% of our products were 
reusable, recyclable or compostable, based 
on revenue (82% in 2022). Our focus is 
on our Flexible Packaging business, as 
our Corrugated Packaging and Uncoated 
Fine Paper businesses are already at 100%. 
By the end of 2023, we had a sustainable 
alternative in place, or identified and 
undergoing development, for 94% of 
our Flexible Packaging products based on 
revenue. 

Performance against baseline

2021

2022

2023

This year at a glance
The percentage of reusable, recyclable or compostable 
products based on revenue has increased to 85%, up 
from 74% in 2020, our baseline year.  

Nevertheless, several challenges remain, 
and the speed of conversion to more 
sustainable solutions in the market make 
it challenging to achieve our target in 2025. 
Contributing factors are: long qualification 
times, such as shelf life testing for food 
packaging, uncertainty related to evolving 
legislation slowing down the adoption 
of circular solutions and necessary 
investments or retrofits to update older 
packaging lines for circular alternatives 
are slow in the face of high inflation 
and slow economic growth. 

For a Mondi product to be ‘circular,’ it must be 
designed with a sustainable end-of-life, and 
meet defined parameters. Our Sustainable 
Design Principles support our innovation. 

Our Path to Circularity Scorecard 
measures our progress against our 
reusable, recyclable or compostable 
product commitment. We review and 
update the scorecard annually to reflect 
developments in technologies, industry 
guidelines and legislation. We also 
assess product impacts through our life 
cycle-based tools.

The ‘European Green Deal’ action plan, 
including the Packaging and Packaging 
Waste Regulation and the Eco-Design 
for Sustainable Products Regulation, aims 
to make sustainable goods, services and 
business models the norm. We believe 
that a harmonised legal framework levels 
the playing field and benefits companies 
whose strategies integrate sustainability 
into their business model, to create value 
in a resilient, low-carbon circular economy.

Circular Driven Solutions continued

Key initiatives and progress in 2023 
– We are enhancing our life cycle-based 

tools to help our customers make 
sustainable packaging choices. In 2023, 
we conducted impact assessments (PIA) 
on 1,145 products and calculated 
146 product carbon footprints (PCF), a 
significant increase to the previous year.

– In 2023, we engaged an independent 
third-party organisation to critically 
review our PCF and PIA tools, including 
our calculation, data sources and process 
approach. Our tools are confirmed to 
be in accordance with ISO 14040/44, 
ISO 14067 and the Greenhouse Gas 
Protocol Product. Life Cycle Accounting 
and Reporting Standard.

– We invested €21 million in research 
and development to improve our 
process technologies, energy and 
material efficiency. We also benefit 
from innovative research infrastructure 
and capabilities at the Mondi Labs Food 
Safety Laboratory and our in-house 
recyclability testing laboratory at 
Mondi Frantschach. 

– In our 2023 Customer Survey, over 
1,700 customers took part. Topics 
perceived as important included 
renewable materials, plastic reduction 
and recyclability. Among the reasons 
why customers value Mondi were quality, 
reliability, product performance and 
sustainability.

– We continue to support skills 
development through our 
sustainability-targeted training 
programme, with 1,624 participants 
(2022: 1,152) joining sustainability training 
sessions in the Sustainable Development 
Academy and the new Growth Gym 
initiative within Flexible Packaging. 
Our employees completed 3,141 hours 
of training (2022: 2,122) on topics such 
as recyclability of paper and plastic, 
assessing product impacts, human 
rights and our Net-Zero journey.

Commitment: Avoid waste by keeping materials in circulation

Target
Eliminate waste to landfill from 
our manufacturing processes

We view waste disposed to landfill 
as a lost resource and have developed 
a sophisticated waste management 
system to avoid waste. This encompasses 
a  review of how we design our products, 
to the selection of raw materials, to reuse 
or recycling of by-products.

We are making progress towards our 
ambition of eliminating waste to landfill 
from our manufacturing. In 2023, we 
achieved an exceptional performance and 
reduced our total waste to landfill by 
around 50,600 tonnes. Since 2020, we have 
achieved a reduction of specific waste to 
landfill of 44%, mainly by reusing the 
effluent fibre from our Richards Bay mill 
as landfill cover. We also adjusted 
our lime kiln and recovery process 
at our Ružomberok mill to avoid 
landfilling lime mud and instead allow 
reuse of the secondary raw material 
by a cement producer. 

The reuse of waste generated in our 
production processes includes using 
secondary raw materials within our own 
organisation and through collaboration 
with our customers.

Performance against baseline

This year at a glance
In 2023, we achieved an exceptional performance to reduce 
our total waste to landfill by around 50,600 tonnes, a 44% 
reduction in specific waste to landfill since 2020.

During production, we investigate how 
we can reuse secondary by-products as 
potential raw materials, rather than sending 
them to landfill and thus losing their value. 
For example, biomass-based chemicals 
such as tall oil (a by-product from the 
wood pulp manufacturing process) can 
be used as bio-based fuel for our own 
energy generation or sold to other 
industries. Tall oil is a renewable-based 
chemical for biodiesel for energy 
generation and can substitute fossil fuels. 

We also explore and use alternatives 
for the disposal of waste to landfill, such 
as using ash from our bark boilers as a 
secondary raw material in the production 
of bricks. 

In 2023, we completed our studies on 
alternative raw material sources from 
residues. Unfortunately, none of the new 
raw materials investigated offered equal 
or better performance with an improved 
environmental impact; however, we will 
continue our efforts to find ways to keep 
materials in circulation and avoid waste.

Key initiatives and progress in 2023 
– Our R&D teams have worked on a new 
conversion technology to turn biogenic 
residues into process energy, replacing 
fossil fuels and reducing GHG emissions. 
In 2023, we conducted pilot trials to 
integrate this into a mill process.

– Reducing and eliminating green liquor 
dregs is an ongoing challenge at our 
mills. We have engineered calcium 
carbonate-free filtration technologies for 
two mills, which will reduce by half the 
amount of green liquor dregs produced.

– We reuse fibre residues from the 

wastewater treatment plant of our mill 
in Richards Bay (South Africa) as landfill 
cover and have found an alternative 
use for waste lime mud from our mill 
in Ružomberok (Slovakia) in the cement 
production process.

Commitment: Work with others to eliminate unsustainable packaging

Target
Progress made through our partnerships 
and stakeholder engagement activities 
every year

Through collaboration with industry 
associations and cross-value chain alliances, 
we can drive progress at scale and support 
the development of a circular economy. 
We collaborate with customers and others 
across the value chain to support the 
transition to sustainable packaging. 

We work together with our customers 
to create packaging solutions that are 
fit-for-purpose and sustainable by design, 
leading the way in resource efficiency, 
waste reduction and recyclability. 

Eliminating food waste is key to this 
commitment, and we are developing 
suitable packaging to boost food shelf 
life without compromising packaging 
recyclability, preventing food from 
spoiling before it is consumed.

We support and participate in many 
external benchmarking initiatives to 
promote transparency and improve our 
performance. In 2023, Mondi was once 
again recognised on CDP’s A List for 
leading practices in forestry and water 
security, and achieved an A– score in 
climate change. We also retained our 
platinum rating in the top 1% globally 
for EcoVadis.

capture employee views through more 
relatable questions and more effective 
measurement indices. We have a new 
baseline for our Purposeful Workplace Index, 
Inclusiveness Index and – for the first time – 
Wellbeing Index which support us in 
measuring our progress towards our 
MAP2030 commitments.

Our recruitment activities and our Diversity 
and Inclusion (D&I) Policy are aligned to 
promote diversity and maintain fair and 
non-discriminatory work practices for 
recruitment and succession planning. 
Recruitment is based on skills and future 
development potential, with conscious 
reflection on biases and hidden talents 
to give fair consideration to all applicants. 
We aim to offer opportunities for 
development that match individual 
aspirations and the future needs 
of our organisation.

A 79% score on the Purposeful Workplace Index was achieved 
in our 2023 Employee Survey
A 77% score on the Inclusiveness Index was achieved in our 
2023 Employee Survey
22.6% women employed across Mondi, representing a small 
improvement since last year (2022: 22.1%)

There are significant variations in the 
percentage of female colleagues and rate 
of female hires across our different operations 
and functions. We are at the beginning of 
an ambitious journey to become a more 
attractive employer for women, and our 
initiatives will take time to show results.

Employee behaviour does not necessarily 
change with one global standardised 
approach, so we integrate D&I guidance 
and awareness raising into all aspects of 
work and encourage continuous learning 
for all employees. The momentum across 
Mondi to create a diverse workforce and 
inclusive culture needs to involve everyone, 
at every level.

Key initiatives and progress in 2023 
– We achieved a 79% score in our Purposeful 
Workplace Index covering questions about 
development opportunities, recognition 
and personal accomplishment. 

– Our Inclusiveness Index covers respect, 

fairness and trust and we achieved a score 
of 77%. The majority of employees confirm 
that we listen and care about what others 
have to say. However, fewer employees felt 
able to speak their minds or recognised for 
their efforts and achievements. We have 
identified psychological safety as a common 
theme which we will work on in 2024.

– We launched eight Employee Resource 
Groups in 2023. These are voluntary, 
employee-led groups based on shared 
identity, experiences, characteristics or 
interests, which aim to support people 
and be a positive resource at Mondi.

– The 'Curious Community' is an evolving 
online community that connects more 
than 350 members from 27 countries 
to learn, grow and discuss their shared 
interest in D&I. 

– In 2023, we ran two workshops called 
'Men Advocating Real Change'. The 
approach supports the principle that all 
genders benefit from more gender equity, 
while men in particular have an important 
role in making equality a reality. 

– In 2023, we had 22.6% female employees 

(2022: 22.1%) and 28.4% of all new 
hires were women (2022: 30.9%). 
The female representation on our 
Executive Committee was 17% 
(2022: 25%). This percentage of women 
will increase to 29% with the new female 
Chief People Officer joining in April 
2024. The percentage of female direct 
reports to the Executive Committee 
was 30% (2022: 25%) and we had 
4 (40%) female directors on the 
Mondi Board (2022: 33%)

What’s next in 
Empowered People?  
– Encourage an inclusive leadership 
approach and a sense of shared 
ownership.

– Share good practices and 

guidance for inclusive recruitment 
and retention of women.  

– Invest in activities to attract, 

retain and develop employees, 
focusing on expert career 
development, and opportunities 
to learn and exchange. 

– Focus on shaping a culture 
where employees feel it is 
safe to speak up. 

– Continue industry-leading Social 
Psychology of Risk approach, 
run training programmes and 
build on modular safety and 
health learning programme.

Our aim is to build the best possible working 
environment, processes and structures 
to enhance people safety and wellbeing. 
We are developing flexible working models 
and offer employees access to assistance 
programmes and support, with a strong focus 
on mental wellbeing.

If an employee suffers a life-altering injury 
at work, we facilitate appropriate medical 
treatment and ongoing rehabilitation, and 
support their continued employment by 
finding alternative equivalent jobs for them, 
where required. 

Key initiatives and progress in 2023 
– We had 200 total recordable cases: 
143 related to employees and 57 
to contractors (2022: 189; 132 related 
to employees and 57 to contractors).

– Our new Engagement Board is a platform 
for our employees and contractors to 
discuss safety and health issues, including 
high-risk activities conducted by 
contractors during annual shuts, and 
major safety and health projects.

– In 2023, we had an average of 12,411 

contractors across the Group (2022: 11,629). 
We are deepening our engagement with 
contractors to eliminate fatalities and 
life-altering injuries.

– At Mondi Bags Ukraine, we are prioritising 
the physical and mental safety of our 
colleagues, including regular check-ins 
and communication about safety, so our 
employees feel supported, connected 
and involved in a purposeful and engaging 
environment.

Support our employees in pursuit of 
a work-life experience that enhances 
their wellbeing

Our operations drive awareness 
of and take measures to improve 
health and mental wellbeing

We prioritise a working environment that 
values safety, health and mental wellbeing, 
with clear targets to hold us accountable. 
Our operations involve high-risk activities, 
and keeping people safe and healthy is 
a moral and a business imperative for 
everyone who works for and on behalf 
of Mondi. 

While we are one of the safety leaders 
in our industry, we sadly experienced a 
fatality of a contractor in our Ružomberok 
mill (Slovakia) in November 2023. Relevant 
details have been shared with all operations 
to prevent reoccurrences.

Many injuries at our operations are related 
to the unconscious mind of our employees 
and contractors. We continuously promote 
our ‘Work safe. Home safe. Everybody, 
every day.’ slogan and strive to bring the 
unconscious to the conscious – thinking 
about the work we do before starting, 
so that it is done safely. 

To drive continuous improvement in our 
culture and safety performance, we are 
shifting our traditional safety approach 
(based on controls) to the Social 
Psychology of Risk (SPoR), which includes 
psychological and cultural elements. 

In 2023, we conducted 29,485 safety audits 
to identify areas for safety improvements. 
All our mills have scheduled annual 
maintenance shuts when we maintain 
and upgrade machinery and equipment. 
Our learning and skills development 
programmes cover safety and health in 
different formats, from formal to on-the-job 
training to engagement sessions, and also 
feature relevant experts.

Absolute Scope 1, 2 and 3 emissions decreased by 21% 
compared with our 2019 baseline, and 7% since last year

*  We are updating our Net-Zero targets following the disposal of our Russian operations and including recent acquisitions.

We have ambitious Net-Zero targets 
to drive down GHG emissions throughout 
our operations and our supply chain. 
We were one of the first packaging and 
paper companies with validated Net-Zero 
targets and compared to our 2019 baseline 
we have reduced our absolute Scope 1, 2 
and 3 GHG emissions by 21%. 

Our Scope 1 GHG emissions occur through 
the combustion of fuels to generate energy 
required for our manufacturing processes, 
while our Scope 2 GHG emissions are 
related to energy we purchase. Our Scope 
3 indirect GHG emissions mainly arise from 
purchased raw materials and logistics.

Our MAP2030 Climate and Environment 
Working Groups have developed a 
roadmap of action plans to deliver on 
our Net-Zero targets. They keep track 
of projects that support our transition 
to a low-carbon economy and reduce 
GHG emissions from our energy and 
manufacturing facilities. We consider the 
potential consequences of climate change 
on nature by including biodiversity and 
water stewardship in our action plans.

Actions to reduce our GHG emissions  
Scope 1 and 2 
– Continue to invest in our operational 

infrastructure.

– By increasing primary GHG emissions 
data from our suppliers, improve the 
quality and accuracy of our Scope 3 
GHG emissions reporting. 

– Invest in energy and process efficiency 
projects across our production sites. 
Key projects that will contribute 
towards meeting our GHG emissions 
reduction targets include the installation 
of a new recovery boiler at Richards Bay 
(South Africa); an energy efficiency 
project at Merebank (South Africa); 
a new heat exchanger at Ružomberok 
(Slovakia); and a modernisation project 
at Dynäs (Sweden). 

– Increase the share of renewables used 
for energy generation and purchase 
electricity from green energy providers.

Scope 3
– Collaborate with key suppliers on 

decarbonisation and support them in 
addressing their GHG reduction targets 
and Net-Zero transition plans through 
workshops and one-to-one meetings.

– Focus on raw material and fuel suppliers, 
as well as logistics partners, to replace 
carbon-intensive practices and materials 
with innovative solutions. 

– Promote the role of sustainable working 
forests for carbon sequestration and 
provision of renewable raw materials, in line 
with our commitment to zero deforestation.

Key initiatives and progress in 2023 
– At Mondi Corrugated Turkey, we installed 
a new gas turbine and co-generation plant, 
operating from 2022. The site is now 
100% energy self-sufficient, significantly 
reducing costs.

– We are continuing to reduce our GHG 
emissions through energy efficiency. 
A new back-pressure turbine at 
Merebank will reduce Scope 2 GHG 
emissions on site by 24% and effectively 
double power generation.

– Our first Supplier Virtual Event 

welcomed key suppliers and highlighted 
their pivotal role in supporting us to 
deliver against our Net-Zero targets. 
We are intensifying our supply chain 
collaboration on GHG reduction targets 
and increasing the share of primary 
GHG emissions data from our suppliers.

Mondi Action Plan 2030
Taking Action on Climate continued

In 2023, our performance included: 

– GHG emissions increase of Scope 1 

by 0.03 million tonnes and reduction of 
Scope 2 by 0.11 million tonnes compared 
to 2022. This is a 4% decrease in 
absolute Scope 1 and 2 GHG emissions 
and a 22% reduction since a 2019 
baseline. Since 2004, we have reduced 
our absolute Scope 1 and Scope 2 
GHG emissions by 2.57 million tonnes 
CO2e, a 55% reduction.

– We reduced the Group’s Scope 3 

emissions by around 260,000 tonnes 
CO2e, which is a reduction of 9% against 
last year and a 21% reduction against 
the 2019 baseline. The reduction is 
mainly due to market-related lower 
production volumes requiring fewer raw 
materials. We recognise that making 
progress in our Scope 3 emissions will 
be a challenge. We will continue to work 
with our suppliers to identify 
opportunities to reduce GHG emissions 
in our supply chain. 

– As a member of the World Business 
Council for Sustainable Development 
(WBCSD) Forest Solutions Group, 
we contributed to the development 
of a catalogue of decarbonisation 
actions for the forest sector.

The share of certified wood for all mills was 75%, with the 
remainder being FSC Controlled Wood

Continued implementation of best management practices 
in our plantation forests to support improved growth 
and minimise disturbances

Key initiatives and progress in 2023 
– Forest certification schemes, such as 

PEFC and FSC, aim to increase 
availability of sustainable fibre sources 
and address emerging challenges in 
forestry. We are enhancing certification 
in our own forestry operations and in our 
global wood fibre sourcing, as well as 
proactively sharing our insights with 
suppliers and partners in the forest 
products value chain.

– The main threat to our forest landholdings 
is from wildfires, which can occur as 
frequent, high-intensity, small-scale fires 
in South Africa. We mitigate the risk 
of large-scale fires with a robust fire 
prevention and management system. 
We have developed a comprehensive 
tree improvement programme, as 
well as silviculture techniques, to 
maintain healthy, resilient and productive 
tree plantations.

– TEAMING UP 4 FORESTS, a platform 
founded by the International Union for 
Forest Research Organizations (IUFRO) 
and Mondi, is now a professional 
network of 100+ scientists, business 
representatives and policymakers along 
the forest sector. We aim to translate 
scientific findings into practical solutions 
for the sustainable provision of wood-
based products. In 2023, the preliminary 
results of an IUFRO-Mondi synthesis 
study were presented at the latest 
Think Tank meeting. The study explores 
ecological, policy, socio-economic 
and technological drivers for the future 
supply of fibre and other forest goods 
and services.

Target
Maintain 100% FSCTM certification in our 
own forest landholdings
Procure 100% responsibly sourced fibre with 
75% FSC- or PEFC-certified fibre procured 
by 2025 and the remainder meeting the FSC 
Controlled Wood standard
Implement leading forestry measures to 
ensure productive and resilient forests

Resilient forests are vital as a key source 
of renewable, recyclable and compostable 
material, and home to the vast majority 
of the planet’s terrestrial biodiversity, 
while absorbing carbon. 

Wood fibre is our most important raw material 
for producing our paper and packaging 
solutions. We believe that the active and 
sustainable management of forests, and 
increasing the use of wood-based products, 
will have a fundamental role in addressing 
the climate crisis and in securing long-term 
benefits for society.

In 2023, 100% of our wood fibre was 
responsibly sourced, with 75% FSC* 
(Forest Stewardship CouncilTM) or PEFC 
(Programme for the Endorsement of Forest 
Certification) certified, and the remainder 
meeting the FSC Controlled Wood 
standard. We source over 90% of our 
wood fibre from countries where our pulp 
and paper mills are located and aim to 
make the best use of certified wood 
from domestic markets.

We enable the uptake of sustainable forest 
management practices and development 
of resilient forest landscapes by collaborating 
with partners, engaging with suppliers and 
forest owners, and scaling up development 
of forest certification. With significant debate 
about the long-term forest strategy for 
mitigating climate change and reversing 
nature loss, between policymakers, the forest 
sector, NGOs and scientific organisations, we 
believe scientific research is crucial to inform 
effective policies and management practices 
in the EU and globally.

Mondi Action Plan 2030
Taking Action on Climate continued

Commitment: Safeguard biodiversity and water resources in our operations and beyond

Target
Conduct water stewardship assessments at 
our mills and forestry operations by 2025, 
and implement required actions to address 
the findings by 2030
Conduct biodiversity assessments at our 
mills and forestry operations, introducing 
biodiversity action plans where necessary 
by 2025

We depend on well-functioning terrestrial 
and freshwater ecosystems to operate 
effectively. As part of our manufacturing 
processes, we require access to natural 
resources including wood and water. 
Within our MAP2030 framework, we have 
a comprehensive approach to climate 
action and conserving natural resources. 

In the forest sector, the most significant 
biodiversity and water impacts and 
dependencies occur upstream in forestry 
landscapes and primary processing 
facilities. We are committed to improving 
our approach to biodiversity and water 
management in our forestry operations 
and mills, to limit our impacts and manage 
our dependencies on natural resources.  

We are conducting biodiversity status 
reviews for all our pulp and paper mills 
and forestry operations. Supported by 
external experts, we have identified 
important biodiversity sites around our 
operations and evaluated environmental 
aspects that potentially have an impact 
on biodiversity. 

We aim to manage water cycles effectively 
and maintain the resilience of freshwater 
ecosystems, especially in water-stressed 
and water-scarce regions. Our Group 
Water Stewardship Standard lists 
all requirements related to our water 
stewardship policy, plans and strategy, 
as well as in relation to water, sanitation 
and hygiene.

We collaborate with local environmental 
NGOs and scientific institutions to increase 
access to best available knowledge on 
ecosystem stewardship, as well as to promote 
communication and implementation of 
effective science-based approaches 
to manage biodiversity and natural capital 
in our operational landscapes.

and improve our sustainability 
performance.

– Scale up our engagement 

with our suppliers and service 
providers, such as logistics 
companies, to drive progress 
on Scope 3 GHG emissions.

Key initiatives and progress in 2023
– We are collaborating with our partners 
to implement biodiversity action plans 
(by 2025) and water impact assessments 
(by 2030), developing context-specific 
measures to address the most material 
aspects in our operations, depending 
on geographic location and value chain 
position. In 2023, we conducted water 
stewardship assessments for Mondi 
mills in Tire (Türkiye) and Stambolijski 
(Bulgaria). We have also assessed our 
biodiversity impacts at Mondi mills 
and have worked to develop action 
plans, for example at Mondi Dynäs 
(Sweden).

– As a member and co-chair of the 

World Business Council for Sustainable 
Development’s Forest Solutions Group, 
we engage with major nature-related 
frameworks, including the Taskforce 
on Nature-related Financial Disclosures 
(TNFD) and Science Based Targets 
Network. In 2023, we engaged on the 
development of the TNFD Additional 
Forest Sector Guidance. The guidance, 
which includes proposed disclosure 
metrics, will support forest companies in 
implementing the TNFD recommendations. 

– Mondi South Africa’s three-year 

partnership with the Endangered Wildlife 
Trust aims to map biodiversity footprints 
in our South African forestry operations. 
We conducted ‘Species Field Days’ 
to track species using the ‘iNaturalist’ app 
as one of the first partnership activities. 
We also conducted a desk-based pilot 
assessment of the biodiversity footprint 
of our South African forestry landholdings.

Mondi Action Plan 2030
Taking Action on Climate: TCFD

We continue to make progress 
against our commitment to 
reduce carbon emissions.

Our TCFD journey
We invest to drive more responsible and 
sustainable practices and our ambitious 
targets have paved the way for our success 
over a number of years and set a platform 
for our future plans and investments as we 
continue our drive to transition to a circular 
economy and further reduce our emissions. 

We recognise that the impact of climate 
change gives rise to physical and transition 
risks. We also recognise clear opportunities 
for our business to drive value accretive 
growth with sustainability at the centre 
of our strategy. 

At Mondi, we are striving to reduce our 
emissions in line with a 1.5°C scenario 
by committing to achieve Net-Zero 
greenhouse gas (GHG) emissions reduction 
targets by 2050. In 2022, the Science 
Based Targets initiative (SBTi) validated 
our targets as science-based Scope 1, 2 
and 3 Net-Zero targets. We are updating 
our Net-Zero targets following the sale 
of our Russian operations.

The Financial Stability Board’s Task Force 
on Climate-Related Financial Disclosures 
(TCFD) recommendations facilitate clear 
disclosure of our governance, strategy, 
risk management and metrics and targets 
in relation to our climate change-related 
risks and opportunities, enabling transparent 
disclosure on how we are taking action 
on climate.

The Group’s focus remains on risk 
management and mitigation of our climate 
change-related risks and maximising our 
opportunities.

The timeline below shows how we have 
integrated the TCFD recommendations 
into our journey of taking action on climate, 
and how we continue to reduce our 
emissions since setting our first Group-

Governance 
The	Board
While the Board as a whole has 
responsibility for overseeing our approach to 
sustainability, the Sustainable Development 
Committee (SD Committee), on behalf 
of the Board, oversees and monitors our 
sustainable development policies, practices 
and progress against our MAP2030 
commitments and targets. It provides 
guidance in relation to sustainability matters, 
including climate change-related issues, 
and reviews updates of the Group’s 
framework of sustainability policies and 
strategies, taking into account global best 
practice. The Board considers the impact 
of climate change-related matters as 
part of its decision-making in relation to 
major capital expenditure, acquisitions 
and disposals. 

The relevant Board committees
The SD Committee met seven times during 
2023, with climate change-related matters 
discussed by the committee at all of these 
meetings. Every Board member normally 
attends each meeting of the SD Committee, 
even if they are not a member of the 
committee, providing context for 
Board discussions.

The Chair of the SD Committee also reports 
back to the Board after every meeting. 
Read our Board members' biographies for 
more information on their sustainability 
skills and experience on pages 86-87.

Progress against our sustainability 
commitments and targets, outlined in 
MAP2030, was an integral part of the 
SD Committee’s agenda throughout the 
year, with each of the key action areas 
reviewed and focus given not only to the 
current status of each commitment, but 
also to the actions being taken towards 
achieving these commitments. 

Further details of our performance in this 
regard can be found on pages 51-54.

Alongside this, the SD Committee also 
spent time considering the climate 
change-related risks and opportunities 
facing the Group in the context of the 
TCFD recommendations. 

Each risk and opportunity was reviewed 
and discussed, considering in particular 
the potential impact in each case. 
The SD Committee acknowledges that 
this is an iterative process, with the 
quantification of the financial impact 
and the methodologies applied being 
continually refined, and that these 
discussions support the development 
of the committee’s understanding of these 
risks and opportunities and provide context 
not only for Mondi’s plans for addressing 
climate change, but also for its wider 
decision-making.

Mondi Action Plan 2030
Taking Action on Climate: TCFD continued

Sustainability-linked financing
The Group’s €750 million five-year 
revolving multi-currency credit facility 
agreement (RCF), entered into in 2021, 
incorporates key sustainability targets 
linked to MAP2030, classifying the facility 
as a Sustainability-Linked Loan. Linking 
our access to capital to our sustainability 
performance reflects our commitment to 
meeting our strategic sustainability targets. 
During 2023, the Group launched its 
Sustainability-Linked Bond Framework 
(the SLB Framework). The SLB Framework 
supports the future issuance of 
Sustainability-Linked Bond transactions 
and aligns bonds issued under it with our 
ambitious sustainability targets which are:

– reduce absolute Scope 1 and 2 GHG 
emissions by 46.2% in aggregate by 
2030 compared to 2019; and

– reduce absolute Scope 3 GHG emissions 

by 27.5% by 2030 compared to 2019.

Capital investments
Energy-related investments can drive 
decarbonisation and enhance our asset 
base. Since 2019, we have invested in and 
approved around €500 million in energy 
and process efficiency, including a new 
stand-by boiler at Świecie (Poland), the 
installation of a new recovery boiler and 
power boiler at Richards Bay (South Africa), 
an energy efficiency project at Merebank 
(South Africa), a new heat exchanger at 
Ružomberok (Slovakia) and a 
modernisation project at Dynäs (Sweden). 
Our investments aim to optimise energy 
and process efficiency and replace fossil 
fuel-based energy with renewable sources.  
Our current commitments, outlined in 
MAP2030, build on the progress we have 
achieved so far and set ambitious near- 
and long-term Net-Zero targets into 
the future.

Governance continued
During 2023, the SD Committee also 
addressed a number of other key matters 
including safety performance and serious 
incidents, sustainable development 
governance and risks, stakeholder 
relationships, environmental performance 
and climate change, forestry, product 
stewardship, responsible procurement 
and people development and diversity. 
Further details on the key matters 
considered by the SD Committee during 
the year can be found on page 121. 
Additional governance oversight is provided 
by the Audit Committee and Remuneration 
Committee. The Audit Committee oversees 
the Group’s corporate financial reporting, 
annual planning process and the Group’s 
risk assessment process, which includes 
climate change risks. Details on the 
key matters considered by the Audit 
Committee during the year can be found 
on page 112. The Remuneration Committee 
is responsible for ensuring that our incentive 
arrangements drive the appropriate 
behaviours that deliver our strategy, 
including the alignment of remuneration 
to performance against our MAP2030 
focus areas. Details on the key matters 
considered by the Remuneration 
Committee during the year can be 
found on page 126.

The Executive Committee
The Executive Committee, chaired by the 
Group CEO, and operational management 
teams consisting of senior executives from 
across the Group monitor our approach 
to sustainability. The Executive Committee 
regularly reviews progress against our 
sustainability commitments and targets. 
In addition, all papers and updates 
prepared for the SD Committee, including 
those relating to climate change, are 
reviewed and discussed by the Executive 
Committee, prior to submission to the 
SD Committee, allowing the Executive 
Committee to develop its understanding 
and awareness of sustainability matters 
and to provide relevant input. 

The Group Technical & Sustainability 
Director and the Group Head of 
Sustainable Development are responsible 
for coordinating actions related to the 
Group’s climate change-related risks 
and opportunities and providing reports 
to the Executive Committee to enable 
it to discharge its responsibility.

Strategy 
Sustainability is at the core of Mondi’s 
strategy and values and we have a 
long-standing focus on reducing 
greenhouse gas emissions. Since 2004, 
the baseline year for our first Group-wide 
GHG target, we have reduced our absolute 
GHG emissions by 2.57 million tonnes 
CO2e, which is a 55% reduction. This 
has been achieved through targeted 
investments to reduce our reliance on 
fossil fuels and a focus on improving 
energy efficiency across our operations. 

We believe that we have the right 
strategy, including our climate transition 
plan to Net-Zero by 2050, to address the 
challenges and opportunities arising from 
climate change. 

We recognise that there are many 
uncertainties around the potential impacts 
of climate change and continue to enhance 
the quality of our scenario modelling 
to further understand these impacts. 
We consider that, based on our current 
understanding, our strategy is resilient. 

The Group’s climate change-related risks 
and opportunities are routinely considered 
in our strategic and financial planning, 
our capital allocation decisions and our 
operational management. Climate change 
risks have been identified as one of 
our strategic principal risks and are 
reflected in our accounting policies 
and financial reporting. 

Climate change in our financial 
statements
The impact of climate change is considered 
in the estimates of future cash flows used 
in the impairment assessment of goodwill, as 
detailed on pages 186-187. Climate change 
is, as detailed on page 188, included as a 
factor that impacts the conversion factor 
used in the assumptions for valuation of 
the Group’s forestry assets and as a factor 
incorporated into the risk premium applied 
to mature and immature timber. Climate 
change was considered in the assessment 
of fair value of assets and liabilities acquired 
in business combinations, as detailed 
on page 202. 

The Group accounting policies reflect the 
impact of climate change considerations 
in relation to the assessment of the residual 
values and estimated useful economic lives 
of property, plant and equipment, as 
detailed on pages 220-221, and in relation 
to the accounting policy applied for the 
valuation of forestry assets and the 
assessment of goodwill for impairment.

Our risks and opportunities
We identified seven climate change-related 
risks and three climate change-related 
opportunities that we have assessed as 
material to our business. Materiality 
considers both financial impacts and other 
considerations such as the importance 
of key climate change-related topics 
to internal and external stakeholders. 

Further details on how the Group defines 
what is material are detailed on page 43.

We evaluate and report on our short- 
(up to three years), medium- (three to 
seven years) and long-term (more than 
seven years) climate-related transition 
and physical risks and opportunities, and 
their financial implications. 

Transition risks may occur when moving 
towards a less polluting, low-carbon 
economy. Such transitions could mean 
that some sectors of the economy face 
big shifts in asset values or higher costs 
of doing business. Climate change means 
we may face more frequent or severe 
weather events like flooding, droughts 
and storms. These events bring physical 
risks that impact our business and society 
directly and have the potential to affect 
the economy. 

The TCFD recommends applying widely 
used reference scenarios that are publicly 
available and peer reviewed. For 2023, 
our assessment of the financial implications 
of our climate change-related risks and 
opportunities was prepared considering 
1.5°C, 2°C and business-as-usual 
(BAU) scenarios1, 2, 3. 
Physical risks and opportunities are 
considered more severe under the BAU 
scenario, as under this scenario, physical 
climate change-related events will be more 
frequent and severe with an increased 
likelihood of impact on our business. 
Under the 1.5°C and 2°C scenarios we still 
observe some impacts of physical climate 
risks. Our mitigation measures are designed 
to reduce the impact of these risks under 
the three presented scenarios. 

In contrast to physical risks, transition risks and 
opportunities increase in likelihood under the 
2°C scenario compared with BAU, with earlier 
policy action and a more aggressive transition, 
and are further amplified under the 1.5°C 
scenario. This is driven by an increase in 
stricter regulations around carbon and energy 
as well as the increased scrutiny of target 
achievements through increased market 
and customer pressure. 

Given the nature of transition risks, the 
likelihood of occurrence is lower under 
the BAU scenario, as there is limited 
change projected to current regulation 
and litigation pressures.

During the year, we assessed our climate 
change-related risks and opportunities and 
have specified the estimated financial impact, 
outlining a potential reduction in operating 
profit for risks and a potential increase in 
operating profit for opportunities, as disclosed 
in the tables below and on pages 60-62, 
taking into consideration mitigation measures 
implemented by the Group. These risks and 
opportunities only reflect our climate 
change-related risks and opportunities 
and reflect an update of the risks and 
opportunities presented in our 2022 
Integrated report and our 2023 CDP 
submission. For an overview of all our Group 
principal risks, please refer to page 72.

1  The IPCC’s most optimistic scenario describes a 
world where global CO2 emissions are cut to 
Net-Zero by around 2050. The scenario meets the 
Paris Agreement’s goal of keeping global warming 
to around 1.5°C above pre-industrial temperatures, 
with warming hitting 1.5°C but then dipping back 
down and stabilising around 1.4°C by the end of 
the century.

2  The International Energy Agency’s 2°C scenario is 
based on limiting global temperature rise to below 
2°C above pre-industrial levels under an emissions 
trajectory that allows CO2 emissions to be reduced 
by almost 60% by 2050 compared with 2013. 
Under this scenario emissions are projected to 
decline from 2020 and they continue their decline 
after 2050 to reach carbon neutrality. 

3  The Representative Concentration Pathway’s 8.5 
(RCP8.5) scenario is a business-as-usual (BAU) 
scenario, which projects the global mean 
temperature to rise by 2.6°C to 4.8°C and the 
global mean sea level to rise by 0.45 metres to 0.82 
metres by the late 21st century.

Risk
1. Higher wood

costs

Timeframe:
Long term

Risk description
Temperature increase, changes in rainfall patterns 
and windstorms can result in large-scale forest damage. 
In Europe, at lower altitudes, fibre losses from pests 
(e.g. bark beetles) and diseases are expected 
to continue unless precipitation increases.
A reduction in the cutting capacity of the sawmilling 
industry due to a lack of spruce saw logs could lead 
to a change in the mix of available pulpwood 
and sawmill chips.
Increasing competition for wood is being driven 
by demand for renewable raw materials and timber 
for green energy generation to achieve EU GHG 
reduction and Net-Zero targets. At the same time, 
there is a call to increase forest areas set aside 
for conservation, which is reflected in the 2030 
EU Forest Strategy. 

How we manage and mitigate this risk
In mountainous regions, we expect an increase in yearly 
forest growth due to rising temperatures. At lower altitudes, 
spruce will be mainly replaced with other softwood species. 
We are investigating alternatives to support flexibility in 
species mix for our future pulp production.

We invest in research and development projects and are 
building strategic partnerships with forest owners and 
industries, NGOs and scientific institutions to foster 
sustainable forest management.

This is supported by the sustainable working forest model 
and fit-for-purpose certification concepts, which we 
developed and promote with our partners. We have started 
to explore approaches to climate-fit forestry to enhance 
forest ecosystems’ resilience.

We also promote the cascading use of wood nationally 
and via Cepi on a European level.

Our mills are often located close to rivers which provide 
the water needed for our operations.

Climate change may increase the frequency and extent 
of flooding events through surface water flooding 
(e.g. after extreme rainfall or rapid snow melting) or 
flooding of low-lying coastal regions (due to sea level 
rise) which may cause damage to our operations.

While taking into account the investments we have 
made at our operations to mitigate the potential impact 
of flooding, our risk quantification considers mill 
downtime due to wider local infrastructure damage 
in the event of a significant flooding event.

Our operations regularly review their flood prevention plans, 
collaborate with governments and hydropower energy 
providers in the regions where we operate and invest in 
flood protection solutions where necessary.

15-85

Our current flooding assessments show the measures 
implemented are generally sufficient to mitigate this risk 
to an acceptable level, with only a few additional measures 
required such as the elevation of motors and vulnerable 
equipment, additional pumps and water-level sensors.

Our geographic diversification enables operational flexibility 
to meet customer orders if flooding were to occur at a mill.

Increased severity and frequency of extreme weather 
events may result in disruptions and decreased 
harvesting capacity of our managed plantation forests. 
Extreme weather conditions may impact plantations 
through sustained higher temperatures, which can lead 
to stronger winds and increased windfalls. Plantations 
may be vulnerable to changes in rainfall patterns and 
erosion. Higher temperatures may increase vulnerability 
of trees to pests and diseases. Fire remains a challenge 
for our South African plantations, exacerbated in years 
when drought conditions occur.

Our tree improvement programme aims to produce stronger, 
more robust trees that can resist disturbances such as 
drought, pests and diseases. We mitigate fire risks with 
naturally vegetated open corridors acting as fire-breaks 
between forest plantations, under canopy biomass 
management and investment in a modern firefighting fleet 
and professional firefighters.

15-20

We have improved pre- and post-burning assessments at 
harvesting sites. These aim to mitigate the risks of erosion 
and nutrient loss after prescribed burning to ensure healthy 
soils, which are critical for productive plantation forests.

Water is a key natural resource used in our production 
process. Extended water shortages are a concern as 
they could disrupt production at our operations. This is 
especially relevant in water scarce regions and locations 
dependent on small catchment areas. Water supply 
is identified as a risk at our Richards Bay (South Africa), 
Frantschach (Austria) and Stambolijski (Bulgaria) mills. 
Our risk quantification considers mitigation measures 
in place at the mills and is based on lower production 
at the mills as a result of water shortages.

We conduct water stewardship assessments and develop 
methods to significantly reduce water use by implementing 
closed loops and recycling water used in our processes. 
We continue to investigate cost-effective improvements 
to local water management systems. We work with local 
authorities and other industries to identify solutions 
to enhance water stewardship around our mills.

Climate change-related risks: Transition risks

Risk
5. Energy 
supply 
costs

Timeframe:
Medium term

Risk description
Due to increasing regulation on fossil-based energy 
sources, increased demand for renewable energy and 
the shifting energy supply mix, the Group estimates that 
our total energy costs could increase in the medium 
term, estimated by up to 10-20%. 

In the medium to long term, the energy supply mix 
transition in Europe includes the closing of coal-fired 
power plants, selective closure of nuclear power 
capacity and increased reliance on renewable sources 
of energy such as onshore and offshore wind, solar 
and biomass. Wind and solar energy supply can be 
inconsistent due to weather patterns leading to reliance 
on fossil fuels during the energy transition period.

The energy supply costs risk quantification uses the 
Group’s energy cost structure as a basis for calculation.

How we manage and mitigate this risk
We continue to focus on energy efficiency and to deliver 
incremental improvements through operational 
enhancements and our ongoing capital investment 
programme. Biomass accounts for around 78% of our mills’ 
fuel needs, with only around 10% of our fuel sourced from 
natural gas. This has been made possible through significant 
investments over a number of years in making our facilities 
more energy efficient and increasing backward integration, 
primarily into biomass-based energy generation. Investment 
in improvements to our sourcing of energy and increased 
electricity self-sufficiency, including the use of renewable 
energy sources, strengthens the energy efficiency of our 
operations while reducing operating costs. Where we 
generate electricity surplus to our own requirements, 
we may sell such surplus.

Timeframe:
Long term

10 of Mondi’s 13 pulp and paper mills fall under the 
EU Emissions Trading Scheme (EU ETS). Some of our 
mills have sufficient EU ETS allowances, while there is 
potential that five will face a deficit in the medium term, 
resulting in the potential for the Group to be in a net 
deficit position. There is a South African carbon tax 
on emissions from fossil fuels, which includes fossil fuel 
combustion at our Richards Bay and Merebank 
operations. The South African carbon tax is currently 
offset by our forestry-related sequestration allowance; 
however, a small cost is anticipated from 2025 onwards. 
Our risk quantification considered an EU ETS carbon 
price range of €50 to €150 per tonne CO2 and includes 
the anticipated South African carbon tax. 

Driven by evolving regulation, there is a risk that certain 
of the Group’s assets may be susceptible to impairment 
if regulations require fossil-based energy plants to be 
decommissioned by a certain date.

Our risk quantification considers the estimated carrying 
value of fossil fuel-based energy plants in our mills 
based within the EU at 2030 and their potential 
impairment. An impairment is a one-off write-down of 
an asset. The mill’s remaining carrying value is excluded 
from our quantification as our medium- to long-term 
capital investment programme aims to replace fossil 
fuel-based energy with renewable sources. 

We collect detailed information on GHG emissions from 
our mills and consider the cost of carbon when making 
investment decisions.

30-85

Our ongoing investments reduce our reliance on fossil fuels, 
improve energy efficiency and help to mitigate the risk of 
insufficient CO2 allowances for our EU-based operations, 
and reduce CO2 emissions for our South African operations.

The Group aims to keep abreast of new and evolving 
regulation and takes actions to mitigate the impact 
of changes either in our own operations or through 
participation in cross-value chain partnerships. We also 
have the resources and capacity to accelerate low-carbon 
energy-related investments to achieve base load capacity 
in the instance of regulatory and/or other required changes.

Opportunity description
The growing demand for sustainable packaging is 
driving investment, collaboration and innovation to meet 
evolving customer needs. Paper-based packaging is 
renewable and generally recyclable making it an ideal 
alternative to less sustainable solutions. Where certain 
barriers are required, flexible plastic packaging can be 
a better alternative when manufactured, used and 
disposed of appropriately. Leveraging our unique 
portfolio of paper-based, hybrid and flexible plastic 
solutions, we see an opportunity to meet the demand 
for more sustainable products, using our leading 
corrugated packaging and flexible packaging footprint 
and increasing the focus on recyclability and the amount 
of recycled content used within our solutions. 

While we continue to enhance our understanding 
around this opportunity, our estimated quantification 
is based on revenue growth of 1-2% per annum for 
our packaging businesses in the long term.

The production of pulp, paper and packaging is energy 
intensive and energy generation is the major source 
of our GHG emissions. By improving the efficiency 
of our energy plants and manufacturing operations, 
we have the opportunity to realise cost savings.

Renewable by-products of the kraft pulping process 
include products such as tall oil. Renewable by-products 
are highly valued as substitutes for fossil fuel-based 
materials. They can be used internally for energy 
generation or extracted, purified and sold as higher 
value secondary raw materials.
We are investigating additional opportunities to use 
other by-products (e.g. lignin from black liquor and 
eucalyptol extraction) to create additional revenue 
streams in the future.

How we realise this opportunity
As a leading packaging producer, Mondi is well positioned 
to leverage the Group’s innovation capabilities, leading 
market positions and strong customer base.

We actively collaborate with our customers to develop 
innovative solutions that are sustainable by design, taking 
industry-wide design for circularity guidelines into 
consideration.

We are also investing in our asset base to increase our 
cost-advantaged packaging capacity to meet growing demand. 
We are leveraging strong partnerships to bring about positive 
change and drive the transition to a circular economy.

15-25

Investing in optimising energy and process efficiencies 
in our operations has been a long-standing focus.
The Group’s current capital investment programme 
continues to prioritise investments in energy efficiency 
measures and in increasing biomass-based energy in 
our mills. 
Further investment projects are planned to meet our 
science-based Net-Zero GHG emission reduction targets 
over the coming years, which is also expected to reduce 
our specific energy costs and improve energy efficiency.

The extraction and sale of renewable by-products from the 
kraft pulping process is part of our circular economy approach. 
We continue to invest in our mills to realise this opportunity, 
which is dependent on the existing infrastructure.

Risk management 
Climate change is specifically identified 
as a standalone Group principal risk, as 
detailed on page 75. Climate change risks, 
and the related mitigating actions, are 
reviewed and updated annually using 
the input of the content reviewed by 
the SD Committee and presented to 
the Audit Committee along with all Group 
principal risks. Read about the Group’s risk 
management framework on pages 69-70.

A cross-functional climate risk team 
identifies and assesses our material climate 
change-related risks and opportunities 
through an iterative continuous 
improvement process. The annual review 
considers the breadth of our business, 
across operating locations and our product 
portfolio, including consultations with 
internal and external technical subject 
experts and senior operational 
management. Our climate change-related 
risks and opportunities are reviewed 
and approved by the Executive Committee 
and the SD Committee annually.

Climate change-related risks and 
opportunities are managed and where 
possible mitigated by our operational 
management team and through our capital 
investment programme. The climate 
change-related risks and opportunities 
are considered in the preparation of, 
and integrated in, the Group’s three-year 
2024-2026 plan (budget period).

Metrics and targets 
The Group uses a variety of metrics to 
measure the current and potential impact 
of our climate change-related risks and 
opportunities, including GHG emissions, 
sustainable fibre metrics, waste to landfill, 
NOx emissions, water use and effluent 
load (COD) in waste water. 

The targets covering GHG emissions 
from Mondi’s operations and value chain 
(Scope 1, 2 and 3) are consistent with a 
reduction required to keep global warming 
to 1.5°C by 2050 and prevent the most 
damaging effects of climate change 
according to the latest climate science.

Given the strategic importance 
of sustainability, the Group’s 
executive directors’ and the 
wider senior management’s 
remuneration is linked to their 
contribution to the overall 
success of MAP2030, including 
our GHG reduction targets.

Direct GHG emissions are from our energy 
plants through combustion of fuels to 
generate the energy required for our 
manufacturing (Scope 1). We also purchase 
energy from the grid (Scope 2) and have 
indirect GHG emissions throughout the value 
chain, mainly as a result of our purchase of 
raw materials, fuel and transportation, which 
together make up more than 95% of our 
total Scope 3 emissions. We are acting 
across all three Scopes and working closely 
with our partners to reduce GHG emissions 
for our business and our value chain. 

Our science-based Net-Zero targets 
include both short-term and long-term 
GHG emissions reduction targets and are 
approved by the SBTi. Our existing Scope 
1, Scope 2 and Scope 3 science-based 
targets are ambitious and in line with a 
1.5°C scenario.

We remain committed to zero 
deforestation in our wood fibre supply 
chains and to maintaining carbon sinks 
in forestry through implementation 
of best forest management and 
silviculture practices.

Taking Action on Climate 
Page 51-64

We report our GHG emissions according 
to the Greenhouse Gas Protocol, published 
by the WBCSD and the WRI, and have 
reported our Scope 1, 2 and 3 GHG data 
in compliance with ISO 14064:1-2006. 
ERM CVS has assured, to a reasonable level 
of assurance, our 2023 absolute Scope 1 
and absolute Scope 2 GHG emissions data, 
in accordance with ISO 14064-3, and to 
a limited level of assurance our Scope 3 
GHG data.

Given the strategic importance 
of sustainability, the Group’s executive 
directors' and the wider senior 
management's remuneration is linked 
to their contribution to the overall success 
of MAP2030, including our GHG reduction 
targets. 20% of the annual bonus awarded 
to members of the Executive Committee, 
which includes the Group CEO 
and the Group CFO, and more than 
3,000 employees across the Group, 
is linked to sustainability objectives.

Waste
To reduce our waste sent to landfill and 
increase the circularity of our material flows, 
we are exploring alternative solutions 
involving recycling and reuse. 

We monitor the volume of our operational 
waste (by waste type and waste routes) 
across all operations and are investigating 
alternative routes to divert unavoidable 
waste from going to landfill. In 2023, we 
generated about 0.8 million tonnes of 
waste in our manufacturing operations, 
of which 74% was brought back into value 
creation processes by recycling and reuse 
of secondary raw materials. We disposed 
of 65,000 tonnes of waste to landfill 
(2022: 116,000 tonnes). Approximately 2% 
of our total waste streams is hazardous 
waste and in 2023, we sent around 
600 tonnes of hazardous waste to landfill – 
approximately 1% of our total waste 
to landfill (2022: 4%).
Human rights
We respect human rights in our operations 
and across our supply chain, and our human 
rights approach is embedded into our 
relevant practices and policies. We report 
against the ten principles of the United 
Nations Global Compact and publish a 
Human Trafficking and Modern Slavery 
Statement according to the UK Modern 
Slavery Act annually. We have robust 
internal processes and tools to facilitate 
the reporting, investigation and resolution 
of potential human rights violations.

Our priority human rights risk areas are 
determined by and take into consideration 
any inherent geographical risk, as well as 
business processes, industry risks and 
legislative requirements. We focus on 
the most significant topics: fair working 
conditions, freedom of association and 
collective bargaining, indigenous and land 
rights, modern slavery, child labour 
and safeguarding our environment. 

Our Environment Policy outlines the 
requirement for cleaner production and 
the drivers for our commitments. Our 
Sustainable Development Management 
System has environmental management 
systems that support us to: meet 
environmental protection standards; 
comply with legislation; improve reporting 
and transparency; and adhere to the 
principles of resource efficiency.

Water
We aim to reduce our water consumption 
and increase water recycling in our 
operations. Managing water resources in an 
efficient and sustainable way, and investing 
in up-to-date water infrastructure, is a 
priority – particularly in regions with high 
water-related risks. In 2023, we reduced 
our specific contact water consumption 
by 4% from our 2020 baseline. 

We monitor the water we withdraw by 
source and report on water use in our 
manufacturing and energy generation. 
In 2023, we conducted water stewardship 
assessments, focused on regions with 
higher water risk. We have a focus at 
each mill to tackle water consumption, 
supported by experts in our Group 
Technical & Sustainability teams. 

Air emissions
Our main source of air emissions is on-site 
energy generation in our boilers and lime 
kilns. Air emissions associated with 
combustion of fuels for energy production 
include nitrogen oxide (NOx) emissions, 
generated by fossil fuels and biomass 
incineration. These substances can damage 
forests, crops and other vegetation by 
acidification of soils. We regularly monitor 
SO2, NOx, total reduced sulphides (TRS) 
and dust, and we calculate our GHG 
emissions based on fuel consumption. 
We strictly adhere to permitted limits 
and are continuously investing in our 
operations to minimise our air emissions.

For more information on our air emissions, 
please see our GRI & SASB Index and 
Consolidated Performance data 
documents, available on our website.

Sustainability reports and publications
www.mondigroup.com/sustainability/
reports-and-publications

MAP2030, our 
sustainability framework,  
is built on a foundation 
of responsible business 
practices and created 
around our purpose 
of contributing to a 
better world by making 
innovative paper and 
packaging solutions that 
are sustainable by design.  

Environmental performance 
Our manufacturing processes depend 
on natural resources, with environmental 
impacts primarily from our pulp and paper 
mills. We generate most of the energy we 
use from biomass-based by-products, in 
pulp manufacturing and from fossil fuels, 
which result in greenhouse gases and other 
air emissions. Our manufacturing processes 
also use significant amounts of water 
and generate waste. 

By investing in our operations, efficiently 
using water resources, working towards 
zero waste and reducing air emissions, 
we reduce our environmental impacts 
and prevent environmental degradation. 

We are implementing best available 
techniques, modernising our energy 
sources and manufacturing facilities to 
reduce our water and air emissions. In turn, 
this is helping us to run resource-efficient 
operations, avoid disturbances and protect 
the rights of our stakeholders. We engage 
with external stakeholders to reduce our 
environmental impacts, finding alternative 
solutions in collaboration with industry 
partners and innovating together 
to support a circular economy.

Responsible business practices 
Delivering on responsible 
business commitments continued

Our Human Rights Due Diligence approach 
is a continuous management process, 
and we review our operational impacts 
through regular stakeholder engagement, 
collaborating with external human rights 
experts, and engaging with our partners and 
in our communities. We conducted in-depth 
risk assessments across all operations in 
2023, reflecting our prioritised human rights 
risk focus areas and highlighting areas 
to improve. The established baseline of 
identified risk areas and mitigation processes 
sets the foundation for our human rights 
action plan and roadmap. 

Through our anonymous whistleblowing 
and grievance platform SpeakOut and 
other channels, we received messages 
relating to 90 incidents (2022: 47 incidents). 
Topics encompassed allegations 
concerning work-related harassment 
and unfair treatment, labour rights and 
safety and health matters. 

Communities 
We aim to maximise our positive impact 
in local communities by supporting their 
sustainable development. We engage 
with our local stakeholders to understand 
the needs of our communities and how 
we impact them. 

In 2023, we conducted Stakeholder 
Engagement Conversations in our 
Ružomberok (Slovakia) mill. These open 
dialogues with a variety of stakeholders, 
facilitated by an independent third party 
inform our understanding and actions 
in relation to our local impact. 

Our voluntary investments include 
contributions where we can make the 
greatest difference, as well as employees 
sharing their skills, time and networks. 
We focus on initiatives related to education, 
environmental protection, enterprise support 
and job creation, as well as support for 
community health care and infrastructure 
development. Our social investments in 
2023 were €7.3 million (2022: €8.9 million).

In times of crisis we provide special 
donations to credible NGOs and aid 
organisations to help their efforts. 

Procurement 
Continuously improving transparency and 
sustainability in our supply chain is an 
essential part of our responsible business 
practice. We collaborate with our suppliers 
to support responsible procurement, 
manage supply chain risk and enhance our 
suppliers’ own sustainability practices. 

In 2023, our global supply chain included 
around 12,000 suppliers in 69 countries. 
We procured €6.2 billion worth of 
goods and services from these suppliers 
(2022: €7 billion), with 57% sourced 
locally (2022: 58%).  

To address specific wood and pulp 
procurement requirements, our dedicated 
Due Diligence Management System 
(DDMS) verifies that we purchase all our 
wood fibre from responsible sources in line 
with our commitment to zero deforestation. 
In 2023, 100% of our wood fibre was 
compliant with FSC, PEFC or Controlled 
Wood requirements. 

For all other materials and services, we 
identify sustainability risks and assess 
supplier performance through our 
Responsible Procurement process, 
which improves transparency and supports 
supplier engagement. In 2023, we began 
collaborating with the global sustainability 
rating company EcoVadis with a selected 
pilot group of 460 Mondi suppliers: 
36 suppliers with high sustainability 
risk were invited to participate in an 
individual assessment. From this, 
5 suppliers were unresponsive or 
declined our assessment invitation 
and remain potential high-risk (1.1%).

Principal risks
Managing our risks

Our Group risk management 
framework and internal control 
environment are designed to 
address the risks that could 
undermine our business model 
and ability to execute our 
strategy into the future.

Our risk management 
framework
The Board has overall responsibility 
for setting the Group’s strategy and is 
responsible for monitoring and maintaining 
the effectiveness of the Group’s risk 
management activities and internal control 
processes. The Board has put in place 
procedures for identifying, evaluating and 
managing the risks faced by the Group.

The Board has determined the Group’s 
residual risk exposure and related risk 
appetite, using a risk rating matrix 
which takes into consideration both the 
likelihood of the risk event occurring and 
the magnitude of the impact in the event 
that the risk event occurs. The risk rating 
matrix is based on the residual risk 
that the Group faces after taking into 
consideration the internal control 
environment and related mitigating actions 
and controls. The Board has established 
specific appetite levels for each principal 
risk, ensuring that our risk exposure 
remains appropriate at all times. The Board 
considers changes in principal risks and 
reviews emerging risks during the year. 

The Audit Committee performs an annual 
review of the Group’s principal risks and 
related mitigation, including consideration 
of acceptable risk appetite levels for the 
Group. Each of the Group’s principal and 
emerging risks is reviewed in detail by 
either the Board, the Audit Committee or 
the Sustainable Development Committee 
through the course of the year, considering 
the detailed risk description, the controls 
and mitigating actions in place, the level 
of internal and external assurance obtained, 
and the resultant residual risk exposure.

Business units are required to conduct 
an annual, detailed review of their risks 
and compile a risk register which is 
reviewed and approved by the business 
unit operating committees. The risk 
management process ensures that the 
various business unit operating committees 
review the principal and emerging risks 
in their respective businesses and identify 
the actions and controls to mitigate these 
risks. Management assurance is provided 
on both a formal and informal basis. 
Risk management is embedded in all 
decision-making processes and captured 
in our policies, procedures and delegated 
authorities, with ongoing review by the 
Board and risk assessments forming part 
of all investment decisions.

In combination with the Audit Committee, 
the Board conducted, over the course 
of the year, a robust assessment of the 
Group’s principal and emerging risks to 
which Mondi is exposed and it is satisfied 
that the Group has effective systems and 
controls in place to manage these risks 
within the risk appetite levels established.

Our internal control 
environment
Our internal controls aim to provide 
reasonable assurance as to the accuracy, 
reliability and integrity of our financial 
information and non-financial disclosures 
and the Group’s compliance with 
applicable laws, regulations and internal 
policies, as well as the effectiveness 
of internal processes. 

Through our structured approach, the 
control environment is subject to regular 
monitoring and review to reduce the 
likelihood of any significant deficiencies 
arising, control weaknesses are identified 
and addressed, and new or emerging risks 
are identified early and monitored regularly. 

The Group’s internal control systems have 
been in place for the year under review and 
up to the date of approval of the Integrated 
report and financial statements 2023 and 
are in accordance with the Guidance on 
Risk Management, Internal Control and 
Related Financial and Business Reporting 
issued by the Financial Reporting Council. 

No significant failings or weaknesses were 
identified in the internal control systems 
for the year under review. 

The Board and its committees have 
approved the Group’s financial, business 
conduct, operating and administrative 
policies, including those relating to 
delegation of signing authorities and 
information security. The policies provide 
a framework for the Group’s internal 
control environment and outline required 
standards of behaviour. Business units are 
required to ensure that they adhere to 
approved Group policies and that they 
have implemented their own supporting 
policies where appropriate. In line with the 
approved delegation of authorities, specific 
matters are reserved for Executive 
Committee or Board approval, including 
the approval of major capital investments, 
acquisitions and disposals.

Management is responsible for regularly 
reviewing the Group’s financial 
performance, and it is the responsibility 
of management at all operational levels 
to ensure that risks are appropriately 
managed and a proper internal control 
environment is in place to anticipate and 
respond to risks. The Group’s financial 
reporting process includes the monthly 
results and management reports, an annual 
three-year plan (budget period), and three 
updates to the first budget year during 
the course of that budget year. Detailed 
monthly management reports and variance 
analyses comparing actual with planned 
results are prepared. In-depth reviews of 
business units and market developments 
are performed regularly, and are designed 
to ensure ongoing monitoring of financial 
and sustainability performance and early 
identification of potential issues and/or 
emerging risks. In addition, the Board 
reviews the Integrated report and financial 
statements to ensure it is fair, balanced and 
understandable, and the Audit Committee 
reviews and approves the accounting 
policies for each financial year.

Work closely with the business units to manage and monitor these risk areas

The three levels of assurance in our internal control environment

Operational management
– Key policies and procedures covering all main areas 
of business conduct are approved by the Board 
and each business unit and Group function is required 
to adhere to these overall Group policies.

– Management is responsible for regularly reviewing 
its entity’s operating, financial and sustainability 
performance and for preparing and reviewing 
monthly management accounts and business 
reports as appropriate. 

– Twice a year, all financial managers are required 
to complete an internal control assessment 
and provide written confirmation of compliance 
with Group policies and procedures. This formal 
confirmation highlights any control weaknesses 
or deficiencies identified.

Management review
– Management is responsible for regularly reviewing 
the Group’s operating, financial and sustainability 
performance, including monthly management 
accounts, and the progress of significant capital 
investment projects.

– Management at Group level and, in more depth, 
at business unit level is responsible for a detailed 
assessment of current market conditions.
– The Group functions (controlling, information 
technology, safety and health, sustainable 
development, tax and treasury) each have 
Board-approved policies in place against which 
conduct is regularly assessed.

Independent assurance
– Internal and external audit.
– Regular reviews and vetting by external regulatory 
and non-regulatory parties, as required and as part 
of our operational management, including ISO 
certification, Sustainable Development report 
assurance and information security programmes.

– The Group sustainable development key 

performance indicators are externally verified.

Principal risks in 2023
Over the course of the past year, the Board 
and the Audit Committee have reviewed 
the Group’s principal and emerging risks. 
In evaluating the Group’s risk management 
and internal control processes, the Audit 
Committee has considered both internal 
and external audit reports and received 
confirmation from the finance directors 
of the business units that the Group’s 
control frameworks have operated 
satisfactorily. The sustainable development 
risks considered throughout our business 
have been reviewed by the Sustainable 
Development Committee during the year. 
Sustainable development risks that are 
considered to be principal risks are 
reviewed by the Audit Committee as 
part of the annual review process.

A detailed risk assurance map is used 
to present our principal risks to the Board, 
Audit Committee and Sustainable 
Development Committee, facilitating 
comprehensive discussions on risk. 
The Group remains committed to 
the continuous improvement of risk 
assessment, risk management and 
risk reporting.

Key changes in the year
The Group’s most significant risks are 
long term in nature. The assessment 
of the principal risks is updated annually 
to reflect the developments in our 
strategic priorities and Board discussions 
on principal and emerging risks.

The pandemic risk has been removed 
as a separate Group principal risk and 
incorporated as part of the employee 
and contractor health and safety risk, 
though it is part of the risk consideration 
embedded in all the principal risks.

The Group is making progress towards 
our MAP2030 commitments. Further details 
of our performance in this regard can be 
found on page 44. Consequently, the 
climate change risk was derated due to 
the assessed impact on Mondi after climate 
mitigation and adaptation initiatives are 
considered. The assessment is supported 
by the Group’s capital investment 
programme which is focused on growing 
capacity through more sustainable means 
of production and is designed to help us 
meet our science-based Net-Zero targets.

The tax risk was derated with an assessed 
decrease in both impact and likelihood. 
The assessed derating is supported by 
initiatives taken in recent years to reduce 
complexity in our legal structure and the 
Group's risk occurrence track record. 

During the year, the risk to energy security 
and related input costs was derated with 
an assessed decrease in both impact and 
likelihood. Stabilisation of European energy 
markets, which are adapting to the impact 
of the war in Ukraine and a high inflationary 
environment, and a proven operational and 
financial performance through a period of 
energy price and supply volatility in 2022 
and 2023 support confidence in the 
Group’s risk mitigating and planning 
activities. Additionally, during the year 
the Group implemented initiatives to 
further reduce dependence on natural gas 
to operate our mills.

Emerging risks
The Board continues to highlight the 
execution of major capital expenditure 
projects as an emerging risk. The emerging 
risk is managed through mitigating 
activities, such that the residual risk 
exposure is not considered significant.

All capital expenditure projects are planned 
in detail with contingency plans in place 
in order to avoid cost overruns and 
design and building defects, and to 
ensure employee and contractor safety. 
Post-investment reviews are conducted 
on major capital expenditure projects 
to evaluate the project execution against 
the original plan and identify lessons learnt. 
We will continue to monitor potential 
risks relating to executing major capital 
expenditure projects in the year ahead.

Risk appetite
A review of the Group’s approach to the 
assessment of risk appetite was performed 
during the year. The review considered 
various risk appetite methodologies 
and settled on an optimal approach which 
enables risk owners to use and own 
the risk appetite in a practical manner. 
The Group utilises a four-point 
risk appetite rating scale against which 
the residual risk of each principal risk 
can be considered. Where a difference is 
identified between the risk appetite and 
residual risk rating, the risk owner provides 
an explanation for and a chosen approach 
to address the differential to the Executive 
Committee and the Board.

The Board, in combination with the Audit 
Committee, is satisfied that the review 
performed has enhanced the Group’s 
approach to risk management.

Strategic risks

Industry productive capacity

Description
– Market supply/demand balance is impacted by large incremental 

new capacity additions.

– Unless market growth exceeds capacity additions, excess capacity 

may lead to lower selling prices.

– Plant utilisation levels are the main driver of profitability in 

paper mills.

– Investments in newer technology may lower operating costs 

and provide increased product functionality, particularly relevant 
in the converting businesses, which can increase competition 
and impact margins.

Product substitution

Description
– Changes in consumer preferences and socio-economic and 
demographic trends can affect the demand for packaging 
and paper products in general, and demand for specific grades 
of our products in particular. 

– Substitution can be to a different packaging or paper substrate 

or to a different solution meeting the same need. 

– With increased public awareness of sustainability challenges 

and our customers’ focus on sustainable packaging, on balance, 
our business faces more opportunities than risks, underpinned 
by the transition to more sustainable solutions, although there 
could be pressures on certain areas of our portfolio. 

– Product substitution trends, many of which benefit Mondi, are, 

for example: replacing plastic-based with paper-based packaging, 
moving to mono-material recyclable plastic packaging solutions, 
lighter weighting of products, increasing the recycled content in 
packaging, demand for certified and responsibly produced materials 
and the impact of digital media on uncoated fine paper demand.

– The EU's Packaging and Packaging Waste Regulation (PPWR) 

might further influence product substitution.

Risk trend

Link to 
strategy

Key mitigation
– Monitor industry developments in terms of changes in capacity and 
utilisation levels both short and long term, as well as market trends 
and trade flows in our product markets, enabling us to establish 
target capacity utilisation levels in the short term and to evaluate 
capital investment projects in the long term.

– Strategic focus on owning cost-advantaged assets, with consistent 
investment to secure our competitiveness, coupled with increasing 
our exposure to structurally growing packaging markets.

– Partnering with our customers for innovation, developing sustainable 

and responsibly produced products. 

– Continuous focus on operational performance, quality, customer 

relationships and service, including developing and applying digital 
platforms to drive performance in our operations and improve 
customer reach.

– Maintaining strong relationships with machine suppliers to identify 
current market developments and technologies, coupled with a 
routine review of our asset portfolio and capacity utilisation levels 
to identify underperforming assets and take decisive action to 
drive performance.

Key mitigation
– A wide portfolio of paper-based and flexible plastic-based solutions 

provides protection from the effects of substitution.

– Engagement with customers and consumers to help understand and 
drive a more sustainable approach to their packaging requirements.

– Development of sustainable, competitive and cost-effective

Strategic risks continued

Fluctuations and variability in selling prices or gross margins

Description
– Price fluctuations in our key paper products can have material profit 

and cash flow implications. 

– Selling prices are determined by changes in capacity and demand 
for our products, which are, in turn, influenced by macroeconomic 
conditions, competitive behaviour, consumer spending preferences 
and inventory levels maintained by our customers. 

– Changes in prices differ between products and geographic regions, 

and the timing and magnitude of such changes have varied 
significantly over time. 

– Gross margins in our converting operations are impacted by 

fluctuations in key input costs, such as paper, which cannot be 
passed on to customers in all cases. 

Country risk

Description
– The Group operates in a number of countries with differing political, 
economic and legal systems. In some countries, such systems are 
less predictable than in countries with more developed institutional 
structures. Political or economic upheaval, changes in laws, 
nationalisation, or expropriation of assets may have a material effect 
on our operations in those countries.

– The current macroeconomic environment is impacted by a number 
of uncertainties, including the effects of increased protectionism, 
use of trade tariffs and economic sanctions.

– In South Africa, the Group is subject to land claims and could face 

adverse land claim rulings. 

– Sustained higher inflation is evident in many economies. Türkiye 

is experiencing a hyperinflationary economic environment.

– In Egypt, foreign currency is prioritised to pay for essential goods 

resulting in difficulties to source foreign currency to pay our foreign 
suppliers.

Risk owner
Executive 
Committee 
(oversight CEO)

Risk trend

Link to 
strategy

Key mitigation
– Strategic focus on higher growth markets and products where we 
enjoy a competitive advantage through innovation, proximity or 
production cost. 

– Continued investment in our high-quality, cost-advantaged asset 
base, ensuring we maintain our competitive cost position while 
developing businesses in higher growth markets with better long-
term fundamentals. 

– Exposure to price volatility of key input costs is reduced by our high 

levels of vertical integration. 

– Financial policies and contract structures take the inherent price 
volatility of the markets in which we operate into consideration. 

– Ongoing monitoring of current market fundamentals, market demand 
trends and market prices, enabling evaluation of price expectations 
in the short term and increased understanding of long-term trends. 

– Continuous monitoring of our order intake to identify changing 

trends and developments in our own product markets. 

– Frequent review of gross margin development in order to monitor 

price pass through to customers.

Risk owner
Executive 
Committee 
(oversight CEO)

Risk trend

Link to 
strategy

Key mitigation
– Our geographic diversification and decentralised management 
structure reduce our exposure to any specific jurisdiction. 
Our operational management teams have strong localised 
operational experience. 

– Capital and debt are structured in each country based on assessed 

risks and exposures in order to mitigate the effect of country 
specific risks. 

– Regular review of our sales strategies to ensure compliance with 
trade restrictions and sanctions and to mitigate export risk in 
countries with less predictable environments and, where possible, 
obtaining credit insurance. 

– Country specific risk premiums are approved by the Board to be 
added to the required returns on investment projects in those 
countries where risks are deemed to be higher; new investments 
are subject to rigorous strategic and commercial evaluation. 
– Maintain a permanent internal audit presence and operate asset 

protection units in large operations in higher risk locations. 

– In South Africa, we continue to engage with government on land 

matters and monitor how the expropriation bill will be implemented. 
The Group has settled a number of land claims structured as sale 
and leaseback arrangements, which provide a framework for settling 
future land claims.

– Regular formal and informal interaction with government officials, 

local communities and business partners helps us to remain abreast 
of changes and new developments.

Strategic risks continued
Climate change risks

Description
– Climate change risks will likely impact our business in the medium 

and long term. 

– The energy we require to manufacture our products results in 

Scope 1 and Scope 2 greenhouse gas (GHG) emissions. Our value 
chain emissions contribute to our Scope 3 emissions.

– Fibre is the main raw material for our products and forests are an 

important carbon store, with sustainably managed forests 
supporting a circular bioeconomy.

– Customers and consumers are concerned about the consequences 
of climate change and are looking for solutions produced from 
renewable materials and reduced carbon footprints. Investors 
are increasingly focused on the climate impact of their portfolios. 

– Our climate change risks include transition and physical risks. 

Transition risks include regulatory risks, for example GHG emissions, 
regulatory changes and energy supply cost volatility due to 
changes in future energy supply mix. Physical risks include the 
impact of water shortages due to drought or changing precipitation 
patterns and increased costs driven by a shortage of wood supply 
in the long term due to physical impacts such as droughts, pests 
and diseases. 

Financial risks

Capital structure

Description
– A strong and stable financial position enables strategic flexibility 
and provides the ability to take advantage of opportunities.
– Our ability to raise debt and/or equity financing is significantly 
influenced by general economic conditions, developments in 
credit markets, equity market volatility and our credit rating. 
– Failure to obtain financing at reasonable rates could prevent us 
from realising our strategy and have a negative impact on our 
competitive position. 

Risk owner
Group Head of 
Sustainable 
Development

Risk trend

Link to 
strategy

Key mitigation
– Reducing our GHG emissions through a combination of capital 
investment and ongoing efficiency programmes to improve 
our energy efficiency, increasing the use of biomass-based fuels 
and decreasing carbon-intensive energy sources. 

– Sourcing our wood from diverse regions and forest types mitigates 
the potential impacts of climate change on our wood fibre raw 
material, particularly in Europe. In South Africa, we continue to 
investigate and select trees which require less water and are more 
resistant to pests and disease.

– Monitoring and measuring our impact on climate change, reporting 
and having our GHG emissions and energy usage independently 
assured. 

– Committing to transition to Net-Zero in line with a 1.5°C scenario 
by 2050 and working on reducing our emissions in line with our 
approved SBTi targets across Scope 1, 2 and 3 emissions.

– Investigating and reporting on climate change risks and opportunities 
in adherence to internationally accepted recommendations, such as 
those published by the FSB’s TCFD. 

TCFD 
Pages 55-64

Key mitigation
– Maintaining strong investment grade credit metrics provides access 

to global debt capital markets. 

– Our central Treasury function operates under a Board-approved 

treasury policy, targeting investment grade credit ratings and with 
access to diverse sources of funding with varying maturities.

– The majority of our external debt is issued centrally. 
– Regular reporting to the Board on our treasury management policies. 
– Compliance with treasury policies is monitored and we engage 

external advisers to review the Treasury function at regular intervals.

Currency risk

Description
– We are exposed to the effect of changes in foreign currency rates; 

Key mitigation
– Hedging is utilised for balance sheet exposures and material 

the impact of currency fluctuations affects us because of 
mismatches between the currencies in which our operating costs 
are incurred and those in which revenues are received. 

– Key operating cost currencies that are not fully offset by local 

currency denominated revenues include the South African rand, 
Polish zloty, Czech koruna and Swedish krona, while the 
fluctuations in the US dollar, British pound and Turkish lira can also 
have a material impact as our revenues in these currencies are 
greater than operating costs incurred. 

– Appreciation of the euro compared with the currencies of the other 
key paper-producing regions or paper pricing currencies, notably 
the US dollar, reduces the competitiveness of Mondi products in 
Europe compared with imports, which can result in lower revenues 
and earnings. 

forecasted capital expenditures upon identification. 

– Diversification of the Group’s currency exposure creates natural 

hedges, and as such we do not hedge our exposure to projected 
future sales or operating costs and our businesses respond 
to adverse currency fluctuations by increasing selling prices or 
increasing exports where competitiveness improves as operating 
currencies weaken; entities also borrow in their local currencies 
to minimise translation risk. 

– Continuous monitoring of exchange rate movements and 

sensitivities, and evaluation of the impact of exchange variances 
on our results. 

– Regular review of our prices and monitoring of import and export 

trade flows.

Tax risk

Description
– There is an increasing disclosure compliance burden in the 

international tax environment, requiring increasing transparency 
and reporting and in-depth scrutiny of the tax affairs of 
multinational companies, such as the Global Reporting Initiative’s 
tax reporting standard.

– We make significant intra-group charges, the basis for which 

is subject to review during tax audits. 

Operational risks

Cost and availability of raw materials

Description
– We use significant amounts of wood, pulp, paper for recycling, 
polymers and chemicals in our production processes, meaning 
access to these raw materials is essential to our operations.
– The prices for many raw material inputs fluctuate in correlation 

with global commodity cycles. 

– Wood prices and availability may be adversely affected by reduced 

quantities of available suitable wood supply due to increased 
frequency of severe weather events, changes in rainfall, increased 
pest and disease outbreaks, increased use of wood as biofuel, 
alternative use of wood for heating and changes in demand for 
wood as a building material.

– Climate change will create long-term structural changes to the 

pricing and availability of wood, with temperature and precipitation 
changes resulting in a geographic shift of optimal forest growth 
areas, and an impact from forest-related legislative policies, 
particularly in the EU. 

– Force majeure events can influence raw material supply and pricing, 

directly affecting the market production and supply balance. 

Key mitigation
– A Board-approved Group tax strategy is reviewed annually.
– Appropriate and attentive management of our affairs, with 

operations structured tax efficiently to benefit from available 
incentives and exemptions. 

– Dedicated tax resources throughout the Group supported by a 

centralised Group tax team. 

– Arm’s length principles are applied in the pricing of all intra-group 

transactions in accordance with Organisation for Economic 
Co-operation and Development (OECD) guidelines. 

– External advisory opinions are obtained where relevant, including 
major projects such as acquisitions and restructuring activities.
– Regular engagement with external advisers to stay up to date with 

changes in tax legislation and tax practice.

Key mitigation
– We are committed to acquiring our raw materials from responsible 
sources and avoiding the use of any controversial or illegal supply. 
Our Responsible Procurement process helps us to assess and 
evaluate the performance of our suppliers and their adherence 
to our policies.

– Multi-stakeholder processes address challenges in meeting demand 
for sustainable fibre; we encourage legislation for the local collection 
of recycled materials. 

– Our operations use multiple suppliers and a centralised procurement 

team works closely with our operations in actively pursuing 
longer-term agreements with strategic suppliers; in Europe, wood 
is sourced from diverse regions and forest types to mitigate the 
potential supply impacts of unforeseen events. We source wood 
from our own managed forests in South Africa.

– Strong relationships with suppliers of critical raw materials 

enable higher volume allocation in times of shortages, and a safety 
stock programme facilitates exchange of raw materials within 
our plant network.

– Where relevant, indexation clauses in revenue contracts allow 
the pass-through of major raw material price movements.

– Wood and pulp suppliers are assessed as part of our Due Diligence 

Management System which addresses the main legal and 
sustainability risks. 

– In South Africa, we have tree improvement programmes to 

produce stronger trees; fire prevention and firefighting capacity 
are integrated into a fire management system with local 
Fire Protection Associations and neighbouring operations.

Operational risks continued

Energy security and related input costs

Description
– Availability of sufficient and reliable energy supply is a key focus 
area; as the transition to cleaner energy sources accelerates, 
accompanied by increased regulation, the energy supply portfolio 
is undergoing long-term changes, such as an increase in demand 
for renewable energy and an increase in carbon taxes, which 
increases the risk of more volatile pricing as well as potential 
for severe energy interruptions.

– Security of supply of gas is subject to political pressures and 
could be intermittent, while renewable energy sources, such 
as wind and solar, are subject to unpredictable physical weather 
patterns. Competition for sources of renewable energy, such 
as biomass, causes cost and availability pressures.

– Rapid increases in fuel and energy costs represent higher direct 
costs to the Group as well as for our suppliers, which in turn may 
seek to increase prices which may be difficult to pass on to 
customers and could cause a contraction of gross margins.
– Income from the sale of renewable energy, either from sales 

of certificates, subsidies or sales of renewable energy to the grid, 
represents a source of income for various pulp and paper mills 
and is subject to both volatility in price and regulatory changes.
– Availability of sufficient and reliable electricity supply in South Africa 
remains a concern and above inflationary increases are virtually 
certain.

Risk owner
Group Head of 
Operations

Risk trend

Link to 
strategy

Key mitigation
– Investment in improvements to our energy profile and increased 
electricity self-sufficiency, including the use of renewable energy 
sources, strengthens the energy efficiency of our operations while 
reducing ongoing operating costs and carbon emission levels. 
– Where we generate electricity surplus to our own requirements, 
we may sell such surplus externally; we also generate income 
from the sale of green energy credits in certain of our operations 
at prices determined in the open market. 

– Optimised use of biomass-based fuels enables reduced use of 
fossil-based energy sources, such as carbon-intensive coal. 
– Energy costs are closely monitored and benchmarked against 
external sources and we monitor our electricity usage, carbon 
emission levels and use of renewable energy; most of our larger 
operations have high levels of electricity self-sufficiency. 

– Monitoring of renewable energy market fundamentals and changes 
in legislation supported by contact with local energy regulators. 
– Detailed compliance assessments regarding Industry Emissions 
and Energy Efficiency Directives to determine future investment 
requirements. 

Technical integrity of our operating assets

Description
– Our four major mills, Świecie (Poland), Štětí (Czech Republic), 

Ružomberok (Slovakia) and Richards Bay (South Africa), account 
for approximately 70% of our total pulp and paper production 
capacity. If operations at any of these key facilities are interrupted 
for any significant length of time, it could have a material effect 
on our financial position or performance. Our converting operations 
are spread over a considerably larger number of plants, providing 
risk diversification.

– Incidents such as fires, explosions or large machinery breakdowns, 
or the inability of our assets to perform the required function 
effectively and efficiently while protecting our people, the business, 
the environment and stakeholders, could result in property damage, 
loss of production, reputational damage, and/or safety and 
environmental incidents.

– Regular maintenance and project-related shuts can experience 

delays in start-up and ramp-up due to reliance on external suppliers 
and contractors for engineering services and equipment supplies. 

Key mitigation
– A capital investment programme supports the replacement of older 
equipment to improve both reliability and integrity, and our proactive 
repair and maintenance approach is designed to improve production 
reliability and minimise breakdown risks. 

Risk owner
Group Head of 
Operations

Risk trend

– Detailed risk assessments of high-priority equipment are conducted 
with specific processes and procedures in place for the ongoing 
management and maintenance of such equipment. 

– Production optimisation throughout the organisation by learning from 
our best performing operations and identifying emerging issues early.

Link to 
strategy

– Digital initiatives utilising advanced analytics, machine sensors and 
process automation enable improved operational efficiency and 
asset utilisation.

– All incidents are actively monitored with a formal reporting process 
which allows us to share lessons learned across our operations, 
identify emerging issues, conduct benchmarking, and evaluate 
the effectiveness of our risk reduction activities. 

– External experts perform technical integrity assessments at our 
major sites and enhance our engineering and loss prevention 
competencies and capabilities. 

– A Fire Protection programme supported by external experts and 
independent loss prevention audits with property insurance cover 
for key risks.

Environmental impact

Description
– Our operations require water and energy and generate emissions 

to air, water and land. We are subject to a wide range of 
environmental laws and regulations, as well as the requirements 
of our customers and expectations of our broader stakeholders. 
Costs to meet compliance requirements, such as Best Available 
Techniques (BAT), potential restoration and soil and groundwater 
clean-up activities, and increasing costs from the effects of 
emissions could have an adverse impact on our profitability. 
– The availability of water in water scarce and stressed areas could 
pose a risk to continuing to operate our production facilities 
to their full potential.

– As we purchase significant amounts of wood and fibre on the 

market and manage plantation forestry landholdings in South Africa, 
a decline in ecosystem functions and loss of biodiversity could 
impact the natural resources that we rely on.

Key mitigation
– Compliance with all applicable environmental requirements where 
we operate and with our own policies and procedures, at or above 
local policy requirements, supported by externally accredited 
environmental management systems. 

– A clean production philosophy to address the impact from emissions,

discharge and waste. 

– Conducting water stewardship assessments to address risks related 
to water scarcity, and promotion of equitable use of water resources 
among local stakeholders wherever we operate. 
– Specialist internal networks share best practices and 

comprehensively report and investigate major environmental 
incidents to avoid reoccurrence.

– Monitoring and reporting of our environmental performance 
indicators against our targets, with our Scope 1 and 2 GHG

Compliance risk

Reputational risk

Description
– Non-compliance with the legal and governance requirements 

and globally established responsible business conduct in any of the 
jurisdictions in which we operate and within our supply chain could 
expose us to significant risk if not actively managed. 

– Failure to successfully manage relationships with our stakeholders 
could disrupt our operations and adversely impact the Group’s 
reputation. 

– Fines imposed by authorities for non-compliance are severe and, 

in some cases, legislation can result in criminal sanction for entities 
and individuals found guilty. 

– Areas of weaker governance present the challenge of addressing 
potential human rights issues in our operations and supply chain; 
human rights legislation further highlights the need to identify 
and address potential risks of child labour, forced or bonded labour, 
modern slavery, human trafficking and other human rights risks 
in our supply chain. 

Key mitigation
– A comprehensive training and compliance programme, supported 
by self-certification and reporting, with personal sanction for failure

– Engagement with local stakeholders through formal and informal processes. 
– Perform screening of our suppliers for sustainability risk in accordance 

with our Code of Conduct for Suppliers to better align with our risk criteria. 

– Continuous assessment of our governance of human rights issues 

and any potential risks in our operations and supply chain.

– Compliance committees are established at a Group level to monitor 

the risk relating to trade controls, data protection, competition 
compliance and business integrity – chaired by the Group CFO with 
representatives from across the business. Our legal and governance 
compliance is supported by a centralised legal compliance team 
and is subject to regular internal audit review. 

– We have a confidential reporting platform (SpeakOut), enabling 

employees, customers, suppliers, communities and other stakeholders 
to raise concerns about conduct that may be contrary to our values.

Viability statement

As part of the approval of this 
Integrated report, the Board has 
assessed the Group’s prospects 
and viability.

Factors in assessing long-term 
prospects
The Group’s business model and strategy 
are described in detail on pages 14-19 
and 20-21 respectively. Our strategy is to 
deliver value accretive growth sustainably. 
We do this by building on the competitive 
advantages we enjoy today, setting a clear 
roadmap for investment and operational 
decisions into the future. Our performance 
against our strategic objectives is 
discussed in more detail on pages 22-29.

Mondi’s geographical footprint, with around 
100 production sites across more than 
30 countries, and broad product range help 
mitigate potential risks of customer or 
supplier liquidity issues. With our scale, 
quality asset base, integrated operations 
and excellent customer proposition, we 
create value for our stakeholders in line 
with the Mondi Way.

The Group’s financial position, cash flows, 
liquidity position and borrowing facilities 
are described in the financial statements. 
At 31 December 2023, the Group had 
€754 million of undrawn, committed debt 
facilities. The weighted average maturity of 
the Group’s committed debt facilities was 
2.8 years. The principal loan arrangements 
are disclosed in note 20 of the financial 
statements. In addition, the Group had 
€1,592 million of cash and cash equivalents 
available, which include proceeds from 
the disposal of discontinued operations 
of €806 million.

Assessment of viability
The Board believes that the three years to 
December 2026 is an appropriate period 
over which a reasonable expectation of 
the Group’s longer-term viability can be 
evaluated. In coming to this view, the Board 
has considered the inherent volatility in selling 
prices, input costs and exchange rates, the 
time taken for new investments in pulp and 
paper production capacity to be introduced 
into the market, typical new product 
development cycles, and the Group’s capital 
structure. Given our principal risks, the Board 
believes that the ability to assess the Group’s 
longer-term viability beyond this period 
becomes increasingly reduced. For these 
reasons, three years also represents the period 
of the Group’s formal planning horizon.

The assessment of viability has been based 
on the Group’s continuing operations. 
Any impact from discontinued operations 
or proceeds from disposal are fully 
excluded from the assessment. The net 
proceeds from the sale of the Group's 
Russian assets have been returned to the 
shareholders by way of a special dividend 
on 13 February 2024 and are hence 
excluded from the viability assessment.

The Board has considered the Group’s 
current financial position, strategy and 
plans for the next three years.

The Group’s principal risks identified on 
pages 69-79 have been assessed for their 
potential impact on the Group’s viability 
over the next three years as part of the 
risk assessment. Our structurally growing 
packaging markets are described in 
more detail on pages 12-13.

The Group’s three-year 2024-2026 plan 
(“budget period”) has been tested for 
severe but plausible downside scenarios. 
These are summarised in the table at 
the bottom of this page. 

While linked to the Group’s principal risks, 
the scenarios detailed in the table below 
are hypothetical and designed to test the 
ability of the Group to withstand such severe 
outcomes. In an event that a scenario partly 
or fully takes place, the Group has various 
options available to maintain liquidity 
and continue operations. The scenarios 
modelled are linked to those principal risks 
which are most likely to occur and have 
the most significant impact.

The sales volume compression scenario 
(Scenario 1) was calculated with assumed 
reductions of up to 11% depending on 
the relevant product compared with the 
assumptions in each year of the budget period.

The margin compression scenario (Scenario 2) 
was calculated with assumed reductions 
of up to 3% depending on the relevant 
product compared with the assumptions 
in each year of the budget period.

Both margin and volume sensitivities have 
been modelled considering current and 
potential future market developments.

Wood, gas and electricity prices in our major 
European operations have been tested in 
Scenario 3, based on internal management 
assumptions. The impact of the other 
input costs, which are usually passed on 
through higher sales prices in the converting 
operations, have been excluded from the 
downside sensitivities, similar to prior years. 

Furthermore, in Scenario 4 the currency risk 
was tested as the wide geographic spread 
exposes the Group to the potential impact 
of exchange rate fluctuations. We have 
evaluated the impact of a weaker US dollar 
and Turkish lira exchange rates, and stronger 
other emerging market currencies including 
the South African rand, relative to the euro. 
These currencies were chosen as the Group 
has a significant exposure in them. A 10% 
weakening and a 10% strengthening of the 
respective currencies against the euro 
was applied, based on historical exchange 
rate developments.

While the assumptions we have applied in 
all four scenarios are possible, they do not 
represent our view of the likely outcome. 
Testing was performed for Scenarios 1 
and 2 individually and in combination for 
a duration of three years, as these two 
scenarios are the ones we consider are 
most likely to happen in combination. 
The likelihood of other scenarios happening 
in combination is considered remote.

We have assessed the impact of these 
assumptions on the Group’s key financial 
metrics over the assessment period, including 
profitability, net debt, and net debt to 
underlying EBITDA.

Based on the results of these scenarios 
individually and in combination for Scenarios 1 
and 2, the Board is satisfied that the 
Group would be able to respond to such 
circumstances through various means which 
could include a reduction and deferral of 
capital expenditure and further rationalisation 
and/or restructuring of operations, to 
ensure that the Group continues to meet 
its ongoing obligations.

The Group meets its funding requirements 
from a variety of sources, as more fully 
described in the financial statements in note 
20. The Board is satisfied that the Group will 
have sufficient liquidity to meet its needs over 
the Group’s formal planning horizon. Testing 
compliance with financial covenants continues 
not to be needed as none of the Group’s loan 
agreements has a financial covenant.

While the Group’s going concern assessment 
(as set out below) takes what the directors 
consider to be a very cautious approach in 
not assuming any renewal of the Group’s 
Eurobond maturing in April 2024, in part in the 
context of the short timeframe for that going 
concern assessment, the Board notes that 
the Group has a track record of successfully 
accessing both the bank and debt capital 
markets for funding, and the Group’s 
management is expecting to be able 
to refinance the facilities maturing during 
the viability assessment period. The Board 
believes that the strong and stable financial 
position of the Group, supported by a 
continued strong investment grade credit 
rating from both Moody’s Investors Service 
(Baa1, outlook stable) and Standard & Poor’s 
(A-, outlook stable), ensures the Group has 
access to funding through the business cycle. 
For this reason, for the purposes of assessing 
viability over a longer period, the assessment 
was carried out against the Group’s 
committed debt facilities on the assumption 
that the Group’s €500 million Eurobond

maturing in April 2024 and €600 million 
Eurobond maturing in April 2026 will 
be refinanced. 

Taking into account the Group’s strategy, 
principal risks and the results of the downside 
scenario assessments, and on the assumption 
that over the extended viability assessment 
the Group will continue to be able to 
successfully refinance its debt as it has done 
it historically, the directors have a reasonable 
expectation that the Group will be able to 
continue in operation and meet its liabilities 
as they fall due over the three year period 
of the viability assessment.
Going concern
The directors have reviewed the Group’s 
budget and considered the assumptions 
contained in the budget, including 
consideration of the principal risks which may 
impact the Group’s performance in the 18 
months following the balance sheet date and 
considerations of the period immediately 
thereafter.

The assessment of going concern has been 
based on the Group’s continuing operations. 
Any impact from discontinued operations or 
proceeds from disposal are fully excluded 
from the assessment. The net proceeds from 
the sale of the Group's Russian assets have 
been returned to shareholders by way of a 
special dividend on 13 February 2024 and are 
hence excluded from the going concern 
assessment. 

The Group has a strong balance sheet. At 
31 December 2023, the Group had a liquidity 
position of €2,346 million, comprising €754 
million of undrawn committed debt facilities 
and cash and cash equivalents of €1,592 
million available, which included proceeds 
from the disposal of discontinued operations 
of €806 million. As the Group’s debt facilities 
and loan agreements contain no financial 
covenants, in performing its going concern 
assessment the directors have focused on 
liquidity, which was adjusted to exclude the 
net proceeds from the disposal of 
discontinued operations, given that these 
were distributed to shareholders by way of 
a special dividend in February 2024.

The current and possible future impact from 
the macroeconomic environment on the 
Group’s activities and performance has been 
considered by the Board in preparing its going 
concern assessment. The base case forecasts 
for the Group, being those arising over the 18 
month going concern assessment period as 
reflected in the Group’s 2024-2026 plan, were 
sensitised to reflect a severe but plausible 
downside scenario on Group performance. 

The scenario testing assumed severe but 
plausible volume and margin reductions 
happening in combination (consistent with the 
sensitivities described in Scenarios 1 and 2 in 
the viability statement) and was carried out 
against Mondi’s current committed debt 
facilities, and on the assumption that the 
Group’s €500 million Eurobond maturing in 
April 2024 will not be refinanced. However, 
the Group has a track record of successfully 
accessing both the bank and debt capital 
markets for funding and is expecting to be 
able to refinance the facilities if needed (which 
is consistent with the assumption applied in 
the longer-term viability assessment).

In the severe but plausible downside scenario, 
including no assumed refinancing of the 
Group’s debt, the Group has sufficient liquidity 
headroom through the whole period covered 
by the going concern assessment. 

In addition to its modelled downside going 
concern scenario, the Board has reverse 
stress tested the model to determine the 
extent of downturn which would result in no 
liquidity headroom. A decline of 48% to the 
planned underlying EBITDA in the period until 
30 June 2025, well in excess of that 
contemplated in the severe but plausible 
downside scenario, would need to persist 
throughout the observed period to result in no 
liquidity headroom, which is considered very 
unlikely. This reverse stress test also does not 
incorporate mitigating actions such as 
reductions and deferrals of capital and 
operational expenditure or cash preservation 
responses, which the Group would implement 
in the event of a severe and extended 
revenue decline. 

Following its assessment, the directors have 
formed a judgement, at the time of approving 
the Integrated report and consolidated 
financial statements, that there are no material 
uncertainties that cast doubt on the Group’s 
going concern status and that it is a 
reasonable expectation that the Group has 
adequate resources to continue in operational 
existence for the foreseeable future. For this 
reason, the Group continues to adopt the 
going concern basis in preparing the 
Integrated report and financial statements 
2023.

Dear fellow shareholder
This report provides you with a more 
detailed look at our approach to 
governance, how it facilitates the 
achievement of our purpose and strategy, 
and the Board’s key focus areas during 
the year.

While 2023 was a year of ongoing 
economic and geopolitical uncertainty, 
Mondi’s well-established and robust 
governance framework continued to 
support the Board in its decision-making, 
allowing it to lead the Group with integrity 
and to keep our purpose and values at the 
forefront, addressing the challenges this 
uncertainty presented.  

Effective governance and a culture of 
transparency, openness and respect among 
Board members and senior managers 
continued to provide the foundation for 
discussions and decision-making in the 
boardroom. They remain key to ensuring 
the long-term sustainable success of our 
business, ensuring that the Board operates 
effectively and that the voices of our 
stakeholders are heard during the Board’s 
deliberations.  

Board composition
Ensuring that the composition of the 
Board continues to give us the breadth 
and diversity of knowledge, skills and 
experience we need to achieve our 
purpose and deliver our strategy is crucial 
and remains under the constant scrutiny 
of the Nominations Committee. 

As outlined in last year's report, I am 
pleased to confirm that Anke Groth joined 
the Board as an independent non-
executive director in April 2023. Anke's 
appointment followed a search focused on 
strengthening the level of relevant financial 
experience on the Audit Committee, 
and it is already clear that Anke has been 
a strong addition to the Board, bringing 
new perspectives and insight. 

The Nominations Committee continues 
to focus on succession planning, not 
only at Board level, but also at senior 
management level, assessing the critical 
skills required by the Group and how 
we prepare for succession to key roles. 
More information on the Nominations 
Committee's work in this respect can 
be found on page 106.

How we comply with the 
UK Corporate Governance Code
Mondi aims to comply with the 
principles and provisions of the 
July 2018 edition of the UK Corporate 
Governance Code issued by the 
Financial Reporting Council 
(available at www.frc.org.uk). 

It is the view of the Board that 
Mondi has applied the principles, 
and complied with the provisions, 
of the UK Corporate Governance 
Code throughout the year.

The Governance report is structured 
according to the sections of the 
UK Corporate Governance Code 2018 
in order to clearly demonstrate how 
we have applied the principles.

The Board notes the publication 
of revisions to the UK Corporate 
Governance Code in January 2024. 
Consideration is being given to the 
revisions and any changes to our 
practices required as a result. 

Effective governance and a culture 
of transparency, openness and respect 
remain key to ensuring the long-term, 
sustainable success of our business. 
Philip Yea
Chair

More broadly, the Board continued 
in its efforts to further its understanding 
of the views of Mondi's employees, 
taking the opportunity to engage with 
a cross-section of employees during 
site visits, and using the results of our 
latest Group-wide Employee Survey 
to give us insight into current sentiment 
across the organisation. 

Sue continued to undertake 
engagement in a variety of formats, 
using these opportunities to discuss 
a wide range of issues, including safety, 
culture, innovation, talent development 
and retention. The insights we get from 
such face-to-face engagement with 
employees are valuable and we will 
continue to focus on offering transparent 
and open forums in which employees 
can express their views. More 
information relating to engagement 
undertaken during the year can be 
found on pages 92-93.

Details of our engagement with our 
key stakeholders more broadly, and 
how we consider their interests during 
decision-making, recognising the 
responsibility we have as a Board in this 
respect, can be found on pages 38-41 
in our Section 172 statement. 

Our people
The safety and health of our workforce 
continues to be a priority for the Board 
and is always high on the agenda at 
every meeting. While Mondi’s strong 
safety culture is deeply embedded 
across the organisation, we were deeply 
saddened by the fatality of a contractor 
at our Ružomberok mill (Slovakia) during 
the second half of the year, and the four 
life-altering injuries we experienced 
in our operations.

Our thoughts go out to those involved, 
and to their families, friends and work 
colleagues. Every effort is made to 
understand the circumstances, identify 
root causes and implement actions to 
minimise the risk of a reoccurrence of 
such tragic incidents. We also look to 
ensure that all the necessary support is 
provided following any serious safety 
incident, whether that be support to the 
families and work colleagues of those 
affected, or to enable those injured 
to return to work. 

Acknowledging the role that mindset 
and culture play in many of the safety 
incidents that occur, our approach 
to safety is increasingly focused on 
the Social Psychology of Risk, and 
the measures we can take to drive 
continuous improvement in our safety 
performance. This is a key focus for the 
Sustainable Development Committee, 
and it is pleasing to hear that safety is 
regularly raised by employees as a topic 
for discussion during the employee 
engagement meetings undertaken 
by Sue Clark, our nominated Board 
member for employee engagement, 
underlining the prominence given to 
safe behaviour across the business. 
More information regarding the actions 
we are taking to improve safety can 
be found on page 50.

Chair’s introduction continued

Strategy and long-term 
sustainability
The long-term sustainability of Mondi's 
strategy and the ability to achieve our 
purpose continued to provide the central 
tenets of the Board's discussions during the 
year. The strategy is regularly challenged, 
particularly during times of uncertainty, 
to ensure it remains appropriate for our 
stakeholders and is achievable in the long 
term. We are conscious that our strategy 
needs to evolve as external conditions 
change and our understanding of the 
impacts of our business is refined. 

The Board's annual in-depth review 
of Mondi's strategy was undertaken in this 
context, with discussions focusing on 
key drivers, including changing demand 
for sustainable packaging and eCommerce 
solutions. There was also particular focus 
on our growth capital investment 
programme, with the Board closely 
monitoring the progress of a number 
of our large capital expenditure projects 
during the year, more details of which 
can be found on page 26.

Sustainability remains at the centre of 
Mondi's strategy and so these discussions 
were undertaken with this in mind. During 
the year, the Sustainable Development 
Committee, on behalf of the Board, spent 
time considering a wide range of issues, 
including safety, diversity and inclusion, 
climate-related risks and opportunities, 
our progress towards science-based 
greenhouse gas emissions reduction 
targets, product stewardship and our 
Responsible Procurement process. 

The work being undertaken across the 
organisation aimed at understanding and 
managing these issues is extensive, and a 
thorough understanding of this at Board 
level is central to good decision-making. 

The deliberations of the Sustainable 
Development Committee, the meetings 
of which are normally attended by every 
Board member, provide the Board with 
valuable insight, and ensure the Board 
is in the best position possible to take 
decisions that may affect our broad 
range of stakeholders. 

Further information on the strategy review 
can be found on page 99, and details of 
the work of the Sustainable Development 
Committee can be found on pages 119-121.

Looking forward
As we go into 2024, it is clear that the 
external challenges facing businesses will 
continue, and that scrutiny of the impact 
we have on our environment and society 
will only increase. The duty we have as a 
Board to ensure that we take action to 
manage these impacts therefore remains 
as important as ever. I am confident that 
Mondi has the right governance framework 
and culture in place to meet this duty, 
while, at the same time, supporting the 
achievement of our strategy and purpose, 
to enable our stakeholders to achieve their 
ambitions, and to secure the long-term 
sustainable success of the business. 

I would like to thank everyone across 
the organisation for their work during 
2023, and I look forward to discussions 
and engagement with our stakeholders 
during 2024.

SpeakOut
The Group has an anonymous 
whistleblowing and grievance 
platform called ‘SpeakOut’, 
operated by an independent 
third party. 

SpeakOut, monitored by the 
Internal Audit function and 
overseen by the Board and Audit 
Committee, is a simple, accessible 
and confidential platform through 
which our employees, customers, 
suppliers and other stakeholders can 
raise concerns about any unethical 
practices and conduct contrary 
to Mondi’s values. The service 
is fundamental to ensuring the 
confidence of our employees 
and other stakeholders in our 
culture and values. 

Any type of concern can be raised 
via SpeakOut. The Board and 
Audit Committee receive regular 
reports of SpeakOut messages 
received and ensure that 
appropriate investigation into 
each message has been undertaken 
and responses given, with actions 
taken where any allegation proves 
to have some foundation. 

The reports allow the Board 
to identify any particular trends 
and common issues, with messages 
classified into categories including 
HR-related concerns, business 
integrity issues and environmental 
and safety topics, and to consider 
whether any changes to Mondi’s 
risk management processes are 
required as a result. 

The effectiveness of the SpeakOut 
platform is kept under regular 
review. More information about 
SpeakOut and Mondi’s approach 
to anti-bribery and corruption in 
particular can be found on page 68.

Corporate governance report
Board leadership and company purpose

Promoting long-term 
sustainable success
The role businesses play in society 
remained firmly in focus during the year, 
with continued scrutiny of the impacts 
they have on the environment in which they 
operate and on wider stakeholders, and 
the measures companies are taking to 
manage and mitigate these impacts. 
Having an effective board in place, 
consisting of directors with the necessary 
skills, knowledge and integrity, is crucial 
in understanding and managing these 
impacts, and ensuring that Mondi operates 
both understanding and fulfilling its 
responsibility to society. The Board 
provides leadership to the Group, 
establishing its strategy with the aim 
of achieving long-term sustainable success 
for the Group, our shareholders and our 
other stakeholders. The biographies for 
Mondi’s Board members, setting out the 
competencies we believe they bring to the 
Board and the skills and experience that 
allow them to contribute to the long-term 
success of Mondi, can be found on 
pages 86-87.

Mondi’s purpose, strategy and culture 
define The Mondi Way and how we run 
our business. This is illustrated in our 
business model, set out on pages 14-19, 
which explains how we achieve our 
purpose and deliver value for stakeholders 
while ensuring sustainability is at the 
centre of everything we do. Strong, 
ethical leadership, supported by a robust 
corporate governance framework, is 
crucial to the achievement of our purpose 
and strategy in a way that balances the 
interests of our key stakeholders while 
creating long-term sustainable value. 

Supported by its committees, the Board 
has responsibility for setting 
and overseeing the implementation 
of the Group’s strategy, ensuring the 
implementation of an appropriate 
risk management framework and 
overseeing sustainable financial 
performance. Mondi’s governance 
framework and our culture of transparency 
ensure that the Board has the information 
it needs to assess the risks and 
opportunities facing the Group and 
the sustainability of the business model. 

The structure of the Board and its 
committees, the division of responsibilities 
and the policies and procedures in place 
to facilitate the effective operation of 
the Board are detailed on pages 96-97. 

How the Board 
monitors culture
Mondi’s culture defines our behaviour 
and the way we do business, across 
the Group, within our operations and in 
the boardroom. It is critical to fulfilling 
our purpose and achieving long-term 
sustainable success. The Mondi Way sets 
out the key values that form the foundation 
of our culture, reinforced by our Code of 
Business Ethics which comprises the 
principles governing the way we behave 
and conduct business – legal compliance, 
behaving with honesty and integrity, 
respect for human rights, consideration of 
stakeholders and sustainability. The Board’s 
responsibility for assessing and monitoring 
the culture of the Group is embedded in 
the Matters Reserved for the Board. 

There are a number of ways in which the 
Board monitors and assesses culture, with 
the insight acquired used as context for 
discussions and decision-making, including:

Site visits
The directors are encouraged to visit 
Mondi’s key assets and operations 
so that they can get a more in-depth 
understanding of the business. Such 
visits offer directors the opportunity 
to see for themselves how our safety 
and sustainability culture is working in 
practice, to talk to local management 
and employees and to see how Mondi’s 
values are communicated at a local level. 
During 2023, in addition to visits to sites 
by individual directors, the Board visited 
Mondi’s mill in Świecie (Poland), more 
details of which can be found on page 94.

Review of key policies
The Board undertakes an annual review 
of Mondi’s key policies. This gives the Board 
the opportunity to assess whether policies 
remain suitable for Mondi, reflect the Group's 
culture and values and support its long-term 
sustainable success. While there were 
no material changes to Mondi’s policies 
as a result of this review during 2023, the 
opportunity was taken to update Mondi's 
Diversity & Inclusion Policy to align with 
current practice. 

Feedback from non-executive 
director responsible for understanding 
the views of employees
During 2021, Sue Clark was appointed as 
the independent non-executive director 
responsible for understanding and feeding 
back to the Board the views and concerns 
of our employees. Sue’s engagement with 
our employees provides the Board with 
valuable insight into how groups of our 
employees are feeling about Mondi and 
any matters of concern to them, giving the 
Board helpful information concerning how 
well the Group’s culture is embedded across 
the organisation and any issues that might 
need greater attention. Information relating 
to the outcomes of this engagement during 
2023 can be found on pages 92-93. 

Corporate governance report
Page 90-121

Employee Survey results
The Board receives regular reports on the 
results of our Employee Surveys, the issues 
raised and the follow-up actions being 
taken, giving the Board an insight into how 
employees feel about the culture of the 
Group and particular areas that may need 
addressing. Our global Employee Surveys 
also help us to measure progress towards 
our MAP2030 Created by Empowered 
People commitments. The last Group-wide 
survey, undertaken in the first half of 2023, 
achieved an 80% response rate, with 
more than 16,800 employees participating. 
The results were used to calculate our 
Purposeful Workplace Index, Inclusiveness 
Index and Wellbeing scores, which provide 
the Board with an objective way to assess 
employee views in relation to, among other 
things, respect, fairness, trust, recognition, 
the working environment and mental 
wellbeing. These indices also give us a way 
of directly measuring and monitoring 
aspects of culture over time, with targets in 
respect of the Purposeful Workplace Index 
and Inclusiveness Index scores forming part 
of our MAP2030 Created by Empowered 
People commitments. More information can 
be found on pages 48-50.

Safety reports and statistics
The Board reviews safety statistics and key 
safety focus areas at every meeting. 
Caring for our employees is fundamental 
to Mondi’s culture and this includes ensuring 
safe behaviour. Reviewing the safety reports 
highlights to the Board any concerns 
around the approach to safety specifically 
or indications of wider leadership issues 
at particular plants or mills. 

SpeakOut
Mondi has an anonymous whistleblowing 
and grievance platform called ‘SpeakOut’ 
operated by an independent third party. 
Any type of concern can be raised via 
SpeakOut, and the Board and Audit 
Committee receive regular reports of the 
messages received. These reports provide 
insight into matters of concern to our 
employees and other stakeholders and 
draw out behaviour that is contrary to 
Mondi’s values. More information relating 
to SpeakOut can be found on page 84. 

SpeakOut

Board presentations
The Board has in place a rolling programme 
of presentations from members of the 
Executive Committee and other senior 
management. These presentations give the 
directors direct exposure to members of 
senior management beyond the executive 
directors, allowing directors the opportunity 
to ask questions and hear their views. 
The directors also gain valuable additional 
insight helpful to succession planning 
discussions. Presenters and members 
of local management are also invited 
to attend Board dinners, which offer a 
more informal setting for discussion. More 
information can be found on page 100.

Board leadership and company purpose continued

Stakeholder engagement
Understanding the impact of our business 
on our key stakeholders, and the 
environment in which we operate, is 
central to the Board’s deliberations and 
decision-making. This is reflected in Mondi’s 
Code of Business Ethics, recognising the 
fact that engagement and collaboration 
with our stakeholders is essential if we are 
to fulfil our purpose, deliver our strategy 
and create long-term, sustainable value 
for our shareholders in a manner that 
reflects our high standards of business 
conduct. Understanding what matters most 
to all our stakeholders allows us to make 
balanced judgements. 

While the Board undertakes a level of 
direct engagement, there is also a 
significant amount of indirect engagement 
that takes place across the Group. Through 
our delegation framework, the output from 
this engagement is relayed to the Board, 
through the Executive and other 
committees of the Board, members 
of senior management and those closest 
to the stakeholders in question. Details 
of our key stakeholders, engagement 
activities undertaken during the year and 
the outcome of these activities can be 
found in our Section 172 statement on 
pages 38-41. 

The information provided over the next 
few pages and in our Section 172 
statement explains how the feedback 
from this engagement influences the 
Board’s decision-making.

Information enabling the Board to assess 
and understand the views and priorities 
of our key stakeholders comes from 
a number of different sources, including:

– presentations from the CEO of each 
business unit, and other members of 
senior management, highlighting those 
stakeholder issues that are of specific 
relevance to their business or area 
of responsibility, including the views 
of our customers and how these 
influence product development 
and key sustainability considerations 
(see page 100 for more information); 

– updates on the global initiatives Mondi 
participates in, primarily related to 
sustainability matters, and collaboration 
with external bodies; 

– regular environmental performance 
reviews, including metrics on our 
greenhouse gas emissions, given 
at meetings of the Sustainable 
Development Committee, which all 
Board members usually attend;

– the outcome of the double materiality 

assessment undertaken during the year, 
which, among other things, identified 
the sustainability issues of greatest 
importance to our stakeholders. 
The results were driven by inputs from 
a range of sources, including surveys and 
interviews with both internal and external 
stakeholders, and will be used to guide 
our key focus areas in the coming years. 
Further details can be found on page 43;

– detailed review of the results of the 

latest customer satisfaction survey; and

– updates and briefings in relation to 

matters impacting the environment in 
which we operate, including regulatory 
changes and market developments. 
In 2023, these included a briefing on 
Mondi's approach to public affairs, the 
key regulatory developments currently 
impacting our customers and how we 
engage in this respect, both directly 
and via trade associations. 

On the following pages, we focus more 
specifically on how we have engaged with 
employees and investors. 

How does the Board consider our 
stakeholders when taking decisions? 
Understanding the views and issues 
raised by our stakeholders through the 
engagement methods highlighted forms 
a key part of the Board’s decision-making 
process. The regular flow of information 
to the Board provides context and ensures 
that the directors are made aware of the 
issues that matter most to our stakeholders 
when directors consider the Group’s 
strategy and take decisions. 

To assist the Board, all papers requiring 
material decisions include clear explanation 
as to the expected impact on those 
stakeholders relevant to the decision, 
whether positive or negative. For capital 
expenditure decisions in particular, a more 
comprehensive review of the impact on 
our stakeholders is part of the established 
process we have for developing the 
necessary business case. 

Examples of the ways in which stakeholder 
interests and views have influenced the 
Board’s decision-making during the year 
can be found on pages 92-95.

How the Board has engaged 
with employees 
Our employees are core to Mondi’s 
long-term sustainable success, and as 
a global employer, employing around 
22,000 people across more than 
30 countries, we have a responsibility 
to provide a safe and healthy working 
environment, to operate with integrity 
and to instil a culture that supports 
our people in fulfilling their potential. 
Understanding the experiences and 
views of our employees, and the issues 
that matter most to them, is an area 
of focus for the Board, with this insight 
allowing the directors to assess the 
impact of their decisions on our 
workforce. Rather than use only one 
method to engage with employees, we 
use a combination of different methods. 
Some of our people are office-based 
but many work in our production facilities 
and so no single method is suitable. 
By using a range of methods, we aim 
to reach as many people as we can, 
engaging with them in the manner most 
suitable for them.

In 2021, the Board agreed that Sue Clark, an 
independent non-executive director, would 
be responsible for undertaking engagement 
with Mondi’s employees on behalf of the 
Board and for understanding and feeding 
back their views and concerns. Sue’s 
exposure to a broad range of stakeholders 
in both an executive and non-executive 
capacity and her previous communication-
focused roles mean she is well positioned 
to take on this responsibility. Each year, Sue 
undertakes a number of engagements with 
a broad range of employees, the format of 
which varies depending upon the location 
and audience to ensure the sessions are 
as productive and valuable as possible. 
The subject matter is usually driven by the 
employees and can cover topics ranging 
from safety and strategy, to sustainability 
and remuneration. Sue reports back to the 
Board on the matters raised and the themes 
emerging during these engagements.

Mondi Group Integrated report and financial statements 2023

93

As an example, in February 2023 during 
a visit to Mondi's Richards Bay mill 
(South Africa), Sue facilitated a roundtable 
session with a cross-section of employees, 
offering a forum for an open, two-way 
discussion in relation to a broad range of 
topics including safety, culture, innovation, 
talent development and retention, diversity 
and inclusivity. Particular insight was given 
into the perceived barriers to increasing 
diversity, within Mondi and across the 
industry more broadly. The session was 
also attended by Philip Yea, Chair of 
the Board, Dame Angela Strank, Chair of 
the Remuneration Committee, and Saki 
Macozoma, a non-executive director, giving 
attendees the opportunity to engage 
directly with a number of Board members. 
The discussions reinforced, among other 
things, the need for the Board to continue 
its focus on the promotion of diversity 
and inclusion across the organisation 
and the challenges faced in attracting 
and retaining critical skills, matters that 
will continue to form part of the Board's, 
and its committees', agendas during 
the coming year. 

The level of engagement and open and 
honest dialogue during these meetings 
results in valuable feedback for the Board, 
and the topics discussed and views 
expressed provide important context 
for Board discussions and key decisions. 
The output reaffirmed that the desired 
culture is felt throughout the organisation 
and that leadership in this regard 
is effective. 

Alongside this, Mondi has a European 
Communication Forum, a formally 
constituted body designed to facilitate 
communication between Mondi and its 
employees. At least once a year, employee 
representatives from plants across Europe 
attend the Forum, at which a number 
of presentations are given by senior 
management. The meetings offer employee 
representatives an opportunity to hear about 
developments across the business, while 
also providing an open forum for employees 
to ask questions and to express their views 
directly to members of senior management. 
The meetings are usually attended by the 
Group CEO and other Executive Committee 
members and members of senior 
management as appropriate. 

The last meeting of the European 
Communication Forum was held in 
October 2023. The meeting was attended 
by representatives from across Mondi’s 
European operations, as well as the 
Group CEO, the Group Head of Safety & 
Health and senior representatives from the 
Group HR and Legal functions. Sue Clark 
also attended the meeting, further 
reinforcing the value of these meetings and 
providing employee representatives with 
a direct channel of communication to the 
non-executive members of the Board. 
The meeting consisted of presentations 
relating to matters including financial 
performance, HR initiatives and safety and 
health, providing attendees with a wide range 
of information on the operation of the business. 
The formal presentations were followed by 
a question and answer session, allowing 
participants to openly engage and to raise 
questions and comments on a broad range 
of topics. Of particular focus for participants 
were the divestment of Mondi’s Russian 
operations; future growth prospects; safety; 
and Mondi's approach to sustainability. 
Matters raised during these meetings are 
subject to subsequent follow-up where 
appropriate, with further information provided 
to participants where required.

A dinner was also held for participants, 
allowing further opportunity for more informal 
engagement outside of the meeting. 

In addition to the above, the full Board 
undertook visits to Mondi’s Świecie mill 
(Poland) and the Group office in Vienna 
(Austria) in June 2023 and January 2024 
respectively, more details of which can 
be found on page 94. 

The Board also uses the following 
mechanisms to ensure it has a broad view 
of the issues affecting our employees 
and their views on key matters:

– regular presentations from the Group HR 
function, providing detailed updates on 
engagement activities undertaken, the 
views expressed by employees and any 
actions being taken in response;

– feedback from the CEO and other 

Executive Committee members, who are 
in regular contact with a wide spectrum 
of employees from across the Group;

– results of global and local Employee 

Surveys, providing insight into the issues 
that matter most to our employees and 
how they feel about working for Mondi, 
guiding decisions that might impact 
employees and allowing the Board to 
identify areas for future focus. A number 
of the questions are also designed to 
test the culture in the organisation and 
to allow the Board to judge how well 
the desired culture is embedded; 

– leadership forums, incorporating the 
Mondi Diamond Awards, usually 
attended by the Chair of the Board 
and held approximately every two 
years, providing the opportunity for 
engagement with a wider range 
of senior employees from across 
all areas of the business;

– SpeakOut reports, which are presented 
to the Audit Committee and Board at 
meetings throughout the year. The reports 
provide details of the messages received 
via our whistleblowing and grievance 
platform, SpeakOut, giving the Board 
insight into specific issues affecting 
our employees and allowing the Board 
to identify any trends. Further details on 
SpeakOut can be found on page 84; and

– review of usage rates for Mondi’s 
Employee Assistance Programme 
which offers an anonymous counselling 
service for employees. The programme 
is available to approximately 94% 
of Mondi’s workforce. 

The Board continues to believe that 
this combination of methods remains 
appropriate and effective, providing 
insight into the views of a broad range 
of employees from across Mondi’s 
locations and allowing for two-way 
engagement, with employees having 
direct access to members of the Board 
and senior management.

How the Board has engaged 
with investors

Board site visits
The June 2023 Board programme 
was held at our Świecie mill (Poland). 
The two-day visit incorporated the 
scheduled Board and committee 
meetings but also provided the 
opportunity for the Board to listen 
to presentations from the local 
management team and to tour the 
mill. The Board was given insight into 
the mill's product portfolio, financial 
performance, sustainability initiatives 
and measures taken to support the 
local community, and was able to 
see the progress made in respect 
of recent investment at the mill. 

Such visits are invaluable to the Board, 
allowing the directors to experience 
the culture and safety approach first 
hand and to engage directly with 
those on the ground in the operations.  
A dinner with representatives from 
the mill was also held, offering the 
opportunity for direct and more informal 
engagement with Board members. 

In addition, a number of Board 
members visited the Richards Bay mill 
(South Africa) in February 2023, which 
included tours of the mill, nursery and 
harvesting operations, presentations 
from local management and the 
opportunity to see the results of 
recent investment at the mill. 

The Company Secretary’s office is 
the focus for private shareholder 
communications, responding to 
individual shareholder correspondence, 
and coordinating our engagement on 
corporate governance matters. 

We also maintain ongoing contact with 
our debt providers, and the Group CFO 
and Group Treasurer hold regular meetings 
with the credit rating agencies, relationship 
banks and debt investors.

The directors are kept informed of the 
views raised, with feedback from investors, 
particularly from the full- and half-year 
investor roadshows, presented and 
discussed at Board meetings. Details of the 
key investor events that took place during 
2023 can be found on page 95, 

How the Board has engaged 
with investors
Understanding the views of our investors 
is fundamental to the way we run the 
business, the development of our strategy 
and how we shape our priorities. These are 
taken into consideration with every decision 
the Board makes. The engagement we have 
with investors, both directly and indirectly, 
allows the Board to determine which issues 
are of most importance to them and 
to understand what long-term, sustainable 
value means from their perspective. 
While recognising that every investor has 
their own rationale for investing in Mondi 
and that their investment goals vary, ongoing 
engagement allows the Board to take fully 
informed decisions, with an understanding 
of how different groups of investors may 
be impacted. 

While the Chair is responsible for ensuring 
effective communication with shareholders, 
day-to-day management of this 
engagement is delegated to the Group 
CEO and Group CFO. They undertake 
active engagement with investors on a 
regular basis, meeting with Mondi’s largest 
shareholders, analysts and other fund 
managers. Meetings with the Chair are 
offered on a regular basis and the Senior 
Independent Director is available to meet 
with shareholders as required, should any 
issues arise that are not resolved through 
the more regular channels. The committee 
chairs are also available for engagement 
with investors and other stakeholders 
where appropriate.

In addition, the executive directors and 
the Head of Investor Relations make 
themselves available to investors on an 
ongoing basis in order to maintain an 
open dialogue, resulting in a number of 
ad hoc meetings and calls taking place 
throughout the year. 

Sue Clark also facilitated a roundtable 
discussion with employees, details 
of which can be found on page 93.

In January 2024, the Board programme 
was held at our Group office in Vienna 
(Austria), facilitating in-person 
engagement between the Board and 
members of senior management based 
in Vienna. In particular, an invitation 
to attend a Board dinner was extended 
to a wide group of people, with 
attendees ranging from function heads 
to HR business partners to key members 
of operational management. Such events 
offer valuable insight for the purposes of 
succession planning and monitoring and 
assessment of the organisational culture.

with feedback from these events covering 
investor views on a range of topics, including 
Mondi's strategy, market developments and 
the approach to sustainability. Analyst 
reports are also shared regularly with the 
Board and consideration given to any views, 
both positive and negative, regarding the 
Group’s performance and future direction 
and the perceptions of the management 
team. These views provide context for, 
and feed into, the Board’s discussions 
around strategy, capital allocation and 
succession planning.

Mondi Group Integrated report and financial statements 2023

95

Alongside this, Philip Yea held meetings 
with a number of Mondi’s major 
shareholders during the year. There was 
no specific agenda for these meetings, but 
instead they were designed to offer open 
discussion and engagement. Topics covered 
included capital allocation, the disposal of 
Mondi's Russian assets, Mondi's approach 
to governance and culture, diversity and 
progress against Mondi's MAP2030 targets. 

In 2023, our Board also continued to engage 
with a cross-section of shareholders on 
developments and external expectations 
relating to executive pay. As a consequence, 
further meetings with investors were held 
to discuss particular features of the Directors' 
Remuneration Policy. Constructive feedback 
from investors is taken into account in 
determining the structure and operation 
of our remuneration policy.  

Mondi’s Annual General Meeting (AGM) also 
presents an opportunity for shareholders 
to question the directors about our activities, 
performance and prospects and continues 
to be a valuable opportunity for direct 
engagement between the Board 
and shareholders. 

The AGM in 2023 was held as a fully 
hybrid meeting. Those shareholders joining 
virtually were able to hear the meeting, 
ask questions both verbally and in written 
form and vote live during the meeting. 
To maximise engagement, shareholders 
were also able to submit their questions 
in advance of the meeting, with written 
answers provided in advance of the 
proxy voting deadline wherever possible. 
All resolutions were passed, with 
approximately 76% of the total Group 
shares voted, indicating high levels 
of engagement. 

While we were pleased with the success 
of the AGM in 2023, and we intend to 
retain the hybrid format in 2024, given the 
cost and complexity involved, we continue 
to look for ways in which we can simplify 
the arrangements while continuing 
to maximise levels of engagement. 

Full details of the arrangements for the 
2024 AGM, and explanations of each 
resolution to be proposed at the AGM, 
can be found in the 2024 AGM notice, 
which is contained in a separate circular 
to be made available to all shareholders 
in advance of the meeting.

Corporate governance report
Division of responsibilities

Composition and independence 
of the Board
The directors holding office during the 
year ended 31 December 2023 are listed 
below, together with their attendance 
at Board meetings. Biographical details 
for those in office at the date of this report 
can be found on pages 86-87.  

The size and composition of the Board 
and its committees are kept under review 
by the Nominations Committee. While 
we are of the view that collectively there 
is an appropriate balance of capabilities, 
business experience, independence 
and skills diversity on the Board to meet 
the Group’s current business needs, 
we are constantly assessing the mix 
of competencies on the Board and its 
committees and considering succession 
planning requirements. 

Meetings between the Chair and 
non-executive directors without 
management present are held prior to 
every Board meeting. Dominique Reiniche 
as Senior Independent Director also 
met with the other directors without 
the Chair present to lead the review 
of the Chair’s performance.
Board policies and procedures
There are a number of policies in place 
designed to ensure that the Board can 
function effectively. These include:

Professional advice
A policy is in place pursuant to which 
each director may obtain independent 
professional advice at Mondi’s expense in 
the furtherance of their duties as a director 
of Mondi plc. No requests were received 
during the year.

In addition, each of the committees is 
empowered, through its terms of reference, 
to seek independent professional advice 
at Mondi’s expense in the furtherance of 
its duties.

Directors’ and officers’ liability 
insurance
Throughout the year to 31 December 
2023, in line with market practice, 
Mondi maintained directors’ and officers’ 
liability insurance.

Procedure for conflicts of interest
Company law and the articles of 
association of Mondi plc allow directors 
to manage potential conflicts. A formal 
procedure is in place for the reporting and 
review of any potential conflicts of interest. 
This requires any potential conflicts to be 
reported to the Company Secretary so that 
the conflict can be discussed by the Board 
and authorised if appropriate. The Board 
may impose any restrictions on the 
authorisation that it thinks appropriate. 
Conflict authorisations are reviewed on an 
annual basis. Directors are also obliged to 
confirm their directorships annually as a 
matter of course for review by the Board. 

External directorships policy
To ensure that our directors are able to 
dedicate sufficient time to Mondi, Mondi 
has a policy setting out the parameters 
regarding external appointments. Executive 
directors must notify and obtain agreement 
from the Nominations Committee before 
accepting external positions. They are 
permitted to retain any fee paid to them in 
respect of directorships external to Mondi. 
Neither of Mondi’s executive directors 
currently holds a directorship external to 
Mondi. 

The policy also covers non-executive 
directors, who are required to notify the 
Chair of any proposed appointments, 
including the time commitment and any 
potential conflicts of interest, so that the 
Nominations Committee can consider 
and, if appropriate, agree to the 
appointment. No significant new 
appointments were taken on by any 
of Mondi’s directors during 2023. 

Division of responsibilities
The division of responsibilities between 
the Chair and the Group CEO has been 
clearly defined and approved by the Board. 
The functions and duties of the Senior 
Independent Director are also set out 
in a separate statement. 

The primary role of the Board, led by 
the Chair, is to ensure the long-term 
sustainable success of the Group, taking 
into consideration the views and interests 
of our key stakeholders. Our governance 
processes and procedures provide a 
framework to support the Board in the 
fulfilment of this role.

There is a clearly defined Schedule of 
Matters Reserved for the Board, setting 
out those key matters that require Board 
approval. The Board meets at least 
seven times a year and an annual rolling 
agenda is agreed with the Board to ensure 
that all key matters reserved for its 
consideration are covered in the annual 
cycle of meetings. The Board is supported 
by a number of committees, each of which 
has its own terms of reference and annual 
work programme. The Matters Reserved 
for the Board and the terms of reference 
are reviewed at least annually and are 
available on the Group’s website. 

The Chair, with support from the Company 
Secretary, ensures the distribution of 
appropriate, accurate and well-presented 
materials, with meeting packs being 
circulated electronically a week before each 
meeting. Each Board programme is usually 
held over two days, enabling the directors 
to spend more time together and form 
a greater understanding of each other, 
developing a culture of trust and openness 
in the boardroom. 

Where appropriate, other senior executives 
and advisers are invited to attend and 
present at meetings, providing the 
non-executive directors with a broader 
perspective on matters under consideration 
and assisting the Board with monitoring 
performance and achieving its objectives 
(see page 100 for more information).

– Concluded a strategy review session resulting in continued support for Mondi’s strategic direction and

– Considered and approved the acquisition of the Hinton pulp mill (Canada), with the intention, subject to 

pre-engineering and permitting, to invest in the expansion of the mill, primarily in a new kraft paper machine 
which will fully integrate our paper bag operations in the Americas and support growth. Stakeholder interests 
were core to this decision, more details of which can be found on page 41.

– In line with the decision taken in 2022 to divest the Group's Russian assets, approved the sale of the 

Syktyvkar mill for a total cash consideration of RUB 80 billion. The sale was completed in October 2023, 
concluding Mondi’s exit from Russia. 

– Considered and approved a number of capital expenditure projects, including a €200 million investment 
at our Duino mill (Italy) to convert the existing paper machine into a 420,000 tonne per annum recycled 
containerboard machine, taking into account the sustainability impact of such investments and the interests 
of Mondi’s key stakeholders (see page 26 for more information).

Strategy review
The Board’s annual in-depth review 
of Mondi’s strategy considered where 
Mondi is today, its strategic focus, 
options for future growth and detailed 
business unit strategic initiatives. 
At the forefront was whether the 
strategy remains capable of delivering 
Mondi’s purpose to contribute to 
a better world by making innovative 
packaging and paper solutions that 
are sustainable by design. 

The strategy review is never an isolated, 
one-off review. The discussions of the 
Board and its committees during the 
previous 12 months provide important 
context and insight to the deliberations, 
with this annual in-depth review a 
culmination of the work undertaken 
by the Board throughout the year. 

The existing strategy was reviewed 
in the context of key demand drivers, 
including developing macroeconomic 
conditions, demand for sustainable 
packaging and eCommerce. 

Of particular focus were the growth 
opportunities available to the Group, 
including the Group’s pipeline of 
new projects.

The Group’s principal risks were also 
factored into the Board’s discussions, with 
consideration given to whether there had 
been any material changes in the Group’s 
risk profile that might impact Mondi’s 
strategy. Alongside this, the evolving 
regulatory landscape, particularly across 
Europe from a sustainability perspective, 
was considered.  

The Board ultimately confirmed its 
continued support for Mondi’s strategic 
direction, confirming the need to ensure 
that sustainability continues to be at the 
core of Mondi’s strategy. 

More information on Mondi’s strategy 
can be found on pages 20-21.

Presentations from senior management
During the year, members of Mondi’s 
senior management presented 
to the Board on a variety of topics. 
These presentations not only provide 
insight into the business directly from 
those on the ground but also support 
the Board’s focus on succession 
planning, allowing Board members 
to hear from, speak to and get 
to know potential future leaders. 

The specific impacts on each business 
of developing trends and key strategic 
drivers were also reviewed, including 
sustainability, eCommerce and 
digitalisation. The other members 
of the Executive Committee also 
presented to the Board in relation 
to their areas of responsibility. 
These presentations included updates 
on technology developments in 
Mondi’s core manufacturing processes, 
operational excellence and Mondi’s 
strategy in respect of energy usage 
and security. 

Each of the business unit CEOs 
provided updates on their areas 
of responsibility within Mondi, focusing 
on safety performance, market position 
and dynamics, evolving customer 
demands and financial performance 
and people development.

In addition, the Group Head of Fibre 
Sourcing presented Mondi’s 
wood sourcing strategy, the Group 
Head of Digital Excellence provided 
an update on the Group’s digitalisation 
journey, and the Group Communication 
Director and Head of Public Affairs 
provided insight into the Group’s 
approach to public affairs. 

The Group Heads of Tax and Treasury 
also updated the Board on their current 
focus areas. 

These presentations provided insight 
into the priorities of a number of 
Mondi’s key stakeholders and current 
risk areas, and formed the backdrop 
to other discussions, including the 
annual strategy review. 

Activity
– Monitored safety performance across the Group, including the number, type and severity of incidents. There 
was particular focus on understanding the events that tragically resulted in a fatality at Mondi’s Ružomberok 
mill (Slovakia) and the four life-altering injuries in our operations (see page 50 for more information).

– Received updates on key sustainability regulatory and best practice developments from the Group Head 
of Sustainable Development through the Sustainable Development Committee, and via regular business 
unit reviews.

– Monitored the work of the Sustainable Development Committee, focusing in particular on progress 

against Mondi’s MAP2030 sustainability commitments and the Group’s most material sustainability risks 
and opportunities. A detailed explanation of the work of the Sustainable Development Committee can 
be found on pages 119-121.

Activity
– Reviewed the Group’s risk management processes, plan and risk appetite levels and internal controls, with

This resulted in a number of changes, following consideration by the Audit Committee and approval by the

employee and contractor health and safety risk), and the derating of a number of principal risks in light 
of the mitigation measures in place and changes in external conditions (see page 71 for more information).

– Received half-yearly presentations on IT risks and cyber security (see page 111 for more information).

Induction, training 
and development 
Training and development are important 
in ensuring the ongoing effectiveness 
of the Board and that we have the right 
combination of skills and knowledge. 

This begins with an induction for all 
new directors. While there is an outline 
induction programme in place, this is 
discussed with each new director and is 
tailored to meet any specific requirements. 
The aim is to familiarise a new director with 
the nature of the Group’s business and 
operations, highlighting the key challenges 
and opportunities as well as the regulatory 
environment in which the Group operates, 
the key duties of the director, including 
in relation to Section 172 and stakeholder 
interests, and the culture and values of 
the Group. All directors are given access 

Director induction process

to an online director handbook containing 
documents including key policies and the 
terms of reference for each committee. 
Details of the induction programme 
for Anke Groth, who joined the Board 
in April 2023, are provided below. 

In addition, we aim to hold at least 
one Board meeting a year at one of 
Mondi’s sites, giving Board members the 
opportunity to refresh and develop their 
understanding of Mondi’s operations. 
Further details can be found on page 94. 

We also aim to ensure that existing 
directors receive ongoing training and 
development opportunities. We offer 
the directors the opportunity to keep 
up to date with regulatory, governance 
and economic changes as well as 
developments in the markets and 
environments in which we operate. We do 
this through Board presentations, both from 
internal and external presenters, site visits, 
updates aimed at providing wider context 
to the Group’s activities and position in 
the market, and regular reports from the 
Company Secretary highlighting developing 
trends and future changes in governance 
and regulation.

Each director can discuss any development 
needs with the Chair at any time, but the 
opportunity arises more formally during the 
annual review process, when discussions 
regarding individual performance are held. 
In addition, all directors are encouraged 
to strengthen and refresh their knowledge 
by attending any workshops, seminars 
and courses relevant to their respective 
roles, and details of the availability 
of these are provided regularly.

Anke Groth's 
induction 

Following Anke's appointment to the 
Board in April 2023, a number of 
meetings and briefings were organised 
in order to provide her with a detailed 
overview of the Group, and to give 
her the insight and knowledge 
required to make as full and effective 
a contribution as possible.

Meetings were held with each of the 
Executive Committee members, 
allowing Anke the opportunity to gain 
an understanding of the Group's business 
units, culture, risk areas and priorities, 
and providing the context necessary 
for matters discussed at Board and 
committee meetings. Anke also met 
with the Company Secretary early 
on in the induction process, with the 
session covering matters including 
directors' duties, share dealing 
procedures, Mondi's approach to 
managing conflicts of interest and 
key policies. 

Given the increasing focus on 
sustainability and the relevance 
of such matters to Board decisions, 
meetings were also arranged with 
the Group Heads of Sustainable 
Development and Safety & Health.

In addition, Anke met with other 
members of senior management 
during an induction visit to Mondi's 
Group office in Vienna (Austria), 
including the Group Controller and 
Group Head of Internal Audit, both 
directly relevant to her membership 
of the Audit Committee, the 
Chief Information Officer, given the 
continued focus on cyber security 
across the organisation, and Mondi's 
General Counsel. 

Site visits are also a crucial element 
of the induction process, and early 
on in her tenure, Anke was able to visit 
Mondi's Świecie mill (Poland) as part 
of the wider Board visit in June 2023. 
Further information can be found 
on page 94. Anke also visited Mondi's 
Korneuburg plant (Austria) and Štětí 
mill (Czech Republic) following her 
appointment.

Board evaluation process

Year 1 (2022)
External assessment
– Independent external evaluation 
firm selected and appointed.

– Scope refined and agreed between 

the Chair and evaluation firm.
– Questionnaires issued and one-

to-one interviews undertaken by 
the evaluator with each director 
and the Company Secretary.
– One-to-one calls between 
the Chair and each director 
to discuss the results.

– Results and actions discussed by 
the Nominations Committee and 
action plan agreed by the Board.

Years 2 and 3 (2023 and 2024)
Internal assessments
– Outcome from previous evaluation 
and progress against each action 
reviewed.

– External evaluation firm used for 
the external evaluation appointed 
to facilitate internal assessments, 
providing continuity.

– Questionnaires issued to 

directors, Company Secretary 
and other regular Board 
attendees.

– One-to-one calls between Chair 
and directors to discuss results.
– Results and actions discussed by 
the Nominations Committee and 
action plan agreed by the Board.

In line with best practice, in 2022 we conducted an external Board evaluation. The process was facilitated by Lintstock, an independent 
governance advisory firm. Below are the key actions reported last year, and details of the progress we have made against those actions:

Action agreed from 2022 evaluation
To expand the Board's regular reviews of the business units 
to include greater detail concerning consumer trends and their 
impact on Mondi's customers.

To expand the scope of the Board's review of the development 
of major competitors and their strategies.
To increase the Board's visibility and understanding of key 
regulatory developments, particularly in relation to sustainability.

To maintain the strong focus on diversity and inclusion, with the 
Board to review steps taken to operationalise the tools that have 
been developed across the business to support improvements 
in this regard.
To continue to give in-depth consideration to executive director 
succession. 

Progress achieved
Each of the business unit reviews undertaken by the Board in 
2023 has included discussion of key consumer trends, including 
eCommerce and sustainability, the impact of these trends on 
demand and market dynamics, and the resulting actions being 
taken in response, including the impact on the types of products 
being produced. 

Relevant deep dives have been introduced into the rolling agenda. 

Regular regulatory updates from a sustainability perspective are 
provided at meetings of the Sustainable Development Committee, 
which all Board members usually attend. Updates during 2023 
have included a detailed overview of the Packaging & Packaging 
Waste Regulation. An update on Mondi’s approach to public 
affairs and the developing EU regulatory landscape in particular 
was also provided to the Board in December 2023. 
A review of diversity and inclusion initiatives, and developments 
and trends in a range of diversity statistics, was undertaken in 
June 2023 and remains high on the Board's agenda. More details 
can be found on pages 107-109. 
Detailed discussions were undertaken during the year to consider 
potential internal successors for the Group CEO and CFO, their 
development needs, and actions that can be taken to provide 
further progression and development opportunities. Succession 
plans for other key roles were also reviewed.

2023 Board evaluation process
In 2023, the Board took the decision to undertake a questionnaire-based evaluation 
facilitated by Lintstock. Given Lintstock carried out Mondi's external evaluation in 2022, 
it was agreed that the follow-up support and insight Lintstock could offer would be 
valuable. Lintstock has no other connection to Mondi beyond the provision of board 
evaluation services. Anonymity was ensured throughout the process to allow for the 
provision of candid and open feedback by participants. The evaluation process was led 
by Philip Yea in conjunction with the Nominations Committee and is set out below. 
The review of the Chair was led by Dominique Reiniche as Senior Independent Director.

As a result of the process, the Board 
concluded that it continues to operate 
in an effective manner, benefitting from 
positive dynamics, strong engagement 
and relationships with senior 
management and a boardroom culture 
that allows for open and constructive 
challenge. Each director continues to 
contribute effectively to the Board.

There was consensus around the 
priorities for the forthcoming year, and 
the key actions agreed by the Board 
as a result of the evaluation include 
the following:

– to arrange for the Board to hear 
directly from major customers, 
to supplement the insight already 
provided to the Board in respect 
of customer requirements through 
presentations from management;

– to further develop and enhance the 
Nominations Committee’s approach 
to succession planning, particularly 
in respect of the executive directors, 
with support from the newly appointed 
Chief People Officer; and 

– to continue to identify opportunities 

for interaction between the Board and 
senior management on a less formal 
basis, with the aim of supporting 
succession planning discussions and 
giving Board members deeper insight 
into the organisation from both an 
operational and cultural perspective. 

The Board considers that it continues 
to benefit from the annual review 
process, the results of which help 
guide the future focus of meeting 
agendas and behaviours.

Dear Shareholder
I am pleased to present this report, 
which provides an overview of the areas 
of focus for the committee during 
the year, and those for the year ahead, 
as well as its key activities and the 
framework within which it operates.

Composition
To ensure the committee has access 
to as wide a range of knowledge 
and experience as possible, each 
non-executive director is a member. In 
line with this practice, Anke Groth joined 
the committee upon her appointment 
to the Board in April 2023. 
Areas of focus
The key focus of the committee is 
to ensure that the composition of the Board 
and its committees is appropriate and 
relevant to the Group and that the Board 
continues to be in the best position to 
deliver the Group’s strategy, and to ensure 
that the business operates in line with 
Mondi’s purpose, culture and values. 
This includes overseeing Board diversity 
and succession matters.

In April 2023, following a recruitment 
process conducted through an external 
search agency, and in line with our 
commitment to strengthen the level of 
relevant financial experience on the Audit 
Committee, Anke Groth joined the Board 
as an independent non-executive director. 
Anke was appointed to the Audit Committee 
at the same time, and I am pleased to 
confirm that Anke has brought valuable 
insight and experience to discussions. 

In preparation for Dominique Reiniche 
completing her nine-year term on the 
Board during 2024, the committee has 
now turned its attention to succession 
planning for Dominique and how the 
Board and committee memberships 
may need to evolve as a result. This 
will continue to be a priority for the 
committee in 2024. There is particular 
focus on Dominique's role as both 
Senior Independent Director and 
Chair of the Sustainable Development 
Committee and the skills and experience 
required to fulfil these roles. While the 
committee remains confident that 
the Board has the broad range of 
knowledge and perspectives it needs, 
it is constantly assessing ways in which 
to further strengthen its composition 
to ensure it has the capability to fulfil 
its responsibilities.

Corporate governance report
Nominations Committee continued

Alongside this, the committee continued 
to consider succession planning in relation 
to the Group CEO and CFO specifically, 
as well as those in key management and 
operational roles. While the committee 
routinely reviews succession plans in this 
regard, it is particularly focused on actions 
required in the short and medium term 
to develop and prepare potential internal 
candidates for some of these critical roles. 
While external candidates will always 
be considered where appropriate, there 
is a clear desire to identify opportunities 
for Mondi employees to progress, and 
to provide the support and encouragement 
they need to succeed within the 
organisation. Development actions discussed 
by the committee included mentoring and 
coaching, rotation into other roles within 
the Group and external training. 

The Group's commitment to increasing 
levels of diversity across the organisation 
was a key factor in these succession 
planning discussions, with the committee 
paying particular attention to where there 
might be opportunities to create a more 
diverse pipeline up to some of the key 
roles discussed. While it is clear that there 
is still a long way to go in this respect, and 
that the MAP2030 target of 30% women 
across the organisation by 2030 remains 
challenging, it was encouraging to see the 
significant work being undertaken in this 
regard through the presentations given to 
the Sustainable Development Committee. 
More information can be found on pages 
107-109. These insights will continue to 
feed into the committee's succession 
planning discussions in 2024.

A more detailed overview of the key 
matters considered by the committee 
during the year can be found below. 

Committee effectiveness
The committee’s performance and 
effectiveness were reviewed as part 
of the Board evaluation undertaken 
during the year, more details of which 
can be found on page 104. I am pleased 
to confirm that the committee is seen to 
be operating effectively and fulfilling the 
duties delegated to it by the Board.

external search agency, recommended 
to the Board the appointment of 
Anke Groth as an independent 
non-executive director. 

– Considered and recommended to 

the Board the proposed appointment 
of a new Chief People Officer and 
their appointment as a member of 
the Executive Committee with effect 
from April 2024.

– Reviewed the continued independence 

of each non-executive director, 
including consideration of their term 
in office and any potential conflicts 
of interest, concluding that each 
non-executive director remained 
independent. 

– Reviewed the time commitment 
required of each non-executive 
director, concluding that all 
non-executive directors continued

plans, in relation to existing directors, 
the requirements of the Board and 
committees in the longer term and 
the skills and experience required 
to support the Group’s future 
growth strategy. 

– Reviewed the succession plans in 

place for members of the Executive 
Committee and other key positions, 
both in the short and long term. 

– Discussed the new Listing Rule 

requirement for boards to disclose 
whether they have met the target of 
having a woman in the role of CEO, 
CFO, Chair or Senior Independent 
Director, with the committee 
considering the actions required to 
achieve this and the views of Mondi’s 
major shareholders. This resulted in 
a recommendation to the Board that 
Dominique Reiniche be appointed 
as Senior Independent Director with 
effect from the conclusion of the 
2023 AGM.

Board evaluation
– Monitored progress against the agreed 

action plan from the prior year’s 
evaluation process (see page 103 for 
more information).

Board appointments
Mondi has a rigorous and transparent process in place for the recruitment and 
appointment of directors, led by the committee. This process was followed in relation 
to the appointment of Anke Groth as an independent non-executive director in 2023 
and is set out below.

Key requirements agreed and candidate specification drawn up

taking into account succession planning requirements, gender, ethnic and other 
forms of diversity and the key skills and experience required to strengthen 
Board and committee capabilities and to ensure they have the competencies 
necessary to manage the impacts of the business

External independent search agent engaged 

to assist with the selection process

Search conducted and longlist of potential 
candidates provided for consideration

which should include male and female candidates from a variety of backgrounds

Shortlist chosen from longlist

for interview by the Chair and at least one other appropriate director

Shortlist reduced to an agreed number of candidates

for interview by other executive and non-executive directors

Nominations Committee considers the preferred candidates

including ability to commit time to the role, confirmation that each individual 
would be deemed independent on appointment and the likely views of key 
stakeholders, including major shareholders and regulatory bodies and in relation 
to financial, sustainability, strategy and risk management experience. 
A recommendation is made to the Board

Board considers the recommendation

and whether to proceed with the appointment

Russell Reynolds Associates, an external 
search agency and signatory to the 
Voluntary Code of Conduct for Executive 
Search Firms, was engaged to assist 
with the recruitment of an additional 
independent non-executive director, 
following the retirement of Tanya Fratto 
in May 2022. This led to the 
appointment of Anke Groth with 
effect from 1 April 2023. 

Russell Reynolds Associates does not 
provide any services to the Mondi Group 
other than Board-level recruitment. 

On appointment, each non-executive 
director receives a letter of appointment 
setting out, among other things, their 
term of appointment, the expected 
time commitment for their duties to 
Mondi and details of any committee 
memberships. Non-executive directors 
are initially appointed for a three-year 
term, subject to annual re-election by 
shareholders, after which a review is 
undertaken to consider renewal of the 
term for a further three years. 

Diversity and inclusion
Mondi has a well-established 
commitment to encouraging and 
promoting diversity and inclusion (D&I). 
This is reflected in our behaviour and 
in our culture and values. 

As a global organisation operating in more 
than 30 countries, D&I is integral to how 
we do business. We are committed to 
creating an inclusive working environment 
that is fair and non-discriminatory, from 
recruitment and people development 
to reward and our approach to 
talent management. 

The Group’s D&I Policy, which was 
approved by the Board, and updated 
in January 2024, is intended to help 
us meet these goals and support the 
development of a diverse workforce. 
It sets out guidelines for matters such 
as recruitment, the use of search firms, 
succession and annual reviews. You can 
read the full policy on our website. 

The policy can be found on 
Mondi’s website

Corporate governance report
Nominations Committee continued

Diversity and inclusion continued
Key elements of the policy include:

At Board and committee level:
– The Board supports the 

recommendations and targets outlined 
in the FTSE Women Leaders Review, 
and is committed to ensuring gender 
diversity on the Board and its 
committees, and among the Executive 
Committee and its direct reports.

– The Board supports the Parker Review 
principles in relation to ethnic diversity 
on boards and among senior 
management.

– For Board appointments, we will, where 
possible, engage executive search firms 
signed up to the Voluntary Code of 
Conduct for Executive Search Firms. 

– Search firms will be asked to include 

a sufficient number of qualified female 
candidates and candidates from a variety 
of ethnic backgrounds. 

– At least annually, the Nominations 

Committee will review succession plans 
for the Board, Executive Committee 
and other senior managers in light 
of Group D&I levels, skills, experience 
and diversity requirements. 

– Mondi commits to the UN ‘Women 

Empowerment Principles’.

At employee level:
– Recruitment activities are aligned with 

our D&I Policy and applicable legislation 
in jurisdictions in which we operate, 
including to promote diversity of all types 
and to ensure fair and non-discriminatory 
working practices.

– We aim to ensure that a pipeline 

of diverse candidates is considered 
during succession planning.

– We aim to ensure that the nationalities 

of candidates at long and shortlist stages 
are appropriately representative of our 
international footprint, subject to the 
availability of suitable candidates. 

– We aim to ensure fair and equal training 

and development opportunities.

– We set targets where meaningful 
and report on them as appropriate.

While appointments at all levels will 
continue to be made based on skill and 
ability, it is clear that all forms of diversity 
are key to ensuring that we have the right 
mix of backgrounds, knowledge and 
experience to meet our future business 
needs and to manage the impacts of 
our business. D&I is therefore central 
to our succession planning discussions 
and is critical to the long-term sustainable 
success of our business. Additional 
information on the specific process 
followed for Board-level appointments 
can be found on page 107.

In 2023, we reported to the FTSE Women 
Leaders Review that as at 31 October 2023, 
we had 17% female representation on our 
Executive Committee and 30% in the 
direct reports to the Executive Committee, 
giving a combined total of 27%. As at 
31 December 2023, our combined total 
had marginally increased to 28%. While the 
percentage of women on the Executive 
Committee and in its direct reports has 
increased compared to 2022 (2022: 25%), 
indicating we are moving in the right 
direction, we are not where we would 
like to be. We have a diverse pool of 
high-calibre employees who have been 
identified as having the potential to be 
appointed to Executive Committee roles 
in the future and every effort is being 
made to prepare these employees for 
progression within Mondi. This is a key 
focus during the committee's succession 
planning discussions. The percentage of 
women on the Executive Committee will 
increase from 17% to 29% when our new 
Chief People Officer joins in April 2024. 

As at 31 December 2023, Mondi was in 
compliance with the diversity targets set 
out in Listing Rule 9.8.6(R)(9). There were 
four female directors, representing 40% 
of the composition of the Board, and 
one director from an ethnic minority 
background. Dominique Reiniche was 
appointed as Senior Independent Director 
in May 2023, satisfying the requirement 
for one of the senior positions on the 
Board to be held by a woman. Mondi 
remained in compliance with the relevant 
targets at the date of this report. 

More detailed information relating to the 
gender and ethnic diversity of Mondi’s 
Board and executive management can be 
found in the tables on page 109. The data 
is provided in the form specified under 
Listing Rule 9.8.6(R)(10) and was collected 
directly from the individuals concerned. 
In line with the Listing Rule definition, 
'executive management' in this case 
consists of Mondi's Executive Committee 
members and the Company Secretary. 

During 2023, we also reported to the 
Parker Review that Mondi was in 
compliance with the existing target of 
having at least one ethnic minority director 
on the Board. Mondi is fully supportive of 
the objectives of the Parker Review and 
the ambition to improve the diversity of 
businesses. However, as a new initiative for 
2023, the Parker Review has also requested 
companies to set, and in due course report 
progress against, an internal target in 
relation to the ethnic diversity of our senior 
management population. The Board has 
carefully considered this new initiative 
and, for a number of practical reasons, 
will not be reporting a target, but instead 
will continue to promote the recruitment 
and development of a diverse workforce 
through programmes suited to the 
locations where we operate. 

Mondi is a global organisation, with only 
around 50 of our 22,000 people based 
in the UK. The definition of 'ethnic minority' 
used in the UK, and by the Parker Review, 
is not appropriate for every country 
in which we operate, with different 
countries applying different definitions. 
The availability of reliable census data in 
relation to ethnicity (as defined in the UK 
and by the Parker Review) also varies 
significantly by country, with limited or no 
reliable data available in some of our largest 
jurisdictions. This means that setting 
a realistic target reflecting the ethnic 
make-up of the populations from which we 
draw our employees is not practical. Legal 
restrictions around the collection of data 
relating to the ethnicity of our employees 
also exist in a number of the more 
significant countries in which we operate. 

Mondi Group Integrated report and financial statements 2023

Instead, we continue to focus on promoting 
all forms of diversity, including ethnicity, 
and inclusiveness in order to build a diverse 
pipeline up to senior management and 
Board level. There are a number of ongoing 
initiatives in this respect, many of which are 
implemented at a local level to allow them 
to be tailored to specific circumstances 
and country requirements. Notably, in 
South Africa, we have taken active steps 
to meet the requirements of Broad-Based 
Black Economic Empowerment (BBBEE), 
including establishing transformation 
committees in our South African operations 
to allow our employees to discuss equity 
and training-related issues and ideas.  

Our current BBBEE certificate can be 
found on our website
www.mondigroup.com/investors/
corporate-governance/regulatory-
reports

More broadly, a governance framework 
around D&I has been established in order 
to focus our efforts. The Group D&I 
function, forming part of the Group HR 
function, supports the D&I agenda across 
Mondi's operations, while a D&I Steering 
Committee provides policy oversight 
and facilitates the necessary stakeholder 
engagement to ensure D&I is firmly 
embedded across the organisation. 
Mondi’s approach to D&I is focused on 
community development, as well as creating 
cultures that are welcoming and foster 
belonging. In line with this, initiatives 
have been started, such as the Curious 
Community, a group consisting of more 
than 350 members from 27 countries 
who span all levels of seniority. It provides 
a safe space for employees to connect, 
learn and find inspiration and ideas to 
implement at a local level. Key activities 
in 2023 included monthly virtual events 
with speakers, discussions relating to 
a broad range of topics and listening 
and reflection exercises. 

We offer a broad range of leadership 
development programmes and initiatives, 
and we have made D&I a part of all 
of them. Through training, coaching, 
mentoring and reverse mentoring 
programmes, we support our female 
talent in their development and growth 
throughout their careers. 

In support of our commitment to D&I, a D&I 
target is included in the Mondi Action Plan 
2030 (MAP2030), and we have committed 
to providing purposeful employment for all, 
in a diverse and inclusive workplace. 
Progress is measured by the Purposeful 
Workplace Index and Inclusiveness Index 
scores in our global Employee Survey 
(each to reach 90% by 2030) and by the 
overall percentage of women that we 
employ across Mondi (to reach a minimum 
of 30% women globally by 2030, against 
a 2020 baseline of 21%). In many of the 
countries in which we operate, a cultural 

shift is required, with education and 
a change of mindset needed, as well 
as changes to underlying recruitment 
processes, to remove the barriers that 
discourage women from entering our 
workforce. We therefore acknowledge that 
meeting the target of 30% women will be 
challenging. The Board and the organisation 
as a whole are committed, however, 
to making the changes required. Read 
more about our MAP2030 commitments 
and our progress in this regard on page 49.

While it is recognised that there are many 
challenges and there is more work to do, 
management and the Board are fully 
committed to our diversity journey and 
we believe that our ambitious goals will 
be achieved by working across the 
business and engaging our stakeholders 
on our 2030 commitments, sharing good 
practice, and collaborating both internally 
and externally.

Corporate governance report
Audit Committee

Dear Shareholder
I am pleased to present this report, 
which provides an overview of the areas 
of focus for the committee during the 
year, as well as its key activities and the 
framework within which it operates.

Composition
In April 2023, Anke Groth was appointed 
as a member of the committee. Anke 
has significant financial and commercial 
experience, making her well placed to 
provide valuable knowledge and insight 
to the committee.

The Board remains comfortable that 
the committee members have the 
appropriate knowledge, skills and 
experience to fulfil the duties delegated 
to the committee. Each member 
has appropriate knowledge and 
understanding of financial matters 
and commercial expertise gained from 
industries with similar manufacturing, 
engineering and technology-focused 
international operations, to give the 
committee as a whole competence 
relevant to the sector in which the 
Group operates.

We continue to keep the composition 
of the committee under review to ensure 
that, in the long term, it continues to have 
the breadth of knowledge it requires. 

Areas of focus
The committee’s primary responsibilities 
are to oversee the Group’s corporate 
financial reporting, including the 
relationship with the external auditor, 
to assist the Board with any judgements 
required and to monitor the effectiveness 
of the Group's risk management 
processes. These remained the key focus 
areas of the committee during the year.

Stephen Young
Chair of the Audit Committee

The committee continued to monitor the approach to 
risk management, and the identification, assessment 
and mitigation of the Group's principal risks. It was 
particularly focused on the appetite level for each risk, 
the actual risk exposure in each case and whether any 
actions were required to close any gaps.

Alongside this, the committee continued to 
monitor the approach to risk management, 
and the identification, assessment and 
mitigation of the Group's principal risks. 
It particularly focused on the appetite level 
for each risk, the actual risk exposure in 
each case and whether any actions were 
required to close any gaps that might exist. 
After detailed discussion in this regard, 
the committee was comfortable that there 
are robust processes in place to identify, 
measure and manage the Group's risk 
exposure. More information relating to 
Mondi's risk management framework can 
be found on pages 69-70.

A more detailed overview of the key 
matters considered by the committee 
during the year can be found on page 112.

This report also aims to provide the 
disclosures required by the new Minimum 
Standard for Audit Committees introduced 
by the Financial Reporting Council during 
2023, and to demonstrate how we have 
complied with the Minimum Standard. 

Committee effectiveness
The committee’s performance and 
effectiveness were reviewed as part of the 
Board evaluation undertaken during the 
year, more details of which can be found 
on page 104. I am pleased to confirm that 
the committee is seen to be operating 
effectively and fulfilling the duties 
delegated to it by the Board.

Stephen Young
Chair, Audit Committee

Areas of focus continued
In particular, the committee continued 
to monitor the accounting implications 
of the Board’s decision in 2022 to divest 
the Group’s Russian assets and the 
continuation and conclusion of the sales 
process in 2023. 

In the prior year, after consideration of the 
detailed accounting rules, and with input 
from management and Mondi’s external 
auditor, PricewaterhouseCoopers LLP 
(PwC), it was concluded in June 2022 
that Mondi retained control of the 
Russian businesses, resulting in continued 
consolidation of the businesses, and that 
they should be classified as held for sale 
and, as a separate major geography, also 
presented as discontinued operations. 
The committee remained comfortable 
that these conclusions were appropriate 
until completion of the sale of the 
Russian assets, with the sale of the three 
packaging converting operations completed 
in June 2023 and the Syktyvkar mill 
in October 2023. The committee also 
concluded, prior to completion of the 
sale of the Syktyvkar mill, that in light of 
developments relating to the sale process 
at the time, the assets of the Syktyvkar mill 
in the six months to 30 June 2023 should 
be impaired. A more detailed explanation 
of the accounting treatment applied can 
be found on pages 206-209. 

The committee was required to consider 
a number of other critical accounting 
judgements during the year, including in 
respect of the acquisition of the Duino mill 
(Italy) in January 2023, and the continued 
impact of hyperinflation in Türkiye. A more 
detailed explanation of the significant 
issues considered by the committee in 
respect of the financial statements can 
be found on pages 113-115.

The continued evolution of the Group's 
Internal Audit function following the 
appointment of a new Group Head of 
Internal Audit towards the end of 2022 was 
also high on the committee's agenda during 
the year. While the committee has always 
been satisfied with the effectiveness of the 
Internal Audit function, the appointment 
represented an opportunity to further 
develop the function to ensure it remains 
fit for purpose and is in the best position 
possible to support the management of 
the Group's risks and the achievement 
of our strategy in the long term. 
Developments have included the 
appointment of relevant specialists to 
the Internal Audit team, strengthening 
the team's ability to respond to new and 
evolving risks facing the Group, and 
a refresh of the approach to reporting 
to the committee, giving the committee 
further comfort that the Internal Audit 
function is focusing on key areas of risk 
and responding appropriately to any issues 
identified. More information relating to 
Mondi's approach to internal audit can 
be found on page 118.

Cyber security remained a notable focus 
for the committee during the year, given 
the increasing number and sophistication 
of the methods being employed by cyber 
attackers. The committee continued to 
receive half-yearly updates from the 
Chief Information Officer covering matters 
including measures taken in response to 
the evolving risk landscape, the findings 
of internal and external audits of Mondi's 
IT infrastructure and the ongoing 
strengthening and development of Mondi's 
cyber defences. The Group continues 
to undertake significant work in this regard 
and the committee was pleased to 
hear that external testing of Mondi’s 
infrastructure, which is undertaken regularly, 
indicated that the measures we have in 
place remain effective and robust in this 
developing landscape. More information 
on Mondi’s approach to cyber security 
can be found on page 79.

Corporate governance report
Audit Committee continued

Audit Committee activity
Set out below are some of the key matters addressed by this committee.

Financial reporting
– Reviewed the integrity of all financial 
announcements with input provided 
by the Group CFO, the Group 
Controlling team and PwC as 
appropriate.

– Reviewed the Mondi Group 

Integrated report and financial 
statements for tone and consistency, 
agreed the application of critical 
accounting policies and key 
judgements, and considered whether 
the report as a whole was fair, 
balanced and understandable 
(see page 116 for more information).

– Reviewed and discussed PwC’s 

reports to the committee.

– Considered in detail the accounting 
implications of the decision to divest 
the Group’s Russian operations, 
Mondi's withdrawal from the 
agreement to sell the Syktyvkar mill 
to Augment Investments Limited and 
the ultimate disposal of the mill 
to Sezar Invest LLC (see pages 
206-209 for more information).

– Considered the accounting 

implications of the acquisition of the 
Duino mill (Italy) (see page 202 for 
more information) and the impact of 
hyperinflation in Türkiye (see page 172 
for more information). 

– Reviewed and agreed the accounting 
policies to be applied for the year 
ending 31 December 2023.

– Reviewed new accounting 

pronouncements and any impact 
for the Group’s financial reporting.

– Reviewed the going concern basis 
of accounting and the longer-term 
viability statement (see pages 80-81 
for more information).

External audit matters
– Recommended to the Board that the 
appointment of PwC for the 2023 
audit be put to shareholders at the 
Annual General Meeting.

– Reviewed the independence, 

objectivity and effectiveness of PwC 
(see page 117 for more information).

– Reviewed and approved the external 
audit plan, taking account of the 
scope, materiality and audit risks 
and agreeing the audit fees.

– Reviewed and agreed the 

engagement and representation 
letters.

– Considered the implications of 

Simon Morley's forthcoming rotation 
as lead audit partner and agreed 
the appointment of his replacement 
for the 2024 audit (see page 117 
for more information).

– Held two meetings with PwC without 
management present; the committee 
Chair also engaged regularly with 
the lead audit partner.

Risk management and 
internal controls
– Undertook a detailed review of the 
Group’s risk management policy 
and plan, risk appetite levels and 
principal risks. This resulted in the 
recommendation of changes to 
the Board, including the removal 
of pandemic risk as a standalone risk 
(given its incorporation into our wider 
employee and contractor health 
and safety risk), and the derating of 
a number of principal risks. Emerging 
risks were also considered, with 
a particular focus on the execution 
of major capital expenditure projects 
given Mondi’s extensive capital 
expenditure programme. Further 
information can be found on page 71. 

– Undertook a more in-depth review 
of a number of the most significant 
Group risks, with presentations 
from relevant members of senior 
management considering the level 
of risk and the monitoring and 
mitigation measures in place.

– Received half-yearly presentations 
on IT risk management and cyber 
security, focusing in particular on 
key measures taken to continuously 
strengthen Mondi’s protection 
against IT risk and cyber attacks 
and internal and external testing 
undertaken to assess the robustness 
of the IT infrastructure. 

Internal audit matters
– Reviewed and agreed the internal 
audit plan, confirming the focus on 
key risk areas and adequate cover 
of all material operations.

– Received reports from the Group 

Head of Internal Audit (see page 118 
for more information).

– Undertook a review of the 

effectiveness of the Internal Audit 
function (see page 118 for more 
information).

– Reviewed summaries of messages 

from SpeakOut, providing insight into 
the culture of the Group and issues 
of particular concern to stakeholders.

– Held two meetings with the Group 
Head of Internal Audit without 
management present.

Governance and other
– Monitored the continued 

implementation of those elements 
of the Group’s Code of Business 
Ethics reserved for review by 
the committee.

– Undertook the annual review of 

Mondi's Business Integrity Policy, 
which, among other things, outlines 
Mondi's zero tolerance approach to 
bribery and corruption. 

– Reviewed the compliance risks faced 
by the Group, including in relation 
to competition compliance.

– Considered the implications of 

proposed governance and audit 
reform in the UK, particularly in 
respect of internal controls.

– Reviewed the committee’s terms 
of reference, performance and 
work programme.

Internal control
The Group’s internal control and risk management framework, embedded in all key operations, is designed to address all the significant 
strategic, financial, operational and compliance risks that could undermine our ability to achieve our business objectives in the future and 
is managed within risk tolerance levels defined by the Board. In accordance with the provisions of the UK Corporate Governance Code, 
the Group has in place an internal control environment to protect the business from principal risks which have been identified. 

Management is responsible for establishing and maintaining adequate internal controls over financial reporting and we have responsibility 
for ensuring the effectiveness of these controls. Full details of Mondi’s internal control and risk management framework can be found 
in the Strategic report on pages 69-70.

The committee has reviewed the risk management process and the Group’s system of internal controls. The committee considers that 
the system of internal controls operated effectively throughout the financial year and up to the date on which the financial statements 
were signed. 

Significant issues related to the financial statements
The committee has considered each of the following items based on discussions with, and submissions by, management and satisfied 
itself as to the accounting treatment and presentation thereof. These significant items were discussed with the external auditor 
during the planning stage and on completion of the audit.

The key considerations in relation to the 2023 financial statements were:

Matter considered
Special items are those financial items which the Group considers 
should be separately disclosed on the face of the income 
statement to assist in understanding the underlying financial 
performance achieved by the Group as special items affect 
year-on-year comparability. The classification of an item as special 
is based on materiality in the context of the current year’s financial 
performance and generally must exceed €10 million. Subsequent 
adjustments to items previously reported as special items 
continue to be reflected as special items in future periods even 
if they do not exceed the quantitative reporting threshold.

The net special item expense (before tax) for the year was €27 
million (2022: income of €242 million), consisting of a closure of 
a paper machine and streamlining of the capacity of the finishing 
lines at the Neusiedler operations in Austria. Details of the special 
items are included in note 3 of the financial statements.

On 12 January 2023, the Group completed the acquisition of the 
Duino mill near Trieste (Italy) from the Burgo Group for total net 
cash paid of €37 million. The purchase price allocation resulted 
in a gain on bargain purchase of €2 million as the fair value of net 
assets acquired was in excess of the consideration paid. The gain 
on bargain purchase is attributable to the need for investment, 
which corresponds with the Group’s investment plans to convert 
the paper machine and the limited reusability of certain assets 
after the conversion and the future costs associated with the mill 
while the conversion is pending.

Details of the fair value of assets acquired and liabilities assumed 
as a result of the business combination are included in note 25 
of the financial statements.

Action
The committee has:

– critically reviewed the item presented by management as being 

special to ensure that the item is in line with the Group’s 
accounting policy;

– considered both the quantification and presentation of the 

special item;

– reviewed the adequacy of the description of the special item 

in the financial statements and the Strategic report; and

– considered whether any significant transactions that were not 

classified as special were appropriately classified in the financial 
statements and appropriately described in the Strategic report.

The committee has:

– considered reports from management in relation to the acquisition;

– evaluated the management reports of the purchase price 

allocation; and

– satisfied itself that the fair value of assets acquired and liabilities 

assumed in the business combination are appropriate and 
considered according to the Group’s accounting policy.

Audit Committee continued

Matter considered
In addition to property, plant and equipment of €4,619 million, 
intangible assets of €68 million and goodwill of €765 million 
are included as assets in the statement of financial position.

As set out in the accounting policies, the goodwill is tested for 
impairment annually and property, plant and equipment and 
intangible assets whenever there is any indication that those 
assets are impaired.

Details of goodwill impairment tests and impairments of property, 
plant and equipment are included in notes 10 and 12 of the 
financial statements.

The Group has applied IAS 29, 'Financial Reporting in 
Hyperinflationary Economies', for its subsidiaries in Türkiye 
and Lebanon (2022: Türkiye).

IAS 29 requires judgement to determine when to apply 
hyperinflationary accounting and which general price index 
to select and other approximations to be made in order 
to restate the financial statements of subsidiaries operating 
in a hyperinflationary economy. 

For the year ended 31 December 2023, the adjustments from 
hyperinflationary accounting have resulted in an accumulated 
increase in total assets of €115 million, an increase in Group 
revenue of €116 million, a decrease in underlying EBITDA 
of €16 million and a net monetary gain of €2 million.
Significant estimation is required in determining the assumptions 
to be applied for the valuation of the Group’s forestry assets 
and retirement benefit obligations. Such assumptions are based, 
as far as possible, on observable market data and, in the case 
of the retirement benefit obligations, on the input and advice 
of actuaries.

Details are included in the financial statements (forestry assets 
in note 14 and retirement benefits in note 24).

Action
The committee has:

– considered a report from management describing potential 
impairment indicators for tangible and intangible assets and 
the outcomes of related impairment tests where performed;

– considered a report from management on the outcomes 

of the annual goodwill impairment test;

– reviewed the underlying assumptions applied and compared 
them with the Group’s three-year 2024-2026 plan (budget 
period) and the current macroeconomic environment; 

– considered the sensitivities underlying the primary assumptions 

to determine the consequences that reasonably possible 
changes in such assumptions may have on the recoverable 
amount of the underlying assets; and

– satisfied itself that no impairments related to goodwill or 

intangible assets were required and impairments of property, 
plant and equipment were justified.

The committee has:

– considered reports from management; and

– satisfied itself that the judgements and adjustments applied 
are appropriate and considered according to the Group’s 
accounting policy.

The committee has:

– considered reports from management;

– reviewed the assumptions applied in the valuation of the 

forestry assets and retirement benefits;

– considered the basis on which these assumptions were 

determined, and evaluated the assumptions by comparing 
them with prior years and considering market developments 
during 2023; and

– satisfied itself that the assumptions, and the changes to 
those assumptions when compared with the year ended 
31 December 2022, were appropriate.

Mondi Group Integrated report and financial statements 2023

Matter considered
The Group has operations in a number of countries, each with 
a different tax system.

The Group is regularly subject to routine tax audits and provisions 
are made based on the tax laws in the relevant country and the 
expected outcomes of any negotiations or settlements.

The Group’s recognition of deferred tax assets, relating to future 
utilisation of accumulated tax losses, is dependent on the future 
profitability and performance of the underlying businesses.

Understanding of the Group’s risks and implications related 
to climate change is continuously being enhanced. While the 
Group’s assessments still reflect that these may not be severe 
in the short term, it is believed that climate change risks are likely 
to have a medium- and long-term impact on business.

The financial statement disclosures consider the impact of climate 
change, notably in the estimates used to calculate the fair value 
of our forestry assets. The Group continues to assess accounting 
policies, judgements and estimates to consider the impact 
of climate change.

Action
The committee has: 

– received regular reports from management about new 
legislative developments that may impact the Group’s 
tax positions;

– considered reports from management outlining the Group’s 
most significant tax exposures, including ongoing tax audits 
and litigation, and has reviewed the related tax provisions 
recognised by management, satisfying itself these are 
appropriate and the risk of new unexpected exposures 
arising is low; and

– considered a report from management outlining the key 

assumptions relating to the recognition of deferred tax assets 
and satisfied itself that the assumptions made are reasonable 
and consistent from year to year.

The committee has:

– participated in overseeing the Group’s approach to 

sustainability;

– received regular reports from management about climate 

change and related legislative developments that may impact 
the Group’s disclosure;

– reviewed the Integrated report (including the TCFD section) 
and the financial statements for consistency with respect 
to climate change risks;

– reviewed the assumptions applied in the valuation of the 

forestry assets;

– considered accounting policies, judgements and estimates 
on the basis of expected climate change impacts; and

– satisfied itself that the assumptions, and the changes 
to those assumptions when compared with the year 
ended 31 December 2022, were appropriate.

Audit Committee continued

Fair, balanced and 
understandable
In line with the committee’s responsibility 
for ensuring there are robust financial 
reporting procedures and internal controls 
in place, and the UK Corporate Governance 
Code requirement for the committee to 
advise the Board in relation to the annual 
report and accounts, in particular whether, 
taken as a whole, it is fair, balanced and 
understandable, the committee undertook 
an assessment of the Integrated report 
and financial statements 2023. This 
incorporated the work undertaken by 
the committee throughout the year to 
monitor financial reporting. The process 
and outcome are set out opposite.

Oversight through the year

– Review of applicable accounting policies and pronouncements and their application.

– Review of regular financial results and announcements.

– Reports from the Group CFO, the Group controlling team and PwC.

– Reports from the Group Head of Internal Audit.

Review included

– Provision of an outline plan including content and structure, design concepts and timetable.

– Consideration of regulatory and governance requirements for reporting.

– Review of detailed reports from the Group CFO, the Group controlling team and PwC 

providing the opportunity for debate and challenge.

– Summaries of areas where management judgements or significant accounting estimates 

had been made. 

– Consideration of going concern and longer-term viability.

– Separate meetings with PwC without management present.

Review confirmed

– Well documented planning and procedures for the preparation of the report.

– Collaborative approach between all parties required to contribute to the report.

– Basis of preparation consistent with financial reporting throughout the year.

– All significant issues had been considered.

– Messaging was consistent, particularly the narrative reflecting the financials.

Conclusion

– After completion of the detailed review, the committee was satisfied that:

– taken as a whole, the Group’s Integrated report and financial statements 2023, were fair, 

balanced and understandable;

– the report accurately reflected the information shareholders would require in order 
to assess the Group’s position and performance, business model and strategy; and

– the use of alternative performance measures contained in the report assists in presenting 

a fair review of the Group’s business.

– The committee reported its findings to the Board, and recommended its conclusions to the 

Board for approval.

Recommendation

Mondi Group Integrated report and financial statements 2023

117

External audit
PricewaterhouseCoopers LLP (PwC) was 
first appointed as auditor by shareholders 
at the Annual General Meeting in May 2017, 
replacing Deloitte LLP following a tender 
process. The 2023 audit was PwC’s seventh 
for Mondi and Simon Morley’s fourth as lead 
audit partner. Given Simon was previously 
a Key Partner Involved in the Engagement 
since 2017, his maximum tenure was 
a combined seven years. The 2023 audit 
was therefore his last for Mondi. 
Andrew Hammond will replace Simon as 
the lead audit partner for the 2024 audit. 

We are required to undertake a 
mandatory audit tender process after 
10 years and the decision on precisely 
when to undertake such a process will 
be taken by the committee. Following 
an assessment of the independence, 
objectivity and effectiveness of the 
external auditor, details of which can 
be found below, the committee has 
concluded that it remains satisfied 
with the effectiveness and quality 
of the audit work. 

The committee also remains satisfied with 
PwC’s capabilities and the relationship 
with Mondi. In light of this, it is not 
currently anticipated that a tender 
process will be conducted before such 
a process is required, in respect of the 
31 December 2027 year-end. 

The committee confirms its compliance for 
the financial year ended 31 December 2023 
with the provisions of The Statutory Audit 
Services for Large Companies Market 
Investigation (Mandatory Use of 
Competitive Tender Processes and Audit 
Committee Responsibilities) Order 2014.

External audit independence, objectivity and effectiveness
A formal framework for the assessment of the effectiveness of the external audit process and quality of the audit has been 
adopted by the committee, covering all aspects of the audit service provided by PwC. While part of the assessment is managed 
annually, it is treated as an ongoing review throughout the cycle. 

Evaluation focus
– Robustness of audit process.
– Audit quality, including quality 

controls.

– Audit partners and team, including 
skills, character and knowledge.

– Independence and objectivity.
– Formal reporting.

Key inputs
Audit Committee
– Continually monitored audit 

performance throughout the year.
– Reviewed and agreed the audit plan.
– Reviewed the quality of reporting to 
the committee, the level of challenge 
and professional scepticism and the 
understanding demonstrated by PwC 
of the business of the Group.
– Reviewed the quality of the audit 

team, technical skills and experience 
and the allocation of resources 
during the audit.

– Considered the interaction with 
management and the level of 
challenge.

– Regular meetings held between 
the Chair of the committee and 
the audit engagement partner.

– Reviewed feedback from committee 
members including views on how 
PwC has supported the work of 
the committee and communicated 
with the committee.

– Considered the effectiveness of 

Mondi’s policies and procedures for 
maintaining auditor independence.

– Met with PwC twice during 
the year without executive 
management present.

Management
– Feedback from engagement with the 
Group CFO, Group Controlling team 
and Group Head of Internal Audit.
– Feedback from questionnaires issued 
at corporate and business unit levels 
to those personnel involved with 
the audit.

PwC
– Provided the committee with 

confirmation that it operates in 
accordance with the ethical standards 
required of audit firms.

– Confirmed the policies and 

procedures it has in place to maintain 
its independence.

Regulators
– The UK Financial Reporting Council’s 

(FRC) 2022/23 report on Audit 
Quality Inspections included a review 
of audits carried out by PwC. 

Key outputs
– The quality of the audit partners 
and team was confirmed, with 
no material issues raised in the 
feedback received.

– The audit had been well planned 

and delivered, with work completed 
on schedule and management 
comfortable that any key findings 
had been raised appropriately, as 
well as active engagement on 
misstatements and appropriate 
judgements on materiality.

– PwC demonstrated a good 

understanding of the Group and its 
internal control systems, and had 
identified and focused on the areas 
of greatest financial reporting risk. 

– PwC’s reporting to the committee 
was clear, open and thorough, 
including explanations of the 
rationale for particular conclusions 
as appropriate. 

– It was confirmed that, through 

the review of management papers 
and analyses and the discussion 
of key matters with management 
and the auditor, there had been 
an appropriate level of challenge 
during the course of the audit, 
with the external auditor and the 
Audit Committee challenging 
management’s judgements and 
assertions on matters including 
critical accounting judgements 
and key sources of estimation 
uncertainty; impairment of property, 
plant and equipment and goodwill; 
and assumptions underlying the 
going concern basis of accounting 
in preparing the financial statements 
and the viability statement.

Conclusion
The committee, having considered 
all relevant matters, has concluded that 
it is satisfied that auditor independence, 
objectivity and effectiveness have 
been maintained.

The effectiveness of the Group's Internal 
Audit function is kept under close 
review by the committee, with a formal 
review undertaken annually. The last 
comprehensive, external review of the 
Internal Audit function was carried out in 
2020 by Independent Audit (a consultancy 
firm specialising in board evaluations 
and effectiveness reviews). The overall 
conclusions in respect of the effectiveness 
of the Internal Audit function, its leadership 
and its relationship with the Audit 
Committee were positive, and all 
recommendations have been addressed. 
Towards the end of 2022, upon retirement 
of the previous Group Head of Internal 
Audit, a new Group Head of Internal 
Audit was appointed. This change was 
complemented by the recruitment of a 
number of specialists into the department 
and the development of a four-year 
roadmap for the Internal Audit function. 

An internal review was undertaken in 2023. 
The committee has concluded following 
the review that the Internal Audit function 
remains effective in carrying out its remit. 

Corporate governance report
Audit Committee continued

The Audit Committee has primary 
responsibility for monitoring and reviewing 
the scope and effectiveness of the Group’s 
Internal Audit function. The Group Head 
of Internal Audit has direct access and 
responsibility to the committee, as well 
as regular access to Mondi’s executive 
management. 

An Internal Audit Charter, approved by 
the committee, is in place. The charter 
sets out the purpose, remit and authority 
of the Internal Audit function. Each year, 
the committee considers and approves 
the internal audit plan, which is designed 
to focus on the Group’s key risks to 
ensure that they are managed effectively 
within the context of our business 
objectives and that appropriate internal 
controls are in place. 

The committee ensures that all material 
operations and relevant business 
processes are covered and that there 
is an appropriate degree of financial 
and geographical coverage. Every Mondi 
operation is visited at least once every five 
years, with all major plants audited annually. 

Reports are given at each committee 
meeting, providing an update on activities, 
resourcing levels, progress against plan, 
results from audits carried out and 
management’s response to address 
any areas highlighted for improvement. 
The committee will consider deviations 
from plan as the need arises during the 
year, usually in response to a material 
acquisition or change in the Group’s risk 
profile, highlighted through audit reports 
and through matters raised via the 
anonymous whistleblowing and grievance 
platform, SpeakOut.

Non-audit services
A policy is in place that governs the 
provision of non-audit services provided 
by PwC to Mondi, setting out those services 
that are permissible and the process to be 
followed to obtain approval for such services. 
All such services must be approved – there 
are no pre-approvals in place. Authority is 
delegated by the committee to the Chair 
of the committee to approve such services. 
The policy, which is regularly reviewed, 
was last updated in 2020 to reflect the 
changes introduced by the Revised Ethical 
Standard 2019. 

For all non-audit services, the business 
must submit a formal request setting out 
the objectives, scope of work, likely fee 
level and the rationale for requiring the 
work to be carried out by the Group’s 
external auditor.

The committee monitors compliance 
with the policy and the monetary cap 
on non-audit fees, receiving reports at 
each meeting detailing all approved 
non-audit services. 

Total fees for non-audit services amounted 
to €0.6 million, representing 9.8% of the 
audit fee, with the vast majority of the 
non-audit fees incurred relating to the 
half-year review and other audit-related 
assurance services.

Internal audit
Mondi’s Internal Audit function forms 
an integral part of Mondi’s governance 
and risk management and internal control 
frameworks. The primary purpose of the 
Internal Audit function is to help the 
Board and executive management to protect 
the assets, reputation and sustainability of 
the organisation and to manage and mitigate 
its risks effectively. This includes assessing 
whether all significant risks are identified 
and appropriately reported by management 
to the Board and executive management, 
and whether they are adequately controlled.

Corporate governance report
Sustainable Development Committee

Dear Shareholder
I am pleased to present this report, 
which provides an overview of the areas 
of focus for the committee during the 
year, as well as its key activities and the 
framework within which it operates. 

While the Board as a whole has 
responsibility for overseeing Mondi’s 
approach to sustainability, the committee, 
on behalf of the Board, oversees 
and monitors Mondi’s sustainable 
development policies and practices 
and progress against our sustainability 
commitments and targets. It provides 
guidance in relation to sustainability 
matters, including climate change-related 
issues and reviewing and approving 
updates to the Group’s framework 
of sustainability policies and strategies, 
ensuring they are aligned with global 
best practice. 

Our sustainability policies include: Safety 
and Occupational Health; Labour and 
Human Rights; Sustainable Forestry; 
Energy and Climate Change; 
Environment; Supply Chain and 
Responsible Procurement; Product 
Stewardship; and Communities.

A summary report from the directors 
on the Group’s sustainability practices 
is set out on pages 42-68.
Areas of focus
The safety of all our employees 
and contractors is a priority for the 
committee. Safety performance 
continues to be a focus at every meeting 
to ensure our high standards are 
maintained. We were deeply saddened 
by the fatality of a contractor at our 
Ružomberok mill (Slovakia) in November. 
Unfortunately we also experienced four 
life-altering injuries at our operations 
during the year. Full investigations were 
undertaken and the committee was kept 
informed throughout. We understand 
the significant impact that such incidents 
have on families, friends and colleagues 
and we look to take any lessons we can 
to minimise the risk of a reoccurrence. 
It was highly important that we spent 
time understanding these events and 
the underlying causes and actions to 
be taken in response. Further details 
of the actions being undertaken can 
be found on page 50.

Dominique Reiniche
Chair of the Sustainable Development Committee

The committee critically reviewed the progress 
against our target of making 100% of our packaging 
and paper solutions reusable, recyclable or 
compostable. The complexity in navigating the 
transition to a circular economy was considered, 
with a focus on the efforts that are being made 
to ensure that a sustainable alternative is in place.

Sustainable Development Committee continued

The committee critically reviewed the 
progress against our target of making 100% 
of our packaging and paper solutions 
reusable, recyclable or compostable. 
The complexity in navigating the transition 
to a circular economy was considered, with 
a focus on the efforts that are being made 
to ensure that a sustainable alternative is 
in place, in particular to accelerate progress 
in the flexible packaging business. More 
information can be found on pages 45-47.

Committee effectiveness
The committee’s performance and 
effectiveness were reviewed as part 
of the Board evaluation undertaken during 
the year, more details of which can be 
found on page 104. I am pleased to 
confirm that the committee is seen to 
be operating effectively and fulfilling 
the duties delegated to it by the Board.

Dominique Reiniche
Chair, Sustainable 
Development Committee

Areas of focus continued
We continue to work hard to proactively 
embed our safety culture across the Group. 
During the year, priority safety focus areas 
were reviewed. These included safety 
support for annual maintenance shuts and 
major capex projects, safety campaigns 
and focused site visits. The Social 
Psychology of Risk was reconfirmed as a 
safety focus area, with the aim of focusing 
on the psychological and cultural elements 
that can pose a risk to safety, the 
promotion of engagement across our sites 
and increasing general personal awareness. 
The safety of our people will remain at the 
top of our agenda in 2024. 

The committee also spent time reviewing 
the double materiality assessment 
undertaken in preparation for the 
implementation of reporting requirements 
under the European Union's Corporate 
Sustainability Reporting Directive (CSRD). 
The committee reviewed both the outcome 
of the materiality assessment, which was 
focused on the impact our business has 
on the environment in which we operate 
and the issues of greatest importance 
to our stakeholders, and on the financial 
materiality, which considered the potential 
impact of key sustainability issues on 
Mondi's business. The resulting double 
materiality outcome was reviewed and 
10 material topics were identified which are 
aligned with our Mondi Action Plan 2030 
(MAP2030) action areas. Further details 
can be found on pages 42-43.  

In January 2023, relevant MAP2030 targets 
were updated to exclude Russian 
operations. Progress made against the 
MAP2030 commitments and targets 
continued to be an area of focus for the 
committee, and particular attention was 
paid to upcoming investment projects 
and their contribution to a reduction in 
greenhouse gas (GHG) emissions. While 
this will be a journey for Mondi, and 
we acknowledge the extent of the work 
required to achieve Net-Zero, the 
committee was pleased to see the actions 
being taken and progress made during 
2023. More information can be found 
on pages 51-64.

Alongside this, the committee reviewed 
sustainability risks and opportunities. 
Climate change mitigation remained 
a priority and climate change risks and 
opportunities were considered in detail. 
Further information, including Mondi’s 
disclosures in line with the 
recommendations of the Task Force 
on Climate-Related Financial Disclosures, 
can be found on pages 55-64. Mondi 
is determined to minimise the impact 
of its business on climate change through 
robust governance combined with a 
rigorous approach to reducing GHG 
emissions across the value chain.  

In 2022, the committee took over 
responsibility for the people-related targets 
from the Nominations Committee, and 
discussions in this respect formed a key 
part of the committee's agenda in 2023. 
The committee reviewed the employee 
statistics and the progress in respect 
of diversity and inclusion targets, with 
increasing the representation of females 
in our workforce remaining a focus area. 
The committee acknowledged that local 
factors play a role and impact the 
performance against our targets in this 
respect. The Board, the committee and 
the organisation as a whole remain 
committed to making the changes 
required. Further information on our 
diversity and inclusion initiatives can 
be found on pages 49 and 107-109. 

The committee was pleased to see the 
results of the 2023 Employee Survey, with 
one of the highlights being that 80% of 
respondents find meaning and purpose 
in their job. The committee also discussed 
potential areas for improvement, such as 
promoting psychological safety to speak 
up. Sue Clark, in her role as non-executive 
director responsible for understanding 
the views of employees, also provided an 
overview of engagement undertaken during 
the year and further insight into views of 
a cross-section of our employees. More 
information can be found on pages 92-93.

Remuneration report
Statement from the Chair of the 
Remuneration Committee

Dear Shareholder
I am pleased to present this report 
on directors' remuneration as Chair 
of the Remuneration Committee 
(the committee). 
Compliance statement
This report has been prepared on 
behalf of, and has been approved by, 
the Board. It complies with the Large 
and Medium-sized Companies and 
Groups (Accounts and Reports) 
Regulations 2008 (as amended in 2018) 
(the Regulations), the UK Corporate 
Governance Code and the UK Listing 
Rules, and takes into account the 
Directors' Remuneration Reporting 
Guidance and the relevant policies 
of shareholder representative bodies.

In accordance with the UK Companies 
Act, shareholders will be asked to vote 
on the following resolution at the 2024 
Annual General Meeting (AGM):

– an advisory vote on the Directors' 
remuneration report excluding the 
Directors' Remuneration Policy (DRP), 
which provides details of the 
remuneration earned by directors 
for performance in the year ended 
31 December 2023, and how the DRP 
will be implemented for 2024.

The committee continues to focus 
on performance driven reward that 
aligns the remuneration of our executives 
to the interests of our shareholders. 
We are confident that the DRP and 
our approach to its implementation will 
continue to support Mondi’s success, 
incentivising the management team 
to deliver long-term sustainable 
shareholder value.

Dame Angela Strank
Chair of the Remuneration Committee

The remuneration strategy is intended to be simple, 
fair and transparent, leading to reward outcomes that 
are reflective of wider business performance.

Performance in 2023 
Context of remuneration
Mondi’s performance in 2023 reflected 
the uncertain global economic environment 
and its impact on the markets in which 
we operate. Against this backdrop, 
we delivered a resilient performance.

Underlying EBITDA was €1,201 million. 
Cash generation remained strong at €1,312 
million, and ahead of last year. We continue 
to make good progress in delivering on our 
growth projects.

Sustainability is at the heart of the strategy 
and embedded into Mondi’s actions and 
decisions. Clear and measurable progress 
continued to be made over the course 
of 2023 against the ambitious targets of 
the Mondi Action Plan 2030 (MAP2030). 
The strategic importance of our sustainability 
agenda is reflected in the remuneration 
structure and is a key component of 
the Group's annual bonus, embedding 
sustainability goals into the organisation. 

Safety is our highest priority. We continue 
to build on our Social Psychology of Risk 
approach to safety, culture and behaviours, 
in addition to our traditional assessment of 
safety performance using Total Recordable 
Case Rate (TRCR). Although we are 
among the leading performers in safety 
in our industry, we tragically experienced 
a fatality towards the end of 2023 at our 
Ružomberok mill (Slovakia). We ensure 
that every incident is fully investigated, that 
learnings are shared, and procedures 
and practices revised, if appropriate, 
to avoid the same or a similar situation 
happening in the future. 

The Board has recommended a total 
ordinary dividend for the year of 70.00 euro 
cents per share in line with 2022. 
This reflects the Board’s confidence 
in the future of the business.

Further details on performance in 2023 
are set out on pages 2-3.

Remuneration outcomes 
aligned to performance
Annual bonus 
For the 2023 annual bonus, performance 
was assessed against financial (60%), safety 
(10%), greenhouse gas (GHG) emissions 
(5%), waste to landfill (WtL) (5%) and 
personal (20%) targets.

Annual bonuses of 29% and 30% of 
maximum have been awarded in respect of 
performance in 2023 for Andrew King and 
Mike Powell respectively. The outturn, as a 
percentage of the maximum opportunity, is 
a fair reflection of the performance against 
the components of the bonus scorecard.

– The majority of the bonus is assessed 
against financial measures. Threshold 
levels of financial performance were not 
achieved (underlying EBITDA of €1,201 
million and ROCE of 12.8%), resulting in 
0% of the financial elements being 
received.

– The Group's annual bonus is linked 
to sustainability objectives, including 
the binary targets of reduction in GHG 
emissions and elimination of waste to 
landfill, each accounting for 5% of the 
total bonus opportunity. While the waste 
to landfill target was achieved, the 
GHG emissions target was not, due to 
loss of production as a consequence of 
market conditions, and this element of 
the bonus was forfeited. As a result, the 
bonus outturn for GHG and waste to 
landfill was 5% out of a maximum of 10%. 
Details are given on pages 140-141. We 
continue to make good progress 
towards achieving our MAP2030 
commitments.

– The sustainability scorecard includes 

safety targets. Lead and lag indicators 
are used to monitor and improve safety 
performance, with the intention to 
mitigate risks proactively. The lead and 
lag indicator each account for 5% of the 
total bonus opportunity. The lag indicator 
assesses the Total Recordable Case 
Rate (TRCR). The TRCR outcome of 
0.64 reflected fewer safety incidents 
than the target of 0.65. The Executive 
Committee individually and collectively 
achieved all of the lead indicators, aimed 
at reinforcing safety as our highest 
priority, and our Social Psychology of 
Risk approach. A formulaic assessment 
of the safety performance against the 
lead and lag indicators would have 
resulted in 10% of the maximum bonus 
being delivered.

– However, there was a fatality in 2023. This 

was independently reviewed by the 
Sustainable Development Committee and 
the Remuneration Committee. 
After careful deliberation of the specific 
circumstances, the Remuneration 
Committee determined that a downward 
adjustment of three percentage points of 
the lag indicator metric should be applied. 
This resulted in 60% of the lag indicator 
metric being forfeited. As a result, the 
safety component of the scorecard 
contributed 7% to the bonus outturn.

– The personal element of the bonus 

(20% of maximum) reflected specific 
operational and strategic objectives. 
Excellent progress was made against 
these objectives, set in the context 
of the challenges of 2023. As a result 
of this strong delivery, Andrew King and 
Mike Powell were awarded 17% and 18% 
respectively. 

Further details are set out on pages 140 to 143.

The committee considered the 
appropriateness of the overall bonus outturn, 
in the context of the financial and operational 
performance against targets. In challenging 
markets, the business delivered strong cash 
flow, and management made excellent 
progress against their strategic objectives. 
While other key metrics of financial 
performance were below expectations, our 
progress on long-term investment projects 
will ensure that Mondi is well positioned for 
a sustainable future. The committee considers 
that annual bonus outturns for Andrew and 
Mike of 29% and 30% of maximum respectively 
are a fair reflection of the performance 
of the business and their individual 
performance against personal objectives.

In accordance with the DRP, half of these 
annual bonus awards will be delivered in 
deferred shares which vest after three years.

LTIP
The performance period for the 2021 
Long-Term Incentive Plan (LTIP) ended 
on 31 December 2023. Half of the award 
was based on average ROCE performance 
and half on relative TSR performance over 
the three-year performance period. 

The ROCE performance range, originally 
determined by the committee in 2021, was 
set at 12% to 18%. The average ROCE for 
the three-year performance period was 
17.8%, which resulted in performance 
between threshold and stretch targets. 
This resulted in vesting of 97.5% of this 
element, which contributed to 48.75% 
of the total LTIP outcome.

Remuneration report
Statement from the Chair of the 
Remuneration Committee continued

Pension
Andrew King, Mike Powell and the majority 
of Mondi plc's workforce receive a pension 
allowance of 8% of base salary.

Variable pay
There are no proposed changes to the 
structure or quantum of the annual bonus 
and LTIP awards. For 2024, Andrew King 
will be eligible for a maximum bonus 
of 185% of base salary and an LTIP award 
of 230% of base salary. Mike Powell will 
be eligible for a maximum bonus of 170% 
of base salary and an LTIP award of 210% 
of base salary. Actual award levels for both 
the annual bonus and LTIP remain below 
the policy maxima.

Annual bonus
The majority of the annual bonus is 
assessed against financial measures. 
ROCE and underlying EBITDA are key 
performance indicators.

Given the strategic importance of 
sustainability, 20% of the total bonus 
opportunity is assessed against 
sustainability measures (pages 42-68 
of this report for further detail on our 
MAP2030 framework). Half of the 
sustainability metrics are assessed against 
safety performance. The scorecard also 
includes reduction in GHG emissions 
and elimination of waste to landfill, each 
with a weighting of 5% of maximum 
bonus opportunity. These are assessed 
against robust, quantifiable targets. These 
scorecard metrics address the key focus 
areas of MAP2030. In Mondi, we have 
chosen to include the sustainability metrics 
in the Group annual bonus plan rather than 
the LTIP, as the annual bonus plan extends 
deeper into the organisation. 

The sustainability metrics are at the heart 
of Mondi’s strategy. Together with ROCE 
and underlying EBITDA, this provides a 
well-rounded assessment of performance. 
Details of the performance measures 
and weightings are on page 129. 

LTIP 
For the 2024 LTIP grant, performance 
will be assessed against ROCE, relative 
TSR and cumulative EPS. Details of the 
performance measures, weightings 
and targets are on pages 129-130.

In 2023, we completed the sale of all 
our Russian assets following the Board's 
decision to exit Russia. The committee took 
account of this in setting the targets for the 
2024 LTIP awards, noting that the Russian 
operations had typically contributed 
approximately an additional 300 basis 
points towards ROCE. The committee 
determined that the threshold ROCE 
performance level should be maintained 
at 12% and the stretch performance level 
should be set at 16%. This adjustment 
of 200 basis points to the stretch target 
does not fully reflect the lost contribution 
from the Russian assets and the 
committee therefore considers this target 
to be stretching.

The EPS targets have been set on a 
cumulative basis in the context of the 
long-term financial plan and reflect the 
basic underlying EPS, post-share 
consolidation. The targets are considered 
to be stretching against the backdrop of a 
challenging global economic environment.

We will continue to review the opportunity, 
performance measures, weightings 
and targets of our variable pay plans 
periodically, within the parameters of the 
prevailing approved DRP. We appreciate 
feedback from investors and have carefully 
considered their comments at the 
Remuneration Committee, as we 
determined the 2024 performance targets.

Further details on the implementation of 
the DRP for the 2024 financial year are 
provided on page 129-130.

The Group’s TSR over the period was 2.17%, 
which was at median performance among 
the comparator group. This performance 
resulted in 25% vesting for this element, 
which contributed to 12.50% of the total 
LTIP outcome. 
As a result, 61.25% of the overall LTIP 
award will vest in March 2024. For our 
executive directors, their vested shares 
will be subject to a two-year post-vesting 
holding period until 2026. Further details 
are set out on page 144.
Summary
The committee considers that the annual 
bonus, taking into account the application 
of downward discretion in respect of the 
safety element, and LTIP outcomes, are 
a fair reflection of the wider business 
performance for the 2023 financial year and 
over the longer term. These outcomes are 
aligned to the shareholder experience. 

Further information about the levels of 
executive remuneration earned in 2023, 
including details of performance against 
the relevant targets for both bonus 
and LTIP, is given on pages 139-145.
Remuneration in 2024
Base salary
At Mondi, the philosophy is to pay our 
executive directors a total remuneration 
package that attracts and retains the best 
people, with salaries intended to be fair 
and well positioned to the external market 
and the wider workforce. 

Acknowledging the need for appropriate 
restraint for executive directors, Andrew King 
and Mike Powell’s base salaries were 
increased by 2.5% to £1,100,338 and £701,613 
respectively, effective from 1 January 2024. 
These were in line with, or below the 
increases applied to the wider UK workforce 
(typically 2.5% to 5%). As part of determining 
the salary increases for our executive 
directors, the committee was updated 
and received a report on the pay and pay 
practices for both senior management 
and the wider workforce across all 
of Mondi's key markets.

The committee considers that the salaries 
for the executive directors are appropriate 
for a global organisation of Mondi’s size 
and complexity.

Executive director pay and the 
wider workforce 
Every year, the committee is presented 
with an analysis of pay practices and 
incentives across the Group. This review 
extends across the global workforce in 
all geographies and business units, and 
includes details of the discretionary 
pay increases being applied to senior 
management and the wider workforce. 
The majority of Mondi employees’ pay is 
negotiated under local collective bargaining 
agreements, details of which are shared 
with the committee. This workforce salary 
review ensures the committee understands 
the wider workforce pay and practices. 
This discussion precedes the consideration 
of the discretionary pay increases for the 
executive directors. The committee is well 
positioned when determining executive 
director pay, to take into account reward 
for the wider workforce and all other 
relevant information. 

The key difference in the remuneration 
of executive directors and employees 
in general is the proportion of the 
remuneration package that is performance 
related and 'at-risk'. The variable pay, 
delivered under the short- and long-term 
incentive plans is higher for executive 
directors. The remuneration is also realised 
over an extended time horizon.

The Board has designated a non-executive 
director, Sue Clark, responsible for 
engaging with employees and reporting 
back to the Board on the relevant insights 
and discussions. During these discussions 
a variety of subjects were discussed, not 
limited to remuneration-related topics. 
The views of employees, shared with the 
Board, contribute to the wider discussions 
of the committee. We will continue to 
engage with employees, both formally and 
informally, to bring their views to the Board 
and the Remuneration Committee.

For further details on wider employee 
engagement, see pages 92-93. 

Special dividend and share 
consolidation
Over the course of 2023, we completed 
the sale of all our Russian assets following 
the Board's decision to exit Russia. 
Following approval by shareholders, the net 
proceeds from the sale were distributed to 
shareholders on 13 February 2024 by way 
of a special dividend of €1.60 per share, 
with an associated share consolidation 
taking effect on 29 January 2024. Further 
information can be found on page 216.

It was agreed by the committee that 
participants in the Bonus Share Plan (BSP) 
and LTIP would not receive the special 
dividend on unvested share awards, and 
that the share consolidation would not 
apply to their unvested awards/options. 
This meant that there were no adjustments 
to the number of shares these participants 
may acquire under their current awards/
options, keeping the overall value of their 
awards/options at a broadly similar level. 

Shareholder engagement
In 2023, our Board continued to engage 
with a cross-section of shareholders on 
developments and external expectations 
relating to executive pay. Early in the year, 
we consulted with shareholders and proxy 
agencies in relation to our revised DRP 
and its implementation. This engagement 
continued throughout the year. Feedback 
from investors is welcome and has been 
carefully considered by the Remuneration 
Committee in determining the structure 
and operation of our remuneration policy.

Conclusion
I should like to thank you for the 
constructive feedback and strong support 
you gave at last year's AGM for our DRP 
and implementation of the policy. I very 
much hope that you will continue to give 
your support to the remuneration resolution 
proposed at the 2024 AGM.

Finally, I should like to thank my fellow 
committee members for their support 
throughout the year.

Key decisions concerning directors' remuneration

Conclusion of DRP, following 
shareholder consultation
Further to the consultation with our key 
shareholders and proxy agencies, our 
revised DRP was taken to shareholders 
and strongly supported at the 2023 AGM.

Impact of the fatality on 2023 annual 
bonus outcomes
As a consequence of the fatality that 
occurred during the year, the committee 
determined that a downward adjustment 
of three percentage points to the annual 
bonus outcome for the executive directors 
and the wider Group Executive Committee 
was appropriate.

Vesting of 2021 LTIP award 
As part of determining the vesting 
outcomes, the committee considered the 
formulaic outturns in the context of Mondi's 
wider business performance. 

Review of executive director salaries
Andrew King and Mike Powell's base 
salaries increased by 2.5% on 1 January 
2024. These increases were in line with, 
or below the increases applied to the wider 
UK workforce (typically 2.5% to 5%).

2024 LTIP targets
The committee considered the impact 
of the sale of the Russian operations on 
the ROCE target range, and the impact 
of the share consolidation on EPS targets 
(page 130).

Return of net proceeds from disposal 
of Russian assets
It was agreed by the committee that 
participants in the BSP and LTIP would 
not receive the special dividend on 
unvested awards, and that the share 
consolidation would not apply to their 
unvested awards/options.

Determination of remuneration for 
new Executive Committee roles
The remuneration structure and quantum 
were determined and approved for the 
CEO Uncoated Fine Paper, following an 
internal promotion, and the new Chief 
People Officer, joining Mondi in April 2024. 

Review of non-executive director fees
No increases are being applied to 
non-executive directors, in respect 
of base fees, committee Chair fees, 
the attendance fee outside country 
of residence (per meeting) or any 
other supplemental fees.

Underlying EBITDA provides a measure 
of the cash-generating ability of the business 
that is comparable from year to year.
ROCE provides a measure of the efficient 
and effective use of capital in our operations.
Reflects the strategic importance of progress 
towards our MAP2030 framework.
One of the key indicators of whether the 
business is meeting its sustainability goal 
of zero harm.
One of our key Taking action on Climate 
indicators in our MAP2030 framework.
One of our key circular driven solution 
indicators in our MAP2030 framework.
An indicator of the contribution and impact 
that each executive director is making to the 
overall success of the management team.

Targets and ranges are set each year by 
the committee taking account of required 
progress towards strategic goals, and the 
prevailing market conditions.

Both lead and lag targets are set each year by 
the committee, based on the specific priorities 
in our MAP2030 framework.

The committee considers input from the 
Sustainable Development Committee, and sets 
appropriate standards and goals to reduce waste 
and GHG emissions.

Targets are set each year by the committee, 
based on the specific priorities, milestones 
and areas of responsibility of the role.

Targets for the annual bonus will be disclosed collectively in next year’s report as the committee considers the financial targets 
to be commercially sensitive. Half of any bonus earned in respect of 2024 performance will be paid out in cash and the other half 
will be deferred into shares for three years as nil cost options.

Long-Term Incentive Plan (LTIP) for 2024
LTIP awards that are to be made in 2024 will be assessed against three performance measures: ROCE, TSR and EPS, weighted 50%, 
25% and 25% respectively and measured over the three-year performance period commencing on 1 January 2024. The awards will be 
subject to a two-year holding period from the date of vesting. The committee’s intention is to grant at the level of 230% of base salary 
and 210% of base salary for Andrew King and Mike Powell respectively. The committee continues to exercise restraint by granting awards 
below the policy maxima.

Metric
Average 3-year ROCE (50%)

TSR, relative to a peer group of competitors 
(25%)

Basic underlying EPS, measured on a 
3-year cumulative basis (25%)

Why chosen?
A key indicator of the 
efficient and effective use 
of capital.
TSR measures the total 
returns to Mondi’s 
shareholders, so provides 
close alignment with 
shareholder interests.
A key growth measure that 
represents the bottom-line 
return and provides a 
balance to the ROCE 
and TSR metrics.

How targets are set
The committee sets threshold and stretch levels, aligned 
to the Group’s strategic targets. ROCE targets for the LTIP 
are detailed on the next page.
The committee sets the performance requirements for each 
grant. A bespoke peer group of packaging and paper sector 
companies is used. TSR targets with respect to the LTIP 
are detailed on the next page.

EPS targets are set in the context of the long-term financial 
plan, reflecting basic underlying EPS. The EPS figures for 
each year in the performance period are added together 
to form a cumulative 3-year target.

Between threshold and maximum, the LTIP awards will vest on a straight-line basis. 

In setting the targets for the 2024 LTIP, the committee noted that the Russian operations had typically contributed approximately an 
additional 300 basis points towards ROCE. The committee determined that the threshold ROCE performance level should be maintained 
at 12% and the stretch performance level should be set at 16%. This adjustment of 200 basis points does not fully reflect the lost 
contribution from the Russian assets. Therefore the committee considers the 16% ROCE target to be stretching. 

The EPS targets are considered to be stretching in a macroeconomic environment going into 2024 that remains challenging.

The TSR peer group for the 2024 LTIP awards consists of the following companies. These are peers who are subject to broadly the same 
market forces and trading environment as Mondi.

Remuneration report
Directors’ Remuneration Policy 

This part of the Directors’ Remuneration Report sets out the Directors’ Remuneration Policy (DRP) for the Group and has been prepared 
in accordance with The Large and Medium-sized Companies and Groups (Accounts and Reports) Regulations 2008 (as amended). 

Remuneration Policy principles
Mondi’s approach is that remuneration should underpin the Group’s strategy. The remuneration is intended to attract, incentivise and retain 
high calibre individuals.

The committee considers the principles set out in Provision 40 of the UK Corporate Governance Code when determining the design, 
implementation and assessment of remuneration. 

Simplicity

Clarity

Risk

Predictability

Proportionality

Alignment to Culture

We operate a simple remuneration structure of fixed pay + short-term incentive + long-term incentive, 
avoiding undue complexity or the potential to deliver unintended outcomes.
The committee is committed to transparency regarding the components of the remuneration structure, 
the potential outcome and the rationale for the quantum of awards made. The choice of metrics and the 
targets set for the assessment of performance under our variable pay plans underpin the overall strategy.
The remuneration structure and the variable pay plans reflect the risk appetite set by the Board. 
The performance measures, and the targets set, do not encourage inappropriate behaviours or excessive 
risk-taking. Holding periods are in place for the LTIP. Mitigation is provided through the application 
of market practice aligned recovery provisions (both malus and clawback). The committee also retains 
discretion to override formulaic vesting outcomes, where pay outcomes do not reflect the wider business 
performance. The post-employment Minimum Shareholding Requirement (MSR) has been extended such 
that 100% of the in-employment shareholding guideline must be held for two years post-employment, 
further promoting the delivery of sustainable share price performance.  

The committee is confident that the remuneration structure and its operation are well understood 
by participants, including potential outcomes driven by performance levels achieved.
The potential outcomes under the remuneration structure at threshold, target and maximum performance 
levels have been assessed and are understood. The committee carefully considers the targets set for the 
variable pay elements to ensure reward is appropriately linked to performance and to minimise the risk 
of excessive outturns. The annual bonus and LTIP outturns are at the discretion of the committee.
The committee considers that the remuneration strategy supports the wider strategy. The approach to pay 
positioning, pension contribution levels and variable pay participation is applied consistently and underpins 
the Mondi Group values.

Remuneration policy for executive directors compared to other employees
The remuneration of the executive directors is higher than that of senior management and the wider workforce of the Group, reflecting 
their market value. Salaries are paid fairly in relation to the market value of the role, recognising local markets and collective bargaining 
agreements for the wider workforce. Executive salary increases are made in line with, or below those of the wider Mondi plc workforce, 
taking into account salary increases across the wider Mondi Group. Pensions and benefits are offered to employees across the Group 
according to the country, and the seniority of the role. The senior management participate in an annual cash bonus on similar terms to 
the executive directors in terms of structure and metrics. The majority of the wider workforce participate in an annual bonus programme.

The main difference between the structure of reward for executive directors and employees in general is the proportion of the total 
remuneration that is at risk and subject to performance. Executive directors and the most senior management participate in the LTIP, 
in addition to the annual bonus.

approved by shareholders on 4 May 2023 at the 2023 AGM. Awards made prior to the approval of this policy remain subject to the 
prevailing approved policy at grant.

Base salary

Purpose and link to strategy To recruit and reward executives of a suitable calibre for the role and duties required. 

Operation

Performance measures

Maximum opportunity

Ordinarily reviewed annually by the committee, taking account of a number of factors including (but not limited 
to) Group and individual performance, the skills and experience of the individual and changes in role scope 
and responsibilities. The committee also takes into consideration the levels of increase for the broader 
employee population.
Reference is also made to remuneration levels in companies of similar size and complexity to Mondi. 
The committee considers the impact of any base salary increase on the total remuneration package. 
Salaries (and other elements of the remuneration package) may be paid in different currencies as appropriate 
to reflect their geographic location.
Whilst no formal performance conditions apply, an individual’s performance in role is taken into account when 
determining any salary increase.
There is no prescribed maximum base salary or annual increase. 
However, increases will normally not exceed the general level of increase awarded in the UK or the location 
in which the executive is based (in percentage of salary terms). On occasion a higher increase may be awarded 
in appropriate circumstances, for example:
– on promotion or development in role or change in responsibilities of the individual;
– where an individual has been appointed to the Board at lower than typical market salary to allow for growth 
in the role, in which case larger increases may be awarded to move salary positioning to a typical market 
level as the individual gains experience; 

– change in size and/or complexity of the Group; and/or 
– significant market movement.

Benefits

Purpose and link to strategy To provide market competitive benefits.

Pension

The Group typically provides:
– car allowance or company car;
– medical insurance;
– death and disability insurance;
– limited and specific personal taxation and financial advice; and
– other ancillary benefits based on individual circumstances, including relocation and assistance with expatriate 

expenses.

Other benefits may be introduced from time to time to ensure the benefits package is appropriately 
competitive and reflects the circumstances of the individual director.
Not applicable.

While the committee has not set an absolute maximum on the level of benefits executive directors may 
receive, the value is set at a level which the committee considers to be appropriately positioned taking into 
account relevant market levels based on the nature and location of the role, and individual circumstances.

Purpose and link to strategy To provide market competitive pension contributions or allowances.

Operation

Defined contribution to pension, or cash allowance of equivalent value. Only base salary is pensionable.

Performance measure

Not applicable.

Maximum opportunity

Executive directors receive a company contribution and/or equivalent cash allowance not exceeding the contribution 
available to the majority of the workforce in the relevant country (currently 8% of salary for the UK workforce).

Benefits under any non-UK pension arrangement may be provided in accordance with the terms of the applicable scheme.

shareholders through a deferred component.
Awards are based on annual performance against stretching financial and non-financial targets. Targets are 
reviewed annually and any pay-out is determined by the committee after the year end based on targets set for 
the financial period. For 2024, the table on page 129 provides details of performance metrics, weightings, the 
rationale and how targets are set.
The policy gives the committee the authority to select suitable performance metrics, aligned to Mondi’s strategy 
and shareholders’ interests, and to assess the performance outcome. 
The committee has discretion to amend the pay-out should any formulaic output not reflect the committee’s 
assessment of overall business performance, or if the committee considers the formulaic outturn is not 
appropriate in the context of other factors considered by the committee to be relevant.  
Ordinarily, half of the award is delivered in cash and half is deferred into a conditional share award or a nil 
(or nominal) cost option which normally vests following a three-year service period. Any dividend equivalents 
accruing on shares between the date when the award was granted and when it vests, will be delivered in shares.
Malus and clawback provisions apply (page 134).

Performance is normally assessed against a balanced scorecard of metrics as determined by the committee from time 
to time, such as underlying EBITDA, ROCE and sustainability. Individual performance may also be assessed against 
suitable objectives aligned to the delivery of Mondi’s strategy. The majority of the bonus is assessed against 
quantifiable financial and science-based sustainability measures, with over 50% assessed against financial targets.
The on-target bonus, as a percentage of maximum, has been reduced from 53% to 50% for non-financial targets, 
aligned to the approach for financial targets for performance awards made in, and after 2023. Subject to the 
committee’s discretion to override formulaic outturns, for financial measures and non-financial measures, no more 
than 25% of maximum is earned for threshold performance, 50% of maximum is earned for on-target performance 
and 100% of maximum is earned for maximum performance.
The maximum annual bonus opportunity for executive directors is 200% of base salary.
The committee retains discretion to set the actual maximum below the policy maximum.

alignment with shareholders through the use of shares.
The committee may grant awards annually as conditional shares or as nil (or nominal) cost options. 
Awards will usually vest to the extent that performance conditions are met, typically measured over three years. 
A two-year post-vesting holding period normally applies to LTIP shares that vest (net of tax). The two-year 
holding requirement will normally continue if the director leaves employment during the holding period or is 
permitted to retain any part of the award as a good leaver. The shares held will count towards the executive 
director’s normal shareholding requirement. For 2024, the tables on pages 129 to 130 provide details of 
performance metrics, weightings, the rationale and how targets are set.
The committee has discretion to vary the formulaic vesting outturn if it considers that the outturn does not 
reflect the committee’s assessment of performance or is not appropriate in the context of other factors 
considered by the committee to be relevant. 
Dividend equivalents will accrue to the first date shares can be acquired and will be delivered in shares, based 
on the proportion of the award that vests. 
Under the plan rules, in exceptional circumstances, the committee has the ability to cash-settle awards, if 
necessary. There is no current intention for awards for the executive directors to be delivered in this way.
Malus and clawback provisions apply (page 134).
Performance measures and targets are set each year by the committee, before the grant. The committee 
annually reviews the performance measures, and in line with the rules of the LTIP, reserves the right to change 
the measures and/or set different targets for future grants to ensure they remain appropriately challenging 
in the prevailing economic environment.  
Performance measures under the LTIP will be based on financial measures (which may include, but not be 
limited to, total shareholder return, return on capital employed, and earnings per share) and may include 
non-financial measures (such as ESG measures). For awards granted in 2024, metrics comprise ROCE 
(50% weighting), relative TSR (25% weighting) and cumulative EPS (25% weighting).
Subject to the committee’s discretion to override formulaic outturns, no more than 25% of the awards will 
vest at threshold performance, increasing to 100% for maximum performance.
The maximum award level under the LTIP in respect of any financial year is 250% of base salary.

Share ownership policy

Purpose and link to strategy To further align the interests of executive directors with those of shareholders.

Operation

The Minimum Shareholding Requirement (MSR) for the CEO is 300% of base salary and 250% for the CFO. 
On appointment, an executive director is normally required to meet the MSR within five years from the date of 
appointment.
While the executive director is building to the required shareholding level, deferred bonus awards under the BSP, net 
of the expected tax liability, will count towards the requirement. Once the required shareholding has been met, such 
shares will not count unless the committee, at its sole discretion, determines that a number of deferred shares may 
count towards the holding requirement of a director.
Unvested LTIP awards (i.e. those awards where performance targets and/or a service requirement must still be met 
for awards to vest) will not count towards the holding requirement. LTIP shares that have vested and on which tax has 
been paid and that are within the two-year post-vesting holding period will count towards the holding requirement.
Previously compliant directors who do not meet the minimum requirement on annual assessment are normally 
expected to achieve compliance by 31 December of the same year.
The executive directors are entitled to participate in the Company's all-employee share plans on the same basis 
as all other employees.
Post-employment MSR:
A post-employment shareholding requirement applies. Under the policy, executive directors will be expected 
to retain a shareholding for two-years post-employment. 
For both years post-employment, the full in-employment MSR level applies. New executive directors who have not 
achieved the necessary in-employment MSR level at date of exit, will be required to retain the actual level of shares 
held at date of exit. 
In order to allow the committee to deal with unexpected circumstances, the committee retains discretion on how 
to operate the policy and may make exceptions and allowances as it sees fit.

Recovery provisions (Malus and Clawback)
The committee may operate malus and clawback (i) for a period of three years from the payment of the BSP cash award or (ii) until the date 
of release for BSP share awards, and for a period of three years following the vesting date of LTIP awards.
The malus and clawback provisions for the BSP and LTIP are set out in the rules for each plan but, in summary, may be applied in the event of:
– misstatement of financial results;
– error or misstatement of performance;
– gross or serious misconduct;
– corporate failure;
– severe downturn in financial or operational performance; or 
– severe reputational damage.
Committee discretion
The committee, consistent with market practice, retains discretion over a number of areas relating to the operation and administration of the DRP. 
These include (but are not limited to) the following:
– who participates in the incentive plans;
– the timing of award grants and/or payments;
– the size of an award and/or a payment (within the limits set out in the DRP table on pages 132 to 134);
– the choice and weighting of performance metrics (in accordance with the statements made in the DRP table on pages 132 to 134); 
– in exceptional circumstances, determining that any share-based award (or any dividend equivalent) shall be settled (in full or in part) in cash;
– discretion relating to the measurement of performance and pro-rating for time for LTIP awards in the event of a change of control or 

restructuring;

– determination of a good leaver (in addition to any specified categories) for incentive plan purposes based on the rules of each plan and the 

appropriate treatment in such circumstances;

– determining the extent of payment or vesting of an award based on the assessment of any performance conditions, including discretion 

as to the basis on which performance is to be measured if an award vests in advance of normal timetable (on cessation of employment as 
a good leaver or on the occurrence of a corporate event) and whether (and to what extent) pro-ration shall apply in such circumstances;

– whether (and to what extent) malus and/or clawback shall apply to any award;
– adjustments required in certain circumstances (e.g. rights issues, corporate restructuring, on a change of control and special dividends); and
– the ability to adjust existing performance conditions for exceptional events so that they can still fulfil their original purpose whilst being 

no less stretching.

Remuneration report
Directors’ Remuneration Policy continued

Remuneration policy for executive directors compared to the wider workforce
The remuneration policy for executive directors reflects the different levels of responsibility and market practices. The key difference 
to the remuneration of the wider workforce is the proportion of remuneration that is 'at risk'. For senior roles, a higher proportion of the 
remuneration package is comprised of variable pay which drives an increased emphasis on pay for performance. Only a small number 
of the most senior colleagues participate in the LTIP and the BSP. Participation in these plans is focused on those individuals who have 
the greatest accountability for the performance of the Group.

Directors' contracts and notice periods
Executive Directors 
Andrew King's and Mike Powell's service contracts provide for termination on one year’s notice by either party. The Group may elect 
to make a payment in lieu of notice and, if it does so, to apply mitigation. Payment in lieu of notice would comprise base salary, benefits 
and pension contributions for the notice period (or, if applicable, the balance of the notice period).

A director’s service contract may be terminated without notice and without any further payment or compensation, except for sums 
accrued up to the date of termination, on the occurrence of certain events such as gross misconduct.

Non-executive directors
All non-executive directors have letters of appointment with Mondi plc for an initial period of three years. In accordance with best 
practice, non-executive directors are subject to annual re-election at the Annual General Meeting. Appointments may be terminated 
by either party with six months’ notice. No compensation is payable on termination, other than accrued fees and expenses. 

Service contracts for new appointments
Normally, for any new executive director appointments, the Group’s policy is that the service contracts should provide for one year’s 
notice by either party. The contract would provide that, in the event of termination by the company, other than for ‘cause’, the executive 
would be eligible for payment of the base salary, pension contribution and benefits in respect of the unexpired portion of the 12-month 
notice period.

The committee would take account of the remuneration and contract features that the executive may be forgoing or relinquishing 
in order to join Mondi, in comparison with the overall remuneration package that Mondi is able to offer.

The committee may consider compensating a newly-appointed executive director for other relevant contractual rights forfeited when 
leaving their previous employer and/or remuneration foregone as a result of leaving their previous employer.

Approach to remuneration on recruitment
The appointment of high calibre executives to the Board, whether by internal promotion or external recruitment is important for the 
success of the Group. The remuneration package for a newly appointed executive director would be set in accordance with the prevailing 
approved remuneration policy at the time of appointment. Base salary would be set at an appropriate level taking into consideration the 
skills and experiences of the individual, the complexity of the role and the individual's current remuneration. The variable pay would be 
considered consistent with that of existing executive directors and would be subject to the maximum limits of the policy. Certain relocation 
expenses may be met, as appropriate.

For an internal appointment, any existing pay components awarded in respect of the prior role would be allowed to pay out in accordance 
with the terms of the award.

For external appointments, the committee may offer additional cash and/or share-based payments to replace any variable pay awards an 
individual may have forgone to join Mondi, if it considers these to be in the best interests of the Group and its shareholders. This includes 
awards made under Section 9.4.2 of the UK Listing Rules. Any such payments would take account of the remuneration forgone including 
the nature of the award, the time horizons and any performance conditions attached to the award. The key terms and an explanation 
of the rationale for such a component would be disclosed in the remuneration report for the relevant year.

Depending on the timing of the appointment, the committee may consider it appropriate to set different annual performance conditions 
for the first performance year of appointment.  An LTIP award may be made shortly after appointment, or as soon as practical following 
a closed period.

Mondi Group Integrated report and financial statements 2023

Policy on loss of office
Notice periods will not normally exceed 12 months. The Group may elect to make a payment in lieu of notice as determined by the 
respective contract of employment, taking account of local employment law, and, if it does, to apply mitigation. The committee reserves 
the right to make any other payments in connection with an executive director’s cessation of office or employment where the payments 
are made in good faith in discharge of an existing legal obligation (or by way of damages for breach of such an obligation) or by way of 
settlement of any claim arising in connection with the cessation of a director’s office or employment. Any such payments may include but 
are not limited to paying any fees for outplacement assistance and/or the director’s legal and/or professional advice fees in connection 
with their cessation of office or employment.

The Group would seek to apply the principles of mitigation to any payment in lieu of notice by, for example, making payments in 
instalments that can be reduced or ended if the former executive wishes to commence alternative employment during the payment 
period. An executive director’s eligibility for bonus on cessation of employment will be determined by the committee in accordance with 
the relevant plan rules, taking into account the reason for their departure and prevailing local legislation. Where eligible, the departing 
director’s bonus would typically be determined in the normal way after the relevant year end, i.e. based on the applicable performance 
conditions, pro-rated for the period worked in that year, save that no portion would be required to be deferred into a BSP award. 
However, the committee has the discretion to apply different treatment. Any share-based entitlements granted to an executive director 
under the Group’s share plans will be determined based on the relevant plan rules. The default treatment is that any outstanding 
awards lapse on cessation of employment. However, in certain prescribed circumstances, such as death, disability, retirement or other 
circumstances at the discretion of the committee (taking into account the individual’s performance and the reasons for their departure) 
‘good leaver’ status can be applied. For good leavers, vesting of BSP awards is accelerated to as soon as practical after employment 
termination (as they are not subject to performance conditions). Typically, LTIP awards remain subject to performance conditions 
(measured over the original time period) and are reduced pro rata to reflect the proportion of the performance period actually served. 
The committee has the discretion to apply different treatment (including to disapply the application of performance conditions and/or 
time pro rating) if it considers it appropriate to do so. However, it is envisaged that this would only be applied in exceptional 
circumstances. Post-vesting holding periods will normally continue to apply, notwithstanding any cessation of employment. 

Statement of consideration of employment conditions elsewhere in the Group
The remuneration of the executive directors and other senior colleagues is set, taking into appropriate account the pay, pay practices 
and employment conditions of the wider workforce, on which the committee receives regular detailed updates. In determining the 
proposed salary increases for the executive directors and individuals within the remit of the committee, the committee is well positioned 
to consider the wider workforce increases as part of their decision-making.

There is no formal consultation with employees on the DRP; however, employees are encouraged to provide feedback, on remuneration 
and wider topics, across a number of channels. A purposeful workplace is a key theme of MAP2030 and understanding the views of our 
employees to address the things that matter to them is at the core.  

During the year we completed our latest Group-wide Employee Survey, conducted every two years. The Board received reports on the 
results of our Employee Survey, the issues raised and the follow-up actions being taken, giving the Board an insight into how employees 
feel about the culture of the Group and particular areas that may need addressing. The results were used to calculate our Purposeful 
Workplace, Inclusiveness and Wellbeing scores, which provide the Board with an objective way to assess employee views. These 
activities provide targeted insights and create further opportunities to engage with our global workforce.

During 2023, Sue Clark, our NED responsible for understanding the views of employees, participated in Mondi's annual European 
Communication Forum meeting, alongside representatives from our European plant network. She also engaged with a cross-section 
of employees during a number of site visits, more details of which can be found on page 94.

Over the course of the year, a session was run where the Remuneration Committee Chair engaged with employees from most of the 
countries we operate in to discuss the role and responsibility of the Board at Mondi, and specifically the role of the Remuneration 
Committee. Employees had the opportunity, and were encouraged, to ask questions and share their views.

The Board receives feedback from these, and other activities, to better understand the experience of a Mondi employee and to support 
their decision making. 

Statement of consideration of shareholder views
The committee takes into account the views of shareholders in the formulation of the Directors' Remuneration Policy and the 
implementation of the policy. In early 2023 we consulted with our major shareholders as part of the process of updating our DRP 
which shareholders voted in favour of at our 2023 AGM. Over the course of the year, the Chair, the Remuneration Committee Chair 
and executive directors engaged with shareholders on a number of matters including remuneration with feedback presented to the 
Board. Feedback received from shareholders at the Annual General Meeting is also considered. In the event that either the DRP 
or implementation resolutions receive a significant proportion of votes against, the committee will seek to engage further with 
shareholders to understand better the reasons for their voting decision. 

Legacy arrangements 
For the avoidance of doubt, in approving this policy report, authority is given to the Group to honour any commitments entered into 
with current or former directors that have been disclosed to shareholders in previous remuneration reports. Details of any payments 
to former directors will be set out in the annual report on remuneration as they arise.

Mondi’s TSR performance over the last ten years 
The following graph sets out the comparative TSR of Mondi plc relative to the FTSE 100 Index, for the period between 31 December 
2013 and 31 December 2023. The FTSE-All-Share Index had been used in previous reports. Mondi plc is a constituent of the FTSE 100 
Index, which is why this index was considered a more appropriate Index for this report. 

Total shareholder return – Mondi vs FTSE 100

Included in this column are accommodation costs, car allowance, life and health cover. For Andrew King, this figure also includes accommodation costs in Vienna for his 
business travel of £48,614, a total of £32,454 for UK, South African and Austrian tax advice benefit, a total tax equalisation and other benefit gross-ups of £146,221 and a car 
allowance of £19,300. For Mike Powell, this figure includes tax advice benefit of £21,962, a total tax equalisation and other benefit gross-ups of £24,955 and a car allowance 
of £19,300.The column 'Other' shows matching SIP shares.

2 This is the total annual bonus amount awarded in respect of the financial year 2023, and includes both the upfront cash element and the deferred share award (pages 140 to 143).
3 For 2023, the three-year performance cycle of the 2021 LTIP ended on 31 December 2023 and the awards will vest in Q1 2024 and be subject to a two-year post vesting 
holding period until 2026. The award value (including equivalent dividends on LTIP shares due to vest in March 2024 set out on page 144) shown is based on the average 
share price over the last three months of the financial year ended 31 December 2023 of £13.98. The 2021 LTIP awards were granted on 12 March 2021, when the share price 
was £17.66. This equated to a decrease in value of £3.68 per share. As a consequence a zero gain is shown. Andrew’s and Mike's loss due to share price depreciation was 
£290,036 and £168,864 respectively. 

4 In the 2022 remuneration report, the value of the 2020 LTIP awards vesting for which the three-year performance cycle ended on 31 December 2022 was calculated using 

the average share price for the three months ended 31 December 2022, being £14.78 (including equivalent dividends on LTIP shares vested in March 2023). The actual share 
price on vesting was £14.17. The award values for 2022 have been restated on this basis.  Andrew King's award was granted on 11 May 2020, when the share price was 
£15.85. This equated to a decrease in value of £1.68 per share. As a consequence a zero gain is shown for Andrew King. Andrew’s loss due to share price depreciation was 
£118,332 (excluding dividend equivalents). As disclosed in the 2020 remuneration report, Mike Powell’s 2020 LTIP award was granted on 2 December 2020, with a grant share 
price of £13.88, in respect of incentives forgone as a result of leaving his former employer. This equated to an increase in value of £0.29 per share. 

5 Svein Richard Brandtzaeg, Anke Groth, Saki Macozoma and Dominique Reiniche received tax advice in the year, constituting taxable benefits to the gross values shown 

in this column.

6 Anke Groth was appointed as non-executive director on 1 April 2023. The 2023 figures reflect her remuneration as a non-executive director from 1 April 2023 

to 31 December 2023.

7 None of the non-executive directors have entitlements to pension-related benefits. Pension benefits of 8% of salary respectively are delivered as pension contribution 

of £8,500 and cash allowance of £77,380 to Andrew King and as cash allowance of £54,760 to Mike Powell.

The majority of the 2023 annual bonus was assessed against financial measures; underlying EBITDA and ROCE. 

The sustainability scorecard includes safety (10/20), reduction in GHG emissions (5/20) and elimination of waste to landfill (WtL) (5/20) measures. 

The safety element of the scorecard includes lead and lag indicators: 

– Five points relate to the achievement of lead indicators. This is reflective of Mondi’s values and proactive approach to safety. 

This is a shared objective requiring individual involvement of all members of the Executive Committee. All the individual activities must 
be completed by the Executive Committee members to achieve the five points. If all the activities in their entirety are not achieved, 
then these five points lapse in full for all. 

– A further five points relate to the lag indicator, assessed against an annually defined Total Recordable Case Rate. In the event of any 
work-related fatality, the Remuneration Committee makes an assessment on a case-by-case basis and will utilise its discretion to 
adjust any pay-outs under the bonus, if appropriate. 

The remaining 20 points of the annual bonus are assessed against personal objectives (pages 142-143).

Financial and Sustainability elements and outcomes of the 2023 annual bonus (audited):
Threshold levels of performance were not met for either of the financial metrics, resulting in 0% of these elements being achieved.

The performance against the sustainability scorecard was partially achieved. While the waste to landfill target was achieved, contributing 
5% to the bonus outturn, the GHG emissions target was not and this element of the bonus was forfeited. These outcomes contributed 
to 5% out of a maximum of 10% to the bonus.

Performance against the safety lead and lag indicators would have resulted in the full 10% of the bonus being achieved.  The Executive 
Committee individually and collectively achieved all of the lead indicators, aimed at reinforcing safety as our highest priority, and our 
Social Psychology of Risk approach.

There was a work-related fatality in 2023 at the Ružomberok mill in Slovakia. The Remuneration Committee and Sustainable Development 
Committee independently reviewed the detailed investigation report of the incident and agreed with the findings. After careful deliberation 
and discussion, the Remuneration Committee concluded that a downward adjustment of three percentage points of the lag indicator metric 
was appropriate. This resulted in 60% of the lag indicator metric being forfeited.

The committee reviewed performance against the targets of each scorecard measure. In addition, the overall bonus outturn was 
considered in the context of the wider performance of the Group. In challenging markets, strong cash flow was delivered and excellent 
progress was made against strategic objectives. The progress of long-term investment projects will ensure that Mondi is well-positioned 
for a sustainable future. 

As a consequence of the circumstances of the fatality, the committee applied its discretion and a three percentage points downward 
adjustment to the bonus outcome was made. Overall, the committee considers that annual bonus outturns for Andrew and Mike of 29% 
and 30% of maximum respectively, are a fair reflection of the performance of the business and their individual performance against 
personal objectives.

In accordance with our DRP, 50% of the bonuses earned are paid in cash, the remaining 50% is deferred into shares which are released 
after three years. No further conditions are attached to these shares, except for being in service at date of vesting.

at 61.25% of maximum against the (equally weighted) relative TSR and ROCE performance conditions, as shown in the table below. 
The committee considered the level of pay-out to be reflective of the overall performance of the Group. No discretion was exercised 
by the committee in determining the vesting outcomes.

1 The three-year average ROCE that was achieved was 17.8% (16.9% in 2021, 23.7% in 2022 and 12.8% in 2023).

Mondi plc achieved a TSR of 2.17%, over the three-year performance period, ranking 8th in the TSR peer group, equivalent to median 
TSR performance and 25% vesting. Therefore 12.50% of the maximum 2021 LTIP award will vest as a result of the TSR performance.

Mondi plc achieved a three-year average ROCE of 17.8%. This resulted in vesting of 97.50% of this element. Therefore 48.75% of the 
maximum 2021 LTIP award will vest as a result of the ROCE performance.

Taking into account both ROCE and TSR performance, in total, 61.25% of the maximum 2021 LTIP award will vest.

The performance conditions, as summarised in the table below, are based on three performance measures – ROCE (50%), TSR, relative 
to a peer group (25%) and cumulative EPS (25%) – measured over a three-year performance period ending on 31 December 2025. 
This combination of metrics provides an appropriate means of aligning the operation of the LTIP with shareholders’ interests and the 
Group’s strategy.

CEO pay ratio
Mondi is not required to report the CEO pay ratio, employing fewer than the threshold 250 people in the UK. However, in line with our 
commitment to fairness and transparency, a voluntary disclosure is being made for the three years 2021, 2022 and 2023. 

The table below sets out the pay ratio of the Group CEO compared to the 25th, 50th (median) and 75th percentile employee, based 
on total remuneration of all permanent Mondi plc employees. A snapshot date of 31 December 2023 was used. This group of employees 
represents less than 1% of our global workforce.

The Option A methodology, where the total annual pay for Mondi plc colleagues is calculated to identify the employee at the median, 
25th and 75th percentile, has been applied. This calculation methodology was selected as being the most accurate way of identifying the 
respective percentiles. No element of remuneration was excluded for the purposes of calculating the CEO pay ratio. The total full-time 
equivalent remuneration for the relevant employees has been calculated based on the amount paid in respect of the financial year 
(unless stated otherwise). The bonus, BSP and LTIP values used are those received during the year ended 31 December 2023. 
Throughout the Group, the approach is that remuneration is fair and market competitive in the context of the talent market for the 
relevant role reflecting local market and other relevant benchmarks. The committee notes the limited comparability of pay ratios across 
companies and sectors, given the diverse range of business models and employee population profiles which exist across the market. 
A significant proportion of the CEO’s total remuneration is delivered in variable remuneration, and particularly via long-term share awards, 
to drive alignment with shareholders. As a result, the pay ratio is strongly influenced by variable pay outcomes, and the share price for 
equity settled awards, and may fluctuate significantly on a year-to-year basis. The ratio has fallen in 2023, as a consequence of the CEO 
pay increase in 2023 being discounted by a third of that applied to the wider workforce, pension levels being aligned to the workforce, 
LTIP and bonus opportunity levels being held and bonus outturns for 2023 being significantly lower than those of the previous two cycles.

Percentage change in directors' remuneration
The table below shows the percentage change in each director’s salary/fees, benefits and bonus between the year ended 31 December 2023 
and the three preceding years, and the average percentage change in the same remuneration over the same period in respect of the 
employees of the listed parent entity and the Group on a full time equivalent basis. 

The Chair fee, NED base fees, the attendance fee for meetings outside the country of residence (per meeting) and all supplemental fees 
were increased by 5%, effective 1 January 2023. A supplemental fee for the role of the NED responsible for understanding the views 
of employees was introduced.

Data for executive directors, joiners and leavers have been excluded in the relevant year. Anke Groth was appointed to the Board during 
the year ended 31 December 2023 and, accordingly, has been excluded from the table above.

1 The number of employees of the listed parent company is substantially less than 1% of the Group and as a consequence any changes to the remuneration of an Executive 

Committee member or a particular single individual, or a change in the profile of the employee group e.g leavers or new hires can have a marked effect on the year-on-year 
comparison. Consequently, the percentage changes may be highly variable. The percentage for the Mondi plc employees reflects a 9% salary increase for 2023, noting that for new 
hires in 2022 Q4, no further increase was applied for 2023.

2 Non UK tax resident non-executive directors receive tax return support. Taxable benefits for plc employees include healthcare, car allowance and SIP matching shares. 

The majority of employees in the Group receive no taxable benefits beyond those provided through the local social security regime. Additional benefits represent less than 
5% of the total remuneration.

3 To provide a meaningful year-on-year comparison, the salaries for Andrew King and Mike Powell were annualised in 2020. Andrew was appointed Group CEO from 

1 April 2020 and Mike Powell joined Mondi on 1 November 2020.

4 Philip Yea was appointed to the Board on 1 April 2020. To enable comparison and to provide meaningful reflection of the annual percentage change, his fees for the year ended 

31 December 2020 have been annualised. The 2020 annualised figure includes a period as NED, prior to being appointed Chair. The 2021 figure represents a full year as Chair.
5 Svein Richard Brandtzaeg and Sue Clark were appointed as non-executive directors on 22 April 2021. Respective fees in the year of appointment have been annualised. Sue 

Clark's 2023 increase includes the introduction of a supplemental fee in relation to the role of the non-executive director responsible for understanding the views 
of employees. Svein Richard Brandtzaeg is not resident in the UK and receives an additional fee for attendance at Board meetings outside his country of residence. 
The increase in taxable benefits in 2023 for Svein Richard Brandtzaeg includes tax advice on the amendment of the 2021/22 UK tax return, 2022/23 UK tax return preparation 
and foreign tax credit claim.

6 Saki Macozoma was appointed as non-executive director on 6 May 2022. To enable comparison and to provide meaningful reflection of the annual percentage change, the 

fees shown for the year ended 31 December 2022 and the taxable benefits are annualised.

7 The percentage change for 2023 for Dominique Reiniche reflects the increases in NED fees and appointment to the role of the SID in May 2023.  The increases in taxable 

benefits for 2023 includes French social security notification review.

8 Dame Angela Strank was appointed as non-executive director on 22 April 2021 and as Chair of the committee in May 2022. Respective fees in the year of appointment have 

been annualised.

9 The percentage change for 2023 for Stephen Young reflects his stepping down from the role of the SID in May 2023.

Statement of directors’ shareholdings and share interests (audited) 
The CEO and CFO are required to build and maintain a Minimum Shareholding Requirement (MSR) equivalent to 300% and 250% of 
base salary respectively. New appointees are required to meet the relevant requirement within five years from appointment. Therefore, 
Andrew King and Mike Powell have until 31 March 2025 and 31 October 2025 to meet their respective shareholding requirements. 
Deferred bonus awards under the BSP (net of tax) and vested LTIP shares that are subject to the two-year post-vesting holding period 
will count towards the holding requirement. As at 31 December 2023, Andrew King exceeded the MSR and Mike Powell, who joined 
Mondi in November 2020, is on track to meet the requirement in the five-year timeframe.

The beneficial and non-beneficial share interests of the directors and their connected persons as at 1 January 2023, and as at 
31 December 2023 were as follows:

1 The shareholding shown at 1 January 2023 includes dividends reinvested into shares, personally by Sue Clark. The shareholding as at 1 January 2023 disclosed in the 2022 
Integrated report (4,000 shares) did not include the shares calculated by dividend reinvestment. The shareholding as at 1 January 2023 has been adjusted to reflect the full 
shareholding, including dividends reinvested.

2 Appointed to the Board on 1 April 2023.

3 A restated shareholding of zero shares at 1 January 2023. The shareholding disclosed in the 2022 Integrated report (500 shares) did not reflect the sale of the entire

There has been no change in the interests of the directors and their connected persons between 31 December 2023 and the date of this 
report other than as a result of the share consolidation which took place on 29 January 2024 and the amounts shown in the footnote to

All-employee share plans (audited)
The Group currently operates one HM Revenue & Customs approved all-employee share plan in the UK (the SIP).

Share Incentive Plan (SIP)
Employees resident in the UK are eligible to participate in the SIP. Contributions of up to £150 per month, are taken from participants’ 
gross salary and used to purchase ordinary shares in Mondi plc each month (partnership shares). Participants receive one matching 
Mondi plc ordinary share free of charge for each share purchased (matching shares). The shares are placed in trust and the matching 
shares are forfeited if participants resign from the Group’s employment within three years. If the shares remain in the trust for at least 
five years, they can be removed free of UK income tax and National Insurance contributions.

Remuneration Committee governance
The Remuneration Committee
The Remuneration Committee is a formal committee of the Board (composition of the Remuneration Committee on page 122). Its remit 
is set out in terms of reference adopted by the Board. A copy of the terms of reference is available on the Group’s website at 
www.mondigroup.com. The committee’s performance against these terms of reference is reviewed on an annual basis and the 
committee is satisfied that it has acted in accordance with its terms of reference during the year.

The primary purposes of the committee, as set out in its terms of reference, are:

– to determine and agree with the Board, the Group’s remuneration policy and the framework of executive and senior management 

remuneration;

– to determine individual remuneration packages within that framework for the executive directors and certain other senior management;

– to determine the remuneration of the Board Chair;

– to determine the targets for any performance-related pay schemes in which the executive directors and senior management of the 

Group participate;

– to oversee the operation of the Group’s share schemes; and.

– to agree the policy on shareholding requirements for executive directors, including post-employment requirements.

No director or other attendee takes part in any discussion regarding his or her personal remuneration.

The committee is authorised to seek information from any director and employee of the Group and to obtain external advice. 
The committee is solely responsible for the appointment of external remuneration advisers and for the approval of their fees and 
other terms. 

Deloitte was appointed by the Remuneration Committee as its independent remuneration consultant with effect from 29 September 2020, 
following a competitive tender process. Total fees paid to Deloitte for providing remuneration advice to the committee were determined 
based on time and materials and amounted to £87,225 for the year ended 31 December 2023 (£161,100 for 2022, which included advice 
for the new DRP). Deloitte also provided other tax and payroll services to the Mondi Group during the year. All advice to the Remuneration 
Committee, received from Deloitte, was objective and independent. Deloitte is a founder member of the Remuneration Consultants 
Group and, as such, voluntarily operates under the Code of Conduct in relation to executive remuneration consulting in the UK.

The committee reviews the appointment of its advisers annually and is satisfied that the advice it receives is objective and independent.

Sums paid to third parties in respect of a director’s services
No consideration was paid or became receivable by third parties for making available the services of any person as a director 
of Mondi plc (‘the Company’), or while a director of the Company, as a director of any of the Company’s subsidiary undertakings, 
or as a director of any other undertaking of which he/she was (while a director of the Company) a director by virtue of the Company’s 
nomination, or otherwise in connection with the management of the Company or any undertaking during the year to 31 December 2023.

Political donations
No political donations were made during 2023, and it is Mondi’s policy not to make such donations.

Auditor
Each of the directors of Mondi plc at the date when this report was approved confirms that:

– so far as each of the directors is aware, there is no relevant audit information of which the Group’s auditor is unaware; and

– each director has taken all the steps that he or she ought to have taken as a director in order to make himself or herself aware 

of any relevant audit information and to establish that the Group’s auditor is aware of that information.

PricewaterhouseCoopers LLP (PwC) has indicated its willingness to continue as auditor of Mondi plc. The Board has decided that 
a resolution to reappoint PwC will be proposed at the Annual General Meeting scheduled to be held on 3 May 2024. 

The reappointment of PwC has the support of the Audit Committee, which will be responsible for determining its audit fee on behalf 
of the directors (see page 112 for more information). 

Note 4 to the financial statements sets out the auditor’s fees, both for audit and non-audit work.
Events occurring after 31 December 2023
Aside from the final ordinary dividend proposed for 2023 (see note 9), there have been the following material reportable events since 
31 December 2023: 

On 5 February 2024, the Group announced the completion of the acquisition of Hinton Pulp mill in Alberta (Canada) from West Fraser 
Timber Co. Ltd (West Fraser) for a total consideration of USD 5 million. The mill has the capacity to produce around 250,000 tonnes 
of pulp per annum and will provide the Group with access to local, high-quality fibre from a well-established wood basket as part of a 
long-term partnership with West Fraser. The Group intends to invest in the mill to improve productivity and sustainability performance 
and, subject to pre-engineering and permitting, expand the facility primarily with a new kraft paper machine which will integrate its paper 
bag operations in the Americas and support future growth.

On 13 February 2024, the Group returned the net proceeds from the sale of the Group's Russian assets to shareholders by way of 
a special dividend of €1.60 per existing ordinary share. In addition, in order to maintain the comparability, so far as possible, of Mondi plc’s 
share price before and after the special dividend, the special dividend was accompanied by a share consolidation, which took effect on 
29 January 2024, resulting in shareholders receiving 10 new ordinary shares for every 11 existing ordinary shares. See notes 9 and 22 for 
further details.

Annual General Meeting
The Annual General Meeting will be held at 10:30 (UK time) on Friday 3 May 2024 at Mercedes-Benz World, Brooklands Drive,

Directors’ responsibility statement

The directors are responsible for preparing the Integrated report and financial statements 2023 in accordance with applicable law 
and regulation. 

Company law requires the directors to prepare financial statements for each financial year. Under that law the directors have prepared 
the Group financial statements in accordance with UK-adopted international accounting standards and the Mondi plc parent company 
financial statements in accordance with United Kingdom Generally Accepted Accounting Practice (United Kingdom Accounting 
Standards, comprising FRS 101 “Reduced Disclosure Framework”, and applicable law). In preparing the Group financial statements, the 
directors have also elected to comply with International Financial Reporting Standards issued by the International Accounting Standards 
Board (IFRSs issued by IASB).

Under company law, the directors must not approve the financial statements unless they are satisfied that they give a true and fair view 
of the state of affairs of the Group and parent company and of the profit or loss of the Group for that period. In preparing the financial 
statements, the directors are required to:

– select suitable accounting policies and then apply them consistently; 

– state whether applicable UK-adopted international accounting standards and IFRSs issued by IASB have been followed for the Group 
financial statements and United Kingdom Accounting Standards, comprising FRS 101, have been followed for the parent company 
financial statements, subject to any material departures disclosed and explained in the financial statements; 

– make judgements and accounting estimates that are reasonable and prudent; and 

– prepare the financial statements on the going concern basis unless it is inappropriate to presume that the Group and parent company 

will continue in business. 

The directors are also responsible for safeguarding the assets of the Group and parent company and hence for taking reasonable steps 
for the prevention and detection of fraud and other irregularities.

The directors are also responsible for keeping adequate accounting records that are sufficient to show and explain the Group’s and 
parent company’s transactions and disclose with reasonable accuracy at any time the financial position of the Group and parent company 
and enable them to ensure that the financial statements and the Remuneration report comply with the Companies Act 2006.

The directors are responsible for the maintenance and integrity of the Group’s website. Legislation in the United Kingdom governing the 
preparation and dissemination of financial statements may differ from legislation in other jurisdictions.

Directors' confirmations
The directors consider that the Integrated report and financial statements 2023, taken as a whole, is fair, balanced and understandable 
and provides the information necessary for shareholders to assess the Group’s and parent company’s position and performance, business 
model and strategy.

Each of the directors, whose names and functions are listed in the Governance section of the Integrated report confirm that, to the best 
of their knowledge:

– the Group financial statements, which have been prepared in accordance with UK-adopted international accounting standards 

and IFRSs issued by IASB, give a true and fair view of the assets, liabilities, financial position and profit of the Group; 

– the parent company financial statements, which have been prepared in accordance with United Kingdom Accounting Standards, 
comprising FRS 101, give a true and fair view of the assets, liabilities and financial position of the Mondi plc parent company; and 

– the Strategic report includes a fair review of the development and performance of the business and the position of the Group 

and parent company, together with a description of the principal risks and uncertainties that they face.

The Directors’ responsibility statement was approved by the Board on 21 February 2024 and is signed on its behalf by:

Independent auditors’ report to the members of Mondi plc

Report on the audit of the financial statements
Opinion
In our opinion:

– Mondi plc’s group financial statements and parent company financial statements (the “financial statements”) give a true and fair view 
of the state of the group’s and of the parent company’s affairs as at 31 December 2023 and of the group’s loss and the group’s cash 
flows for the year then ended;

– the group financial statements have been properly prepared in accordance with UK-adopted international accounting standards 

as applied in accordance with the provisions of the Companies Act 2006;

– the parent company financial statements have been properly prepared in accordance with United Kingdom Generally Accepted Accounting 

Practice (United Kingdom Accounting Standards, including FRS 101 “Reduced Disclosure Framework”, and applicable law); and

– the financial statements have been prepared in accordance with the requirements of the Companies Act 2006.

We have audited the financial statements, included within the Integrated report and financial statements 2023 (the “Integrated Report”), 
which comprise: the consolidated statement of financial position and the Mondi plc parent company balance sheet as at 31 December 
2023; the consolidated income statement, the consolidated statement of comprehensive income, the consolidated statement of cash 
flows and the consolidated and Mondi plc parent company statements of changes in equity for the year then ended; and the notes 
to the financial statements, which include a description of the significant accounting policies.

Our opinion is consistent with our reporting to the Audit Committee.

Basis for opinion
We conducted our audit in accordance with International Standards on Auditing (UK) (“ISAs (UK)”) and applicable law. Our responsibilities 
under ISAs (UK) are further described in the Auditors’ responsibilities for the audit of the financial statements section of our report. 
We believe that the audit evidence we have obtained is sufficient and appropriate to provide a basis for our opinion.

Independence
We remained independent of the group in accordance with the ethical requirements that are relevant to our audit of the financial 
statements in the UK, which includes the FRC’s Ethical Standard, as applicable to listed public interest entities, and we have fulfilled our 
other ethical responsibilities in accordance with these requirements.

To the best of our knowledge and belief, we declare that non-audit services prohibited by the FRC’s Ethical Standard were not provided.

Other than those disclosed in note 4, we have provided no non-audit services to the parent company or its controlled undertakings 
in the period under audit.

Our audit approach
Overview
Audit scope
– We identified one component (2022: three) as an individually significant component, which required an audit of its complete financial 
information due to its financial significance to the group, and a further seven components (2022: five) where we have concluded that 
the component engagement leader is a Key Audit Partner (as defined under ISAs (UK)). These eight components (2022: eight) are 
located in Austria, the Czech Republic, Poland, South Africa, Sweden and Russia (2022: Austria, the Czech Republic, Poland, Russia, 
Slovakia, South Africa and Sweden). We obtained full scope audit reporting from an additional twenty components (2022: nineteen), including 
operating units and treasury operations. An audit of specific financial statement line items was performed at a further ten components 
(2022: five) and group level procedures on selected transactions or balances were performed at four components (2022: three).

– In aggregate, the locations subject to audit procedures represented 77% (2022: 72%) of the group’s revenue and 67% (2022: 76%) 
of the group’s absolute profit before tax adjusted for special items from continuing operations. In addition, we received full scope 
reporting on JSC Mondi Syktyvkar, the main component included in discontinued operations.

Key audit matters
– Divestment of Russian operations (group)

– Audit of the fair value of forestry assets (group)

– Application of hyperinflation accounting related to subsidiaries in Türkiye (group)

– Valuation of property, plant and equipment (group)

– Impairment indicator assessment of the parent company investment in subsidiaries (parent)

Materiality
– Overall group materiality: €35 million (2022: €65 million) based on approximately 5% of profit before tax (‘PBT’) from continuing 
operations adjusted for special items (2022: based on approximately 5% of profit before tax ('PBT') from continuing operations 
adjusted for special items).

– Overall parent company materiality: €47 million (2022: €40 million) based on approximately 1% of total assets.

– Performance materiality: €26 million (2022: €49 million) (group) and €35 million (2022: €30 million) (parent company).

The scope of our audit
As part of designing our audit, we determined materiality and assessed the risks of material misstatement in the financial statements.

Key audit matters
Key audit matters are those matters that, in the auditors’ professional judgement, were of most significance in the audit of the financial 
statements of the current period and include the most significant assessed risks of material misstatement (whether or not due to fraud) 
identified by the auditors, including those which had the greatest effect on: the overall audit strategy; the allocation of resources in the 
audit; and directing the efforts of the engagement team. These matters, and any comments we make on the results of our procedures 
thereon, were addressed in the context of our audit of the financial statements as a whole, and in forming our opinion thereon, and we 
do not provide a separate opinion on these matters.

This is not a complete list of all risks identified by our audit.

Valuation of property, plant and equipment is a new key audit matter this year. Disposal of Personal Care Components ("PCC") (group), 
which was a key audit matter last year, is no longer included because of the disposal being completed in the prior year. Otherwise, 
the key audit matters below are consistent with last year.

Key audit matter
Divestment of Russian operations (group)

How our audit addressed the key audit matter

On 30 June 2023, the group completed the sale of its three 
Russian packaging converting operations to the Gotek Group for 
a cash consideration of RUB 1.6 billion, resulting in cash proceeds 
of €30 million, and a loss on disposal of €46 million. 

Subsequently, on 4 October 2023, the group completed the sale 
of its Syktyvkar mill ‘JSC Mondi Syktyvkar’ and two affiliated 
entities to Sezar Invest LLC (Sezar Invest) for a total cash 
consideration of RUB 80 billion, resulting in cash proceeds 
of €776 million, and a loss on disposal of €710 million.

Given the quantum of the consideration received for the disposal 
of the group’s Russian operations and the associated complexity 
of the accounting for the disposal, we identified a significant audit 
risk in relation to the accuracy of the calculation of the loss on 
disposal, as well as the presentation and disclosure of the various 
elements of the disposal in the financial statements, specifically 
focused on the carrying amount of the net assets disposed and 
the recycling of the foreign currency translation reserve. 
Accordingly, this had a significant effect on our overall audit 
strategy and allocation of resources in the planning for and 
completion of our audit, and was, therefore, determined to 
be a key audit matter.

Refer to notes 28 and 35 of the group financial statements, 
and the Audit Committee’s views set out on page 111.

We tested the loss on disposal calculation by verifying the cash 
received to bank statements, reading the signed sale and purchase 
agreements (“SPAs”), and agreeing the carrying value of the 
Russian businesses prior to disposal to the underlying accounting 
records of the group.

We also tested the associated transaction costs and performed 
a proof of the cumulative translation reserve, which was recycled 
to the consolidated income statement on disposal, to the 
underlying accounting records.

Given the quantum of profits, up to the date of disposal, and 
the net assets disposed of in relation to JSC Mondi Syktyvkar, we 
issued instructions to, and obtained reporting as at and for the 
nine month period ended 30 September 2023 from, a third party 
component auditor in Russia, who audited the assets and liabilities 
of the Syktyvkar mill. We performed oversight procedures (including 
a review, performed remotely, of certain working papers of the 
component audit team) to satisfy ourselves as to the nature, 
timing and extent of the audit procedures performed. We also 
considered potential movements between the component auditor’s 
period end reporting date (30 September 2023) and the date of 
completion of the disposal (4 October 2023) to satisfy ourselves 
that the movement in the net asset position between the two 
dates could not be material.

We considered the adequacy of the group’s disclosures in respect 
of the disposed Russian operations and confirmed the resulting 
loss on disposals had been recorded appropriately.

Based on the procedures performed, we noted no material issues 
from our work.

Key audit matter
Audit of the fair value of forestry assets (group)

The valuation of the group’s forestry assets, amounting to 
€519 million as at 31 December 2023 (2022: €485 million), 
is dependent upon various assumptions that are subject to 
significant estimation, and the fair value gain recorded in 
the year is material.

The most significant assumptions included in the valuation 
model relate to the determination of the estimated net selling 
prices to be applied to the forestry assets, the conversion factor 
used to convert hectares of land under afforestation to tonnes of 
standing timber and the risk premium applied to immature timber, 
alongside any manual adjustments that are made outside the 
underlying model.

The fair value gain in the year ended 31 December 2023 
of €128 million (2022: €169 million), which is recorded in the 
consolidated income statement, has been primarily driven 
by the increase in net selling prices.

Given the quantum of the gain and the estimation inherent 
in the determination of fair value, this was determined to be 
a key audit matter.

Refer to notes 14 and 35, and the Audit Committee’s views set 
out on page 114.

How our audit addressed the key audit matter

We evaluated the group’s valuation model used for calculating 
the fair value of the forestry assets against the criteria in IAS 41, 
‘Agriculture’ and IFRS 13, ‘Fair Value Measurement’.

In assessing the valuation of the forestry assets, our procedures 
(which were performed by our component team in South Africa, 
with oversight from the group audit team in the UK) primarily 
consisted of substantive tests of detail, where we assessed the 
appropriateness of the inputs and the assumptions used in the 
valuation model taking into account supporting evidence (where 
available), and analytical procedures. We also compared the inputs 
and assumptions in the 31 December 2022 valuation with the 
31 December 2023 valuation to identify, and subsequently investigate, 
any unexpected variances. Our analytical procedures also focused 
on comparisons of the assumptions and inputs with industry 
averages. In addition, we performed procedures over the 
mathematical accuracy of the valuation model.

We compared the estimated net selling prices used in the model 
with third party evidence and the inputs used in the conversion 
factor to convert hectares of land under afforestation to tonnes 
of standing timber with historical evidence, as well as benchmarking 
the conversion factor against industry data. Forestry assets were 
physically verified on a sample basis in addition to using geospatial 
imaging. We also assessed the risk premium applied in the 
valuation model to immature and mature timber by comparing the 
factors taken into account in the risk adjustment with historical 
experience, industry data and other evidence provided by 
management. We evaluated whether the climate change risks 
relevant to the valuation of the forestry assets were appropriately 
included within the model, by comparison with historical data and 
the climate risk assessments performed by group management.

Adjustments outside the underlying model have been tested 
through challenging assumptions made by management, 
independently reperforming the calculations and obtaining 
supporting evidence, on a sample basis. 

We evaluated the director’s assessment of the sensitivity of 
the valuation to reasonably possible changes in assumptions 
and we considered the appropriateness of the related disclosures 
in note 14 and note 35 to the financial statements.

Based on the procedures performed, we noted no material issues 
from our work.

Independent auditors’ report to the members of Mondi plc continued

Key audit matter
Application of hyperinflation accounting related to subsidiaries in Türkiye (group)

How our audit addressed the key audit matter

In the year ended 31 December 2023, the group has applied 
IAS 29, 'Financial Reporting in Hyperinflationary Economies', for 
its subsidiaries in Türkiye and Lebanon (2022: Türkiye), whose 
functional currencies have experienced a cumulative inflation 
rate of more than 100% over the past three years. 

The application of IAS 29 required the financial information 
of these subsidiaries of the group to be restated for changes 
in the general purchasing power of the local currency, being 
the functional currency of those subsidiaries.

The effect of IAS 29 is pervasive to the consolidated income 
statement and applicable to all non-monetary assets and liabilities 
in the consolidated statement of financial position.

For the year ended 31 December 2023, the adjustments from 
hyperinflationary accounting have resulted in an increase in group 
revenue of €116 million (2022: €125 million), a decrease in underlying 
EBITDA of €16 million (2022: €44 million) and a net monetary gain 
of €2 million (2022: €17 million) and an accumulated increase in 
total assets of €115 million (31 December 2022: €91 million) from 
the date of initial application to 31 December 2023. 

IAS 29 requires judgement to determine which general price index 
to select and other approximations to be made in order to prepare 
the financial statements of affected subsidiaries and complex 
calculations to determine the impact of IAS 29. Given the 
complexity of the accounting and the size of the group’s businesses 
in Türkiye, this was determined to be a key audit matter.

Refer to notes 1, 7, 10, 12, 13, 22, 27 and 35 of the group financial 
statements, and the Audit Committee’s views set out on page 114.

Given the relative size of the group’s businesses in Türkiye 
and Lebanon, we focused our testing on the impact of IAS 29 
on the operations in Türkiye.

We assessed the consistency of the application of the 
methodology in the calculation of the IAS 29 related adjustments 
to the group’s accounting policies as well as to the prior year for 
all subsidiaries that were impacted materially.

We verified the appropriateness of the index used to calculate 
the IAS 29 impact to publicly available market data.

We tested a sample of items in the underlying data used in the 
calculations of the IAS 29 adjustments, as well as the accuracy 
of the calculations. These procedures were performed by our 
component teams in Türkiye, with oversight from the group audit 
team in the UK.

We assessed changes made to the configuration of the group’s 
consolidation system during the year ended 31 December 2023 
to validate that the newly implemented automation of certain 
areas of hyperinflation accounting was in line with the group’s 
established accounting policies and UK-adopted international 
accounting standards. We also tested the exchange rates used by 
management to translate the local currency results into Euros, the 
group’s presentation currency, to publicly available information.

We also considered the appropriateness of the disclosures 
in the group financial statements.

Based on the procedures performed, we noted no material issues 
from our work.

Key audit matter
Valuation of property, plant and equipment (group)

How our audit addressed the key audit matter

The group has property, plant and equipment (“PPE”) of 
€4,619 million (2022: €4,167 million). Management has assessed 
whether indicators of impairment or impairment reversal existed 
in relation to PPE as at 31 December 2023, performed at the cash 
generating units (“CGUs”) level, being the lowest level at which 
largely independent cash inflows are generated.

The determination of appropriate CGUs is judgemental in nature. 
Once the CGUs are identified, the determination of whether an 
indicator of impairment or impairment reversal exists for a specific 
CGU is also judgemental. Where an indicator of impairment or 
impairment reversal is identified, management must estimate the 
recoverable amount of the relevant CGU in order to assess the 
recoverability of the carrying value of the CGU. 

The determination of the recoverable amount, being the higher of 
value in use (“VIU”) and fair value less costs to dispose (“FVLCD”), 
requires judgement and estimation by management. This is because 
the determination of recoverable amount reflects management’s 
consideration of key internal inputs and external market conditions, 
such as future paper prices, customer demand and forecast growth 
rates, which all impact future cash flows, and the determination 
of the most appropriate discount rate. Therefore, we considered 
it to be a key audit matter.

Refer to notes 10 and 35 of the group financial statements, 
and the Audit Committee’s views set out on page 114.

We satisfied ourselves as to the appropriateness of the 
judgement related to the level at which impairment of these 
assets is assessed, being the lowest level at which largely 
independent cash inflows can be identified (the “CGU”).

We evaluated management’s assessment of impairment and 
impairment reversal indicators by comparing actual performance 
with the budget and considering other internal and external 
factors, including those set out in IAS 36 ‘Impairment of Assets’. 

In relation to the CGUs where impairment indicators were 
identified, for certain CGUs we engaged our component teams 
with oversight from the group audit team in the UK, and challenged 
the basis for management’s estimates of growth rates and future 
cash flows with reference to historical trading performance, 
market expectations and management forecasts. 

We used our internal valuation experts to independently 
recalculate the discount rates and evaluate the long-term growth 
assumptions applied by management. We also checked the 
mathematical accuracy of management’s valuation models. Where 
management had obtained independent, third party valuations to 
determine the fair value less costs to dispose of individual assets 
or specific CGUs, we assessed the external valuation reports 
and the professional qualifications of these third party valuers.

Based on the procedures performed, we noted no material issues 
from our work.

Impairment indicator assessment of the parent company investment in subsidiaries (parent)

We considered the adequacy and completeness of management’s 
impairment and impairment reversal indicator analysis as at 
31 December 2023 by assessing it against the requirements 
of IAS 36 ‘Impairment of Assets’. We also validated the accuracy 
of the data supporting the assessment.

We considered the appropriateness of the disclosures in the 
parent company financial statements. 

Based on the procedures performed, we noted no material issues 
from our work.

The investment in Mondi South Africa (Pty) Limited held by 
Mondi plc at 31 December 2023 amounts to €666 million 
(FY22: €666 million), with an accumulated impairment of 
€117 million. No further impairment charges have been recorded 
in the year as there was no impairment trigger identified. 
Management has also considered whether an indicator of 
impairment reversal has arisen during 2023 but concluded 
that this was not the case. 

Management has considered various internal and external 
indicators of impairment in assessing whether the investment 
might be impaired in 2023. No indicator of impairment or 
impairment reversal was identified based on consideration 
of the qualitative and quantitative factors outlined in IAS 36 
‘Impairment of Assets’. 

Given the inherent judgement required and the quantum of 
the balances in the parent company’s balance sheet, this matter 
was determined to be a key audit matter.

Refer to notes 1 and 6 of the parent company financial statements.

Independent auditors’ report to the members of Mondi plc continued

How we tailored the audit scope
We tailored the scope of our audit to ensure that we performed enough work to be able to give an opinion on the financial statements 
as a whole, taking into account the structure of the group and the parent company, the accounting processes and controls, and the 
industry in which they operate.

In establishing the overall approach to the group audit, we determined the type of work that needed to be performed at components 
by us, as the group engagement team, or component auditors operating under our instruction.

We identified one component (2022: three) as a significant component (as defined within ISAs (UK)) which, in our view, required an audit 
of its complete financial information, due to its financial significance to the group. Outside of this component, we obtained full scope 
audit reporting from a further seven components (2022: five), where we concluded that the component engagement leader is a Key 
Audit Partner (as defined under ISAs (UK)), and an additional 20 components where full scope audits were performed (2022: 19). 
Together, these components were in 11 countries (2022: 11), representing the group’s principal businesses. The group engagement team 
performed work at two of these components, with component auditors operating under our instruction performing the work on the other 
full scope components.

An audit of specific financial statement line items was performed at a further ten (2022: five) components, with the component auditors 
operating under our instruction. In addition, the group engagement team performed specified procedures at four components (2022: 
three) related to transactions or balances. Central testing was also performed on selected items, such as goodwill, primarily to ensure 
appropriate audit coverage. In aggregate, the locations subject to audit procedures represented 77% (2022: 72%) of the group’s revenue 
from continuing operations.

The components included within the scope of our audit were determined based on the individual component's contribution to the 
group’s key financial statement line items (in particular revenue and profit before tax adjusted for special items), and considerations 
relating to aggregation risk within the group.

Where work was performed by component auditors, we determined the level of involvement we needed to have in the audit work at 
those components to be able to conclude on whether sufficient appropriate audit evidence had been obtained as a basis for our opinion 
on the group financial statements as a whole.

We issued formal written instructions to all component auditors setting out the audit work to be performed by each of them and 
maintained regular communication with them throughout the audit cycle. These interactions included attending certain component audit 
clearance meetings, in person or by video conferencing, as well as reviewing and assessing any matters reported. We also held a virtual 
planning meeting with component auditors ahead of the year-end audit to agree on effective working arrangements and key areas of 
audit focus.

We issued separate instructions and held virtual meetings with the third party component team in Russia, to ensure effective remote 
working arrangements. We reviewed selected audit working papers for certain in-scope component teams, including the significant 
component and the seven components where we concluded that the component engagement leader is a Key Audit Partner.

In addition, senior members of the group engagement team visited component teams in Austria, the Czech Republic, Poland, Sweden, 
South Africa and Türkiye. These visits included meetings with local management and with the component auditors, and typically involved 
operating site tours.

The impact of climate risk on our audit
In planning our work, including identifying areas of audit risk and determining an appropriate response, we were mindful of the increased 
focus on the impact of climate change risk on companies and their financial reporting, and also that the group has identified climate change 
as a principal risk. Climate change risk is expected to have a significant impact on the group’s business as the operations and strategy of the 
group evolve to address the potential physical and transition risks that could arise and the opportunities associated with climate change. 
Climate change initiatives and commitments impact the group in a variety of ways, as described within the Integrated Report.

The Board has made commitments to achieve Net-Zero GHG emissions reduction targets by 2050. As part of our audit we made 
enquiries of management to understand the process management adopted to assess the extent of the potential impact of climate 
change risk on the group’s financial statements, including considering the Mondi Action Plan 2030 (“MAP2030”) science-based targets 
as detailed within the Integrated Report, which are in the process of being re-submitted for validation following the divestment of the 
Russian operations.

We challenged the completeness of management’s climate risk assessment by reading external reporting made by management, 
including the Sustainable Development Report and Carbon Disclosure Project submissions, and making management aware of any 
apparent internal inconsistencies there may be in its climate reporting.

We also considered the key financial statement line items and estimates that are most likely to be impacted by climate risks, as set out 
in note 1 of the group financial statements. Given that the impact of climate change on the group is likely, principally, to crystallise in the 
medium to long-term, we concluded that the risks of material misstatement in the financial statements associated with climate change 
related primarily to the valuation of forestry assets and estimates of future cash flows, which are used, for example, when testing assets 
for impairment. Management considers that the impact of climate change does not give rise to a material financial statement impact.

Mondi Group Integrated report and financial statements 2023

161

We also considered the consistency of the disclosures in relation to climate change (including the disclosures in relation to the 
Task Force on Climate-related Financial Disclosures (TCFD)) made in the other information within the Integrated Report with the financial 
statements and our knowledge from our audit. This included:

– Understanding which models management has used in the TCFD scenario analysis and considering whether the assumptions in the 

models are consistent with the assumptions used in the financial statements; and

– Challenging the consistency of the disclosures given in the narrative reporting within the other information with the impact disclosed 

within the financial statements.

Where applicable, our audit response to climate change risk is included in relevant key audit matters above. Refer also to notes 1, 12, 14, 25 
and 35 of the group financial statements for disclosures related to climate change. Our procedures did not identify any material impact in 
the context of our audit of the financial statements as a whole, or our key audit matters for the year ended 31 December 2023.

Materiality
The scope of our audit was influenced by our application of materiality. We set certain quantitative thresholds for materiality. These, 
together with qualitative considerations, helped us to determine the scope of our audit and the nature, timing and extent of our audit 
procedures on the individual financial statement line items and disclosures and in evaluating the effect of misstatements, both individually 
and in aggregate on the financial statements as a whole.

Based on our professional judgement, we determined materiality for the financial statements as a whole as follows:

Overall materiality €35 million (2022: €65 million).

Financial statements – group

Financial statements – parent company
€47 million (2022: €40 million).

How we 
determined it

Rationale for 
benchmark applied

based on approximately 5% of profit before tax (‘PBT’) 
from continuing operations adjusted for special items 
(2022: based on approximately 5% of profit before tax 
('PBT') from continuing operations adjusted for 
special items)
For overall group materiality, we chose profit before tax 
from continuing operations adjusted for special items as 
the benchmark. The adjusted profit before tax measure 
removes the impact of significant items which do not 
recur from year to year or otherwise significantly affect 
the underlying trend of performance from continuing 
operations. This is the metric against which the 
performance of the group is most commonly 
assessed by management and reported to members. 
We chose 5% as this is consistent with the 
quantitative materiality threshold typically used 
for other profit-oriented companies.

based on approximately 1% of total assets (2022: based 
on approximately 1% of total assets)

For overall Mondi plc parent company materiality, 
we determined the materiality based on total assets, 
which is more appropriate than a performance-related 
measure as the parent company is an investment 
holding company for the group. Using professional 
judgement, we determined materiality for this year at 
€47 million (2022: €40 million), which equates to 
approximately 1% of the current year’s total assets.

For each component in the scope of our group audit, we allocated a materiality that is less than our overall group materiality. The range 
of materiality allocated across components was between €2 million and €31.5 million.

We use performance materiality to reduce to an appropriately low level the probability that the aggregate of uncorrected and 
undetected misstatements exceeds overall materiality. Specifically, we use performance materiality in determining the scope of our audit 
and the nature and extent of our testing of account balances, classes of transactions and disclosures, for example in determining sample 
sizes. Our performance materiality was 75% (2022: 75%) of overall materiality, amounting to €26 million (2022: €49 million) for the group 
financial statements and €35 million (2022: €30 million) for the parent company financial statements.

In determining the performance materiality, we considered a number of factors - the history of misstatements, risk assessment and 
aggregation risk and the effectiveness of controls - and concluded that an amount at the upper end of our normal range was appropriate.

We agreed with the Audit Committee that we would report to them misstatements identified during our audit above €3 million (group audit) 
(2022: €3.5 million) and €3 million (parent company audit) (2022: €3.5 million) as well as misstatements below those amounts that, in our 
view, warranted reporting for qualitative reasons.

Independent auditors’ report to the members of Mondi plc continued

Conclusions relating to going concern
Our evaluation of the directors’ assessment of the group's and the parent company’s ability to continue to adopt the going concern basis 
of accounting included:

– We assessed management’s going concern cash flow projections, agreeing them to the latest Board approved forecasts;

– We evaluated management’s future cash flows with reference to historical trading performance, market expectations from industry 

or economic reports and management capital investment plans;

– We tested the available committed debt facilities to our year end audit work, including checking that the key terms were applied 
appropriately in the going concern assessment related to the maturity dates of available committed debt facilities and satisfied 
ourselves that there are no financial covenants in these facilities;

– We considered the potential downside sensitivities that management had applied and considered their likelihood and whether more 

severe scenarios could arise and the associated impact on available liquidity;

– We assessed management’s reverse stress test and considered the likelihood of events arising that could erode liquidity within the 

forecast period;

– We assessed the performance of the group since year end and compared it with the Board approved cash flow forecast;

– We read the basis of preparation note to the financial statements and validated that it accurately described management’s going 

concern considerations; and

– We tested the assumption that management's assessment is performed on the basis of continuing operations only, ensuring that 

it excluded any proceeds from the Russian disposal.

Based on the work we have performed, we have not identified any material uncertainties relating to events or conditions that, individually 
or collectively, may cast significant doubt on the group's and the parent company’s ability to continue as a going concern for a period 
of at least twelve months from when the financial statements are authorised for issue.

In auditing the financial statements, we have concluded that the directors’ use of the going concern basis of accounting in the 
preparation of the financial statements is appropriate.

However, because not all future events or conditions can be predicted, this conclusion is not a guarantee as to the group's and the 
parent company's ability to continue as a going concern.

In relation to the directors’ reporting on how they have applied the UK Corporate Governance Code, we have nothing material to add or 
draw attention to in relation to the directors’ statement in the financial statements about whether the directors considered it appropriate 
to adopt the going concern basis of accounting.

Our responsibilities and the responsibilities of the directors with respect to going concern are described in the relevant sections of this report.

Reporting on other information
The other information comprises all of the information in the Integrated Report other than the financial statements and our auditors’ 
report thereon. The directors are responsible for the other information. Our opinion on the financial statements does not cover the other 
information and, accordingly, we do not express an audit opinion or, except to the extent otherwise explicitly stated in this report, any 
form of assurance thereon.

In connection with our audit of the financial statements, our responsibility is to read the other information and, in doing so, consider 
whether the other information is materially inconsistent with the financial statements or our knowledge obtained in the audit, or otherwise 
appears to be materially misstated. If we identify an apparent material inconsistency or material misstatement, we are required to perform 
procedures to conclude whether there is a material misstatement of the financial statements or a material misstatement of the other 
information. If, based on the work we have performed, we conclude that there is a material misstatement of this other information, 
we are required to report that fact. We have nothing to report based on these responsibilities.

With respect to the Strategic report and Directors' report, we also considered whether the disclosures required by the UK Companies 
Act 2006 have been included.

Mondi Group Integrated report and financial statements 2023

163

Based on our work undertaken in the course of the audit, the Companies Act 2006 requires us also to report certain opinions 
and matters as described below.

Strategic report and Directors’ report
In our opinion, based on the work undertaken in the course of the audit, the information given in the Strategic report and Directors' 
report for the year ended 31 December 2023 is consistent with the financial statements and has been prepared in accordance with 
applicable legal requirements.

In light of the knowledge and understanding of the group and parent company and their environment obtained in the course of the audit, 
we did not identify any material misstatements in the Strategic report and Directors' report.

Directors’ Remuneration
In our opinion, the part of the Remuneration report to be audited has been properly prepared in accordance with the Companies Act 2006.

Corporate governance statement
The Listing Rules require us to review the directors’ statements in relation to going concern, longer-term viability and that part of the 
corporate governance statement relating to the parent company’s compliance with the provisions of the UK Corporate Governance 
Code specified for our review. Our additional responsibilities with respect to the corporate governance statement as other information 
are described in the Reporting on other information section of this report.

Based on the work undertaken as part of our audit, we have concluded that each of the following elements of the corporate governance 
statement, included within the Strategic report and the Corporate governance report, is materially consistent with the financial 
statements and our knowledge obtained during the audit, and we have nothing material to add or draw attention to in relation to:

– The directors’ confirmation that they have carried out a robust assessment of the emerging and principal risks;

– The disclosures in the Integrated Report that describe those principal risks, what procedures are in place to identify emerging risks 

and an explanation of how these are being managed or mitigated;

– The directors’ statement in the financial statements about whether they considered it appropriate to adopt the going concern basis 
of accounting in preparing them, and their identification of any material uncertainties to the group’s and parent company’s ability to 
continue to do so over a period of at least twelve months from the date of approval of the financial statements;

– The directors’ explanation as to their assessment of the group's and parent company’s prospects, the period this assessment covers 

and why the period is appropriate; and

– The directors’ statement as to whether they have a reasonable expectation that the parent company will be able to continue in 

operation and meet its liabilities as they fall due over the period of its assessment, including any related disclosures drawing attention 
to any necessary qualifications or assumptions.

Our review of the directors’ statement regarding the longer-term viability of the group and parent company was substantially less in 
scope than an audit and only consisted of making inquiries and considering the directors’ process supporting their statement; checking 
that the statement is in alignment with the relevant provisions of the UK Corporate Governance Code; and considering whether the 
statement is consistent with the financial statements and our knowledge and understanding of the group and parent company and their 
environment obtained in the course of the audit.

In addition, based on the work undertaken as part of our audit, we have concluded that each of the following elements of the corporate 
governance statement is materially consistent with the financial statements and our knowledge obtained during the audit:

– The directors’ statement that they consider the Integrated Report, taken as a whole, is fair, balanced and understandable, and provides the 
information necessary for the members to assess the group’s and parent company's position, performance, business model and strategy;

– The section of the Integrated Report that describes the review of effectiveness of risk management and internal control systems; and

– The section of the Integrated Report describing the work of the Audit Committee.

We have nothing to report in respect of our responsibility to report when the directors’ statement relating to the parent company’s 
compliance with the Code does not properly disclose a departure from a relevant provision of the Code specified under the Listing Rules 
for review by the auditors.

Independent auditors’ report to the members of Mondi plc continued

Responsibilities for the financial statements and the audit
Responsibilities of the directors for the financial statements
As explained more fully in the Directors' responsibility statement, the directors are responsible for the preparation of the financial 
statements in accordance with the applicable framework and for being satisfied that they give a true and fair view. The directors are also 
responsible for such internal control as they determine is necessary to enable the preparation of financial statements that are free from 
material misstatement, whether due to fraud or error.

In preparing the financial statements, the directors are responsible for assessing the group’s and the parent company’s ability to continue 
as a going concern, disclosing, as applicable, matters related to going concern and using the going concern basis of accounting unless the 
directors either intend to liquidate the group or the parent company or to cease operations, or have no realistic alternative but to do so.

Auditors’ responsibilities for the audit of the financial statements
Our objectives are to obtain reasonable assurance about whether the financial statements as a whole are free from material 
misstatement, whether due to fraud or error, and to issue an auditors’ report that includes our opinion. Reasonable assurance is a high 
level of assurance, but is not a guarantee that an audit conducted in accordance with ISAs (UK) will always detect a material 
misstatement when it exists. Misstatements can arise from fraud or error and are considered material if, individually or in the aggregate, 
they could reasonably be expected to influence the economic decisions of users taken on the basis of these financial statements.

Irregularities, including fraud, are instances of non-compliance with laws and regulations. We design procedures in line with our 
responsibilities, outlined above, to detect material misstatements in respect of irregularities, including fraud. The extent to which 
our procedures are capable of detecting irregularities, including fraud, is detailed below.

Based on our understanding of the group and industry, we identified that the principal risks of non-compliance with laws and regulations 
related to breaches of environmental regulations and breaches of sanctions in relation to Russia, and we considered the extent to which 
non-compliance might have a material effect on the financial statements. We also considered those laws and regulations that have a 
direct impact on the financial statements such as the Companies Act 2006 and relevant tax legislation. We evaluated management’s 
incentives and opportunities for fraudulent manipulation of the financial statements (including the risk of override of controls), and 
determined that the principal risks were related to posting inappropriate journal entries to increase revenue and management bias in 
accounting estimates and judgements. The group engagement team shared this risk assessment with the component auditors so that 
they could include appropriate audit procedures in response to such risks in their work. Audit procedures performed by the group 
engagement team and/or component auditors included:

– Discussions with management, Internal Audit and the group’s internal legal counsel, including consideration of potential instances 

of non-compliance with laws and regulation and fraud and the group's processes for addressing sanctions risk in Russia;

– Assessment of matters reported through the group’s whistleblowing helpline and the results of management’s investigation of such 

matters;

– Testing controls in relation to IT systems within the group, in part to identify whether opportunities exist to carry out fraud through 

inappropriate access to systems and data;

– Testing a sample of journal entries posted to revenue based on specific risk criteria; and

– Challenging assumptions and judgements made by management in its accounting estimates or judgements as a whole and assessing 

whether there has been any management bias in aggregate.

There are inherent limitations in the audit procedures described above. We are less likely to become aware of instances of 
non-compliance with laws and regulations that are not closely related to events and transactions reflected in the financial statements. 
Also, the risk of not detecting a material misstatement due to fraud is higher than the risk of not detecting one resulting from error, 
as fraud may involve deliberate concealment by, for example, forgery or intentional misrepresentations, or through collusion.

Our audit testing might include testing complete populations of certain transactions and balances, possibly using data auditing 
techniques. However, it typically involves selecting a limited number of items for testing, rather than testing complete populations. We will 
often seek to target particular items for testing based on their size or risk characteristics. In other cases, we will use audit sampling to 
enable us to draw a conclusion about the population from which the sample is selected.

A further description of our responsibilities for the audit of the financial statements is located on the FRC’s website at: www.frc.org.uk/
auditorsresponsibilities. This description forms part of our auditors’ report.

Use of this report
This report, including the opinions, has been prepared for and only for the parent company’s members as a body in accordance with 
Chapter 3 of Part 16 of the Companies Act 2006 and for no other purpose. We do not, in giving these opinions, accept or assume 
responsibility for any other purpose or to any other person to whom this report is shown or into whose hands it may come save where 
expressly agreed by our prior consent in writing.

Mondi Group Integrated report and financial statements 2023

171

Notes to the consolidated financial statements
for the year ended 31 December 2023 

1 Basis of preparation
These consolidated financial statements as at and for the year ended 31 December 2023 comprise Mondi plc and its subsidiaries 
(referred to as 'the Group’), and the Group’s share of the results and net assets of its associates and joint ventures.

The Group’s consolidated financial statements have been prepared in accordance with UK-adopted International Accounting Standards 
and with the requirements of the Companies Act 2006 as applicable to companies reporting under those standards. The principal 
accounting policies adopted are set out in note 35 and were applied consistently throughout the year and preceding year.

The Group also applies International Financial Reporting Standards (IFRSs) as issued by the International Accounting Standards Board 
(IASB), and there are no differences with applying IFRSs adopted for use in the UK which may significantly or materially affect the 
Group’s accounting policies.

The consolidated financial statements have been prepared on a going concern basis. The directors have reviewed the Group’s budget 
and considered the assumptions contained in the budget, including the principal and emerging risks which may impact the Group’s 
performance in the near term. The Group has a strong balance sheet. At 31 December 2023, the Group had a liquidity position of 
€2,346 million, comprising €754 million of undrawn committed debt facilities and cash and cash equivalents of €1,592 million, which 
include proceeds from the disposal of discontinued operations of €806 million. As the Group’s debt facilities and loan agreements 
contain no financial covenants, in performing its going concern assessment the directors have focused on liquidity, which was adjusted 
to exclude the net proceeds from the disposal of discontinued operations, given that these were distributed to shareholders by way of 
a special dividend in February 2024 (see notes 9 and 22). The assessment of going concern is further described in the Strategic report 
under the heading Going concern on page 81, which is incorporated by reference into these financial statements. Based on this 
evaluation, the Board considered it appropriate to prepare the consolidated financial statements on the going concern basis.

The consolidated financial statements have been prepared under the historical cost basis of accounting, as modified by forestry assets, 
pension assets, certain financial assets and financial liabilities held at fair value through profit and loss, assets acquired and liabilities 
assumed in a business combination and accounting in hyperinflationary economies.

The Group presents certain measures of financial performance, position or cash flows that are not defined or specified according to 
IFRSs and UK-adopted International Accounting Standards. These measures, referred to as Alternative Performance Measures (APMs), 
are defined on pages 238-241.

Critical accounting judgements and significant accounting estimates
The preparation of the Group’s consolidated financial statements includes the use of estimates and assumptions. Although the estimates 
used are based on management’s best information about current circumstances and future events and actions, actual results may differ 
from those estimates. The critical accounting judgements and significant accounting estimates with a significant risk of a material change 
to the carrying value of assets and liabilities within the next year in terms of IAS 1, 'Presentation of Financial Statements', are:

Significant accounting estimates
– Fair value of forestry assets – refer to note 14
– Actuarial valuations of retirement benefit obligations – refer to note 24
Other areas of judgement and accounting estimates
The consolidated financial statements include other areas of judgement and accounting estimates. While these areas do not meet the 
definition under IAS 1 of significant accounting estimates or critical accounting judgements, the recognition and measurement of certain 
material assets and liabilities are based on assumptions and/or are subject to longer-term uncertainties. The other areas of judgement 
and accounting estimates include:

– Hyperinflation accounting – refer to notes 1 and 35
– Climate change – refer to note 1
– Taxation – refer to notes 7 and 35 
– Residual values and useful economic lives of property, plant and equipment – refer to notes 10 and 35
– Fair value of assets acquired and liabilities assumed in business combinations - refer to notes 25 and 35

Climate change
Management has considered the impact of climate change in preparing these consolidated financial statements, in particular in the context 
of the disclosures included in the Strategic report, including the Group’s science-based Net-Zero GHG emission reduction targets 
as detailed in the Mondi Action Plan 2030 (MAP2030) Taking Action on Climate section on pages 51-64. These considerations, which 
are integral to the Group’s strategy, did not have a material impact on the accounting estimates and judgements, including the 
following areas:

– Estimates of future cash flows used in the impairment assessment of goodwill – refer to note 12
– Assumptions used in the fair value measurement of forestry assets – refer to note 14
– Residual values and useful economic lives of property, plant and equipment – refer to note 35
– Fair value of assets acquired and liabilities assumed in business combinations – refer to note 25

Notes to the consolidated financial statements
for the year ended 31 December 2023 continued

1 Basis of preparation continued
While these considerations did not have a material impact on the areas set out above, this may change in future periods as management 
evolves its understanding of climate change-related impacts on the Group.

Hyperinflation accounting (see note 35)
The Group has applied IAS 29, 'Financial Reporting in Hyperinflationary Economies', for its subsidiaries in Türkiye and Lebanon 
(2022: Türkiye), whose functional currencies have experienced a cumulative inflation rate of more than 100% over the past three years, 
respectively. The consumer price index increased in Türkiye by 65% from 1,128 at 31 December 2022 to 1,859 at 31 December 2023 
and in Lebanon by 212% from 1,917 at 31 December 2022 to 5,978 at 31 December 2023. For the year ended 31 December 2023, 
the adjustments from hyperinflationary accounting have resulted in an increase in Group revenue of €116 million (2022: €125 million), 
a decrease in underlying EBITDA of €16 million (2022: €44 million) and a net monetary gain of €2 million (2022: €17 million). As at 
31 December 2023, the adjustments from hyperinflationary accounting have resulted in an accumulated increase in total assets of 
€115 million (2022: €91 million). Comparative amounts presented in euro were not restated for subsequent changes in the price level 
or exchange rates.

IAS 29 requires judgement to determine when to apply hyperinflationary accounting and which general price index to select and other 
approximations to be made in order to restate the financial statements of subsidiaries operating in a hyperinflationary economy.

2 Operating segments
The Group generates revenue from the sale of manufactured products across the packaging and paper value chain. Revenue is generally 
recognised at a point in time, typically when the goods have been delivered to a contractually agreed location in line with the shipment 
terms agreed with customers. Customer payment terms vary within the Group due to its global operations and do not contain significant 
financing components.

The Group provides transport services after control of certain goods has passed to the customer. The Group generated transport 
revenue of €91 million (2022: €139 million), which was recognised over time. The stage of completion is used to determine the amount 
of revenue recognised, which is based on the transportation days completed at the reporting date relative to the total expected delivery 
days.

The Group’s operating segments are reported in a manner consistent with the internal reporting provided to the Executive Committee, 
the chief operating decision-making body. The operating segments are managed based on the nature of the underlying products 
produced by those businesses and, consistent with prior year, comprise three distinct segments. In 2022, the Group disposed of its 
Personal Care Components business.

The material product types from which the Group’s operating segments derive their internal and external revenues are as follows:

Operating segments
Corrugated Packaging

Flexible Packaging

Uncoated Fine Paper

Product types
Containerboard

Corrugated solutions

Kraft paper

Paper bags

Consumer flexibles

Functional paper and films

Pulp

Uncoated fine paper

Pulp

The Group’s previously owned operations in Russia are reported as discontinued operations and no longer reported to the 
Executive Committee, and hence not disclosed for all periods presented in this note. The discontinued operations' net (loss)/profit 
and cash flows are presented separately in the consolidated income statement and consolidated statement of cash flows for all periods 
presented. Financial information relating to the discontinued operations is provided in note 28.

On 24 May 2021, legislation was substantively enacted in the UK to increase the corporate tax rate from 19% to 25% with effect from 
1 April 2023. The 23.5% UK corporation tax rate referenced in the table above reflects the average tax rate that has applied during 2023.

As the Group operates in a number of countries, each with different tax systems, a degree of tax risk is inevitable, as tax laws are 
complex and subject to changes in legislation and to differing interpretations. Consequently, provision has been made for such tax risk 
exposures within current tax liabilities of €38 million (2022: €41 million), mainly in relation to transfer pricing risks arising from cross 
border transactions. There is not expected to be any material change to the tax risk exposures or associated provisions within the next 
12 months.

The Group is within the scope of the OECD Pillar 2 model rules. As of 31 December 2023, the effective tax rate in the majority of 
countries in which the Group operates exceeds the 15% minimum tax rate threshold required under Pillar 2. In certain jurisdictions, notably 
in Bulgaria and Hungary, there are potential impacts from this tax, given their current statutory tax rates are 10% and 9% respectively. In 
addition, it is expected that additional Pillar 2 tax may be triggered in jurisdictions in which the Group benefits from tax incentives on 
capital investments or tax holidays but this will ultimately depend year on year on the quantum of tax incentives available to the Group. 
Therefore, quantitative information to indicate potential exposure to Pillar 2 is currently not reasonably estimable. The Group continues 
to progress on the assessment and expects to complete it in 2024.

The key items within other temporary differences include retirement benefit obligations, inventory write-downs, other provisions 
and accruals and elimination of intercompany profit in inventory.

Based on forecast data, the Group considers it probable that there will be sufficient future taxable profits available in the relevant 
jurisdictions to utilise the tax losses and other temporary differences presented in the table above.

Deferred tax balances have been shown after offset when they relate to income taxes levied by the same tax authority and it is intended 
to settle current assets and liabilities on a net basis.

The current expectation regarding the maturity of deferred tax balances is:

No deferred tax liability is recognised on gross temporary differences of €622 million (2022: €679 million) relating to the unremitted 
earnings of overseas subsidiaries, as the Group is able to control the timing of the reversal of these temporary differences and it is 
probable that they will not reverse in the foreseeable future. UK tax legislation largely exempts, from UK tax, overseas dividends received. 
As a result, the gross temporary differences at 31 December 2023 represent only the unremitted earnings of those overseas subsidiaries 
where remittance to the UK of those earnings would still result in a tax liability, principally as a result of dividend withholding taxes levied 
by the overseas tax jurisdictions in which these subsidiaries operate and non-UK corporate taxes on dividends.

On 13 February 2024, the Group returned the net proceeds from the sale of the Group's Russian assets to its shareholders by way of 
a special dividend (see note 9). In addition, in order to maintain the comparability, so far as possible, of Mondi plc’s share price before 
and after the special dividend, the special dividend was accompanied by a share consolidation, which took effect on 29 January 2024, 
resulting in shareholders receiving 10 new ordinary shares for every 11 existing ordinary shares (see note 22). The weighted average 
number of ordinary shares outstanding for 2023 and 2022, respectively, is based on the number of existing ordinary shares throughout 
the relevant years (i.e. before share consolidation).

The final ordinary dividend proposed in respect of the financial year ended 31 December 2023 has been recommended by the Board 
and is subject to the approval of the shareholders of Mondi plc at the Annual General Meeting scheduled for 3 May 2024.

On 13 February 2024, the Group returned the net proceeds from the sale of the Group's Russian assets to shareholders by way of a 
special dividend of €1.60 per existing ordinary share. In addition, in order to maintain the comparability, so far as possible, of Mondi plc’s 
share price before and after the special dividend, the special dividend was accompanied by a share consolidation, which took effect 
on 29 January 2024, resulting in shareholders receiving 10 new ordinary shares for every 11 existing ordinary shares (see note 22).

Included in the additions above is €11 million (2022: €2 million) of interest incurred on qualifying assets which has been capitalised during 
the year. The amount is deductible for tax purposes either when incurred or included in the amount permitted to be deducted for capital 
expenditure, depending on the jurisdiction in which they are capitalised.

The Group recognised income from insurance reimbursements relating to damages of property, plant and equipment of €27 million 
(2022: €7 million) in other net operating expenses in the consolidated income statement with reimbursements received in cash 
of €17 million (2022: €8 million) classified as other investing activities within the consolidated statement of cash flows.

The recoverable amount of property, plant and equipment is determined based on the use of the asset within the current business plans. 
Any change in future intentions could result in an impairment of varying magnitude, depending on the assets affected.

11 Leases
The Group has entered into various lease agreements. Leases over land and buildings have a weighted average term of 35 years 
(2022: 35 years), plant and equipment a weighted average term of 12 years (2022: 12 years) and other assets a weighted average term 
of 5 years (2022: 5 years).

The principal lease agreements in place include the following:

South African land lease
The Group entered into a land lease agreement on 1 January 2001 for a total term of 70 years. The lease commitment and annual 
escalation rate are renegotiated every five years. The lease does not contain any clauses with regard to contingent rent or an option 
to purchase the land at the end of the lease term, and does not impose any significant restrictions on the Group as a lessee.

Office building
The Group entered into an office building lease agreement in Vienna (Austria) for a total term of 20 years from October 2013. The lease 
may only be terminated by the Group, after six months’ notice, in September 2023 (which did not occur) and again in September 2028. 
Rent escalates on an annual basis by the consumer price index of the local jurisdiction. The lease does not contain any option to 
purchase the building at the end of the lease term, and does not impose any significant restrictions on the Group as a lessee. Variable 
lease payments are included in the lease liability and calculated at the consumer price index. The Group does not intend to exercise 
the termination option in September 2028, and thus it was not considered in the calculation of the right-of-use asset.

(b) Assumptions
Goodwill acquired through business combinations is allocated to the group of cash-generating units (CGUs) that are expected to benefit 
from the synergies of the combination and represents the lowest level at which goodwill is monitored for internal management purposes. 
Goodwill is assessed for impairment at least annually. In performing this impairment test, the recoverable amounts of these groups of 
CGUs are the higher of fair value less costs to dispose and value in use (see note 35 for further details).

Goodwill is allocated to three groups of CGUs, as follows:

Key assumptions for 2023
The key assumptions in the value-in-use calculations are as follows:

– Cash flow forecasts are derived from the budget most recently approved by the Board covering the three-year period 

to 31 December 2026.

– Sales volumes, sales prices and input cost assumptions in the budget period are derived from a combination of economic forecasts 

for the regions in which the Group operates, industry forecasts for individual product lines, internal management projections, historical 
performance and announced and expected industry capacity changes.

– The impact of climate change such as regulatory risks on carbon pricing, yield losses on plantations or the effects of droughts as well 
as climate-change related opportunities in the budget period are considered in the cash flow forecasts. The Group’s climate change 
risks and opportunities identified according to the TCFD recommendations are disclosed on pages 55-64 of this report.

– Cash flow projections in year four are based on internal management projections taking into consideration industry forecasts and 

growth rates in the regions in which the Group operates. Growth rates are applied to the groups of CGUs for all years from year four 
onwards (as per the table above).

– Capital expenditure forecasts are based on historical experience and include expenditure necessary to maintain the assets in their 

current condition.

The pre-tax discount rate is derived from the Group’s weighted average cost of capital. In determining the discount rate applicable 
to each group of CGUs, adjustments are made to reflect the impacts of country risk. 

 
 
 
 
 
 
 
Mondi Group Integrated report and financial statements 2023

187

Sensitivity analyses
Expected future cash flows are inherently uncertain and could change materially over time. They are affected by a number of factors, 
including market and production estimates, together with economic factors such as prices, discount rates, currency exchange rates, 
estimates of production costs and future capital expenditure. Risks associated with increased operating costs such as carbon pricing 
mechanisms have also been considered.

Sensitivity analyses of reasonably possible changes in the underlying assumptions for each group of CGUs included:

– 100 bps increase in discount rate;

– 0% growth rate assumed for cash flow projections beyond three years in the Corrugated Packaging and Flexible Packaging groups 

of CGUs;

– 2% decrease in sales prices of paper in all years in the Corrugated Packaging group of CGUs;

– 1% decrease in sales prices of paper in 2024 in the Flexible Packaging group of CGUs; and

– 3% decrease in sales prices of paper in all years in the Uncoated Fine Paper group of CGUs.

None of these downside sensitivity analyses, in isolation, indicated the need for an impairment.

The Group has 254,858 hectares (2022: 252,857 hectares) of owned and leased land available for forestry activities, all of which is in 
South Africa. 80,614 hectares (2022: 80,227 hectares) are set aside for conservation activities and infrastructure needs. 1,044 hectares 
(2022: 1,045 hectares) relate to non-core activities. The balance of 173,200 hectares (2022: 171,585 hectares) are under afforestation, 
which forms the basis of the valuation set out above.

Mature forestry assets are those plantations that are harvestable, while immature forestry assets have not yet reached that stage of 
growth. Timber is harvested according to a rotation plan, once trees reach maturity. The maturity period ranges from 6.5 to 14.5 years 
(2022: 6.5 to 14.5 years) depending on species, climate and location.

The fair value of forestry assets is a level 3 measure in terms of the fair value measurement hierarchy, consistent with prior years.

The following assumptions have a significant impact on the valuation of the Group’s forestry assets:

– The net selling price is defined as the selling price less the costs of transport, harvesting, extraction and loading, and all selling prices 
and costs are denominated in South African rand. The net selling price is based on third-party transactions and is influenced by the 
species, maturity profile and location of timber. In 2023, the net selling price used ranged from the South African rand equivalent 
of €15 per tonne to €53 per tonne (2022: €14 per tonne to €47 per tonne), with a weighted average of €34 per tonne 
(2022: €33 per tonne).

– The conversion factor, which is used to convert hectares of land under afforestation to tonnes of standing timber, is dependent on the 
species, the maturity profile of the timber, the geographic location and a variety of other environmental factors, such as the anticipated 
impact of climate change on water scarcity and fire risks. In 2023, the conversion factors ranged from 7.6 to 25.0 (2022: 7.9 to 23.9).

– The risk premium on immature timber of 12.4% (2022: 12.5%) is based on an assessment of the risks associated with forestry assets 
in South Africa and is applied for the years the immature timber has left to reach maturity. A risk premium on mature timber of 4.0% 
(2022: 4.0%) was applied. The risk premium applied to immature and mature timber includes factors for the anticipated impact of 
climate change on water scarcity and fire risks. An increase in the severity and frequency of extreme weather events, such as higher 
temperatures, changes in rainfall patterns and drought conditions, may result in higher timber losses in future years caused by stronger 
winds, erosion, fires, pests and diseases.

The valuation of the Group’s forestry assets is determined in South African rand and converted to euro at the closing exchange rate 
on 31 December of each year.

Management has performed sensitivity analyses of reasonably possible changes in the significant assumptions and the EUR/ZAR 
exchange rate. The sensitivity table is based on historical experience; however, the estimates may vary by greater amounts. Therefore, 
the Board considers the forestry assets valuation to be a significant accounting estimate. The reported value of owned forestry assets 
would change as follows should there be a change in these underlying assumptions on the basis that all other factors remain unchanged:

€ million

Effect of €5/tonne increase in net selling price

Effect of 1% increase in conversion factor (hectares to tonnes)

Effect of 1% increase in risk premium

Effect of 10% increase in EUR/ZAR exchange rate

Trade receivables: credit risk
The Group has a large number of unrelated customers and does not have significant credit risk exposure to any particular customer. 
The Group considers that there is no significant geographical or customer concentration of credit risk.

Each business segment manages its own exposure to credit risk according to the economic circumstances and characteristics of the 
relevant markets that it serves. The Group considers that management of credit risk on a decentralised basis enables it to assess and 
manage credit risk more effectively. However, broad principles of credit risk management are observed across all business segments, 
such as the use of credit rating agencies, credit guarantee insurance, where appropriate, and the maintenance of a credit control function.

In addition, the Group is in possession of bank guarantees and letters of credit securing trade and other receivables to the value 
of €6 million (2022: €17 million).

Credit periods offered to customers vary according to the credit risk profiles of participants and invoicing conventions established in the 
various markets in which the Group operates. Interest is charged at appropriate market rates on balances which are considered overdue 
in the relevant market. 

To the extent that recoverable amounts are expected to be less than their associated carrying values, impairment charges have been 
recorded in the consolidated income statement and the carrying values have been written down to their expected recoverable amounts. 
The total gross carrying value of trade receivables that were subject to credit loss allowance during the year was €36 million 
(2022: €42 million).

Included within the Group’s aggregate trade receivables balance are specific debtor balances with customers totalling €140 million 
(2022: €173 million) which are past due and where the Group considers that their credit quality remains intact.

The expected credit loss allowance for trade receivables was determined as follows:

The provisions for restructuring costs are expected to be settled over the next year. Restructuring provisions include severance costs, 
when management has made a formal decision to eliminate certain positions and this has been communicated to the groups of 
employees affected, and other related costs that are typically expected to be incurred in the course of a restructuring programme. 

Employee-related provisions comprise provisions for jubilee awards and other short-term benefits. Given the nature of jubilee provisions, 
the amounts are likely to be settled over many years. 

The Group provides for the costs of environmental remediation that have been identified at the time of plant closure, as part 
of acquisition due diligence or in other circumstances where remediation by the Group is required and a probable outflow of 
economic resources is identified. Judgement and experience are used by management in determining the expected timing, closure 
and decommissioning methods, which can vary over time and between locations in response to the relevant legal requirements in each 
territory or the impact of applying new technologies. As of 31 December 2023, such provisions totalled €4 million (2022: €4 million).

The Group does not provide for any potential future environmental remediation or asset retirement obligations in respect of plants 
that the Group continues to own and operate into the foreseeable future based on the existing strategy of the Group, unless a legal 
or constructive obligation exists at the reporting date.

Notes to the consolidated financial statements
for the year ended 31 December 2023 continued

19 Provisions continued
Provisions may be identified at a future date if a change in strategy results in planned plant closure or disposal and the Group identifies 
the need for future environmental remediation subject to the existence of a legal or constructive obligation.

Other provisions are mainly attributable to potential claims against the Group and onerous contracts, none of which are individually 
material to the Group. The Group expects to settle the majority of the provisions over the next year.

All non-current provisions are discounted using a discount rate relevant in the local countries, based on a pre-tax yield on 
long-term bonds.

20 Capital management
The Group defines its capital employed as equity, as presented in the consolidated statement of financial position, plus net debt.

Capital employed is managed on a basis that enables the Group to continue trading as a going concern, while delivering acceptable 
returns to shareholders. The Group is committed to managing its cost of capital by maintaining an appropriate capital structure, with 
a balance between equity and net debt.

The Group utilises its capital employed to fund its business.

The primary sources of the Group’s liquidity include its Guaranteed Euro Medium Term Note Programme, which the Group increased 
from €2.5 billion to €3.0 billion in June 2023, its €750 million Syndicated Revolving Credit Facility and financing from various banks 
and other credit agencies, thus providing the Group with access to diverse sources of debt financing.

In April 2023 the Group opted for a one-year extension on the facility, which moved the maturity from June 2027 to June 2028.

Note:
1
The Group’s Eurobonds incur a fixed rate of interest. Swap agreements are utilised by the Group to raise non-euro-denominated 
currency to fund subsidiaries' liquidity needs, thereby exposing the Group to floating interest rates.

The €750 million 5-year revolving multi-currency credit facility agreement (RCF) incorporates key sustainability targets linked to 
MAP2030, classifying the facility as a Sustainability Linked Loan. Under the terms of the agreement, the margin will be adjusted according 
to the Group’s performance against specified sustainability targets.

Short-term liquidity needs are met by cash and the RCF. As at 31 December 2023, the Group had no financial covenants in any of its 
financing facilities.

Note:

It has been assumed that, where applicable, interest and foreign exchange rates prevailing at the reporting date will not vary over the time periods remaining for future cash outflows.
In addition to the above, the Group swaps euro debt into other currencies through the foreign exchange market, as disclosed in note 31, 
which has the effect of exposing the Group to the floating interest rate of those currencies.

22 Share capital and other reserves
Mondi plc is not restricted in the number of shares that can be issued. Any issue of shares is subject to shareholder approval. Mondi plc 
ordinary shares issued on the London Stock Exchange and Johannesburg Stock Exchange have a nominal value of €0.20. All ordinary 
shares are called up, allotted and fully paid.

On 13 February 2024, the Group returned the net proceeds from the sale of the Group's Russian assets to shareholders by way of a special 
dividend of €1.60 per existing ordinary share. In addition, in order to maintain the comparability, so far as possible, of Mondi plc’s share price 
before and after the special dividend, the special dividend was accompanied by a share consolidation, which took effect on 29 January 2024, 
resulting in shareholders receiving 10 new ordinary shares with a nominal value of €0.22 each for every 11 existing ordinary shares with a nominal 
value of €0.20 each. To effect the share consolidation, the Group issued 3 additional ordinary shares prior to the record date for the share 
consolidation, increasing the number of ordinary shares from 485,553,780 ordinary shares to 485,553,783 ordinary shares, so that the number 
of the existing ordinary shares in issue at the time of the consolidation was exactly divisible by 11, such that there was no remaining fraction of 
a share. Following the share consolidation, the total number of ordinary shares issued decreased by 44,141,253 ordinary shares from 485,553,783 
ordinary shares to 441,412,530 ordinary shares, while the total nominal value of the share capital of the Group remained unchanged at €97 million.

Own shares
Own shares represent the cost of shares in Mondi plc purchased in the market to satisfy share awards under the Group’s employee share 
schemes (see note 23). These costs are reflected in the consolidated statement of changes in equity.

A description of the nature and purpose of each reserve is provided below. The accounting policies applied to each reserve are further 
described in note 35.

Cumulative translation adjustment reserve
Exchange differences arising on the translation of the Group’s non-euro operations into the presentation currency of the Group are 
recognised in other comprehensive income and accumulated in the cumulative translation adjustment reserve. The cumulative amount 
is reclassified to profit or loss only on disposal or partial disposal of the non-euro operation.

Post-retirement benefits reserve
Actuarial gains and losses and the return on plan assets arising from the Group’s defined benefit pension and post-retirement medical 
plans are recognised in other comprehensive income and accumulated in the post-retirement benefits reserve. Remeasurements recorded 
in other comprehensive income are not recycled to the consolidated income statement, but those amounts recognised in other 
comprehensive income may be transferred to retained earnings within equity.

Share-based payment reserve
The share-based payment reserve is used to recognise the grant date fair value of options issued to employees but not exercised 
and the grant date fair value of shares awarded to employees but not yet vested.

Cash flow hedge reserve
The cash flow hedge reserve is used to recognise the effective portion of changes in the fair value of derivative financial instruments 
that are designated as hedges of future cash flows.

Merger reserve
The merger reserve was recognised in respect of the demerger from Anglo American plc in 2007 and the simplification of the dual-listed 
company structure in 2019.

Other sundry reserves
The other sundry reserves comprise various other reserves, which individually are not material and typically are not subject 
to material changes.

Note:
1 The base fair value has been adjusted for contractually determined market-based performance conditions.
For the 2023 LTIP grant, performance was assessed against ROCE, relative TSR and an additional EPS metric. The inclusion of this 
growth metric, together with ROCE and relative TSR, provides a more rounded assessment of performance.

All of these scheme awards will be settled at the end of the vesting cycle in either the award of ordinary shares in Mondi plc or the award 
of nil-cost options to ordinary shares in Mondi plc. The Group has no obligation to settle the awards made under these schemes in cash. 
An amount equal to the dividends that would have been paid on Bonus Share Plan (BSP) and Long-Term Incentive Plan (LTIP) share 
awards during the holding period is paid to participants upon vesting.

The total fair value charge in respect of all the Mondi share awards for the year ended 31 December is made up as follows:

24 Retirement benefits
The Group operates post-retirement defined contribution, post-retirement defined benefit pension plans and post-retirement 
medical plans.

Defined contribution plans
The assets of the defined contribution plans are held separately in independently administered funds. The charge in respect of 
these plans of €14 million (2022: €14 million) is calculated on the basis of the contribution payable by the Group in the financial year. 
There were no material outstanding or prepaid contributions recognised in relation to these plans as at the reporting dates presented. 
The expected contributions to be paid to defined contribution plans during 2024 are €15 million.

Defined benefit pension plans and post-retirement medical plans
The Group operates in excess of 100 defined benefit retirement plans across its global operations. A large proportion of the Group’s 
defined benefit plans are closed to new members.

The majority of these plans are unfunded and provide pensions and severance benefits to members of those plans. 

The most significant unfunded defined benefit plans are operated in Austria and Germany, and funded plans are operated primarily 
in the UK. These plans are established in accordance with applicable local labour legislation and/or collective agreements with 
participating employees.

The benefits are based on a variety of factors, the most significant of which are a combination of pensionable service and final salary. 
A number of these plans also provide additional benefits in the event of death in service, disability or ill-health retirement, which are 
derived from the final salary benefit formula.

The assets of the funded plans are held separately in independently administered funds, in accordance with statutory requirements or 
local practice where those funds are operated. The boards of trustees of these plans are required to act in the best interests of the plans 
and all relevant stakeholders of the plans (active employees, inactive employees, retirees and employers), and are responsible for the 
Investment policy with regard to the assets of the plans.

The post-retirement medical plans provide health benefits to retired employees and certain of their dependants. Eligibility for cover 
is dependent upon certain criteria. The South African plan is unfunded and has been closed to new participants since 1 January 1999.

Except for the actuarial risks set out below, the Group has not identified any additional specific risks in respect of these plans.

Notes to the consolidated financial statements
for the year ended 31 December 2023 continued

24 Retirement benefits continued
Defined benefit plans typically expose the Group to the following actuarial risks:

Investment risk (asset volatility)

Interest risk

Longevity risk

Salary risk

Medical cost inflation risk

The present value of the net retirement benefit liability/asset is calculated using a discount rate 
determined by reference to high-quality bond yields. If the return on plan assets is below this 
rate, it will create a plan deficit that needs to be funded/guaranteed by the employer. 
A decrease in the bond interest rate will increase plan liabilities; however, this will be partially 
offset by an increase in the value of the plan’s fixed rate debt instruments.
The present value of the net retirement benefit liability/asset is calculated by reference to the 
best estimate of the mortality of plan participants both during and after their employment. 
An increase in the life expectancy of the plan participants will increase the plan liabilities.
The present value of the net retirement benefit liability/asset is calculated by reference to the 
expected future salaries of plan participants. An increase in the salary of the plan participants will 
increase the plan liabilities.
The present value of the post-retirement medical plans is calculated by reference to expected 
future medical costs. An increase in medical cost inflation will increase the plan liabilities.

Independent qualified actuaries carry out full valuations every year using the projected unit credit method.

Actuarial assumptions
The weighted average principal assumptions used in the actuarial valuations are detailed below:

Discount rate

Rate of inflation

Rate of increase in salaries

Rate of increase of pensions in payment

The majority of the Group’s plan assets are located in two UK pension schemes. These schemes are closed, have no active members 
and have undertaken ‘buy-ins’ in 2022 and 2023 by purchasing insured annuity contracts to fund their future liabilities. The next stage 
for these two schemes is to complete buy-outs by transferring their liabilities to third parties, followed by the closure of these schemes. 
The purchased insured annuity contracts exactly fund the future payment benefits of the scheme, eliminating the risks for future 
scheme deficits. 
The fair values of plan assets are determined in accordance with IAS 19.

The actual return on plan assets in respect of defined benefit plans was €nil (2022: loss of €41 million).

The market value of assets is used to determine the funding level of the plans and is sufficient to cover 83% (2022: 91%) of the benefits which 
have accrued to members, after allowing for expected increases in future earnings and pensions. Companies within the Group are paying 
contributions at rates agreed with the plans’ trustees and in accordance with local independent actuarial advice and statutory provisions. 

In certain jurisdictions, Group plans are subject to minimum funding requirements. At 31 December 2023, these minimum funding 
requirements did not give rise to the recognition of any additional liabilities.

Sensitivity analyses
The sensitivity analyses below have been determined based on reasonably possible changes to the respective assumptions occurring 
at the end of the financial year, while holding all other assumptions constant.

The sensitivity analyses may not be representative of the actual changes in the net retirement benefits asset/(liability), as it is unlikely that 
the changes in assumptions would occur in isolation of one another and some of the assumptions may be inter-related. The projected 
unit credit method was used to calculate the sensitivity analyses below.

The sensitivity table is based on a 1% change by reference to the movement in actuarial assumptions in the tables above; however, 
the estimates may vary by greater amounts. Therefore, the Board considers the retirement benefit obligations a significant 
accounting estimate.

25 Business combinations
To 31 December 2023
On 12 January 2023, the Group completed the acquisition of the Duino mill near Trieste (Italy) from the Burgo Group. The mill operated 
one paper machine producing lightweight coated mechanical paper. During the year, production was permanently stopped and a 
€200 million investment to convert the existing paper machine into a 420,000 tonne per annum high-quality, cost-competitive recycled 
containerboard machine commenced, with start-up expected in 2025. For the year ended 31 December 2023, the mill generated revenue 
of €21 million and a loss after tax of €11 million, which have been included in the consolidated income statement. The loss is primarily 
attributable to the annual depreciation of property, plant and equipment and expenses for the integration of the mill into the 
Group’s structure.

Details of the net assets acquired, as adjusted from book to fair value, are as follows:

Transaction costs of €2 million were charged to other net operating expenses in the consolidated income statement.

The purchase price allocation resulted in a gain on bargain purchase of €2 million as the fair value of net assets acquired was in excess 
of the consideration paid. The gain on bargain purchase is attributable to the need for investment. This corresponds with the Group’s 
investment plans to convert the paper machine and the limited reusability of certain assets after the conversion and the future costs 
associated with the mill while the conversion is pending. The gain was recognised in other net operating expenses in the consolidated 
income statement. 

The fair values of assets acquired and liabilities assumed in business combinations are level 3 measures in terms of the fair value 
measurement hierarchy. Property, plant and equipment has been measured at fair value using relevant valuation methods accepted under 
IFRS 13, 'Fair Value Measurement', with related deferred tax adjustments. Management has considered the impact of environmental and 
climate risks on the estimated fair values of Duino's property, plant and equipment. These considerations did not have a material impact.

To 31 December 2022
There were no business combinations during the year ended 31 December 2022.

On 30 June 2022, the Group sold its Personal Care Components (PCC) business to Nitto Denko Corporation for an enterprise value of 
€615 million. The sale enabled the Group to simplify its portfolio and focus on its strategic priority to grow in sustainable packaging. PCC 
manufactured a range of components for personal and home care products needed in everyday life such as diapers, feminine care, adult 
incontinence and wipes.

The cash and cash equivalents of €1,592 million (2022: €1,067 million) include money market funds of €840 million (2022: €595 million) 
valued at fair value through profit and loss, with the remaining balance carried at amortised cost.

The Group operates in certain countries where the existence of exchange controls or access to hard currency may restrict the use 
of certain cash balances outside of those countries. These restrictions are not expected to have any material effect on the Group’s ability 
to meet its ongoing obligations.

The fair values of cash and cash equivalents carried at amortised cost approximate their carrying values presented.

Notes to the consolidated financial statements
for the year ended 31 December 2023 continued

27 Consolidated cash flow analysis continued
The Group incurred interest expense of €122 million (2022: €140 million) in relation to bank overdrafts, loans and lease liabilities. Included 
in this expense is €53 million (2022: €67 million) relating to forward exchange rates on derivative contracts and interest paid on 
borrowings of €50 million (2022: €60 million).

28 Russian operations (discontinued operations)
On 4 May 2022, the Board decided to divest the Group’s Russian assets and subsequently concluded, in June 2022, that the Russian 
operations satisfied the criteria to be classified as held for sale and that they should also be classified as discontinued operations.

With the completion of the disposal of its Russian packaging converting operations and its Syktyvkar mill on 30 June 2023 and 
4 October 2023 respectively, as further described below, the Group has concluded its exit from Russia and the net proceeds from the 
sale of its Russian assets were distributed to shareholders on 13 February 2024 by way of a special dividend (see notes 9, 22 and 34 
for further details).

Syktyvkar mill
On 12 August 2022, the Group entered into an agreement to sell its Syktyvkar mill, comprising JSC Mondi Syktyvkar together with two 
affiliated entities, to Augment Investments Limited (Augment).

On 5 June 2023, following discussions with Augment on its lack of progress in gaining the necessary approval from the Russian 
Federation’s Government Sub-Commission for the Control of Foreign Investments to complete this transaction, the Group withdrew 
from the agreement with Augment.

At that time, the Board remained committed to the divestment of the Syktyvkar mill. Following the withdrawal, the Group entered into 
dialogue with a number of potential buyers and the Group had received conditional offers for the Syktyvkar mill. In approximating a fair 
value less costs to sell as at 30 June 2023 in the context of the Group’s half-year results for the period then ended, the Board considered 
the offers received to date and also obtained an independent valuation by an authorised valuer in Russia. As reported at the half year, 
the available information suggested a range of fair values, and there were ongoing negotiations with the potential buyers about various 
aspects of their offers which meant that the final offer price and the associated assets within the perimeter of the transaction were not, 
in the case of all offers, clearly defined. Based on all information available at the time of the half-year results being published, the Group 
impaired the Syktyvkar mill by €97 million, net of related tax, to its estimated fair value less costs to sell as at 30 June 2023.

On 17 September 2023, the Group announced that it had entered into an agreement to sell its Syktyvkar mill to Sezar Invest LLC (Sezar 
Invest) for a total cash consideration of RUB 80 billion. The disposal was completed and ownership of the Syktyvkar mill was transferred 
to Sezar Invest on 4 October 2023 after the Group had received RUB 57 billion (€547 million) into its London bank account and a letter 
of credit for the remaining RUB 23 billion. The final two instalments of the consideration for RUB 23 billion (€229 million) were received 
in November and December 2023 respectively, resulting in total proceeds received in cash of €776 million.

The Group’s contingent liabilities as at 31 December 2023 were €3 million (2022: €11 million). No acquired contingent liabilities have been 
recorded in the Group’s consolidated statement of financial position for either year presented.

31 Financial instruments
The Group’s trading and financing activities expose it to various financial risks that, if left unmanaged, could adversely impact current or 
future earnings. Although not necessarily mutually exclusive, these financial risks are categorised separately according to their different 
generic risk characteristics and include market risk (foreign exchange risk and interest rate risk), credit risk and liquidity risk. The Group 
manages all of these financial risks in order to minimise their potential adverse impact on the Group’s financial performance.

The principles, practices and procedures governing the Group-wide financial risk management process have been approved by the 
Board and are overseen by the Executive Committee. In turn, the Executive Committee delegates authority to a central Treasury function 
(Group Treasury) for the practical implementation of the financial risk management process across the Group and for ensuring that 
the Group’s entities adhere to specified financial risk management policies. Group Treasury continually reassesses and reports on the 
financial risk environment, identifying, evaluating and hedging financial risks by entering into derivative contracts with counterparties 
where appropriate. The Group does not take speculative positions on derivative contracts.

(b) Fair value measurement
There have been no transfers of assets or liabilities between levels of the fair value hierarchy during the year.

Except as detailed below, the carrying values of financial instruments at amortised cost as presented in the consolidated financial 
statements approximate their fair values.

1,956 

The fair values of the Eurobonds represent level 1 fair values and are estimated with reference to the last price quoted in the secondary 
market. The fair values of all other borrowings represent level 3 fair values and are estimated by discounting the future contractual cash 
flows at the current market interest rate that is available to the Group for similar financial instruments.

(c) Financial risk management
Market risk
The Group’s activities expose it primarily to foreign exchange and interest rate risk. Both risks are actively monitored on a regular basis 
and managed through the use of foreign exchange contracts and interest rate swaps as appropriate. Although the Group’s cash flows are 
exposed to movements in key input and output prices, such movements represent the commercial rather than financial risks inherent 
to the Group.

Foreign exchange risk
The Group operates globally and is exposed to foreign exchange risk in the normal course of its business. Multiple currency exposures 
arise from commercial transactions denominated in foreign currencies, recognised financial assets and liabilities (monetary items) 
denominated in foreign currencies and translational exposure on net investments in non-euro operations.

Foreign exchange contracts
The Group’s Treasury policy requires subsidiaries to actively manage foreign currency transactional exposures against their functional 
currencies by entering into foreign exchange contracts. For segmental reporting purposes, each subsidiary enters into, and accounts 
for, foreign exchange contracts with Group treasury or with counterparties that are external to the Group, whichever is more 
commercially appropriate.

Only material balance sheet exposures and highly probable forecast capital expenditure transactions are hedged.

Foreign currency sensitivity analysis
Foreign exchange risk sensitivity analysis has been performed on the foreign currency exposures inherent in the Group’s financial assets 
and financial liabilities at the reporting dates presented, net of related foreign exchange contracts. The sensitivity analysis provides an 
indication of the impact on the Group’s reported earnings of reasonably possible changes in the currency exposures embedded within 
the functional currency environments that the Group operates in. In addition, an indication is provided of how reasonably possible 
changes in foreign exchange rates might impact on the Group’s equity, as a result of fair value adjustments to foreign exchange 
contracts designated as cash flow hedges. Reasonably possible changes are based on an analysis of historical currency volatility, 
together with any relevant assumptions regarding near-term future volatility.

Notes:
1 Presented in euro, the presentation currency of the Group.

2 Net monetary exposures represent financial assets less financial liabilities denominated in currencies other than the applicable functional currency, adjusted for the effects of 

foreign exchange risk hedging, excluding cash flow hedging of non-monetary assets and liabilities.

3 Included in the other net monetary exposure is €nil (2022: €148 million) worth of Russian rouble dividend receivable.
Functional to foreign currency net monetary exposure sensitivity
Functional to foreign currency net monetary exposure sensitivity is €1 million or less for each major currency assuming a 5% appreciation 
and/or depreciation of functional currency, with the exception of euro which has an exposure sensitivity of €1 million (2022: €7 million) 
and Egyptian pound of €4 million (2022: €3 million).

Interest rate risk
The Group holds cash and cash equivalents, which earn interest at a variable rate, and has variable and fixed rate debt in issue. 
Consequently, the Group is exposed to interest rate risk. Although the Group has fixed rate debt in issue, the Group’s Accounting policy 
stipulates that all borrowings are held at amortised cost. As a result, the carrying value of fixed rate debt is not sensitive to changes in 
credit conditions in the relevant debt markets, and there is, therefore, no exposure to fair value interest rate risk.

Management of cash and cash equivalents
Cash and cash equivalents comprise cash on hand and demand deposits, together with short-term highly liquid investments which have 
a maturity of three months or less from the date of acquisition. Centralised cash pooling arrangements are in place, which ensure that 
cash is utilised most efficiently for the ongoing working capital needs of the Group’s operating units and, in addition, to ensure that the 
Group earns the most advantageous rates of interest available.

Management of variable rate debt
The Group has multiple variable rate debt facilities, of which the most significant is the Syndicated Revolving Credit Facility (see note 20).

The Group’s cash and cash equivalents act as a natural hedge to movements in the relevant interbank lending rates on its variable rate 
debt, subject to any interest rate differentials that exist between the Group’s corporate saving and lending rates.

Net variable rate debt sensitivity analysis
The net variable rate exposure represents variable rate debt less the future cash outflows swapped from variable to fixed via interest 
rate swap instruments and cash and cash equivalents. Reasonably possible changes in interest rates have been applied to the net 
variable rate exposure, denominated by currency, in order to provide an indication of the possible impact on the Group’s consolidated 
income statement.

Included in other is net variable exposure to various currencies, the most significant of which is Turkish lira (2022: Turkish lira and 
South African rand).

The potential impact on the Group’s consolidated equity resulting from the application of a 50 basis point increase to the variable interest 
rate exposure would be a profit of €8 million and vice versa for a 50 basis point reduction.

In addition to the above, the Group swaps euro debt into other currencies through the foreign exchange market using foreign exchange 
contracts, which has the effect of exposing the Group to the interest rates of these currencies. The currencies swapped into/(out of)

Credit risk
The Group’s principal credit risk is the risk of customers defaulting on sales invoices raised. The Group’s exposure to the credit risk 
inherent in its trade receivables and the associated risk management techniques that the Group deploys in order to mitigate this risk 
are discussed in note 17. Additionally, the Group has credit risk on the investment of cash with certain financial institutions. The Group 
Treasury manages the risk on these investments within approved credit limits.

Several Group entities have also issued certain financial guarantees to external counterparties in order to achieve competitive funding 
rates for specific debt agreements entered into by other Group entities. None of these financial guarantees contractually obligates the 
Group to pay more than the recognised financial liabilities in the entities concerned. As a result, these financial guarantee contracts have 
no bearing on the credit risk profile of the Group as a whole.

Liquidity risk
Liquidity risk is the risk that the Group could experience difficulties in meeting its commitments to creditors as financial liabilities fall due 
for payment. The Group manages its liquidity risk by using reasonable and retrospectively assessed assumptions to forecast the future 
cash-generative capabilities and working capital requirements of the businesses it operates and by maintaining sufficient reserves, 
committed borrowing facilities and other credit lines as appropriate.

Forecast liquidity represents the Group’s expected cash inflows, generated principally from sales made to customers, less the Group’s 
expected cash outflows, related principally to the payment of employees, supplier payments and the repayment of borrowings plus the 
payment of any interest accruing thereon. The matching of these cash inflows and outflows rests on the expected ageing profiles of the 
underlying assets and liabilities.

Short-term financial assets and financial liabilities are represented primarily by the Group’s trade receivables and trade payables. 
The matching of the cash flows that result from trade receivables and trade payables typically takes place over a period of three to four 
months from recognition in the consolidated statement of financial position and is managed to ensure the ongoing operating liquidity 
of the Group.

Financing cash outflows may be longer-term in nature. The Group does not hold long-term financial assets to match against these 
commitments, but is significantly invested in long-term non-financial assets which generate the sustainable future cash inflows, net of 
future capital expenditure requirements, needed to service and repay the Group’s borrowings.

(d) Derivative financial instruments
At 31 December 2023, the Group recognised total derivative assets of €13 million (2022: €3 million) and derivative liabilities of €4 million 
(2022: €10 million). The net asset of €9 million (2022: net liability of €7 million) will mature within one year.

The notional amount of €2,678 million (2022: €1,710 million) is the aggregate face value of all derivatives outstanding at the reporting 
date. They do not indicate the contractual future cash flows of the derivative instruments held or their current fair value and, therefore, 
do not indicate the Group’s exposure to credit or market risks. Of the €2,678 million (2022: €1,710 million) aggregate notional amount, 
€2,643 million (2022: €1,698 million) relates primarily to the economic hedging of foreign exchange exposures on short-term 
inter-company funding balances, which are fully eliminated on consolidation.

Derivative financial instruments are subject to International Swaps and Derivatives Association (ISDA) master netting agreements. 
The amounts are not offset in the consolidated statement of financial position. The amount subject to an enforceable master netting 
arrangement or similar agreement that is not netted off is €4 million (2022: €3 million).

Hedging
The Group designates certain derivative financial instruments as cash flow hedges. The fair value gains/(losses) are reclassified from 
the cash flow hedge reserve to the consolidated income statement in the period when the hedged transaction affects profit and loss. 
For non-current non-financial assets, these gains/(losses) are included in the carrying value of the asset and depreciated over the same 
useful life as the cost of the asset.

The Group designates both the spot and forward elements of forward foreign exchange contracts to hedge its currency risk and applies 
a hedge ratio of 1:1. The Group determines the existence of an economic relationship between the hedging instrument and hedged item 
based on the currency, amount and timing of their respective cash flows. The Group’s policy is for critical terms of the forward exchange 
contracts to align with the hedged items and uses the same method to determine hedge ineffectiveness.

Fair value losses of €1 million (2022: gains of €1 million) were reclassified from the cash flow hedge reserve to property, plant 
and equipment during the current year. There were no fair value losses in the current year (2022: losses of €4 million) arising on 
cash flow hedges due to ineffectiveness which were charged to the (loss)/profit from discontinued operations in the consolidated 
income statement.

Mondi AG acquired 100% of the shares in Mondi Neusiedler GmbH and Ybbstaler Zellstoff GmbH for a purchase price of €10 each from 
Mondi SCP, a.s. and Obaly SOLO, s.r.o. respectively on 27 February 2023, thereby increasing the Group's effective ownership from 51% 
to 100% with no changes in the Group's ownership of Mondi SCP, a.s. and Obaly SOLO, s.r.o. 

34 Events occurring after 31 December 2023
Aside from the final ordinary dividend proposed for 2023 (see note 9), there have been the following material reportable events since 
31 December 2023: 

– On 5 February 2024, the Group announced the completion of the acquisition of Hinton Pulp mill in Alberta (Canada) from West Fraser 
Timber Co. Ltd (West Fraser) for a total consideration of USD 5 million. The mill has the capacity to produce around 250,000 tonnes 
of pulp per annum and will provide the Group with access to local, high-quality fibre from a well-established wood basket as part of a 
long-term partnership with West Fraser. The Group intends to invest in the mill to improve productivity and sustainability performance 
and, subject to pre-engineering and permitting, expand the facility primarily with a new kraft paper machine which will integrate its 
paper bag operations in the Americas and support future growth.

– On 13 February 2024, the Group returned the net proceeds from the sale of the Group's Russian assets to shareholders by way of 
a special dividend of €1.60 per existing ordinary share. In addition, in order to maintain the comparability, so far as possible, of 
Mondi plc’s share price before and after the special dividend, the special dividend was accompanied by a share consolidation, which 
took effect on 29 January 2024, resulting in shareholders receiving 10 new ordinary shares for every 11 existing ordinary shares. 
See notes 9 and 22 for further details.

35 Accounting policies
Basis of consolidation
The consolidated financial statements incorporate the revenues, expenses, assets, liabilities, equity and cash flows of Mondi plc and its 
subsidiaries (the Group), and the Group’s share of associates and joint ventures drawn up to 31 December each year. All intra-group 
balances and transactions are eliminated.

A subsidiary is an entity over which the Group has control. Control is evident where the Group is exposed to, or has rights to, variable 
returns from its involvement with that entity and has the ability to affect those returns through its power over that entity.

The results of subsidiaries acquired or disposed of during the years presented are included in the consolidated income statement from 
the effective date of acquiring control or up to the effective date of disposal.

Non-controlling interests are measured, at initial recognition, as the non-controlling proportion of the fair values of the assets and 
liabilities recognised at acquisition.

After initial recognition, non-controlling interests are measured as the aggregate of the value at initial recognition and their subsequent 
proportionate share of profits and losses less any distributions made. 

Changes in the Group’s interests in subsidiaries that do not result in a change in control are accounted for as equity transactions. 
Any resulting difference between the amount by which the non-controlling interests are adjusted and the fair value of the consideration 
payable or receivable is recognised directly in equity and attributed to the shareholders.

Foreign currency transactions and translation
Foreign currency transactions
Foreign currency transactions are translated into the functional currency of the entity that has undertaken the transaction, using the 
exchange rates ruling on the dates of the transactions. At each reporting date, monetary assets and liabilities that are denominated in 
foreign currencies are translated at the rates prevailing on the reporting date. Gains and losses arising on translation are included in the 
consolidated income statement and are classified as either operating or financing consistent with the nature of the monetary item giving 
rise to them.

Translation of non-euro operations
The Group’s results are presented in euro, the currency in which most of its business is conducted. On consolidation, the assets and 
liabilities of the Group’s non-euro operations are translated into the presentation currency of the Group at exchange rates prevailing on 
the reporting date. Income and expense items, except those which arise in countries with hyperinflationary economies (see note 1), are 
translated at the average exchange rates for the month in which they occur, where these approximate the rates on the dates of the 
underlying transactions. Exchange differences, if any, are recognised directly in other comprehensive income, and accumulated in the 
Group’s currency translation adjustment reserve in equity. Such translation differences are reclassified to profit or loss only on disposal 
or partial disposal of the non-euro operation.

Hyperinflation accounting (note 1)
The Group has applied IAS 29, 'Financial Reporting in Hyperinflationary Economies', to its subsidiaries in Türkiye and Lebanon, whose 
functional currencies have experienced a cumulative inflation rate of more than 100% over the past three years. Assets, liabilities, the 
financial position and results of non-euro operations in hyperinflationary economies are translated to euro at the exchange rates 
prevailing on the reporting date. The exchange differences are recognised directly in other comprehensive income or expense, and 
accumulated in the Group’s cumulative translation adjustment reserve in equity. Such translation differences are reclassified to profit 
or loss only on disposal or partial disposal of the non-euro operation. 

Prior to translating the financial statements of the Turkish and Lebanese operations, the non-monetary assets and liabilities stated at 
historical cost are restated to account for changes in the general purchasing power of the local currencies based on the consumer price 
index (Turkish operations: TÜFE, 2003=100; Lebanese operations: CPI 2013=100) published by the Turkish Statistical Institute (TURKSTAT) 
and Central Administration of Statistics of the Lebanese Republic, respectively. Gains or losses resulting from the restatement of 
non-monetary assets and liabilities are recorded in the consolidated income statement as a net monetary gain or loss arising from 
hyperinflationary economies. Comparative amounts presented in euro are not restated for subsequent changes in the price level or 
exchange rates. The results of the Turkish and Lebanese operations are restated to the index level at the end of the period, with 
hyperinflationary gains and losses being reported in net monetary gain or loss arising from hyperinflationary economies.

Fair value measurement
Assets and liabilities that are measured at fair value, or where the fair value of financial instruments has been disclosed in notes 
to the consolidated financial statements, are based on the following fair value measurement hierarchy:

– Level 1 – quoted prices (unadjusted) in active markets for identical assets or liabilities

– Level 2 – inputs other than quoted prices included within level 1 that are observable for the asset or liability, either directly (that is, 

as prices) or indirectly (that is, derived from prices)

– Level 3 – inputs for the asset or liability that are not based on observable market data (that is, unobservable inputs)

 
    
Mondi Group Integrated report and financial statements 2023

218

Notes to the consolidated financial statements
for the year ended 31 December 2023 continued

35 Accounting policies continued
The assets measured at fair value on level 3 of the fair value measurement hierarchy are the Group’s forestry assets, as set out in note 14, 
and certain assets acquired and liabilities assumed in a business combination (see note 25). 

The fair values of financial instruments that are not traded in an active market (for example, over-the-counter derivatives) require a 
degree of estimation and judgement and are determined using generally accepted valuation techniques. These valuation techniques 
maximise the use of observable market data and rely as little as possible on Group-specific estimates.

Specific valuation methodologies used to value financial instruments include the following:

– The fair values of foreign exchange contracts are calculated as the present value of expected future cash flows based on observable 

yield curves and exchange rates.

– The fair values of the Group’s commodity price derivatives are calculated as the present value of expected future cash flows based 

on observable market data.

– Other techniques, including discounted cash flow analysis, are used to determine the fair values of other financial instruments.

Segmental reporting (note 2)
The Group’s operating segments are reported in a manner consistent with the internal reporting provided to the Executive Committee, 
the chief operating decision-making body. The operating segments are managed based on the nature of the underlying products 
produced by those businesses and comprise three distinct segments. The number of reportable segments is the same as the number 
of identified operating segments. 

Measurement of operating segment revenues, profit or loss, assets and non-current non-financial assets
Each of the operating segments derives its income from the sale of manufactured products.

The operating segment measures adhere to the recognition and measurement criteria presented in the Group’s accounting policies 
and are presented on an underlying basis, excluding special items. The Group has presented certain non-IFRS measures (Alternative 
Performance Measures), as defined on pages 238-241, by segment to supplement the user’s understanding. All intra-group transactions 
are conducted on an arm’s-length basis.

Revenue from contracts with customers (note 2)
Sale of goods
Revenue is recognised from the sale of goods and is measured at the amount of the transaction price received or receivable in exchange 
for transferring goods. The transaction price is the expected consideration to be received, to the extent that it is highly probable that 
there will not be a significant reversal of revenue in future, after deducting discounts, volume rebates, value added tax and other sales 
taxes. When the period of time between delivery of goods and subsequent payment by the customer is less than one year, no 
adjustment for a financing component is made.

Control of goods is passed when title and insurance risk have passed to the customer, which is typically when the goods have been 
delivered to a contractually agreed location.

The incremental costs of obtaining a contract are recognised as an expense when the period of amortisation over which the costs would 
have been recognised is one year or less. If not, these costs are capitalised and amortised on a basis consistent with the transfer of 
goods to the customer to which the asset relates.

Transport revenue
Transport revenue is considered distinct when the Group provides transport services after the point in time when control of goods 
has passed to the customer. Such revenue is recognised over time. 

Other income
Sale of green energy and CO2e credits (note 16)
Income generated from the sale of green energy and CO2e credits issued under international trading schemes are accounted for as 
government grants and are measured at the consideration received in exchange for transferring such credits. The income is recorded 
within other net operating expenses in the consolidated income statement when ownership rights pass to the buyer. Any unsold green 
energy credits are recorded in inventory at cost, which is often at nil value.

Insurance reimbursements (note 10)
Compensation for insurance reimbursements, including compensation for business interruptions and for the loss or impairment of property, plant 
and equipment, is recognised within other net operating expenses in the consolidated income statement when receipt is virtually certain. 

Fair value gains/(losses) from forestry assets (note 14)
Changes in the fair value of forestry assets are recognised within other net operating expenses in the consolidated income statement.

Investment income (note 6)
Interest income, which is derived from cash and cash equivalents and other interest-bearing financial assets, is accrued on a time 
proportion basis, by reference to the principal outstanding and at the applicable effective interest rate.

Taxation (note 7)
The tax expense represents the sum of the current tax charge and the deferred tax charge.

Current tax
The current tax charge is based on taxable profit for the year. The Group’s asset/liability for current tax is calculated using tax rates that 
have been enacted or substantively enacted by the reporting date. The Group is regularly subject to routine tax audits. Provision is made 
based on the tax laws in the relevant country and the expected outcomes of any negotiations or settlements. Current tax is presented as 
a special item if the corresponding taxable income/expense is accounted for as a special item. 

The Group is subject to corporate taxes in a number of jurisdictions and a degree of estimation and judgement is required in determining 
the appropriate tax provision for transactions where the tax treatment is uncertain. In these circumstances, the Group recognises 
provisions for taxes based on information available where the anticipated liability is both probable and estimable.

Deferred tax
Deferred tax is the tax expected to be payable or recoverable on temporary differences between the carrying amount of assets and 
liabilities in the Group’s consolidated financial statements and the corresponding tax bases used in the computation of taxable profits and 
is accounted for using the balance sheet liability method. Deferred tax is presented as a special item if the corresponding temporary 
difference arises from a special item.

Deferred tax liabilities are generally recognised for all taxable temporary differences and deferred tax assets are recognised to the extent 
that it is probable that future taxable profits will be available against which deductible temporary differences can be utilised. Such assets 
and liabilities are not recognised if the temporary differences arise from the initial recognition of goodwill or from the initial recognition, 
other than in a business combination, of other assets and liabilities in a transaction that affects neither the tax profit nor accounting profit 
and does not give rise to equal taxable and deductible temporary differences.

Deferred tax liabilities are recognised for taxable temporary differences arising on investments in subsidiaries and associates, except 
where the Group is able to control the reversal of the temporary difference and it is probable that the temporary difference will not 
reverse in the foreseeable future.

The carrying amount of deferred tax assets is reviewed at each reporting date. In considering their recoverability, the Group assesses 
the likelihood of the assets being recoverable within a reasonably foreseeable timeframe, typically a three-year period consistent with 
the period applied to the Group’s viability assessment. The carrying amount is reduced to the extent that it is no longer probable that 
sufficient taxable profit will be available to allow all or part of the asset to be recovered. Similarly, it is increased to the extent that it 
becomes probable that sufficient taxable profit will be available in the future for all or part of the deferred tax asset to be recovered.

Deferred tax is calculated at the tax rates that have been enacted or substantively enacted and which are expected to apply in the year 
when the liability is settled or the asset is realised. Deferred tax is charged or credited to the consolidated income statement, except to 
the extent that it relates to items recognised in other comprehensive income or directly in equity. In this case, the tax is also recognised 
in other comprehensive income or directly in equity, respectively.

Deferred tax assets and liabilities are offset when they relate to income taxes levied by the same tax authority and the Group intends 
to settle its current tax assets and liabilities on a net basis.

The Group applies the initial recognition exemption model to account for any investment tax credits. Deferred tax is not recognised 
for temporary differences relating to investment tax credits due to the availability of the initial recognition exemption.

The OECD Pillar 2 rules have been enacted in the United Kingdom and are effective for accounting periods beginning on or after 
31 December 2023, except for the Undertaxed Payments Rule (UTPR) which is still in draft and expected to be effective after 
31 December 2024 at the earliest. The Group is therefore within the enacted Pillar 2 rules from 1 January 2024. In light of recent 
amendments to IAS 12, 'Income Taxes', which clarify that Pillar 2 related balances are not within the scope of IAS 12 for deferred tax 
purposes, the Group has applied the exemption to recognising and disclosing information about deferred tax assets and liabilities arising 
from the implementation of the Pillar 2 rules. The Group’s ongoing assessment of the OECD Pillar 2 rules is provided in note 7.

Earnings per share (EPS) (note 8)
Basic EPS
The basic EPS is calculated by dividing net profit attributable to ordinary shareholders by the weighted average number of Mondi plc 
shares in issue during the year, net of own shares.

Diluted EPS
For diluted EPS, the weighted average number of Mondi plc ordinary shares in issue, net of own shares, is adjusted to assume conversion 
of all dilutive potential ordinary shares. At present these only include share awards granted to employees. Potential or contingent share 
issues are treated as dilutive when their conversion to shares would decrease EPS.

The weighted average number of ordinary shares in issue is the weighted number of shares in issue throughout the year and excludes 
own shares held by employee benefit trusts. A share consolidation combined with a special dividend reduces the weighted average 
number of ordinary shares in issue in the period when the transaction occurs from the date the special dividend is recognised.

Non-current non-financial assets excluding goodwill, deferred tax and net retirement benefit assets
Property, plant and equipment (note 10)
Property, plant and equipment principally comprise land and buildings, plant and equipment, assets under construction and other.

Property, plant and equipment is stated at cost less accumulated depreciation and impairment. Land and assets under construction are 
carried at cost less impairment. Cost includes site preparation, the purchase price of the equipment and directly attributable labour and 
installation costs. Cost may also include transfers from equity of any gains or losses on qualifying cash flow hedges of foreign currency 
purchases of property, plant and equipment. Borrowing costs are capitalised on qualifying assets. The capitalisation of costs ceases when 
the asset is in the location and condition necessary for it to be capable of operating in the manner intended by management. Start-up 
and ongoing maintenance costs are recognised immediately as an expense.

Depreciation is charged to the consolidated income statement so as to write off the cost of assets, other than freehold land and assets 
under construction, over their estimated useful lives on a straight-line basis to their estimated residual values of nil or scrap value. 
Depreciation commences when the assets are ready for their intended use.

Residual values and useful lives are reviewed and adjusted, if appropriate, at least annually. An adjustment is made to the estimated useful 
lives of assets where climate change is anticipated to have a material impact. Estimated useful lives range from 3 years to 25 years for 
items of plant and equipment and other categories and up to a maximum of 40 years for buildings.

Insurance reimbursements for the loss or impairment of property, plant and equipment are recognised within other net operating 
expenses in the consolidated income statement when receipt is virtually certain.

Leases (note 11)
To the extent that a right of control exists over an identified asset subject to a lease, a right-of-use asset, representing the Group’s right 
to use the underlying leased asset, is recognised within property, plant and equipment in the consolidated statement of financial position. 
A corresponding lease liability, representing the Group’s obligation to make lease payments, is recognised, depending on the maturity 
of the underlying lease payments, within short-term borrowings or medium- and long-term borrowings in the consolidated statement 
of financial position at the commencement of the lease.

The right-of-use asset is measured initially at cost and includes the amount of initial measurement of the lease liability, any initial direct 
costs incurred, including advance lease payments, and an estimate of the dismantling, removal and restoration costs required in terms 
of the lease. Depreciation is charged to the consolidated income statement so as to depreciate the right-of-use asset from the 
commencement date to the earlier of the end of the useful life of the right-of-use asset or the end of the lease term. The lease term 
shall include the period of an extension option where it is reasonably certain that the option will be exercised. Where the lease contains 
a purchase option, the asset is written off over the useful life of the asset when it is reasonably certain that the purchase option will 
be exercised.

The lease liability is measured at the present value of the future lease payments, including variable lease payments that depend on an index and 
the exercise price of purchase options where it is reasonably certain that the option will be exercised, discounted using the interest rate implicit in 
the lease, if readily determinable. If the implicit interest rate cannot be readily determined, the lessee’s incremental borrowing rate is used. Finance 
charges are recognised within finance costs in the consolidated income statement over the period of the lease.

Lease expenses for leases with a duration of one year or less and low-value assets are not recognised in the consolidated statement of 
financial position, and are charged to the consolidated income statement when incurred. Low-value assets are determined based on 
quantitative criteria.

Intangible assets and R&D expenditure (note 13)
Intangible assets are measured initially at purchase consideration and are amortised on a straight-line basis over their estimated useful 
lives. Estimated useful lives vary between 3 years and 10 years and are reviewed at least annually.

Research expenditure is expensed in the year in which it is incurred. Development costs are capitalised when the completion of the asset 
is both commercially and technically feasible and are amortised on a systematic basis over the economic life of the related development. 
Development costs are recognised immediately as an expense if they do not qualify for capitalisation.

Impairment of property, plant and equipment and intangible assets
At each reporting date, the Group reviews the carrying amounts of its property, plant and equipment and intangible assets to determine 
whether there is any indication that those assets are impaired. If any such indication exists, the recoverable amount of the asset is 
estimated. If the recoverable amount of an asset, or cash-generating unit (CGU) to which the asset relates, is less than its carrying 
amount, the carrying amount of the asset, or CGU, is reduced to its recoverable amount and an impairment recognised as an expense.

 
    
Mondi Group Integrated report and financial statements 2023

221

The recoverable amount of the asset, or CGU, is the higher of its fair value less costs to dispose and its value in use. In assessing value 
in use, the estimated future cash flows generated by the asset are discounted to their present value using a pre-tax discount rate that 
reflects current market assessments of the time value of money and the risks specific to the asset for which estimates of future cash 
flows have not been adjusted. Where the asset does not generate cash flows that are independent from other assets, the Group 
estimates the recoverable amount of the smallest CGU to which the asset belongs. 
Where the underlying circumstances change such that a previously recognised impairment subsequently reverses, the carrying amount 
of the asset, or CGU, is increased to the revised estimate of its recoverable amount. Such a reversal is limited to the carrying amount 
that would have been determined (taking into account depreciation or amortisation in the intervening period) had no impairment been 
recognised for the asset, or CGU, in prior years. A reversal of an impairment is recognised in the consolidated income statement.

Agriculture – owned forestry assets (note 14)
Owned forestry assets are biological assets measured at fair value less costs to sell, calculated by applying the expected selling price, 
less costs to harvest and deliver, to the estimated volume of timber on hand at each reporting date. The fair value less costs to sell is 
determined using a market-based approach. The estimated volume of timber on hand is determined based on the maturity profile of 
the area under afforestation, the species, the geographic location, climate and other environmental considerations and excludes future 
growth. The product of these is then adjusted for risks associated with forestry assets.

Changes in fair value are recognised in the consolidated income statement within other net operating expenses. At point of harvest, the 
carrying value of forestry assets is transferred to inventory and recorded as a felling cost reduction to the fair value of forestry assets.

Directly attributable costs incurred during the year of biological growth and investments in standing timber are capitalised and presented 
within cash flows from investing activities.

Investments in joint ventures (note 15)
A joint venture is an entity in which the Group holds a long-term interest with contractually agreed sharing of control over the strategic, 
financial and operating decisions with one or more other venturers. Typically, the Group owns between 20% and 50% of the voting equity 
of its joint ventures. Investments in joint ventures are accounted for using the equity method, after initially being recognised at cost in the 
consolidated statement of financial position.

The Group’s share of the profit or loss of joint ventures is recognised in net profit/(loss) from joint ventures. Any impairment is presented 
adjacent to the share of the joint venture’s results in impairment of investments in joint ventures in the consolidated income statement.

Non-current assets held for sale and discontinued operations (note 28)
Non-current assets, and disposal groups, are classified as held for sale if their carrying amount will be recovered through a sale 
transaction rather than through continuing use. For this to be the case, the asset (or disposal group) must be available for immediate sale 
in its present condition subject only to terms that are usual and customary for sales of such assets (or disposal groups), and its sale must 
be highly probable. Non-current assets, and disposal groups, classified as held for sale are measured at the lower of carrying amount 
and fair value less costs to sell from the date on which these conditions are met. The deferred tax assets, assets arising from employee 
benefits and financial assets are specifically exempt from this requirement. 

Any resulting impairment is reported through the consolidated income statement. From the time of classification as held for sale, the 
assets are no longer depreciated or amortised. Interest and other expenses attributable to the liabilities of a disposal group classified 
as held for sale continue to be recognised. Comparative amounts in the consolidated statement of financial position are not adjusted. 

Discontinued operations are either a separate major line of business or geographical area of operations that have been disposed of or 
are part of a single coordinated plan for disposal which satisfy the held for sale criteria. The discontinued operations' net profit or loss, 
other comprehensive income or expense and cash flows for current and comparative periods are presented separately in the consolidated 
income statement, the consolidated statement of comprehensive income and the consolidated statement of cash flows, including related 
notes to these statements. Non-current assets classified as held for sale and the assets of a disposal group classified as held for sale are 
presented separately from the other assets in the consolidated statement of financial position. The liabilities of a disposal group classified 
as held for sale are presented separately from other liabilities in the consolidated statement of financial position.

Business combinations (note 25)
Identifiable net assets
The identifiable assets acquired and liabilities and contingent liabilities assumed in a business combination are, with limited exceptions, 
measured initially at their fair values on the acquisition date. If the initial accounting for assets and liabilities is incomplete by the end of 
the reporting period in which the combination occurs, the Group reports provisional fair values. The measurement period ends no later 
than 12 months from the acquisition date. Any non-controlling interest in the acquiree is recorded at the non-controlling interest’s 
proportionate share of the acquired net assets.

Cost of a business combination
The cost of a business combination includes the fair value of assets provided, liabilities incurred or assumed and any equity instruments 
issued by a Group entity, in exchange for control of an acquiree. The directly attributable costs associated with a business combination 
are expensed as incurred and recognised within other net operating expenses into the consolidated income statement.

Notes to the consolidated financial statements
for the year ended 31 December 2023 continued

35 Accounting policies continued
Goodwill (note 12)
Any excess of the consideration of the acquisition over the fair values of the identifiable net assets acquired is attributed to goodwill. 
Goodwill is subsequently measured at cost less any impairment.

Impairment of goodwill
Goodwill acquired through business combinations is allocated to the group of CGUs that is expected to benefit from the synergies of the 
combination and represents the lowest level at which goodwill is monitored for internal management purposes. The recoverable amount 
of the group of CGUs to which goodwill has been allocated is tested for impairment annually in the fourth quarter of each financial year 
and when events or changes in circumstances indicate that it may be impaired.

The recoverable amount of a group of CGUs is determined based on the higher of value in use or its fair value less costs of disposal. 
Value-in-use calculations use cash flow projections based on financial budgets covering a three-year period that are based on the latest 
forecasts for revenue and costs as approved by the Board. Projected revenues and costs are determined taking into consideration 
relevant industry forecasts for individual product lines, climate change, internal management projections, historical performance and 
announced industry capacity changes.

Cash flow projections beyond three years are based on internal management projections. Growth rates in the countries in which the 
Group operates are determined with reference to published gross domestic product information, and for specific product lines are 
determined with reference to published industry studies.

The discount rate is derived from the Group’s weighted average cost of capital using published market data and published borrowing 
rates and adjusted for country risk and tax.

Any impairment is recognised in the consolidated income statement. Impairments of goodwill are not subsequently reversed.

Current non-financial assets
Inventories (note 16)
Inventories are valued at the lower of cost and net realisable value. Cost is determined on the first-in, first-out (FIFO) or weighted 
average cost basis, as appropriate. Costs comprise direct materials and, where applicable, direct labour costs and those overheads that 
have been incurred in bringing the inventories to their present location and condition. Net realisable value is defined as the selling price 
less any estimated costs to sell.

Equity instruments
Own shares (note 22)
The purchase by any Group entity of Mondi plc’s equity instruments results in the recognition of own shares. The consideration paid or 
payable is deducted from equity. Where own shares are subsequently sold, reissued or otherwise disposed of, any consideration received 
or receivable is included in equity attributable to the shareholders of Mondi plc, net of any directly attributable incremental transaction 
costs and the related tax effects.

Dividend payments (note 9)
The dividend distributions to Mondi plc’s ordinary shareholders are recognised as a liability when the dividends are declared and 
approved. Final dividends are accrued when approved by Mondi plc’s ordinary shareholders at its Annual General Meeting and interim 
dividends are recognised when paid.

Share-based payments (note 23)
The Group operates a number of equity-settled, share-based compensation schemes. The fair value of the employee services received 
in exchange for the grant of share awards is recognised concurrently as an expense and an adjustment to equity. The total amount to 
be expensed over the vesting period is determined by reference to the fair value of the share awards granted, as adjusted for market 
performance conditions and non-market vesting conditions. Vesting conditions are included in assumptions about the number of awards 
that are expected to vest. At each reporting date, the Group revises its estimates of the number of share awards that are expected 
to vest as a result of changes in non-market vesting conditions. It recognises the impact of the revision to original estimates, if any, 
in the consolidated income statement, with a corresponding adjustment to equity.

Financial instruments (note 31)
Financial assets and financial liabilities are recognised in the Group’s consolidated statement of financial position when the Group 
becomes party to the contractual provisions of the instrument.

Financial assets and financial liabilities are initially measured at fair value. Transaction costs that are directly attributable to the acquisition 
or issue of financial assets and financial liabilities (other than financial assets and financial liabilities at fair value through profit or loss) are 
added to or deducted from the fair value of the financial assets or financial liabilities on initial recognition. Transaction costs directly 
attributable to the acquisition of financial assets or financial liabilities at fair value through profit or loss are recognised immediately 
in the consolidated income statement.

 
    
Mondi Group Integrated report and financial statements 2023

223

Cash and cash equivalents (note 27b)
Cash and cash equivalents comprise cash on hand, money market funds, demand deposits and short-term, highly liquid investments of a 
maturity of three months or less from the date of acquisition that are readily convertible to a known amount of cash and that are subject 
to an insignificant risk of changes in value. The money market funds are held at fair value through profit and loss, with the remaining 
balance of cash and cash equivalents carried at amortised cost. Bank overdrafts are shown within short-term borrowings in current 
liabilities in the consolidated statement of financial position. Cash and cash equivalents presented in the consolidated statement of cash 
flows are net of overdrafts and include cash and cash equivalents classified as assets held for sale.

Trade receivables (note 17)
Trade receivables are initially recognised at fair value and are subsequently measured at amortised cost using the effective interest rate 
method, less an allowance for impairment.

Impairment of trade receivables (note 17)
A simplified lifetime expected credit loss (ECL) model is used to assess trade receivables for impairment. ECL is the present value of 
all cash shortfalls over the expected life of a trade receivable. Expected credit losses are based on historical loss experience on trade 
receivables, adjusted to reflect information about current economic conditions and reasonable and supportable forecasts of future 
economic conditions. At the date of initial recognition, the credit losses expected to arise over the lifetime of a trade receivable are 
recognised as an impairment. 

Trade payables (note 18)
Trade payables are initially recognised at fair value and are subsequently carried at amortised cost using the effective interest rate 
method. 

Borrowings (note 21)
Interest-bearing loans and overdrafts are initially recognised at fair value, net of direct transaction costs. Borrowings are subsequently 
measured at amortised cost. Any difference between the proceeds, net of transaction costs, and the redemption value is recognised 
in the consolidated income statement over the term of the borrowings using the effective interest rate method.

Borrowing costs (note 6)
Interest on borrowings directly relating to the acquisition, construction or production of qualifying assets is capitalised until such time as 
the assets are substantially ready for their intended use. Where funds have been borrowed specifically to finance a project, the amount 
capitalised represents the actual borrowing costs incurred. Where the funds used to finance a project form part of general borrowings, 
the amount capitalised is calculated using a weighted average of rates applicable to relevant general borrowings of the Group during 
the construction period.

All other borrowing costs are recognised in the consolidated income statement in the period in which they are incurred.

Derivative financial instruments and hedge accounting (note 31d)
The Group enters into forward and swap contracts in order to hedge its exposure to foreign exchange, interest rate and commodity 
price risks.

Derivatives are initially recognised at fair value at the date a derivative contract is entered into and subsequently measured at fair value 
in the consolidated statement of financial position within financial instruments, and are classified as current or non-current depending 
on the maturity of the derivative.

Changes in the fair value of derivative financial instruments that are not formally designated in hedge relationships are recognised 
immediately in the consolidated income statement and are classified within operating profit or net finance costs, depending on the type 
of risk to which the derivative relates.

Cash flow hedges
The effective portion of changes in the fair value of derivative financial instruments that are designated as hedges of future cash flows 
are recognised directly in other comprehensive income and accumulated in equity. The gain or loss relating to the ineffective portion is 
recognised immediately in the consolidated income statement. If the cash flow hedge of a forecast transaction results in the recognition 
of a non-financial asset, then, at the time the asset is recognised, the associated gains or losses on the derivative that had previously 
been recognised in the Group’s cash flow hedge reserve in equity are included in the initial measurement of the asset. For hedges that 
do not result in the recognition of a non-financial asset, amounts deferred in the Group’s cash flow hedge reserve in equity are recognised in 
the consolidated income statement in the same period in which the hedged item affects profit or loss on a proportionate basis.

Hedge accounting is discontinued when the hedge relationship is revoked or the hedging instrument expires, is sold, terminated or 
exercised or no longer qualifies for hedge accounting. At that time, any cumulative gain or loss deferred in equity remains in equity and 
is recognised in the consolidated income statement when the forecast transaction is ultimately recognised. If a hedge transaction is no 
longer expected to occur, the net cumulative gain or loss deferred in equity is included immediately in the consolidated income statement.

35 Accounting policies continued
Retirement benefits (note 24)
The Group operates post-retirement defined contribution plans, post-retirement defined benefit pension plans and post-retirement 
medical plans for many of its employees. 

Defined contribution plans
For defined contribution plans, the amount charged to the consolidated income statement is the contributions paid or payable during 
the financial year.

Defined benefit pension plans and post-retirement medical plans
For defined benefit pension and post-retirement medical plans, actuarial valuations are performed at each financial year end using the 
projected unit credit method. The average discount rate for the plans’ liabilities is based on investment-grade-rated corporate bonds or 
similar government bonds of a suitable duration and currency. Plans’ assets are measured using market values at the end of the financial year.

The net retirement benefits liability recognised in the consolidated statement of financial position represents the present value of the 
defined benefit liability as reduced by the fair value of any plan assets.

Any increase in the present value of plan liabilities expected to arise from employee service during the year is charged to personnel costs 
as service costs. Past service costs resulting from plan amendments or curtailments and gains or losses on settlements are charged to 
personnel costs. A net interest expense or net interest income is calculated by applying the discount rate, on a per plan basis, to the net 
defined benefit liability or asset and recognised in the consolidated income statement within finance costs.

Remeasurements comprising actuarial gains and losses and the return on plan assets (after recognising the net finance charge) are 
charged or credited to equity in other comprehensive income, net of deferred tax, in the financial year in which they occur. 
Remeasurements recorded in other comprehensive income are not recycled to the consolidated income statement, but those amounts 
recognised in other comprehensive income may be transferred within equity.

Provisions (note 19)
Provisions are recognised when the Group has a present obligation as a result of a past event, which it is probable it will be required to 
settle. Provisions are measured at management’s best estimate of the expenditure required to settle the obligation at the reporting date, 
and are discounted to present value using country-specific discount rates for periods matching the duration of the underlying liability 
where the effect of discounting is material.

Notes to the Mondi plc parent company financial statements
for the year ended 31 December 2023

1 Accounting policies
Basis of preparation
Mondi plc meets the definition of a qualifying entity under Financial Reporting Standard 100 (FRS 100) issued by the Financial Reporting 
Council. Accordingly, the financial statements have been prepared in accordance with Financial Reporting Standard 101, ‘Reduced 
Disclosure Framework’ (FRS 101), as issued by the Financial Reporting Council and the Companies Act 2006.

As permitted by FRS 101, Mondi plc has taken advantage of the disclosure exemptions available under that standard in relation to 
share-based payments, financial instruments, capital management, presentation of comparative information in respect of certain items, 
presentation of a cash flow statement, standards not yet effective, impairment of assets and related party transactions. 

Where required, equivalent disclosures are given in the consolidated Group financial statements of Mondi plc, which are publicly available. 
The results, assets and liabilities of Mondi plc are included in the publicly available consolidated Group financial statements.

Mondi plc has made use of the exemption from presenting a profit and loss account, in accordance with Section 408 of the Companies 
Act 2006.

The financial statements have been prepared on a going concern basis. The assessment of going concern is disclosed in the Strategic 
report as part of the viability statement under the heading Going concern on page 81, which is incorporated by reference into these 
financial statements.

The financial statements are prepared on the historical cost basis. Historical cost is generally based on the fair value of the consideration 
given in exchange for the assets. The principal accounting policies adopted are described below. They have all been applied consistently 
throughout the year and the preceding year.

Principal accounting policies
The principal accounting policies applied by Mondi plc are the same as those presented in notes 1 and 35 to the Group’s consolidated 
financial statements, to the extent that the Group’s transactions and balances are applicable to the company financial statements. 
Principally, the accounting policies which are not directly relevant to the Mondi plc parent company financial statements are those relating 
to consolidation accounting, the recognition and subsequent measurement of goodwill and accounting in hyperinflationary economies.

The accounting policy, which is additional to those applied by the Group, is stated as follows:

Shares in Group undertakings
Shares in Group undertakings are stated at cost, less, where appropriate, provisions for impairment.

Impairment reviews are performed when there is an indicator that the carrying value of the shares in Group undertakings could exceed 
their recoverable amounts based on their value in use or fair value less costs to dispose. Value in use is calculated by discounting future 
expected cash flows. These calculations use cash flow projections based on Board-approved budgets and forecasts which reflect 
management’s current experience and future expectations of the markets in which the Group undertaking operates.

Costs incremental and directly attributable to the acquisition of investments are capitalised.

Critical accounting judgements and significant accounting estimates
The preparation of the financial statements of Mondi plc includes the use of estimates and assumptions. Although the estimates used are 
based on management’s best information about current circumstances and future events and actions, actual results may differ from those 
estimates. No critical accounting judgements or significant accounting estimates were identified.

2 Auditors' remuneration and employee information
Disclosure of the audit fees payable to the auditors for the audit of Mondi plc’s financial statements is set out in note 4 of the Group’s 
consolidated financial statements.

Mondi plc had 28 employees during the year (2022: 27).

Notes to the Mondi plc parent company financial statements
for the year ended 31 December 2023 continued

3 Share-based payments
The share schemes and the underlying assumptions used to estimate the associated fair value charge are set out in note 23 
of the Group’s consolidated financial statements.

4 Deferred tax
No deferred tax asset is recognised on gross temporary differences of €21 million (2022: €15 million) relating to share-based payment 
arrangements. Mondi plc has tax losses of €197 million (2022: €198 million) in respect of which no deferred tax asset has been 
recognised due to the low probability of future taxable profit streams or gains against which these could be utilised. Although Mondi plc 
receives dividend income from its subsidiaries, this dividend income is exempt from corporation tax.

5 Tangible assets
Mondi plc entered into an office building lease agreement for a total term of 10 years from 2 August 2021 and recognised a right-of-use 
asset of €3 million (2022: €3 million) accordingly. Corresponding lease liabilities are included in creditors and further split by maturity as 
presented in the balance sheet. The lease may only be terminated by Mondi plc after 5 years. Mondi plc does not intend to exercise the 
termination option, and thus it was not considered in the calculation of the right-of-use asset.

The shares in Group undertakings are in Mondi Investments Limited (incorporated in the UK), a wholly owned subsidiary which acts as an 
investment holding company, and Mondi South Africa (Pty) Limited (incorporated in South Africa), a wholly owned subsidiary which 
manages forestry operations and manufactures pulp, uncoated fine paper and containerboard.

7 Debtors: due within one year
Amounts held on deposit in a cash pool facility with a subsidiary of €1,131 million (2022: €600 million) are included in debtors: due within 
one year. No provision on expected credit losses is recognised at 31 December 2023 (2022: €nil). The carrying amount of such deposits 
held at amortised cost approximated their fair value at 31 December 2023 and at 31 December 2022.

8 Capital and reserves
Full disclosure of the called-up share capital of Mondi plc is set out in note 22 of the Group’s consolidated financial statements.

The merger reserve was recognised in respect of the simplification of the dual-listed company structure in 2019.

The capital redemption reserve is a statutory, non-distributable reserve into which amounts are transferred following the redemption 
or purchase of own shares out of distributable profits or, in certain circumstances, from the proceeds of a fresh issue of shares.

The share-based payment reserve is used to recognise the grant date fair value of options issued to employees but not exercised 
and the grant date fair value of shares awarded to employees but not yet vested.

9 Financial guarantees
Mondi plc has issued financial guarantees in respect of the UK pension schemes of its subsidiaries, obligations incurred in the ordinary course of 
business and the borrowings of other Group undertakings. The likelihood of these financial guarantees being called is considered to be remote, and 
therefore the estimated financial effect of issuance is €nil (2022: €nil). The fair value of these issued financial guarantees is deemed to be immaterial.

As the ultimate parent, Mondi plc has provided a statutory guarantee for any outstanding liabilities of those subsidiaries. All subsidiary 
undertakings have been included in the consolidation of the Group.

– Mondi Consumer Goods Packaging UK Limited (registered number: 05188170)

10 Events occurring after 31 December 2023
Aside from the final ordinary dividend proposed for 2023, included in note 9 of the Group’s consolidated financial statements, there has 
been the following material reportable event since 31 December 2023:

On 13 February 2024, the Group returned the net proceeds from the sale of the Group's Russian assets to shareholders by way of 
a special dividend of €1.60 per existing ordinary share. In addition, in order to maintain the comparability, so far as possible, of Mondi plc’s 
share price before and after the special dividend, the special dividend was accompanied by a share consolidation, which took effect on 
29 January 2024, resulting in shareholders receiving 10 new ordinary shares for every 11 existing ordinary shares. See notes 9 and 22 
of the Group’s consolidated financial statements for further details.

Group financial record 

Financial performance 2014–2023
On 4 May 2022, the Board decided to divest the Group’s Russian assets and subsequently concluded, in June 2022, that the Russian 
operations satisfied the criteria to be classified as held for sale and that they should also be classified as discontinued operations 
(see note 28). Income, expenses and cash flows for the years ended 2021 and thereafter are presented on a continuing basis and exclude 
the results from the Russian discontinued operations. Profit and cash flow measures for the years ended 2014 to 2020 include the results 
from Russian discontinued operations.

Alternative Performance Measures

The Group presents certain measures of financial performance, position or cash flows in the consolidated financial statements that 
are not defined or specified according to IFRSs and UK-adopted International Accounting Standards in order to provide additional 
performance-related measures to its stakeholders. These measures, referred to as Alternative Performance Measures (APMs), 
are prepared on a consistent basis for all periods presented in this report. 

By their nature, the APMs used by the Group are not necessarily uniformly applied by peer companies and therefore may not be 
comparable with similarly defined measures and disclosures applied by other companies. Such measures should not be viewed in 
isolation or as a substitute to the equivalent IFRSs measure.

Internally, the Group and its operating segments apply the same APMs in a consistent manner in planning and reporting on performance 
to management, the Executive Committee and the Board. Three of the Group’s APMs, underlying EBITDA, basic underlying EPS and 
ROCE, link to the Group’s strategy, as described on pages 22-23, and form part of the executive directors' and senior management's 
remuneration targets. 

The most significant APMs used by the Group are described below, together with a reconciliation to the equivalent IFRSs. 
The reconciliations are based on Group figures and represent the continuing operations of the Group, unless otherwise stated. 
The reporting segment equivalent APMs are measured in a consistent manner.

APM description and purpose
Special items
Special items are generally material, non-recurring items from continuing operations that exceed 
€10 million. The Audit Committee regularly assesses the monetary threshold of €10 million on a net 
basis and considers the threshold in the context of both the Group as a whole and individual operating 
segment performance. 

The Group separately discloses special items on the face of the consolidated income statement to 
assist its stakeholders in understanding the underlying financial performance achieved by the Group 
on a basis that is comparable from year to year.

Examples of special item charges or credits include, but are not limited to, significant restructuring 
programmes, impairment of assets or cash-generating units, profits or losses from the disposal of 
businesses, and the settlement of significant litigation or claims. 

Subsequent adjustments to items previously recognised as special items, including any related credits 
received subsequently, continue to be reflected as special items in future periods even if they do not 
exceed the quantitative reporting threshold. Subsequent adjustments to items, or charges and credits 
on items that are closely related, which previously did not qualify for reporting as special items, continue 
to be reported in the underlying result even if the cumulative net charge/credit over the years exceeds 
the €10 million quantitative reporting threshold. 

Underlying EBITDA
Operating profit before special items, depreciation, amortisation and impairments not recorded as 
special items provides a measure of the cash-generating ability of the Group's continuing operations 
that is comparable from year to year.

Additional information for shareholders

The disclosures below form part of the Directors’ report on pages 150-151 of this report.

Introduction
Set out below is a summary of certain provisions of Mondi’s articles of association (Articles) and applicable English law concerning 
companies (the Companies Act 2006). This is a summary only, and the relevant provisions of the Articles and/or the Companies Act 2006 
should be consulted (as applicable) if further information is required.

Share capital
Mondi’s issued share capital as at 31 December 2023 comprised 485,553,780 ordinary shares of 20 euro cents each (the Ordinary Shares) 
representing 100% of the total share capital. As at the date of this Integrated report, the issued share capital comprised 441,412,530 
ordinary shares of 22 euro cents each, following implementation of the share consolidation approved by shareholders at the General 
Meeting held on 15 January 2024. The share consolidation took effect on 29 January 2024.

Purchase of own shares
Subject to the provisions of the Articles and the Companies Act 2006, Mondi may purchase, or may enter into a contract under which it will or may 
purchase, any of its own shares of any class, including any redeemable shares. At the Annual General Meeting held on 4 May 2023, authority was 
given for Mondi to purchase, in the market, up to 24,277,689 Ordinary Shares. At the General Meeting held on 15 January 2024 to approve the 
payment of a special dividend and implementation of an associated share consolidation, this authority was replaced with a new authority allowing 
Mondi to purchase, in the market, up to 22,070,626 Ordinary Shares. This authority will expire at the conclusion of the Annual General Meeting 
to be held in 2024 and, in accordance with usual practice, a resolution to renew such authority for the next year will be proposed.
Ordinary Shares
Dividends and distributions
Subject to the provisions of the Companies Act 2006, Mondi may, by ordinary resolution, from time to time declare dividends not 
exceeding the amount recommended by the Board. The Board may pay interim dividends whenever the financial position of Mondi, 
in the opinion of the Board, justifies such payment.

The Board may withhold payment of all, or any part of any dividends or other monies payable in respect of Mondi’s shares, from a person 
with a 0.25% interest or more in nominal value of the issued shares, if such a person has been served with a notice after failure to provide 
Mondi with information concerning interest in those shares required to be provided under the Companies Act 2006.

Voting rights and restrictions
Subject to the Articles generally and to any special rights or restrictions as to voting attached by or in accordance with the Articles to any 
class of shares, at a general meeting, every member present in person has, upon a show of hands, one vote. Every duly appointed proxy 
has, upon a show of hands, one vote unless the proxy is appointed by more than one member, in which case the proxy has one vote for 
and one vote against if (i) the proxy has been instructed by one or more members to vote for the resolution and by one or more 
members to vote against the resolution or (ii) the proxy has been instructed by one or more members to vote either for or against the 
resolution and by one or more members to use their discretion as to how to vote. On a poll, every member who is present in person or 
by proxy has one vote for every fully paid share of which they are the holder.

In the case of joint holders of a share, the vote of the senior who tenders a vote, whether in person or by proxy, shall be accepted to the 
exclusion of the votes of the other joint holders, and for this purpose seniority shall be determined by the order in which the names stand 
in the register of members in respect of the shares. 

Under the Companies Act 2006, members are entitled to appoint a proxy, who need not be a member of Mondi, to exercise all or any 
of their rights to attend and to speak and vote on their behalf at a general meeting or class meeting.

A member may appoint more than one proxy in relation to a general meeting or class meeting provided that each proxy is appointed to 
exercise the rights attached to a different share or shares held by that member. A proxy is not entitled to delegate the proxy’s authority 
to act on behalf of a member to another person. A member that is a corporation may appoint one or more individuals to act on its behalf 
at a general meeting or class meeting as a corporate representative. Where a shareholder appoints more than one corporate 
representative in respect of its shareholding, but in respect of different shares, those corporate representatives can act independently 
of each other, and validly vote in different ways.

No member shall be entitled to vote either in person or by proxy at any general meeting or class meeting, or to exercise any other right 
conferred by membership in relation to such meetings, in respect of any shares held by them, if any call or other sum then payable by them to 
Mondi in respect of that share remains unpaid. In addition, no member shall be entitled to vote if they have been served with a notice 
after failing to provide Mondi with information concerning interests in those shares required to be provided under the Companies Act 2006.

The Articles provide a deadline for submission of proxy forms of not less than 48 hours before the time appointed for the holding of 
the meeting or adjourned meeting.

Variation of rights
Subject to the Companies Act 2006, the Articles specify that rights attached to any class of shares may be varied with the written 
consent of the holders of not less than three-quarters in nominal value of the issued shares of that class, or with the sanction of a special 
resolution passed at a separate general meeting of the holders of those shares. At every such separate general meeting, the quorum shall 
be two persons holding, or representing by proxy, at least one-third in nominal value of the issued shares of the class (calculated 
excluding any shares held as treasury shares).  

Mondi Group Integrated report and financial statements 2023

243

The rights conferred upon the holders of any shares shall not, unless otherwise expressly provided in the rights attaching to those shares, 
be deemed to be varied by the creation or issue of further shares ranking pari passu with them. Notwithstanding this, the relevant plan 
rules provide that any shares held by the trustee of the Mondi Share Incentive Plan from time to time will not be voted. 

Transfer of shares
All transfers of shares which are in certificated form may be effected by transfer in writing in any usual or common form or in any other 
form acceptable to the directors. The instrument of transfer shall be signed by, or on behalf of, the transferor and (except in the case 
of fully paid shares) by, or on behalf of, the transferee and shall specify the name of the transferor, the name of the transferee and the 
number of shares being transferred. The transferor shall remain the holder of the shares concerned until the name of the transferee is 
entered into the register of members in respect of those shares. Transfers of shares which are in uncertificated form are effected by 
means of the CREST system.

The directors may refuse to register an allotment or transfer of shares (whether fully paid or not) in favour of more than four persons 
jointly. If the directors refuse to register an allotment or transfer they shall, within two months after the date on which the letter of 
allotment or transfer was lodged with Mondi, send to the allottee or transferee a notice of the refusal.

The directors may decline to register any instrument of transfer unless the instrument of the transfer: (i) is in respect of only one class 
of share; (ii) is lodged at the transfer office (duly stamped if required), accompanied by the relevant share certificate(s) and such other 
evidence as the directors may reasonably require to show the right of the transferor to make the transfer (and, if the instrument 
of transfer is executed by some other person on their behalf, the authority of that person to do so); and (iii) is fully paid.

Subject to the Companies Act 2006 and regulations and applicable CREST rules, the directors may determine that any class of shares 
may be held in uncertificated form and that title to such shares may be transferred by means of the CREST system, or that shares of any 
class should cease to be so held and transferred.

A shareholder does not need to obtain the approval of Mondi, or of other shareholders of Mondi, for a transfer of shares to take place.

Notwithstanding the above, some of the Mondi employee share plans include restrictions on transfer of shares while the shares are 
subject to such plan.

Directors
Directors shall be no less than four and no more than 20 in number. A director is not required to hold any shares of Mondi by way of 
qualification. Mondi may by special resolution increase or reduce the maximum or minimum number of directors. Each director shall retire 
at the Annual General Meeting held in the third calendar year following the year in which the director was elected or last re-elected by 
Mondi, or at such earlier Annual General Meeting as the directors resolve. A retiring director shall be eligible for re-election. 

The Board may appoint any person to be a director (so long as the total number of directors does not exceed the limit prescribed in 
the Articles). Any such director shall hold office only until the next Annual General Meeting (or if the notice of the next Annual General 
Meeting has already been sent at the time of such person’s appointment, the Annual General Meeting following that one) and shall then 
be eligible for re-election.

Subject to the Articles, the Companies Act 2006 and any directions given by special resolution, the business of Mondi will be managed 
by the Board which may exercise all the powers of Mondi.

The Board may exercise all the powers of Mondi to borrow money and to mortgage or charge any of its undertaking, property and 
uncalled capital and to issue debentures and other securities, whether outright or as collateral security for any debt, liability or obligation 
of Mondi or of any third party.

Indemnities
As at the date of this report, indemnities are in force under which Mondi has agreed to indemnify its directors, to the extent permitted by 
law and the Articles in respect of all losses arising out of, or in connection with, the execution of their powers, duties and responsibilities, 
as directors of Mondi or any of its subsidiaries. 

Significant agreements: change of control
All of Mondi’s employee share plans contain provisions relating to a change of control. Outstanding awards and options would normally 
vest and become exercisable on a change of control, subject to the satisfaction of any performance conditions at that time and under 
certain plans, time pro-rating. The Group also has in place certain borrowing facilities and banking arrangements, some of which could be 
cancelled, become immediately payable or subject to acceleration upon a change of control of Mondi. Of these arrangements, only one 
facility agreement is considered to be significant to the Group. In addition, a subsidiary of the Company is a party to a significant 
agreement (being a supply agreement) entitling the counterparty to terminate such agreement in certain circumstances if there is a 
change of control of the Company following a takeover. There are no other significant agreements that would take effect, alter or 
terminate upon a change of control following a takeover bid. 

Amendment of the Articles
Any amendments to the Articles may be made in accordance with the provisions of the Companies Act 2006 by way of special resolution.

Shareholder information continued

Dividends continued
Share certificates on Mondi plc’s South African register may not be dematerialised or rematerialised between Wednesday 3 April 2024 
and Friday 5 April 2024, both dates inclusive, nor may transfers between the UK and South African registers of Mondi plc take place 
between Wednesday 27 March 2024 and Friday 5 April 2024, both dates inclusive.

Dividend tax will be withheld from the amount of the gross final dividend paid to shareholders on the South African branch register 
at the rate of 20%, unless a shareholder qualifies for an exemption.

Your dividend currency
All dividends are declared in euro. Dividends are paid in euro with the following exceptions:

UK residents

South African residents

pound sterling

South African rand

Shareholders on the UK register resident in the UK may, however, elect to receive their dividends in euro, and shareholders on the UK 
register resident outside the UK may elect to receive their dividends in pound sterling. 

Shareholders on the UK register wishing to elect to receive their dividends in an alternative currency should contact Equiniti using 
the details provided.

Payment of your dividends
Mondi encourages shareholders to have dividends paid directly into their bank accounts, meaning the payment will reach you more 
securely and on the payment date, without the inconvenience of depositing a cheque.

Shareholders on the UK register:

– Shareholders wishing to receive dividends in euro or sterling can elect to receive dividends directly into their bank account via 

ShareView or by contacting Equiniti.

– Shareholders wishing to receive another local currency may be able to take advantage of the Overseas Payment Service offered 

by Equiniti. Find out more via ShareView or by contacting Equiniti.

Shareholders on the South African branch register:

– The 2019 interim dividend was the last dividend to be paid by cheque. Shareholders who previously received cheques should 

contact JSE Investor Services, if they have not already done so, to provide their bank details and ensure they continue to receive 
their dividends.

– Shareholders without a South African bank account are encouraged to dematerialise their shares with a CSDP in South Africa, as 

a CSDP is often able to pay dividends into foreign bank accounts. Find out more by contacting JSE Investor Services or any CSDP.

Reinvest your dividends
The dividend reinvestment plans (DRIPs) provide an opportunity for shareholders to have their cash dividends reinvested in Mondi plc 
ordinary shares.

The plans are available to all ordinary shareholders (excluding those in certain restricted jurisdictions). Fees may apply. 

If you wish to participate in the DRIPs, you can sign up via ShareView or by contacting either Equiniti in the UK or JSE Investor Services 
in South Africa as appropriate.

South African dematerialisation
Mondi encourages shareholders on the South African branch register to consider dematerialising their shares. By surrendering your 
share certificate, you will hold your shares electronically with a CSDP in South Africa, helping to prevent share fraud, theft and loss 
of share certificates. 

Find out more by contacting JSE Investor Services or any CSDP.

Taxation
Mondi is unable to advise shareholders on taxation. Your tax obligations will vary depending on your jurisdiction and financial 
circumstances. With regard to your Mondi shareholding, we recommend all shareholders maintain records of dividend payments, 
share purchases and sales. A dividend confirmation will be sent with all dividend payments. For further assistance, please speak 
to an independent professional tax or financial adviser.
