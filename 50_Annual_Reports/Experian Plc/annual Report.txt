Chair’s statement

Making a profound and positive difference 
to people’s lives

is made up of diverse industries located in 
various regions of the world. We offer products 
that help clients make better decisions for their 
businesses, regardless of what’s happening 
in the economy. 

Our strength comes from the diversity of our 
business, which allows us to access new 
growth opportunities, weather external 
challenges and thrive in difficult times. 
This has all helped deliver a strong track 
record of financial resilience.

This year we have continued to grow and 
diversify our business. We are extending our 
presence in Brazil by entering segments new 
to data-driven credit decisioning, including 
our expanding work in the farming and 
agricultural sector. We have built an auto 
insurance marketplace in the USA to help 
drivers shop around for cheaper deals on their 
car insurance. And we are further expanding 
into the income and employment verification 
market in both the USA and UK to support 
clients with their lending decisions.

Innovation
Whether in finance, healthcare, advertising 
or automotive, we are always looking for 
innovative ways to help our clients. We 
leverage artificial intelligence (AI) and machine 
learning across a broad spectrum, such 
as fraud prevention or healthcare, to help 
clients be more predictive and reduce risk. 
In healthcare, for example, we have launched 
a new product called AI Advantage which 
improves the processing of healthcare claims 
and makes the system more efficient for 
hospitals and patients. In fraud prevention, our 
Aidrian product makes shopping online safer 
by blocking suspicious users, while letting 
legitimate customers proceed with their 
transaction, resulting in businesses 
improving their revenue by up to 15%.

This year we continued to innovate with 
Experian Boost, our ground-breaking free 
offer, which helps consumers to provide a 
fuller financial picture of themselves. Experian 
Boost now also helps millions of renters 
improve their credit scores. By allowing 
consumers to add rent payments directly 
to their Experian credit file, Experian Boost 
stands apart as the only credit tool that can 
positively impact a consumer's FICO credit 
score instantly. This is another exciting step 
forward in making financial products 
accessible to more people.

Experian Go is a revolutionary tool that lets 
those without a credit history establish their 
financial identity with ease. Launched just over 
a year ago, this service has already helped 
over 130,000 people jumpstart their credit 
journey and begin building their credit history, 
and we are delighted it has been recognised 
in the 2023 BIG Innovation Awards and by 
Fast Company's World Changing Ideas 2023.

We take pride in making a positive impact on 
society, through how we support consumers, 
clients, colleagues and communities across the 
globe. We believe this approach is instrumental 
to our long-term business growth and we are 
very strongly committed to achieving our 
environmental, social, and governance goals.

Mike Rogers 
Chair

Introduction
Experian has had another strong year, driven 
by growth in new markets and demand for 
our innovative products. Our commitment to 
empowering people to overcome financial 
challenges is helping millions to achieve 
greater financial confidence, by equipping 
them with the resources and financial literacy 
tools that can help them to navigate the 
cost-of-living challenges posed by higher 
inflation and interest rates. 

We take immense pride in the profound and 
positive difference we can make in people’s 
lives when we deliver on our purpose.

Our diverse portfolio strengthens 
our resilience
We harness the power of extensive and 
unparalleled datasets in our markets, 
integrating data into advanced solutions that 
benefit businesses, individuals, and society 
as a whole. With data on 1.5 billion consumers 
and 201 million businesses, we possess a 
deep understanding of the needs of our clients 
and consumers, enabling us to develop 
new products which make life easier for 
consumers and more productive for our 
clients. Our ever-expanding client base 

Experian plc Strategic reportWe have also enhanced our Experian app 
in the USA, adding new ways to negotiate bills 
on behalf of Experian members, helping them 
save money by finding lower rates on cable 
television, internet and phone bills.

We are very proud that in the USA and in Brazil 
we are now recognised among the top 
financial services apps.

ESG
We take pride in making a positive impact on 
society, through how we support consumers, 
clients, colleagues and communities across 
the globe. We believe this approach is 
instrumental to our long-term business 
growth and we are very strongly committed 
to achieving our environmental, social, and 
governance (ESG) goals. 

As part of our sustainable business strategy, 
we have identified three UN Sustainable 
Development Goals to focus our efforts on. 
Our goal is to contribute meaningfully to 
improving access to credit and financial 
services. We achieve this through our 
innovative business products, social 
innovation, and community investments 
that help improve financial health for all.

In Brazil, our Serasa Limpa Nome platform 
continues to help people renegotiate their 
debts to more manageable payment plans. 
This year we helped renegotiate US$8.9bn of 
debt, of which US$7.1bn was written off, to help 
set even more people on the path to brighter 
financial futures.

We are passionate about positively impacting 
people's lives. To achieve this, we have 
progressed our Social Innovation programme 
that provides funding to explore innovative new 
solutions that offer societal benefits and new 
revenue streams. Since its launch, our current 
programme has successfully reached over 
100 million people, which is two years ahead 
of our original target. 

We recently launched our new Support Hub 
in the UK to help vulnerable customers. 
It helps to improve accessibility to essential 
businesses for people with disabilities by 
sharing their support needs with multiple 
organisations all at once in a few minutes. 
This eliminates the frustrating and 
time-consuming process of letting each 
service provider know individually, while 
helping our clients meet their regulatory 
requirements. 

In addition to our social innovation products, 
we have achieved our goal of connecting with 
100 million people through our United for 
Financial Health programme, a year earlier 
than planned. 

We are committed to playing our part in 
tackling climate change, and this year we 
made a significant step forward by reducing 
our Scope 1 and 2 carbon emissions by 38% 
from the previous year. This puts us ahead 
of schedule on meeting our target to reduce 
these emissions by 50% by 2030. As part of 
our plans to reduce our carbon emissions, 
we have increased our use of renewable 
electricity from 32% to 62%. Also, as part of 
our Scope 3 work in Purchased Goods and 
Services, we began engaging our suppliers 
regarding their carbon emissions, encouraging 
them to submit their emission data to the 
Carbon Disclosure Project (CDP). 

People
We are passionate about supporting and 
motivating our people. Our company culture 
emphasises diversity and inclusivity, ensuring 
that every individual's voice is heard and valued. 
This creates a positive and empowering 
environment where our employees can perform 
to the best of their abilities.

We have been accredited as a Great Place to 
Work in 22 countries, which is something we 
take great pride in. The survey's results show 
that 95% of our colleagues agree that everyone 
is treated fairly and equitably, regardless of 
their background or identity. We also see that 
our positive impact on the world motivates our 
people. 88% of our team members are proud 
to share that they work at Experian.

Glassdoor has also validated our workplace 
culture, giving us a global score of 4.4, well 
exceeding the average score of 3.74. This is an 
important metric for a few reasons: candidates 
use Glassdoor to assess whether they want to 
work at Experian, and existing employees use 
it to give their views on us as an employer. 

We’ve continued to make progress towards 
greater diversity in leadership positions, and 
now three of our five operating regions are led 
by women. We’re proud that our focus on 
creating an inclusive workplace has been 
recognised in Equileap’s 'Top 100 Globally for 
Gender Equality' for 2023, ranking us second in 
the USA and 21st globally. This reflects career 
and development opportunities being open to 
all, our parental leave and flexible workplace, 
as well as our approach to supporting diverse 
suppliers and human rights protections.

Our company strives to foster an environment 
where diversity, equity, and inclusion are 
not just buzzwords, but intrinsic values. 
By creating an inclusive and collaborative 
culture, we believe that we can create a 
workplace that empowers all individuals 
to thrive.

Governance and Board
As a company committed to strong corporate 
governance, we hold ourselves to the highest 
standards set out in the 2018 UK Corporate 
Governance Code. Through ongoing reviews 
and assessments, we strive to go above and 
beyond in creating an environment that is truly 
representative of the world we live in. 

The external Board evaluation undertaken 
during the year attests to our first-class 
governance and excellent performance. 
We are pleased that our Board is now 
composed of 45% women and has two 
ethnically diverse board members, going 
beyond the recommended guidelines for 
gender and ethnic diversity outlined by the 
FTSE Women Leaders Review and the 
Parker Review. 

I am pleased to share that we have recently 
welcomed three new non-executive directors 
to our Board: Kathleen DeRose, Louise 
Pentland and Esther Lee. Craig Boundy, our 
Chief Operating Officer (COO), also joined the 
Board as an executive director. I want to thank 
Deirdre Mahlan, George Rose, Dr Ruba Borno 
and Kerry Williams, who stepped down from 
the Board this year, for their significant 
contributions to Experian.

Looking ahead to a future 
ﬁlled with opportunity
This has been a year of success and 
momentum as highlighted through this Annual 
Report. Despite the uncertain economic 
climate, our business remains resilient with 
ambitious plans for expansion. 

Supported by product innovation and strong 
customer relationships, we achieved 7%1 
organic revenue growth and delivered 9% 
growth in Benchmark EPS – an impressive 
result that speaks volumes about our 
unwavering commitment to excellence. 

As we look to the year ahead, we are confident 
that the quality of our data, continued focus 
on product innovation, and our inclusive 
high-performance culture will continue to 
drive our success.

Chief Executive’s review

Delivering strong and resilient growth

We delivered a very strong performance in 
FY23, despite a challenging economic 
backdrop in many of our markets. It was driven 
by growth across all of our regions. Our past 
investments in data, technology, new products, 
client service and talent have enhanced our 
competitive position, resulting in significant 
new business wins. At the same time, the 
expansion of our product portfolio has 
positioned many of our businesses to address 
higher growth opportunities and over the years 
we have expanded existing vertical markets 
and entered new segments. This is reflected 
in the strong organic growth we saw in FY23, 
despite deceleration in some of our 
volume-based businesses. This progress also 
reflects our focus on improving the 
foundations of our business, a very strong 
culture of innovation and a powerful social 
mission to help people thrive financially. It is 
also down to the hard work of our 22,000 
people around the world who strive every day 
to make it happen. All of this has helped us to 
sustain our growth trajectory, offsetting the 
effects of the slower macroeconomic 
backdrop.

Very powerful structural growth trends drive 
our extensive growth opportunities. With large 
and growing addressable markets, we have 
many opportunities for long-term growth. 
In the near term, businesses need to improve 
productivity, deliver better digital experiences 
and build stronger customer relations, at the 
same time as improving risk management, 
assuring compliance and fighting fraud. 
Despite short-term pressures, clients continue 
to invest in these areas. Advances in 
technology continue at pace and will accelerate 
this. The power of our unique, proprietary 
datasets, and the significant advances we 
have made in the range and sophistication 
of our products, has and will continue to allow 
us to develop new ways to help customers to 
achieve their goals, and we believe these 
trends will expand our opportunity set. Our 
progress is illustrated by our strong client Net 
Promoter Score performance in every region, 
best-in-class employee engagement, and an 
increasing number of awards recognising this, 
such as Fortune’s America’s Most Innovative 
Companies.

So, while the coming year will likely see 
headwinds in the global economy, we are very 
confident in the strategic position of our 
business, in the resilience of our portfolio, and 
we are excited about the opportunities ahead.

We delivered very strong results in FY23, reflecting 
a combination of new business wins, new products 
and expansion into higher growth markets. 
We saw growth in every region, in many cases 
outperforming our underlying markets 
substantially. Total revenue growth from ongoing 
activities was 6% at actual exchange rates and 8% 
at constant exchange rates, and organic revenue 
growth was 7%. Benchmark EBIT margin expansion 
was at the top end of our expectations, helping us  
to deliver Benchmark earnings per share up 9%.

Experian plc Strategic reportStrategic highlights

Our performance in FY23 represented further 
progress on our strategic evolution. Our 
strategy is focused on enhancing the depth, 
breadth, quality and uniqueness of our 
datasets, to which we add advanced analytics 
and other sophisticated software solutions to 
address a range of client requirements, all 
built on the foundations of outstanding talent, 
great technology and world-class innovation. 
Our solutions address a wider range of client 
needs across identity, credit, fraud, compliance 
and marketing, and include capabilities such 
as strategy design, originations, ongoing 
customer management and collections. 
All of our new platforms are cloud based and 
leverage advanced technologies to deliver the 
best outcomes for our clients and consumers. 
Increasingly, they are integrated capabilities 
that combine with our datasets. More and 
more of these solutions in the future will 
address end-to-end capabilities, for example 
being able to move seamlessly from initial 
strategy design to an executable credit 
decision in one platform. This brings together 
the power of our data, with our industry-
leading platforms to create unique and 
differentiated solutions. 

A key component of our strategy is to grow and 
deepen our relationships with consumers, and 
we are now well on our way to becoming an 
unrivalled platform for consumer finance. 

These actions have positioned Experian to 
address large, growing markets which we 
estimate at over US$150bn in scale. Some 
notable data points in FY23, opposite, highlight 
the progress we are making.

Data assets enriched and extended
New expanded sources and user-
permissioned data help our clients manage 
credit risk and fraud prevention and 
transaction categorisation. For example, 
we have processed over 188 billion 
consumer-permissioned transactions in our 
global bureaux and are adding new sources 
of data such as buy-now-pay-later records. 

Ascend continues  
its growth trajectory
Now with 491 clients globally and Total 
Contract Value of US$471m. We are bringing 
more of our data and software platforms 
together and are further embedding 
analytics across Experian’s broader 
products and services to deliver more 
solutions to clients which are uniquely 
Experian. 

Our technology transformation  
is advancing rapidly
We have signed an agreement with Amazon 
Web Services (AWS) to be our preferred cloud 
provider globally, which will accelerate the 
rate of product innovation still further.

Consumer memberships  
continue to grow
We continue to grow consumer 
memberships, deepen customer relations 
and deliver new products to both our free 
and premium members. Free memberships 
have grown to 168 million. On a like-for-like 
basis, consumer membership was  
145 million, up 16% year-on-year, and our 
total now includes 13 million members from 
Spanish Latin America.

Signiﬁcant growth opportunities 
in Brazil 
The implementation of positive data and 
other regulatory reforms in Brazil are 
expanding the addressable market and 
enhancing growth opportunities. We now 
have c.200 positive data solutions in market 
and are delivering significant growth across 
data, scores, attributes, fraud, software 
platforms and much more.

Consumer Services now addresses 
half the Brazilian adult population
It has moved into profitability, and we are 
extending our presence into new services 
such as e-wallet to add functionality. 

Successfully repositioning Targeting 
We are successfully repositioning Targeting 
to address the larger addressable market 
of digital identity resolution to support 
marketers. Nearly 60% of North America 
Targeting revenues now arise from digital 
products, compared to 26% in FY19.

Further expansion of verticals
We have further expanded our vertical 
market presence with strong growth in 
North America Automotive and Health, 
Agribusiness in Brazil, as well as 
Verification and Employer Services.

  See note 10(a)(ii) to the Group financial statements for the Reconciliation of revenue from ongoing activities.

 a Revenue growth was in line with our 

expected performance range. Total revenue 
growth from ongoing activities was 6% at 
actual exchange rates and 8% at constant 
currency. Organic revenue growth was 7%. 
Organic revenue growth is determined on 
a constant currency basis and for ongoing 
activities.

 a All four of our reporting regions contributed 
positively to our performance. Organic 
revenue growth was 7% in North America, 
16% in Latin America and 5% in UK and 
Ireland (UK&I). EMEA/Asia Pacific organic 
revenue growth was 3%.

 a By quarter, organic revenue growth was 8% 

in Q1, 8% in Q2, 6% in Q3 and 7% in Q4. 
 a B2B organic revenue growth was 6%. 
We saw strong client adoption of our 
data-centric products, powerful analytics 
and world-leading platforms as we help our 
clients with their shift to digital, to optimise 
profitability and better manage risk. 

 a In Consumer Services organic revenue was 
up 11% with growth driven by marketplaces 
and memberships. We now have 168 million 
free consumer members globally.
 a We delivered strong Benchmark EBIT 

growth, up 9% at both constant and actual 
exchange rates.

 a The underlying margin improvement was at 
the top end of our expectations, Benchmark 
EBIT margin for ongoing activities was 
27.4%, compared to 26.2% in FY22 and a 
re-presented prior-year comparative 
margin of 26.6%. This represented 30 basis 
points underlying uplift, and a 50 basis 
points uplift from foreign exchange 
translation. 

 a We delivered strong growth in Benchmark 
earnings per share, which increased by 9%. 
Basic EPS was USc84.2 (2022: USc127.5), 
predominantly due to a goodwill impairment 
in EMEA of US$179m due to higher interest 
rates and macroeconomic weakness in our 
European markets, and an increase to the 
fair value of contingent consideration. 
 a We had another year of strong cash flow 

conversion. We converted 98% Benchmark 
EBIT into Benchmark operating cash flow. 
Benchmark operating cash flow was 
US$1.8bn. 

 a Return on capital employed (ROCE) was 

16.5%, up 80 basis points on the prior year. 

 a We ended the year with Net debt to 

Benchmark EBITDA at 1.8x, compared to our 
target range of 2.0-2.5x and we have no debt 
refinancing due until September 2024. 
Around 90% of our current debt is at fixed 
interest rates for the next two years.

Other financial developments

Benchmark profit before tax (PBT) was 
US$1,670m, up 9% at actual exchange rates, 
after a net interest expense of US$124m (2022: 
US$110m). Benchmark net finance expense 
increased modestly despite the large increase 
in market rates thanks to our forward rate 
fixing programme meaning the average 
interest rate on our Net debt was broadly 
stable at around 3%. For FY24, we expect net 
interest expense to be in the range of 
US$125-130m.

The Benchmark tax rate was 26.0% (2022: 
25.7%). For FY24, we expect a rate of around 
26-27%, taking into account expected profit 
mix for the year and an increase in the UK 
corporate tax rate.

Our Benchmark EPS was USc135.1, an increase 
of 9% at both constant and actual exchange 
rates. For FY24, we expect weighted average 
number of ordinary shares (WANOS) to be 
c.914m. 

Foreign exchange translation was neutral to 
Benchmark EPS. For FY24, we expect a foreign 
exchange translation effect of c.0% to +1% 
impact on revenue and Benchmark EBIT, 
assuming recent foreign exchange rates prevail. 

Non-benchmark items:

 a Statutory PBT was US$1,174m, down 
US$273m, as a result of increased 
non-benchmark costs.

 a Macroeconomic conditions have contributed 
to a non-cash impairment of goodwill of 
US$179m, partially offset by a gain on 
financing fair value remeasurements of 
US$51m. 

 a We have incurred a charge of US$45m for 
increased contingent consideration due to 
over-performance on prior acquisitions. 
 a We have also continued to execute on our 
plans to streamline our geographic and 
operational footprint in EMEA/Asia Pacific 
and associated global functions. In 
connection with this programme in FY23, 
we have provided for costs of US$69m, 
including US$53m of restructuring and 
US$16m of onerous global support costs 
for exited businesses.

Capital allocation and liquidity

 a Cash generation was strong with 98% 
conversion of Benchmark EBIT into 
Benchmark operating cash flow (2022: 
109%). Benchmark operating cash flow 
was US$1.8bn, down (3)% at actual 
exchange rates. 

 a We continued to invest in data, technology 

and new products through capital 
expenditure, which represented 9% of total 
revenue. We plan to sustain strong levels of 
investment to support our growth, and for 

FY24 we expect capital expenditure to 
represent c.9% of total revenue. 

 a We invested US$480m in acquisitions and 
US$15m in investments in support of our 
strategic initiatives. Acquisitions were 
principally in income verification and 
employee services, and included CIC Plus, 
Inc. (CIC Plus) in North America, and Pay 
Dashboard Ltd and the Work Report in UK&I. 

 a We are announcing a second interim 

dividend of USc37.75 per share, up 6%. This 
will be paid on 21 July 2023 to shareholders 
on the register at the close of business on 
23 June 2023, taking our full-year dividend 
to USc54.75 per share, up 6%.

 a We have completed our FY23 share 

repurchase programme for a net cash 
consideration of US$175m, which mainly 
offsets deliveries under employee share 
plans. We are also announcing that we will 
commence a net US$150m share 
repurchase programme in FY24, which 
will again offset deliveries under employee 
share plans.

 a Our bonds, including derivatives, totalled 
US$3.9bn as at 31 March 2023 and had an 
average remaining tenor of five years. 
Undrawn committed bank borrowing 
facilities were US$2.4bn as at 31 March 
2023 (2022: US$2.6bn).

 a At 31 March 2023, Net debt to Benchmark 
EBITDA was 1.8x, compared to our target 
leverage range of 2.0-2.5x. We have no 
refinancing commitments until September 
2024. Around 90% of our current debt is at 
fixed interest rates for the next two years 
and 67% fixed for at least four years. 

Environmental, Social and 
Governance (ESG)

The current cost pressures faced by 
consumers makes gaining access to fair, 
affordable credit all the more important. 
We are focused on our mission and purpose 
to encourage broader financial inclusion and 
to help people to take control of their finances. 
This is a defining ethos of our business, and 
we take great pride in it, doing what we can 
to make a positive difference to society.

 a Around 13 million consumers have now 

connected to Experian Boost, empowering 
millions to improve their credit scores and 
improve their financial lives. Experian Go 
launched in the USA in January 2022, 
enabling ‘credit invisibles’ to establish 
their financial identity in minutes, and 
over 130,000 US consumers have since 
connected to the platform. We were 
delighted that Experian Go was recognised 
as a 2023 BIG Innovation Award winner. 
 a Since 2013, our social innovation products, 
specifically developed to deliver societal 
benefits and improve financial health, have 

reached 106 million people, exceeding our 
target of 100 million people two years early. 
 a Our United for Financial Health programme 

to improve financial education among 
disadvantaged communities has now 
connected with 113 million people since 
launch, exceeding our target of 100 million 
people a year early. 

 a We pride ourselves on our ‘people first’ 

culture. This year we were listed in Fortune’s 
2023 ‘100 Best Companies to Work For’ for 
the fourth consecutive year, 95% of our 
employees agreed that Experian is 
committed to creating a diverse, equitable 
and inclusive culture, and we were ranked 
21st in Equileap’s ‘Top 100 Globally for 
Gender Equality’ for 2023.

 a Following recent appointments to our Board, 

it is now 45% women and includes two 
ethnically diverse Board members. Our 
Board meets the recommendations of the 
FTSE Women Leaders Review on gender 
diversity and the Parker Review on ethnic 
diversity.

 a As part of our journey to be carbon neutral 
by 2030 in our own operations, we have 
reduced our Scope 1 and 2 emissions by 
38% this year, reaching a 65% reduction 
since our 2019 base year. 62% of our 
electricity is now renewable. In order to 
reduce our Scope 3 emissions, we are 
continuing to engage with our suppliers and 
have improved our emissions calculations 
methodology. We are pleased to be 
recognised again in the Financial Times’ 
Europe Climate Leaders 2023 for our 
success in reducing our carbon emissions. 
Our commitment to help tackle climate 
change is also reflected in our CDP rating of 
‘A-’, placing us in the Leadership category 
and among the top 24% of professional 
services companies. We are working to 
complete our Net Zero Transition Plan in line 
with the UK’s Transition Plan Taskforce draft 
Disclosure Framework.

Outlook

For the year ahead, we 
anticipate another year of 
growth due to the breadth and 
the resilience of our portfolio, 
and significant structural growth 
opportunities. Despite the 
uncertain economic climate, 
we expect to deliver organic 
revenue growth in the range of 
4% to 6% and modest margin 
accretion, all at constant 
exchange rates and on an 
ongoing basis.

Growth in North America was good. Revenue 
was US$4,432m, with total revenue growth at 
constant currency of 8% and organic revenue 
growth of 7%. Acquisition growth included CIC 
Plus, in employment services, and Gabi in 
Consumer Services. 

In B2B, organic revenue growth was 5% driven 
by innovation, a diversified portfolio, and 
competitive outperformance. 

Consumer and Business Information Services 
delivered low-single digit organic growth 
overall, and high-single digit organic growth 
when mortgage is excluded. This was despite 
mixed external conditions in the USA which 
caused some of our lending clients to adopt a 
more cautious stance by tightening their credit 
criteria. Our growth was due to strong new 
business outperformance in the year with our 
differentiated data assets, real-time data 
delivery capability, analytics and Experian 
Ascend major contributory factors. Ascend 
continues on a positive trajectory and we 
continue to expand the range of products on 
the platform. Ascend Ops is the latest 
innovation and will sustain momentum. 
Experian PowerCurve also had a good year, 
particularly in collections and analytics. We 
also made significant progress in Employer 
and Verification Services, adding to our data 
count, now at 47 million US individuals, and 
securing new clients across verification 
services and for Experian Verify. 

We saw growth in automotive, where we have 
a range of products which combine Experian’s 
credit and marketing capabilities, as the 
industry seeks to stimulate car purchases and 
auto lenders adjust to recessionary risk 
models. In Targeting, which had a very strong 
year, we are successfully delivering on our 
strategy to reposition towards digital 
marketing. We are serving higher growth 
segments of the market having expanded our 
position in digital identity and data connectivity 
and enablement. We also performed well in 
Health, despite a strong prior year comparable. 

We were delighted to be recognised as Best in 
KLAS, a US Health industry award, for our 
claims and contract management solutions.

Latin America

Organic revenue growth %

Consumer Services delivered organic revenue 
growth of 11%. We are deepening and growing 
our member relationships by helping 
consumers to manage their financial health. 
This year we introduced a range of new 
features, including new ways to boost your 
credit score using rental information and bill 
negotiation to help with savings. We are proud 
that Experian is now a top 15 US finance app 
(in the Apple App Store) with a 4.8 star rating. 
Our free membership base has grown to 62 
million, up by ten million year-on-year. We now 
provide offers across several active verticals, 
which means more ways for consumers to 
engage with Experian in order to manage their 
finances. Marketplace delivered another 
strong year of growth, driven by cards and 
loans expansion, even as credit market 
conditions got somewhat tougher and lenders 
reduced credit market supply. New services 
for lenders have been an important factor in 
helping us to outperform in the current 
environment: Experian Activate enables 
lenders to target their offers more precisely 
and to help them secure higher conversion 
rates. We also benefit from the growing 
diversity of our business model. The 
contribution from our insurance vertical is 
growing rapidly, while premium membership 
and partner solutions also contributed 
positively. 

Benchmark EBIT rose 6% to US$1,467m. 
The Benchmark EBIT margin reduced 40 basis 
points to 33.1%. Margins reflected the mix 
of growth, investments in our verification 
services and our insurance marketplace and 
our innovations across our scaling verticals. 

Expanding into Veriﬁcation and 
Employer Services 
Our expansion into Verification and 
Employer Services is progressing well. 
North America has achieved revenues of 
over US$160m and a record count of 47 
million, and we have established access 
to records representing 77% of the UK 
PAYE workforce and have nascent 
positions in other markets.

Latin America delivered strongly, with revenue 
of US$947m representing organic revenue 
growth of 16% and total revenue growth at 
constant currency of 18%. Acquisitions 
contributing to our performance included 
Sinacofi, our new bureau in Chile, and 
PagueVeloz in Consumer Services in Brazil. 

In B2B, organic revenue growth was 13%. 

Credit markets in Brazil continue to undergo 
significant change brought about by regulatory 
reforms, creating new opportunities for our 
business all driven by the expansion of the 
market. We have established over 200 sources 
of positive data, covering 82% of the credit 
active population, and are seeing strong 
demand for positive data solutions, including 
improved scores, more predictive analytics 
and sophisticated software platforms. Ascend 
is progressing well, with adoption by existing 
and new clients. PowerCurve performed well 
and we are growing strongly in fraud 
prevention. We are adding and growing 
relationships with small and medium 
enterprises, and our agribusiness vertical, 
which is still at an early stage of its 
development, grew very strongly. 

Spanish Latin America delivered strong 
growth, reflecting bureau volume strength, 
uptake of new richer datasets and advanced 
analytics. We are also rolling out the Ascend 
platform and have benefitted from good 
demand for our fraud and identity 
management products. 

In Consumer Services, organic revenue growth 
was 32%. We continue to build our brand in 
Brazil with the ambition of becoming one of 
the most recognised financial services brands. 
We added 10 million consumer memberships 
year-on-year to take our total free 
membership base to 81 million. Our app now 
ranks at number two of Brazil’s top financial 
services apps (per data.ai). We are enhancing 
our ecosystem of consumer offers to 
encourage engagement and enhance the value 
of our services to our consumer members.

Revenue growth reflected further progress in 
our debt resolution service, Limpa Nome, as 
we added new partners and settled more 
debts on the platform, plus increased usage of 
our credit marketplace and premium services. 
We are also developing services for 
consumers more widely across Latin America 
and our membership count for Spanish Latin 
America has reached 13 million. 

Benchmark EBIT in Latin America was 
US$294m, up 30% at constant exchange rates. 
The Benchmark EBIT margin from ongoing 
activities at actual exchange rates was 31.0%, 
up by 280 basis points. While we continue to 
invest in developing new market opportunities, 
the margin uplift reflects revenue growth 
drop-through and improving margin in 
Consumer Services as the business scales.

The UK and Ireland delivered a good 
performance overall. Revenue was US$784m, 
with both total and organic revenue growth at 
constant exchange rates of 5%.

In B2B, organic revenue was up 7%, a great 
performance in a year that included periods 
of extreme economic instability. Our market 
position in the UK has strengthened, driven 
by investments we have made to extend data 
superiority and to add new product capability. 
As a result, we secured new business wins 
across a broad range of industry segments 
including financial services, energy, utilities 
and telecommunications. While lenders have 
tightened credit criteria, affordability and 
eligibility products performed well, and 
we are helping our clients to cope with the 
cost-of-living crisis, as well as to meet new 
regulatory obligations under the Financial 
Conduct Authority’s new Consumer Duty. 
Fraud and identity management also 
performed well, with strong win rates and 
new business bookings, while Targeting also 
contributed positively. While we expect 
economic conditions in the UK to remain 
fairly soft, we are confident we will emerge 
strongly when the economic cycle turns. 

Our confidence is underpinned by a compelling 
pipeline of new product introductions, which 
include new Ascend modules, products to 
support fairness in lending and new 
capabilities to conduct income and 
employment verification.

In Consumer Services, organic revenue was 
down (4)%. While consumer demand for credit 
held up relatively well, volumes in our credit 
marketplace were affected in the second half 
of the year by the reduction in credit supply. 
Our premium subscription services were also 
affected negatively as we lapped a strong prior 
year comparable. We are investing in new 
capabilities to attract and retain members, and 
introducing a new CreditLock feature this year. 
We plan further new feature introductions in 
the months to come. Free memberships were 
12 million. 

Benchmark EBIT from ongoing activities was 
US$170m, up 1% at constant exchange rates. 
The Benchmark EBIT margin from ongoing 
activities was 21.7% (2022: 22.2%). The 
reduction reflects start-up investment in our 
income and employment verification initiative, 
the commencement of the implementation 
phase of our UK&I technology migration plan 
and lower growth in Consumer Services. 

Leveraging our global capabilities 
We have an extensive roadmap of new 
product introductions planned in the UK&I 
in FY24 to leverage our global capabilities 
and build on a strong year for B2B new 
business performance in the region. 

EMEA/Asia Paciﬁc  
transformation on track
The first phase of our transformation in 
EMEA/Asia Pacific is on track with 
improving profitability. In the second 
phase, we are focused on improving 
growth with stronger, new product 
introductions.

In EMEA/Asia Pacific, revenue from ongoing 
activities was US$424m, with both total and 
organic growth at constant exchange rates 
of 3%. 

The transformation of our EMEA/Asia Pacific 
operations is progressing well. We have 
reduced costs and are exiting from non-core 
activities. We are focused on realising our full 
potential in markets where we have scale 
by utilising our extensive data assets and 
leveraging Experian global platforms. 
We made progress this year despite 
macroeconomic headwinds in some markets. 

 a Australia and New Zealand – made good 

progress positioning Ascend and Experian 
One, with positive contributions in data.
 a DACH (Germany, Austria and Switzerland) 
– delivered a weaker performance due to 
economic headwinds and lower volumes.

 a India – delivered strongly with a strong 

contribution from our bureau.

 a Italy – performed strongly due to new 
product innovations and higher bureau 
volumes from new business. 

 a South Africa – delivered well, with good 

progress in decisioning, despite 
macroeconomic headwinds.

 a Spain – performed well despite a strong 

prior-year comparative, with strong growth 
from Consumer Information volumes and 
Open Banking.

Our actions have led to an improved 
Benchmark EBIT trajectory, which for ongoing 
activities was US$14m, up 8%. The Benchmark 
EBIT margin for ongoing activities improved to 
3.3% from 2.9%.

In the full year ended 31 March 2023, the 
non-core markets accounted for revenue of 
US$32m and Benchmark EBIT of US$(8)m. Due 
to higher interest rates and macroeconomic 
weakness in our European markets we have 
impaired goodwill in EMEA by US$179m.

Many of our products and services are integral to our clients’ 
operating processes. Because of this, we have highly recurring 
revenue. Our growth strategy is aimed at delivering sustainable 
financial returns, including organic revenue growth and at least 
stable margins. The counter-cyclical nature of portions of our 
product portfolio, as well as our portfolio diversity, means we have 
delivered organic revenue growth every year since becoming a 
listed company in 2006. Our cash flow is consistently strong, and 
we have a proven record of converting operating profit to cash. 
This allows us to prioritise investment, both organically and 
by pursuing focused acquisition opportunities, while balancing 
returns to shareholders. Our balance sheet is strong, and we aim 
to operate within our leverage policy target range of Net debt to 
Benchmark EBITDA of 2.0–2.5x.

stakeholders. We recognise their needs and priorities, regularly engage with them and work to establish deeper 
relationships. Our stakeholders are crucial to the success of our company and our long-term profitability.

By delivering to our clients and consumers, 
working side-by-side with suppliers, meeting 
regulations, keeping our commitment to our 
people, supporting communities and creating 
financial returns for our shareholders, our 
stakeholders in turn support us and help our 
company to continue to grow in a strong, 
sustainable way.

How we add value
We put people in control of their financial 
wellbeing. We help them to access many 
financial services such as obtaining credit, 
saving money and paying bills. Because 
consumer data is at the core of our business, 
consumers need a company they can trust 
with that data and who will be their champion. 
Not only do we serve consumers directly, but 
our clients, whether they are businesses or 
other organisations, serve consumers as their 
end customer. This is why consumers are at 
the heart of all we do. For information on how 
we add value for consumers please see the 
Our business model section.

Engaging with our key stakeholders
We have a diverse range of stakeholders; this 
includes seven key stakeholder groups:

 a Consumers 
 a Our clients
 a Our communities
 a Our people
 a Our suppliers
 a Governments
 a Our shareholders and bondholders

We aim to treat all stakeholders fairly, ensuring 
we engage in a regular programme of dialogue. 
Each group has its own distinct, but sometimes 
overlapping, needs. We engage frequently to 
better understand their needs and priorities 
through a continual process, which helps to 
build understanding. We work with our 
stakeholders to solve their problems, however 
big or small, by finding new data sources, 
developing new propositions, addressing their 
needs and improving our processes.

Why is this important? It is a measure of our ability to provide innovative 
propositions and services for clients and consumers, and to extend these 
to new industries and across many regions.

Why is this important? It measures how well we turn our revenue into 
profits, which allows us to reinvest for future growth and to provide 
returns for shareholders.

Aim: To consistently achieve mid to high single-digit organic revenue 
growth.

Aim: To operate our business efficiently and cost effectively with stable 
EBIT margins.

Analysis: Organic revenue grew 7%. The main contributors to growth 
were Brazil, progress in Consumer Services, a solid performance in UK 
and Ireland B2B and good contributions from vertical expansion.

More detail: In the Chief Executive's review.

See page 125 – Revenue performance is linked to directors’ remuneration

For a reconciliation of revenue from ongoing activities, including disclosure of organic and acquisition 
revenue, from the year 31 March 2022 to 31 March 2023 see Note 10(a)(ii) to the Group financial 
statements.

Analysis: We continue to invest in new data sources, product innovation, 
technology and top talent. Those are the foundational elements of our 
business. This year we achieved Benchmark EBIT from ongoing activities 
of US$1,802m, up 9% at both constant and actual exchange rates. 
Benchmark EBIT margin was 27.4%, up 30 basis points before the impact 
of foreign exchange rates, and up 80 basis points overall.

Why is this important? It measures how effectively we have deployed 
our resources and how efficiently we apply our capital.

Why is this important? EPS measures our success at generating 
surpluses and value for our shareholders.

Aim: To generate good returns on the investments we make and create 
long-term value for shareholders.

Aim: To achieve earnings growth for shareholders while balancing 
reinvestment to secure future growth opportunities.

Analysis: This year, ROCE was 16.5%, up 80 basis points on the prior year, 
reflecting growth and our continued focus on operating efficiency.

See page 125 – Adjusted ROCE is a directors’ remuneration measure

Analysis: Benchmark EBIT from ongoing activities was up 9% at constant 
exchange rates, helped by the strength of our organic revenue growth 
performance and cost discipline. Our Benchmark net finance costs 
increased US$14m to US$124m, and the Benchmark tax rate was up 
30 basis points to 26.0%. With weighted average numbers of shares at 
914m, this resulted in Benchmark earnings per share of 135.1 US cents. 
This was up 9% on the prior year at both actual and constant 
exchange rates.

Why is this important? Benchmark operating cash flow is the cash 
generated by the business. It gives us the capacity to operate and 
reinvest, and fund acquisitions and shareholder payments. The efficiency 
with which we convert profits into cash flow is measured by cash flow 
conversion.

Aim: To convert at least 90% of Benchmark EBIT into Benchmark 
operating cash flow.

Analysis: Cash flow performance was strong this year with Benchmark 
operating cash flow of US$1,753m, down US$47m on last year. The slight 
decrease is due to exceptional conversion in the prior year and a higher 
investment in growth initiatives.

See page 125 – Cumulative Benchmark operating cash flow is a directors’ 
remuneration measure

See note 41(g) for reconciliation of Cash generated from operations to Benchmark operating 
cash flow.

Why is this important? Our people make us great. Engaged and 
motivated people help us develop innovative propositions, find new 
opportunities, and grow.

Aim: To ensure Experian is a great place to work and that we can attract 
and retain the best people.

Analysis: For our second global Great Place to Work survey, this year we 
achieved an engagement score of 82% (2022: 78%).  

 a 88% of our employees said they are proud to tell people they work at 
Experian, a testament to our commitment to creating an inclusive and 
welcoming workplace. 

 a We were accredited as a Great Place to Work in 22 countries.

Why is this important? It measures the carbon emissions we generate, 
as we have a responsibility as a business to reduce our carbon footprint 
and respond to the climate change emergency.
Aim: To be carbon neutral in our own operations by 20301.
Analysis: This year, our total Scope 1 and 2 emissions have decreased by 
38%. We have achieved this by increasing the use of renewable electricity, 
improving our energy efficiency, embracing flexible working to reduce 
building occupancy, and consolidation and reduction of office space. 
Since 2019, we have reduced our total Scope 1 and 2 emissions by 65%. 
This means we are currently outperforming and well on track to meet 
our science-based target to reduce these emissions by 50% by 2030.

Our Scope 3 emissions have decreased by 1% in 2023 versus a restated 
20222. We engage with suppliers to encourage them to reduce their 
emissions and are switching to suppliers who are actively reducing their 
own emissions. We remain committed to delivering a 15% reduction in 
these Scope 3 emissions by 2030. 

Overall, we have reduced our carbon intensity by 9% since last year. Our 
Scope 1 and 2 carbon intensity is down 41% since last year and down 74% 
since 2019. We will continue to reduce our absolute carbon emissions 
while the business continues to grow.

See the ‘Protecting the environment’ section on pages 56 to 62 for further 
information on how we are taking action on climate change

1  All references in this Annual Report to ‘carbon neutral in our own operations by 2030’ includes 
all Scope 1 and 2 emissions, as well as Scope 3 emissions from purchased goods and services, 
business travel and fuel- and-energy-related activities (which represent 83% of our baseline 
emissions in Scope 3) in line with the boundaries covered by our Scope 3 target approved by 
the Science Based Targets initiative (SBTi). Once we have achieved our SBTi-approved targets, 
we will invest in high-quality carbon offsetting projects to offset the remaining Scope 1, 2 and 3 
emissions within the boundaries of our SBTi-approved targets to achieve carbon neutrality in 
our own operations by 2030. Refer to pages 60 to 61 for further information.
In 2023 we have upgraded our Scope 3 methodology, from using a purely spend-based analysis 
to also including actual supplier emissions data. We are therefore restating our 2022 Scope 3 
figures using the same methodology, to provide comparable figures, resulting in restated figures 
for purchased goods and services, upstream leased assets, capital goods, and investments. 
For further information please refer to our 2023 Carbon Reporting Principles and Methodologies

Our business model

Creating value for businesses

Transforming businesses and driving growth

By understanding the different needs of our clients, we can truly transform their business activities. Not just at product level but 
at the strategic level. However new or mature a business is, we work with them to assess their challenges and offer the right 
end-to-end solution, tailored to their size and budget.

One business that needed our help was a loans 
company which consolidates credit card debt for 
consumers. The debt is simplified into just one 
loan, which is then paid by the consumer in 
instalments and very often at a much lower 
interest rate. They wanted to grow their market 
share and increase the positive impact they were 
having on people’s financial lives. But they were 
constrained by a highly manual review process, 
and so wanted to automate it. 

They wanted to improve the online customer 
experience and their capacity to add customers, 
while still managing risk and compliance with 
regulations. 

We worked with them to create a whole new 
process based on our integrated platforms, such 
as PowerCurve and Ascend. Automated from end 
to end, the new process provides more balanced 
decisions significantly faster, and at a lower cost. 

It’s also easier for consumers, putting them on the 
path to more manageable debt repayment, more 
quickly. Because of this automation the lender has 
been able to significantly grow their reach and 
help more consumers become free of debt.

Our strategy

Fulfilling our purpose

At the core of our strategy is the purpose on which Experian is built: being a force for inclusion that brings financial 
power to all. We live this purpose through our products and our culture. We take deep pride in the positive impact 
we have across society. It underpins how we think strategically. 

How we build a stronger, more advantaged Experian

While our strategy is built around the deepest, 
broadest and most unique datasets available 
in our markets, we do much more. To data we 
add advanced analytics and decisioning tools 
to create highly differentiated solutions that 
solve client challenges and open up new 
markets to address. Our datasets have unique 
value, and we strive to make them the most 
powerful and accurate sources available, 

indispensable to our customers, and helping to 
address a wide range of their needs.

We are adept at spotting and developing new 
market spaces to enter and existing spaces 
where we can expand. This is a key driver of 
our thinking and has seen us create several 
large new businesses, usually by cross-
pollinating our data and analytics. We estimate 
that the market opportunity directly 

addressable by Experian exceeds US$150bn. 
There are many examples of where we have 
successfully entered new markets or where 
we are prospecting new ones. This includes 
some exciting opportunities today in countries 
such as Brazil, in sectors as wide-ranging as 
health, automotive and agriculture, or in 
attractive growth markets like digital 
marketing.

Business-to-
Business 

Consumer 
Services

Over time, the wide range of uses that our clients 
can put our data and analytics towards is also 
expanding. We all now expect the organisations we 
deal with to serve us in the digital sphere, to 
anticipate and personalise the services they offer 
us and to behave responsibly. Organisations in turn, 
while satisfying these demands, need to be 
commercially successful while managing risk, 
minimising fraud, and ensuring they are compliant. 
More and more, these desired outcomes rely on the 
data and sophisticated solutions that we provide. 

These shifts, and the need to create trust between 
the provider of a service and their end-customer, 
open new ways for data and advanced analytics to 
be used. The nature of our products also means we 
become deeply embedded in client operations and 
this allows us to forge close relationships, working 
with our clients to understand their requirements 
and expand alongside them by providing more 
applications. 

Our ambition is for Experian to be recognised as 
one of the world’s most innovative data, analytics 
and software companies, delivering advanced, 
cloud-based B2B solutions. We are very proud of 
the achievements and recognition we increasingly 
attract for this, from our clients and wider afield. 

We also seek to build trust and enduring 
relationships with consumers. This is the 
cornerstone of our Consumer Services strategy. 
Our ambition is to create an unrivalled platform to 
help consumers manage their finances. We are well 
on our way to realising this ambition having 
established relationships with millions of 
consumers and by constantly adding to the ways 
people can interact with us. We want to bring more 
people into the financial system, help them to build 
credit and save money, as well as protect their own 
and their family’s identity. 

A unique interplay
One of the unique aspects of Experian is the interplay between 
the two parts of our business, B2B and Consumer Services. 
This sits at the very heart of our strategy. We see it as our 
mission to help consumers use their own data to get access  
to the best and most suitable offers. At the same time this 
nurtures our B2B businesses and helps us to use the data 
contributed to develop even better propositions. We are very 
proud of the way we have pioneered this concept, through 
Experian Boost, and now Experian Lift and Experian Go. 

We are confident that our strategy will continue to deliver 
strong, sustainable growth which compounds over time. We 
pursue our goals through a clear strategic framework  
and a disciplined approach to capital allocation. We identify 
specific opportunities that are directly addressable by 
Experian. We pursue these opportunities through defined 
strategic initiatives, investing organically and inorganically to 
realise our ambitions, and we believe this approach has been 
an important factor in our strong track record of delivery.

Defining our priorities –  
our Strategic Focus Areas

Our key strategic growth initiatives 

Each year, we sharpen our focus on a defined list of strategic growth 
initiatives. Our goal is to ensure that we are executing at pace, pursuing 
the biggest opportunities and that we are addressing the highest-growth 
customer segments. 

1. Lead the next 
generation  
of credit, risk  
and identity

to grow in adjacent 
and existing  
customer markets
See page 32

3. Transform 
Consumer Services 
into a world-leading 
consumer finance  
platform 
See page 34

Our strategic framework helps us to identify 
customer challenges. Deeply informed by 
customer trends, our Strategic Focus Areas 
(SFAs) define where we focus our product 
strategy and investment decisions, and help us 
to target innovation. We then monitor and 
manage innovation projects and evaluate 
progress. Each region and business adapts 
and uses this framework to develop more 
detailed focus areas which are relevant to their 
particular market. Plans and progress are then 
regularly reviewed by our senior management 
team and Board, informing our decisions on 
which areas to prioritise for further 
investment.

Our five key areas of strategic focus are to:

1.  Make credit and lending simpler, faster and 

safer for consumers and businesses

2.  Empower consumers to improve their 

financial lives

3.  Help businesses verify identity and combat 

fraud

4.  Help organisations in specialised verticals 
harness data, analytics and software to 
make smarter decisions 

5.  Enable businesses to find, understand and 

connect with audiences

Shopping made safe using  
artificial intelligence 

Shopping online can be risky these days, 
both for customers and businesses, with 
billions of dollars lost every year to 
fraud. In an effort to combat this, many 
businesses end up blocking legitimate 
online customers due to using outdated 
or underperforming fraud rules. 
Resulting in frustrated customers and 
lost revenue.  

This problem is solved with powerful, 
adaptive AI that gets ahead of the 
fraudsters. Experian’s new fraud 
prevention platform, Aidrian, uses AI to 
identify subtle data patterns, not easily 
found by humans, to extract new 
insights and create new fraud rules. 

These rules block certain user actions, 
such as suspicious logins, identity theft, 
or fraudulent transactions, while letting 
legitimate customers through. 

Aidrian assesses up to 99.9%¹ of all 
transactions accurately and reliably 
filters out fraud. It can result in up to 
15%¹ more revenue. Because it's 
constantly learning Aidrian also 
identifies and adapts to new and 
emerging fraud threats. This helps to 
keep everyone safer while they transact 
in the digital world.

Smart ESG

Helping farmers focus on farming

What do farmers want to do? They want 
to farm. They want to grow crops and 
look after their animals, rather than 
spend time on paperwork. However, in 
places like Brazil, farmers are now 
having to deal with much higher levels of 
compliance when applying for credit.

Experian’s Smart ESG platform takes 
care of this for farmers, by providing 
lenders with a holistic view of a farm’s 
compliance, and it monitors that 
compliance daily. A process that used to 
be highly manual and take weeks, now 
takes minutes. 

Access to credit is essential, because it 
allows farmers to plan their planting and 
buy fertiliser, seeds and equipment. 
They have to show not only that they can 
repay debt, but also that they are not 
involved in any illegal deforestation, 
encroachment onto indigenous land, 
modern slavery or environmental 
infractions. And they need to show this 
every time they apply for credit or sign 
up with a new food distributor.

This helps lenders explore new 
agricultural regions, understand the 
market and land use and expand into 
agribusiness, while meeting regulations 
and reducing their socio-environmental 
and reputational risk. For farmers it 
means faster access to credit, as well as 
certification of their products going into 
the food supply chain. Helping farmers 
do less paperwork, and more farming.

Environmental, social and governance

We are making improvements in financial health by using our data, products and expertise  
to help people thrive at every stage of their financial journey. 

Our strong focus on environmental, social and governance (ESG) opportunities and risks is 
critical to realising this ambition, growing our business and fulfilling our purpose of creating  
a better tomorrow.

Highlights in FY23

Our Global Data Principles
We continued to establish our Global Data 
Principles across the business, to reinforce  
our focus on security, accuracy, fairness, 
transparency and inclusion in the way we treat 
data and those it belongs to.

Great Place to Work
Employee engagement increased by four 
points to 82% across our 22,000 employees 
and we were certified as a Great Place to Work 
in 22 countries.

106 million people reached
Our social innovation products, designed to 
provide additional societal benefits, have 
reached 106 million people since 2013 – 
meeting our 100 million target two years 
early – and generated US$241m in revenue.

93 million points added to credit 
scores
Around 13 million consumers in the USA 
have connected to Experian Boost. More than 
93 million points have been added to credit 
scores over the past four years by adding 
positive data, such as on-time payments from 
utility bills or streaming services – and now 
rent – to their Experian profiles. Experian 
Boost was recognised at Fast Company’s 2022 
World Changing Ideas Awards as having the 
potential to effect true system change. 

113 million connections
Our United for Financial Health programme  
to improve financial education among 
underserved communities has made more 
than 113 million connections over the last 
three years, meeting our 100 million target 
a year early.

More women in management
Representation of women increased to 34% of 
our senior leaders. Women also make up 36% 
of our mid-level leaders and 44% of our total 
workforce. 

65% reduction in Scopes 1 and 2 
We have achieved a 65% reduction in Scope  
1 and 2 emissions since 2019, currently 
outperforming our 50% science-based 
reduction target (set in line with a 1.5ºC climate 
scenario). We have achieved this through our 
focus on consolidating offices, improving 
energy efficiency and sourcing renewable 
electricity. We have also enhanced the way we 
measure Scope 3 emissions to include more 
supplier-specific data.

External recognition 
We continued to rank highly in external ratings 
and rankings that recognise our strong ESG 
approach and performance (see page 38).

Our priorities
We can add the most value to society by 
improving financial health for all, and we have 
made this our sustainable business strategic 
priority. 

Helping people improve their financial health 
enables them to get fairer access to credit and 
the essentials they need to transform their 
lives – from having a home or building their 
business, to paying for education and 
healthcare. This in turn drives social and 
economic development, and contributes to 
three of the United Nations Sustainable 
Development Goals, including helping to lift 
people out of poverty (as outlined to the right). 

Our sustainable business strategy and our 
growth strategy are aligned and mutually 
reinforcing. Our focus on improving financial 
health supports the long-term revenue growth 
and success of our business in many ways. For 
instance, increasing financial inclusion grows 
our total addressable markets by creating 
millions of potential new consumers for us and 
our clients around the world. One such 
product, Experian Go, has the opportunity to 
help 28 million US consumers who are 'credit 
invisible' establish a credit report and become 
visible to lenders. Equally, this focus helps 
drive innovation, in ground-breaking products 
like Experian Boost. It also creates new 
revenue streams, such as our Limpa Nome 
debt renegotiation product, which significantly 
contributes to our Consumer Services revenue 
in Brazil. Being a purpose-driven business 
helps attract and retain talent, and it also 
motivates our people. 88% of our employees 
are proud to tell others that they work at 
Experian. Lastly, it enhances our reputation 

External recognition in FY23

and strengthens stakeholder relationships, 
whether that be with consumers, clients, 
employees, investors, regulators or 
governments. Our mission to improve financial 
health is aligned with three of our five Strategic 
Focus Areas (see page 29): make credit and 
lending simpler, faster and safer for 
consumers and businesses; empower 
consumers to improve their financial lives; and 
help businesses verify identity and combat 
fraud. 

Delivering these positive impacts for society 
and our business depends on our ability to 
access and use data from individuals and 
businesses around the world. Treating that 
data with respect is essential to maintain trust 
– and failure to keep it secure is one of our 
biggest business and ESG risks.

One of our core beliefs is that how we work is 
as important as what we do, and our strategy 
is built on a strong culture of corporate 
responsibility. We aim to inspire and support 
our people by embracing and developing 
diverse talent and creating an inclusive 
working environment that supports high 
performance. We are committed to working 
with integrity, and we strive to do our part to 
protect the environment and tackle climate 
change. 

This responsible culture also helps us recruit 
and retain people with the expertise and 
experience we need to grow our business and 
meet our sustainable business goals. 

Our sustainable business strategy is informed 
by an assessment of our most material ESG 
factors, based on consultation with senior 
leaders who represent different regions and 
functions across the business.

Regular engagement with investors and other 
stakeholders helps us refine our priorities. See 
pages 16-19 for more on how we engage with, 
and create value for, our stakeholders. 

Contributing to the United Nations 
Sustainable Development Goals

Our strategic priority to improve financial 
health can make the most meaningful 
contribution to the United Nations 
Sustainable Development Goals by 
supporting progress towards: 

By 2030, ensure that all people, 
in particular the poor and the 
vulnerable, have equal rights to 
economic resources, as well as 
access to appropriate new 
technology and financial 
services, including microfinance.

Strengthen the capacity of 
domestic financial institutions to 
encourage and expand access 
to banking, insurance and 
financial services for all.

Increase the access 
of small-scale industrial and 
other enterprises, in particular in 
developing countries, to financial 
services, including affordable 
credit.

Target 1.4

Target 8.10

Target 9.3

We also contribute to several of the other 
Sustainable Development Goals, for 
example through our work to improve

Governance of ESG
We believe strong ESG performance can be 
a source of competitive advantage, as well 
as boosting our reputation and strengthening 
our relationships with all our stakeholders. 

Our ESG strategy helps us set targets and 
commitments, drive progress and enhance 
transparency through our ESG reporting and 
disclosures. It is developed, approved, 
implemented and overseen through a robust 
governance structure. See the organisation 
chart below and see page 102 for the division 
of responsibilities, including ESG, across the 
Board. 

The Board oversees our ESG strategy and 
performance. Board members receive a 
written update on ESG activities ahead of every 
Board meeting, as well as an annual in-depth 
presentation from our Chief Sustainability 
Officer that educates them on the evolving 
global ESG context and provides a detailed 

update on our ESG strategy and performance. 
The Group Operating Committee reviews and 
approves our ESG strategy and targets, and 
receives regular updates on performance.

The Chief Financial Officer is executive sponsor 
of our overall ESG programme and the 
Company Secretary oversees the Group’s 
Sustainability function. They both sit on the 
Executive Risk Management Committee that 
oversees how we manage risks globally, 
including ESG risks, with oversight from the 
Audit Committee. 

Our ESG Steering Committee, comprised of 
executive sponsors and workstream leaders 
and chaired by the Chief Financial Officer, 
meets six times a year to oversee our ESG 
agenda. It steers our strategy, metrics and 
targets, and helps to shape the priorities of 
our ESG programme. Topics discussed this 
year included: social impact initiatives, 
communications and engagement, data 

security and ESG in investor relations, as well 
as climate-related items.

The ESG Steering Committee also regularly 
discusses and agrees appropriate responses 
to relevant market and regulatory 
developments and stakeholder needs, and 
their potential implications for our business 
and stakeholders. These are also monitored 
continually by our Sustainability, Investor 
Relations, Government Affairs, Finance and 
Corporate Secretariat teams.

Our Chief Sustainability Officer is responsible 
for ensuring successful implementation of 
our ESG plans across all our workstreams. 
A central sustainability team and a network 
of regional leads, specialists and steering 
groups across the business manage our 
Social Innovation, community investment, 
health and safety, and environmental 
programmes and impact.

Managing ESG risks
The Board and our Executive Risk Management 
Committee review our principal risks on an 
ongoing basis. Five of our eight principal 
business risks are relevant to ESG (see table 
opposite). In addition, we continue to identify 
and analyse emerging risks, including those 
related to ESG, such as climate risks. See 
pages 57-59 for details on climate-related 
risks and opportunities.

See pages 78-85 for more on our principal 
risks and risk management processes, 
including our Three Lines of Defence approach. 

Embedding ESG in innovation
Our culture of innovation puts consumer and 
client needs first. We have five Strategic Focus 
Areas (see page 29), against which we execute 
our strategy, and which shape our innovation 
investment in core products. Three of these 
Strategic Focus areas underpin our 
sustainable business priority of improving 
financial health as outlined on page 38. 

In addition, we invest in developing new 
products that are specifically designed to offer 
additional societal benefits, as well as creating 
revenue for our business, through our Social 
Innovation programme (see page 43). The 
funding model for social innovation products is 
aligned with our global innovation framework. 

The Social Innovation programme is governed 
by a global steering committee facilitated by 
the Global Head of Social Innovation and 
chaired by the Group President of Experian 
Consumer Services North America. The 
steering committee also includes our Chief 
Sustainability Officer, Chief Investment Officer, 
and Company Secretary, as well as senior 
representatives from each region. We have a 
sub-committee that governs lower-level 
funding to explore early-stage ideas.

We also have strict processes to ensure we 
build critical ESG considerations, such as data

security, privacy and accuracy, into all our 
products and services. We extend our high 
standards to suppliers through our third-party 
risk management framework.

Setting goals and measuring 
performance
We have set quantitative goals to support our 
sustainable business strategy in three key 
areas: improving financial health, diversity and 
environment.

Our initial focus was on increasing the reach of 
products developed through our Social 
Innovation programme. Having reached 
around 35 million people over the preceding 
seven years, in FY20, we set a stretch goal to 
reach 100 million people by 2025. We measure 
reach as the number of consumers and small 
business owners who interact with our social 
innovation products either directly or indirectly. 

When we launched our United for Financial 
Health (UFH) community investment initiative 
in 2020, our initial goal was to connect with 15 
million people within a year. We connected with 
double that number in the first year so we set 
an ambitious new goal to connect with 100 
million over four years (by 2024). To measure 
the reach across our UFH programme, we 
define connections as the total number of 
users who have viewed UFH content 
containing the tracked hashtag, keyword, URL 
or mention on social media channels, blogs 
and websites. 

We met both these goals early this year, but we 
aim to continue to increase the reach and 
number of connections in these areas as we 
work to more meaningfully measure our 
impact on society. We are already able to 
demonstrate the impact, as well as reach, of 
certain products such as Experian Go in the 
USA and Limpa Nome in Brazil (see pages 
42-43). Quantifying social impact across 
multiple products or programmes is more 
challenging, but we are working on a way to do 
this with a particular focus on the impact our 
core products have on improving financial 
health. 

The targets we have set for diversity focus on 
increasing gender diversity at all levels of our 
business as part of our wider DEI strategy. 

Our environment goals focus on reducing our 
operational and value chain carbon footprint, 
which is our most material environmental 
impact. These are approved by the Science 
Based Targets initiative, supporting our 
commitment to become carbon neutral in our 
own operations by 20301.

Target met: Connect with 

100m 

people by 2024 via our 
United for Financial 
Health community 
investment initiative

Target met: Reach

The Finance team centrally collates data related 
to these goals and wider ESG performance for 
quarterly review by our ESG Steering 
Committee and our Group Operating 
Committee. Principles of data collection are set 
out by our Finance team and submitted by each 
region for central reporting. Our ESG data 
reporting methodologies are published on our 
website, together with detailed ESG 
performance data that we disclose annually. 
ESG data is gathered, shared and discussed 
with global and regional leadership through our 
quarterly business reviews.

Certain non-financial metrics – including 
employee engagement, diversity and inclusion, 
ESG considerations and risk – are factored into 
the holistic assessment of the Company’s 
short- and longer-term performance. 

We also integrate ESG into employee pension 
investments. Our defined contribution pension 
plan in the UK includes an allocation to a fund 
that explicitly includes ESG in its investment 
strategy, and members of the plan also have the 
option to select a focused ethical fund.

Includes all Scope 1 and 2 emissions, as well as Scope 3 
emissions from purchased goods and services, business 
travel and fuel- and energy-related activities (which 
represent 83% of our baseline emissions in Scope 3) in line 
with the boundaries covered by our Scope 3 target approved 
by the Science Based Targets initiative (SBTi). Once we have 
achieved our SBTi-approved targets, we will invest in 
high-quality carbon offsetting projects to offset the 
remaining Scope 1, 2 and 3 emissions within the boundaries 
of our SBTi-approved targets to achieve carbon neutrality in 
our own operations by 2030.

Improving ﬁnancial health for all
Our goal is to help people thrive on their financial journey by empowering them to 
establish a credit identity and build their credit score, improve their financial literacy and 
confidence, protect their identity and personal data, and manage their finances and debt. 

A quarter of the world’s adult population lacks 
access to banking products. Many of those 
who do have access to financial services still 
cannot access fair, affordable credit, or face 
spiralling debt. 28 million people in the USA 
and four to five million in the UK are ‘credit 
invisible’ because their financial profiles are 
too limited for lenders to make an informed 
decision; and more than 63 million people in 
Brazil have unmanageable debts that are 
affecting their credit rating.

The current cost-of-living crisis has 
exacerbated threats to financial health and 
makes access to fair, affordable credit all the 
more important. In the UK alone, the Financial 
Conduct Authority have found 80% of adults 
have reported an increase in cost of living, half 
the population is now borrowing to make ends 
meet and more than a quarter (27%) are now 
classed as having low financial resilience.

We support financial inclusion and enable 
better financial health for millions of people 
around the world through our core products, 
Social Innovation programme and community 
investment initiatives – and we aim to reach 
millions more.

To date, we have been able to measure the 
reach of the products developed through our 
Social Innovation programme and the 
connections made through our flagship United 
for Financial Health community investment 
programme. We are currently working on a 
way to measure the social impact of our core 
products which have the greatest potential to 
improve financial health at scale – and, in doing 
so, create new revenue streams and growth 
opportunities for our business.

Experian Boost in the last four years

168m 

consumers worldwide use our free platforms 
to access products and services to help 
manage their credit profiles

We also channel innovation for financial health 
through our DataLabs and global hackathons. 

Core products
Many of our core products contribute to 
improving people’s financial health – either 
directly through our Consumer Services 
business or indirectly through solutions for 
clients, such as for lenders. 

Our consumer-focused tools enable consumers 
to take control of their financial lives and reach 
their credit and money goals, with financial 
inclusion as a key driver. Our data and analytics 
provide lenders with the information they need 
to offer more loans at fairer rates, which in turn 
enables people to improve their financial health. 

In the USA, we offer game-changing consumer 
services like Experian Boost and Experian Go 
that are designed to improve financial inclusion 
and financial health by unlocking access to fair 
and affordable credit. 

Experian Boost provides consumers with the 
opportunity to enhance their credit scores by 
choosing to add positive data – such as 
on-time payments from utility bills or 
streaming services – to their Experian profiles. 
This year, we added the option to contribute 
rent payments as well, to enable millions of 
renters to instantly improve their FICO® Score. 
Around 13 million US consumers have 
connected to Experian Boost. More than 93 
million points have been added to credit scores 
using Experian Boost in the last four years. 

Since launch in FY22, Experian Go has enabled 
more than 130,000 US consumers who were 
‘credit invisible’ to establish a credit profile in 
just minutes. 

Scan me  
to find out more about 
Lift Premium

As well as empowering consumers to improve 
their scores directly, we have partnered with 
lenders to improve financial inclusion through 
products like Experian Lift that do not rely on 
traditional credit data alone. Applying machine 
learning and other advanced analytics to 
additional datasets regulated by the US Fair 
Credit Reporting Act (FCRA), Lift Premium 
enables lenders to further enhance the 
accuracy of credit risk scores for 98% of 
incoming applications and enables scoring of 
65%-75% of ‘credit invisibles’ in the USA. 

In the UK, the fairness assessment toolkit we 
trialled last year to help lenders identify and 
support vulnerable consumers has been 
launched commercially to support access to 
loans that would otherwise have been 
declined. The new global partnership we have 
announced with Prove Identity aims to advance 
financial inclusion through next-generation 
identity verification technology, enabling 
companies to extend financial services to more 
consumers in traditionally underbanked 
populations, including those who do not 
already have a credit profile, while also 
mitigating digital fraud such as synthetic 
identity fraud. 

Keeping track of pay, and cutting expenditure, 
can make a big difference to financial health in 
the current cost-of-living crisis. This year, we 
have expanded our employer services offering 
in the UK with the acquisition of PayDashboard, 
which delivers online payslips together with 
features to help employees understand their 
pay. We have also launched two new products 
designed to help consumers in the USA save 
money on bills: Experian Insurance Services, 
a new way to shop for car insurance; and 

Improving Financial                          Health for allImproving Financial Health Report 2023Experian plc Strategic report43

Experian BillFixer, which negotiates on behalf 
of Experian members to get them better rates 
on bills such as cable, internet and phone.

Our focus on improving financial health 
extends beyond consumers to include small 
and medium enterprises (SMEs), which form 
the backbone of economies in countries such 
as Brazil and the UK. In Brazil, almost 1.5 
million SMEs took up our offer of a free SME 
Credit Score consultation this year, and our 
agreed acquisition of FinTech MOVA (pending 
regulatory approval) will support the 
development of new credit solutions that make 
it easier for SMEs to access fair and affordable 
credit. In the UK, our new Credit Review 
Service, launched in partnership with 
Capitalise, is designed to help thousands of 
SMEs take control of their finances and build 
financial resilience.

Worldwide, 168 million consumers use our 
free platforms to access products and 
services that can help them understand and 
manage their credit profiles. In India, we have 
launched a new service that allows consumers 
to check their credit score free of charge using 
WhatsApp.

Our Consumer Services business also helps 
individuals spot potentially fraudulent 
transactions in their credit profiles, and we 
enable Experian members in Brazil, the UK 
and the USA to lock their profiles to reduce the 
risk of identity theft and fraud (see page 47). 

We also offer a range of solutions to help 
lenders and other clients prevent fraud. Our 
new Experian Fraud Score in the UK uses 
advanced analytics technology to support 
more businesses – large and small – in the 
battle against fraud, accurately identifying two 
in three frauds from the riskiest 1% of 
transactions. Overall, our core fraud and 
identity theft products are estimated to have 
prevented at least US$12bn in fraud for our 
clients this year, and across the Group fraud 
and identity products generated 11% of our 
business revenue. 

Social innovation
Our social innovation products are specifically 
designed to offer additional societal benefits as 
well as generating revenue for our business. 
Since 2013, they have reached more than 106 
million people – exceeding our target of 100 
million by 2025 – and generated US$241m in 
revenue for a total investment of US$12m.

Of the 34 product ideas we have developed 
through our Social Innovation programme over 
the last ten years, 20 have been launched – 
including ground-breaking products such as 
the Limpa Nome Recovery Portal, which has 
become a core part of our consumer strategy 
in Brazil and helped collectively write off more 
than US$21bn-worth of debts to date. 

Scan me  
to find out more about 
our Support Hub

The Limpa Nome Recovery Portal is just one of 
the products that were initially developed 
through the Social Innovation programme and 
have now become part of our mainstream 
business. Prove-ID Link, designed to help 
financially excluded people in India verify their 
identity, is integrated into our CrossCore 
identity-authentication platform. The Trilha 
Financeira (Financial Trail) online training has 
been taken on by our Consumer Services 
business in Brazil. And several social 
innovation products form part of our Experian 
Health offering in the USA.

This year, we partnered with charities and 
businesses to launch a Support Hub in the UK 
(see above) that enables consumers to easily 
notify multiple organisations about their 
support needs and vulnerabilities through a 
single action. This, in turn, enables clients to 
tailor customer support to better meet these 
needs. It initially focuses on three specific 
support needs – sight, sound and mind – and 
we will integrate other types of needs in future.

We have also created a credit education 
simulation tool, to be tested in the coming year, 
to support financial inclusion in the USA, and 
the Smallholders Marketplace to improve 
access to credit among smallholder farmers in 
Brazil (see page 61). Newly funded social 
innovation solutions this year include plans to 
extend the Support Hub to cover additional 
support needs in the UK, financial 
management support for micro and small 
businesses in Brazil, and a product to enable 
SMEs in Brazil to gain access to credit based 
on an assessment of their ESG rating.

Community investment
Our flagship United for Financial Health 
programme to empower underserved 
communities through financial education has 
connected with over 113 million people since it 

launched in 2020, exceeding our target of 100 
million by 2024. 

This year, highlights included: transforming the 
Protect the Bag online video series, launched 
last year with Grammy Award-winning artist 
Lecrae, into live financial education forums to 
empower Black Americans; collaborating with 
singer Jake Wesley Rogers to amplify key 
messages among LGBTQ+ communities in 
North America; and joining forces with football 
star Adebayo Akinfenwa and money influencer 
Iona Bain on a campaign to educate young 
adults in the UK on both physical and financial 
health. We also continued other NGO 
partnerships across our regions and began a 
new partnership with Srujna Charitable Trust 
in India to help women affected by poverty to 
earn a respectable income.

We aim to further increase United for Financial 
Health connections through ongoing 
programmes and NGO partnerships across 
our regions.

United for Financial Health is part of our wider 
community investment. We contribute funding, 
products (as gifts in kind) and expertise 
(through employee volunteering) to benefit the 
communities where we operate. Our 
community investment contributions totalled 
US$17.6m this year, exceeding our annual goal 
of 1% of benchmark profit before tax. This 
includes US$1m in cash, product and other 
donations contributed to various non-profit 
agencies to help refugees displaced by conflict. 

Experian employees volunteered 47,000 hours 
of their time (in and outside working hours) to 
help their communities, including sharing their 
expertise to support programmes designed to 
improve financial health.

Back to living in peace

Being in debt and defaulting is a heavy 
burden. People suffer emotionally 
from the anxiety that comes from not 
meeting repayments. They may suffer 
physically too, from working several 
jobs or doing without bare necessities, 
trying to make ends meet while 
paying back the debt and accumulated 
penalties. It can be a desperate 
situation.

In Brazil, 40% of adults, around 70 
million people, are behind on their 
debt repayments. Many find 
themselves in this situation due to no 
fault of their own. For example, a close 
relative may have taken on debt under 
their name, or they may have lost their 
job during the pandemic. Recent high 
inflation has also played a part, 
pushing many into using credit to  
buy food.

On our Serasa Limpa Nome  
(Clean My Name) platform, people can 
renegotiate their debts simply and 
quickly, without having to leave home. 
They can obtain new repayment plans 
from over 500 banks, retailers, 
finance companies and others, and 
receive up to 99% discount on their 
debts. For many people this is an 
opportunity to start again; to rebuild 
relationships; to see a way to a better 
quality of life; to live in peace.

Treating data with respect
Data is at the heart of our business. We are entrusted with data on 
1.5 billion people and 201 million businesses worldwide. 

We are deeply aware of our responsibility to 
treat data – and those it belongs to – with care 
and respect. Living up to this responsibility is 
fundamental to securing the trust Experian 
depends on to exist, grow and create a better 
tomorrow. 

To do this, we protect the data we hold, use it 
fairly and make sure it is as accurate as 
possible. We are open about the data we 
collect, how we use it and who we share it 
with. And we use data to increase financial 
inclusion and help people improve their 
financial lives. 

Our five Global Data Principles embody these 
key values (see below) and apply in all 
territories where Experian operates. They 
guide how we manage and use data, build 
products and conduct all aspects of our 
business. We are embedding the principles 

Experian Global Data Principles

Security 
Data security is critical. Securing and 
protecting data against unauthorised 
access, use, disclosure and loss are key 
priorities for us. 

Accuracy 
We will make data as accurate, complete 
and relevant as possible for the way we use 
it, always in compliance with legal 
requirements. 

Fairness 
We collect and use data fairly and for 
legitimate purposes, balancing privacy 
expectations with the social and economic 
benefits derived from the responsible use 
of data for individuals, businesses and 
clients. 

Transparency 
We are open about the types of data we 
collect, where we get it, how it is used and 
where it is shared. Where appropriate we 
provide individuals with access to the data 
we collect about them and the ability to 
correct, restrict or delete data. 

Inclusion 
We seek to improve financial health and 
inclusion for all through the innovative use 
of relevant data to help individuals improve 
their financial lives.

into relevant processes throughout the 
business and will continue to apply them to 
new product ideas through our global 
innovation framework, and as our business 
evolves through transformations (including the 
ongoing move to cloud computing) and 
acquisitions. 

Security
The loss or inappropriate use of data and 
systems could result in material loss of 
business, substantial legal liability, regulatory 
enforcement actions and significant harm to 
our reputation. 

Our approach
Security comes first at Experian. We 
continually enhance and invest in our security 
infrastructure, practices and culture across 
the business. We have specialist teams, 
state-of-the-art technology and rigorous due 
diligence procedures to deal with potential 
cyber security threats. 

Our security approach has three tiers: applying 
tools and processes to prevent threats from 
entering our environment; detecting if a threat 
enters our environment; and mitigating any 
threats by minimising the potential for 
information to be extracted from our 
environment. Threat-informed defence helps 
us shape, assess, prioritise and measure the 
effectiveness of our approach.

Protecting our data

We have controls in place to check for 
compliance and constantly scan for potential 
threats, with several layers of protection for 
our data assets (see diagram below). 

Our Global Security Operations Centre works 
around the clock to identify suspicious or 
malicious activity, with teams in Malaysia, the 
UK and the USA, as well as automated tools and 
artificial intelligence. If a threat is identified, our 
incident response team steps in to eliminate it 
with support from in-house forensic data 
specialists and external experts if required.

We interact with law enforcement authorities 
and others in our industry to gather intelligence 
to help our security teams stay ahead of 
evolving cyber threats. We also share our 
knowledge to help other businesses and 
consumers keep their data safe. Our annual 
Data Breach Industry Forecast highlights 
emerging threats for 2023 and the coming 
decade, including increasing use of artificial 
intelligence for cyber attacks and of deepfake 
technology for identity theft.

Most data breaches involve some human 
interaction, often something as simple as 
clicking a link in an email. Our email and web 
browsing controls protect against this kind of 
malware, and our employee security training 
encourages people to think carefully about what 
they are clicking on. 

We have a defence-in-depth approach to protecting our critical data assets, which provides 
multiple layers of control and protection.

We use a robust identity and access 
management programme to control access to 
our critical assets. Users with privileged 
accounts are subject to strict controls that 
include multifactor authentication, password 
rotation, session recording and more frequent 
access recertification.

Our Development, Security and Operations 
(DevSecOps) teams work together to build 
security considerations into our products 
throughout their lifecycle. We use a range of 
processes, including manual penetration 
testing, to discover, detect and remediate any 
potential security risks at every stage of product 
development – from concept to coding, build, 
quality assurance and production. 

We conduct regular risk assessments and 
vulnerability checks, and our operations are 
subject to external cyber security audits every 
year. Simulated exercises and a global data 
breach plan prepare our cyber security teams 
and senior leaders to respond rapidly in the 
event of a breach. 

In the event of a serious breach, we would 
disclose information about the incident and 
commit to contact any affected data subjects in 
a timely way. We do not publicly disclose 
vulnerabilities or lapses due to client 
sensitivities. To the extent that any relevant 
regulator should find fault with our data breach 
management or data security practices, they 
will publish their findings and any related 
sanctions. There were no new findings or 
sanctions in FY23.

Security governance 
The Chief Information Security Officer has 
overall responsibility for Experian’s global 
security strategy and reports quarterly to the 
Audit Committee. The Global Security Office 
(GSO) sets relevant policies and standards. 

The Security and Continuity Steering 
Committee – which includes the Chief 
Executive Officer, Chief Financial Officer, Chief 
Operating Officer and Group President Global 
Technology – oversees our approach to 
keeping data secure and protecting consumer 
information. Key metrics on security tools, 
compliance and training completion rates are 
reported monthly, with regular reviews at the 
regional and global levels. The global Steering 
Committee meets formally every other month, 
or more frequently if required, to review 
governance matters regarding security 
strategy, policy, risks or threats.

We continually review and adapt our 
information security programme, tools, 
expertise and processes to respond to evolving 
threats and maintain alignment with external 
standards. We have a comprehensive Global 
Security Policy and controls based on the 
internationally recognised ISO 27001 standard 
that drives continuous improvement.

Our robust information security programme 
builds on industry-recognised procedures. We 
seek and receive third-party assurance 
through ISO 27001 certifications of key 
business areas and systems, as well as other 
recognised external accreditations of our 
security programmes. For example, we hold a 
UK Cyber Essentials Plus Certification and 
perform risk assessments of our critical and 
external-facing applications annually. 

Security, Audit and Risk teams work together 
to continually improve our assurance 
capabilities and test the effectiveness of our 
controls. Our Three Lines of Defence model for 
risk management (see page 79) includes 
review by Global Internal Audit and oversight 
from the Audit Committee. Any potential policy 
breaches are thoroughly investigated and we 
take disciplinary action where appropriate. 

The GSO conducts due diligence to identify any 
potential risks before an acquisition, followed 
by an in-depth post-acquisition security 
assessment that is reviewed by Global Internal 
Audit.

When it is necessary to provide third parties 
with access to our data and systems, the GSO 
ensures we provide access in line with our 
information security requirements. We extend 
stringent standards on information security to 
our suppliers and partners through the terms 
of our contracts. All third parties must undergo 
a risk assessment and any material security 
gaps identified must be remediated before 
they begin working with Experian. Existing 
third parties are assessed periodically and we 
work with them to drive continuous 
improvements in their security procedures. 
Over the last two years, we have reduced the 
number of active suppliers overall. Of the 
approximately 7,300 active third parties we 
have now, around 900 have been identified as 
significant or high risk and all of these have 
undergone more in-depth assurance by the 
GSO. 

Security requirements are tiered based on this 
risk assessment, and can include increased 
controls for higher-risk third parties. We 
monitor compliance through our third-party 
risk management framework and third parties 
identified as significant or high risk are added 
to the GSO’s continuous monitoring 
programme, which alerts us to any material 
changes to trigger follow-up action if needed. 
Our risk profiling and validation processes 
include a strong focus on higher-risk third 
parties through our Third Party Security 
programme, together with a robust Risk and 
Control Framework, assurance controls, and 
accompanying tools and training for relevant 
teams.

Our information security culture
At Experian, information security is everyone’s 
responsibility. We set out clear requirements 

>300 

training courses are available 
for people across the business 
to find out more about keeping 
information safe across various 
web, mobile and desktop 
platforms

>60,000 

courses were completed this 
year

for employees and business units in our 
Security Risk Management and Governance 
Policy. We invest significant time and 
resources in training and awareness. 

Our strong information security culture starts 
at the top of the business. Senior leaders are 
highly engaged and continually reinforce the 
message that security is the personal 
responsibility of everyone working with us. All 
our employees and any contractors who have 
access to our systems must complete 
mandatory training on information security 
and data protection – when they first start 
working with us and annually thereafter. We 
track training completion rates weekly and 
provide a monthly dashboard to the Security 
and Continuity Steering Committee.

Promoting vigilance against phishing attacks 
remains a priority. This year, we ran regular 
phishing awareness campaigns for every 
employee and contractor to test their 
response, with difficulty levels adjusted in line 
with the threat environment. These metrics 
are reported to our Security and Continuity 
Steering Committee. If anyone fails a phishing 
test, we provide timely feedback and additional 
training. We also provided additional 
awareness training for employees in roles 
most likely to be targeted by phishing attacks.

More than 300 training courses are available 
for people across the business to find out more 
about keeping information safe across various 
web, mobile and desktop platforms, 
applications and software. We provide 
additional in-depth training for people working 
in higher-risk roles, such as product and 
software development. More than 60,000 
courses were completed this year.

We routinely refresh our training to stay up to 
date with evolving risks and circumstances. 
We also conduct regular outreach 
programmes on a variety of information 
security topics to make sure people are aware 
of emerging threats. These include simulations 
of security incidents.

Experian plc Strategic report47

gender, sex, age, race, ethnicity, religion or 
sexual orientation is not included in credit 
reports or scores. However, when someone 
transitions gender, and changes their name, 
their credit and financial history may still be 
tied to their birth name (or ‘deadname’), which 
can unintentionally ‘out’ the consumer or force 
them to establish a new credit history. In the 
UK and the USA, we have processes that 
enable people who identify as transgender or 
non-binary to affirm their identity, update their 
name and suppress their deadname so it does 
not appear on their Experian credit report.

Many of our products also empower 
consumers and businesses to check for any 
inaccuracies in their financial profiles and take 
steps to protect their data, including choosing 
to block access to their credit report to help 
reduce the risk of identity theft and fraud. This 
year, we launched CreditLock in the UK, 
enabling CreditExpert and IdentityPlus 
customers to lock or unlock their Experian 
credit report at the touch of a button. The new 
feature also alerts customers in real time if 
any new credit searches are made in their 
name and if it has stopped any fraudulent 
applications on their behalf. Premium 
subscribers in the USA can also lock and 
unlock their credit reports quickly and easily 
with the CreditLock feature, and our credit 
score app in Brazil includes a lock/unlock 
feature that enables premium subscribers to 
block and unblock their credit score from any 
third party that tries to consult their data. 
Accompanying information explains how this 
feature can help to reduce the risk of fraud, as 
well as educating consumers about different 
kinds of fraud and the importance of protecting 
their credit score.

Accuracy
Accurate credit reports enable lenders to give 
people fairer access to credit and essential 
services to improve their lives (see page 42). 
Any inaccuracies in credit reports – and the 
data they are built on – can cause problems for 
consumers, and potentially deny them fair 
access to credit and services.

We understand how important this issue is for 
consumers, and accuracy is one of our Global 
Data Principles that guide our approach 
wherever we operate. Data accuracy principles 
are also being written into data protection 
regulations in many countries.

We are committed to making data as accurate, 
complete and relevant as possible for the way 
it is used, always in compliance with legal 
requirements. We constantly strive to improve 
the accuracy of our data in a competitive 
market to ensure our clients can always rely 
on it to make appropriate decisions.

We have strict processes for data accuracy 
– from sourcing accurate data in the first place 
to monitoring and improving accuracy over 
time, and resolving reported inaccuracies or 
information queried by consumers. Our focus 
is on the timeliness, accuracy and 
completeness of the data we hold and the 
reports we provide to our clients. 

Sourcing accurate data
All our data comes from reputable sources 
and, as part of our due diligence processes 
before we onboard new sources of data, our 
quality control procedures help us identify and 
weed out inaccurate or out-of-date information 
before we add it to our databases. 

We work with data providers to review and 
continuously improve the quality of the 
information we receive. To do this, we regularly 
review and report back on quality to our data 
providers so we can drive continuous 
improvement. We also offer a comprehensive 
suite of software and analytics tools to help 
them check data before they submit it to us.

We monitor how data providers deal with 
queries about data and how they remediate 
them to improve accuracy. If data providers 
are unwilling to implement improvements to 
meet our standards, we will no longer source 
data from them. 

Monitoring and improving data accuracy
Once we have acquired data, we frequently 
update and periodically audit the information in 
our databases to ensure it is as current as 
possible. We apply further quality assurance 
techniques, including screening for logical 
inconsistencies and applying data-matching 
algorithms, before providing data to our 
clients. This ensures we provide clients with 
information that represents consumers and 
businesses as accurately and fairly as 
possible. 

We also monitor queries received directly from 
consumers to identify trends relating to data 
quality, enabling us to rectify many accuracy 
issues quickly at source. We make it a priority 
to rapidly resolve any conflicts or errors that 
are likely to have a material impact on a 
consumer’s credit score.

In the UK, we have added more than 33 million 
net new records to our consumer bureau in the 
last year alone, constantly reviewing the 
market and working with new lenders and 
sectors to ensure their customers are 
represented appropriately within the bureau. 
Our Data Office leads our efforts to achieve 
world-class data governance through a strong 
focus on data quality, acquisition, transparency 
and privacy across both our credit and 
marketing services businesses. As part of this 
approach, we continue to invest in technology 
to automate and monitor the way we improve 
our data.

In the USA, we manage the accuracy of data 
from around 13,000 providers that have data 
on file. Every month, we receive around 36,000 
submissions from data providers, and update 
around 1.2 billion records – 98% within 24 
hours. We are innovating to continuously 
improve our data integrity and focus on 
targeted changes that drive even better 
accuracy for US consumers.

Empowering consumers to correct their data
We empower people to correct, restrict and 
delete data, where appropriate. We provide 
consumers with various methods to view their 
credit information and request corrections, if 
needed. In the UK and the USA, agents in our 
support centres are trained to help consumers 
with questions, concerns or disputes about 
information in their credit file or other personal 
data we hold that might be processed for other 
purposes, such as the provision of marketing 
services to our clients. Our websites in the UK 
and the USA make it easy for people to raise a 
query about credit information and get it 
corrected quickly, and in Brazil we offer a form 
to dispute data by post. 

We pass on consumer disputes to the data 
provider to evaluate, resolve and supply 
corrected data where errors are confirmed. 
Each time a data provider responds to a 
request for verification, they must also confirm 
that the entire account is accurate. In the USA, 
if the data provider fails to respond within 30 
days, we will delete the item. Similarly in the 
UK, if the data provider fails to respond within 
28 days, the data is temporarily suppressed on 
the consumer’s credit report until a response 
is received. Once a dispute is resolved, we 
update data as required and notify the 
consumer of the result.

Data accuracy is particularly relevant for the 
transgender and non-binary community with 
regard to name changes. Information about

Fairness
We are committed to collecting and using data 
fairly and for legitimate purposes and 
complying with regulations on data lifecycle 
and retention in the markets in which we 
operate. We carefully balance privacy 
expectations with the social and economic 
benefits derived from the responsible use of 
data for individuals, businesses and clients. 

Our privacy policies vary in each country or 
region to comply with local regulatory 
requirements. Underlying these policies is our 
commitment to provide consumers with notice, 
choice and education about the use of personal 
information. Educated consumers are better 
equipped to be effective, successful 
participants in a world that increasingly relies 
on the exchange of information to deliver 
relevant products and services efficiently. 

Lenders need access to accurate information 
about people’s financial profiles from Experian 
or other credit bureaux. Such information is 
integral to an efficient and competitive credit 
ecosystem that provides innovative products 
which enable consumers to get the most out of 
their data, contributes to economic growth and 
supports a stable consumer banking system.

Our Marketing Services business also gathers, 
analyses, combines and processes data to help 
organisations better understand consumers so 
they can offer them relevant products and 
services, and communicate more effectively 
and at the right time. 

We evaluate every product and service to 
ensure we strike the right balance between 
consumers’ privacy expectations and the 
economic benefit to consumers and clients, as 
well as considering societal benefits. Our 
comprehensive data protection programme 
details the steps we take to mitigate data 
protection risks, and what we expect from our 
employees. 

We are committed to obtaining, processing, 
using and retaining data compliantly and 
responsibly. We strive to only ever share data 
with authorised and trusted organisations. 
When we do so, we follow strict guidelines and 
comply with all relevant laws. 

We take fair and appropriate measures when it 
comes to data retention, adhering to national, 
state and federal regulations in locations 
where we operate. We have strict processes to 
appropriately manage the lifecycle of data we 
hold and to allow appropriate access to, and 
deletion and correction of, data when 
requested by the individual data subjects in 
each of our markets. We communicate details 
on retention and privacy through our websites. 
We also embed the concept of privacy by 
design into the data journey to ensure that we 
are using only the minimum amount of 
personal data needed for a specific purpose.

Responsible marketing 
We're committed to putting your interests at 
the heart of everything we do.

The safeguards we have in place protect your 
personal data so you experience positive 
outcomes because of our activities.

In many parts of the world, regulations on data 
privacy set clear requirements on the way data 
is collected and used, and how consent is 
gained from consumers. We regularly review 
our data processes to ensure compliance with 
regulations, such as the Data Protection Act 
2018 in the UK, the General Data Protection 
Regulation (GDPR) in the UK and European 
Union, the California Consumer Privacy Act 
(CCPA) and other state laws in the USA, and the 
Brazil General Data Protection Law (LGPD). 

Data offers huge potential to support jobs and 
prosperity. We need a regulatory framework 
that nurtures and supports use of data to 
encourage growth, while protecting 
consumers’ privacy. We respond to 
government consultations and engage with 
regulators and policy-makers as privacy 
regulations and guidance evolve, for example 
on the implications for privacy in relation to 
use of artificial intelligence and machine 
learning. Many regional and national 
regulations on data privacy share common 
principles, and we advocate for interoperability 
to support global commerce. 

Our Group Operating Committee and senior 
leaders receive regular briefings to keep them 
apprised of privacy developments around the 
world, and we update our policies and 
practices accordingly. 

In the UK, in February 2023, Experian’s appeal 
to the First Tier Tribunal against the 
Information Commissioner's Office (ICO) 
Enforcement Notice from 2018 was 
substantially successful. The Tribunal set aside 
the eight requirements from the ICO’s 

Scan me  
to see the Marketing 
Services Consumer 
Information Portal

Enforcement Notice. It issued a substitute 
enforcement notice which contained the 
requirement that if Experian continues to use 
data from certain public data sources, it must 
notify those whose data has been received 
only from those public data sources of its data 
processing. 

In line with its public statements, the ICO is 
appealing the decision and we expect the 
hearing of that appeal to take place in the latter 
part of 2023. The substitute enforcement 
notice is stayed pending the outcome of the 
appeal.

Transparency
We strive to be open and transparent about the 
types of data we collect from consumers and 
third parties, where we get it, how it is used 
and where it is shared. Where appropriate, we 
provide individuals with access to the data we 
collect about them and give them the ability to 
correct, restrict and delete data.

Data transparency not only empowers 
consumers, it also benefits our business. For 
example, our marketing services are more 
effective for our clients when more people 
understand their ability to set their marketing 
preferences, as this means fewer people 
receive unwanted marketing to which they 
would not be receptive.

In the UK, the privacy section of our website 
provides privacy policies for different parts of 
the business, and our Marketing Services 
Consumer Information Portal (MSCIP) explains 
data rights and sets out the various ways we

commitment to financial inclusion for all, and 
our Chief Operating Officer, Craig Boundy, sits 
on the national working group of the US Office 
of the Comptroller of the Currency’s 
Roundtable for Economic Access and Change 
(REACh).

Our Inclusion Forward programme, initially 
launched in the USA, aims to help our clients 
further accelerate financial inclusion in the 
communities they serve, and create better 
outcomes for underserved consumers and 
small businesses by unlocking barriers to 
financial health. It helps clients: understand 
geographic areas and segments with the 
largest opportunities for inclusion; benchmark 
and track progress; incorporate expanded

owners; and develop and educate vulnerable 
populations, offering additional tools to 
support their credit journey.

use personal and anonymised data. The 
content on these websites is designed to be 
clear and easy for non-experts, and the MSCIP 
includes a series of engaging videos on topics 
such as how we obtain data and how people 
can benefit from sharing their data. Individuals 
can use the MSCIP to find out if they are on our 
marketing file and understand what data we 
hold about them, where this data comes from 
and how it is used. It includes a prominent 
feature enabling people to easily opt out of 
targeted marketing if they choose. 

To enhance transparency about the marketing 
profiles we build, the MSCIP allows consumers 
to view our Mosaic classification for any valid 
UK postcode. Through this feature, consumers 
can get a flavour of how marketers may view 
them, or people with similar profiles, when 
using our Mosaic segmentation to improve the 
relevance of their marketing messages. The 
results use simple icons to show key attributes 
– such as property, transport, lifestyle and 
holidays – in a way that’s easy to understand at 
a glance. In a survey of 378 nationally 
representative adults, 92% agreed the 
information on our ‘how we use your data’ 
page was easy to understand.

In Brazil, our privacy terms page is designed to 
be user-friendly, translating the consumer 
contract into simple, accessible language and 
layout before the user logs in. We also provide 
consumers with illustrations of what their 
positive data means, to help them understand 
how it affects their overall financial health.

In the USA, we set out our privacy policies for 
specific products and services in the privacy 
section of our website. Consumers can access 
the credit information that Experian holds on 
them in various ways, including by signing up 
for a free or paid membership through the 
Reports and Scores section of our website. 
They will then be presented with a report 
showing the data Experian holds on them and 
how to dispute this information online if 
necessary. Our credit reports in North America 
also include a Credit Report Insights section 
that features infographics, colour-coding and 
easy-to-interpret explanations of the factors 
that may be helping or hurting a consumer’s 
credit status and score. We have applied the 
standards of individual state privacy laws 
more broadly so all US residents can also 
manage their personal data permissions 
through the Central Consumer Consent (CP3A) 
platform. 

We work with financial institutions to enhance 
transparency with consumers. In the UK, when 
a consumer applies for credit, the lender will 
direct them to an industry-standard 
information notice – the Credit Agency 
Information Notice (CRAIN) – which presents 
clear and consistent information explaining 
how credit reference agencies use and share 
personal information. As with the MSCIP, the 

CRAIN uses clear language to make it 
accessible to consumers and is divided into 
easy-to-access sections. It also references 
other privacy and transparency notices that 
may be relevant to the consumer.

In the USA, financial institutions provide 
adverse action notices when an applicant is 
denied credit or employment based on 
information included on their consumer credit 
report. This notice includes a brief description 
of the data used for the decision and a contact 
for the credit reference agencies that provided 
the data, as well as triggering the right of the 
consumer to review their credit report free of 
charge.

Inclusion
We enhance financial inclusion by using data to 
create insights that help lenders offer fairer 
access to credit to more people. 

Our aim is to help more people get better 
access to credit by sharing relevant data with 
lending organisations, including adding 
alternative sources of data, such as positive 
data about on-time payments of utility bills and 
subscription services. 

Products such as Experian Boost and Experian 
Go enable individuals to directly contribute 
such data to their profiles to help them 
enhance their credit score or establish a credit 
profile for the first time (see page 42). This 
year, we added the option to contribute rent 
payments, to enable millions of renters in the 
USA to instantly improve their credit score.

In the UK, we have contributed to a reduction in 
the number of credit invisibles and thin files 
from nine million to fewer than five million 
over the last six years by introducing additional 
data sources into our products and improving 
data accuracy.

A new social innovation product, to be piloted 
in the coming year, could help millions more 
UK credit invisibles access mainstream 
financial services by building their credit files 
in as little as three months. Another solution 
being developed through our Social Innovation 
programme aims to enhance financial 
inclusion for more than one million Venezuelan 
migrants living in Colombia by making it

Inspiring and supporting our people
Our people are central to our purpose. Our aim is to be a market-leading 
destination for talent, underpinned by a high-performing and inclusive culture 
where our people feel valued and able to do their best work in support of our 
purpose and our ambitious plans for growth. 

We have an ambition to be one of the best 
places to work in the world and we have 
continued to score highly in external 
recognition this year (see Awards on page 52). 
We are making progress across the Group 
through programmes in five strategic 
focus areas:

1. Creating a culture that puts 
people first
Create a 'wow' employee experience that 
sets us apart

2. Growing world-beating leaders
Grow the next generation of leaders with 
strong product, technology and customer 
orientation

3. Focusing on tech talent
Keep in tune with current and future tech 
skills, specifically focusing on attracting 
and retaining product design and product 
building capabilities

4. Preparing our organisation for 
growth
Play a leading role in defining the 
organisation we need so that we are 
prepared for global opportunities and 
growth

5. Supporting colleagues with their 
career development
Enable everyone in Experian to develop 
and progress their careers

1. Creating a culture that puts  
people ﬁrst
The world of work is changing rapidly, and 
we believe our people and culture are key 
differentiators for us. Our business offers an 
exciting future and our strong purpose – our 
belief in doing the right thing for our people 
and the communities we serve – helps us 
attract people who want to work somewhere 
they feel they can make a difference. 

We have continued to evolve our employer 
brand and employee value proposition. 
This year, we have made progress towards 
being recognised as a leading employer, and 
enhanced perceptions of us in the market as 
an innovative, technology organisation. As a 
result, we have seen our seventh consecutive 
year of improvements in our Glassdoor score, 
now 4.4 out of 5, and we are now in the top 
quartile of companies globally listed in the 
Link Humans Employer Brand Index. 

Offering flexible ways of working
The COVID-19 pandemic accelerated the 
transition to new ways of working. In FY22 our 
Group-wide Future of Work programme 
considered the role of our offices as well as the 
technology investments needed to enable 
more hybrid working. Following this, we 
created a variety of options – Hub, Hybrid, 
Home and Roam – to give our people more 
choice in the way they work. In our FY23 
annual employee survey, over 90% of our 
people said they value our approach to flexible 
working, and employee engagement was up 
four points from the previous year. At the same 
time, we have maintained productivity levels 
and innovation measures across the 
organisation. 

Embracing diversity, equity and inclusion
Diversity, equity and inclusion (DEI) is essential 
to our purpose of creating a better tomorrow, 
together, by making positive changes in the 
world and supporting efforts to close the 
financial wealth gap of underserved 
communities (see page 49). We support and 
encourage expressions of diversity, including 
thought, style, sexual orientation, gender 
identity or expression, race, ethnicity, disability, 
culture and experience. 

Our Global Chief DEI Officer leads our DEI 
strategy, which focuses on our people, our 
clients, consumers and communities. Regional 
CEOs and business unit leaders are accountable 
for implementing the accompanying Diversity 
Action Plans and monitor progress at quarterly 
business reviews. DEI is also part of our wider 
sustainable business strategy and ESG agenda, 
overseen by our executive-level ESG Steering 
Committee (see page 39). Inclusive leadership is 
a key element of our new Leadership Exchange 
development programme (see page 53). 

Our DEI Report sets out how we are putting our 
DEI strategy into practice across five key areas 
– gender, mental health, disability, LGBTQ+ and 
ethnicity – each sponsored by a member of our 
Group Operating Committee.

The DEI highlights for our people  
in FY23 include:

 a Investing in technologies to improve 

accessibility, and launching a 
Barrier-Free Experian campaign to make 
progress towards an inclusive and 
barrier-free workplace, and solutions for 
our people, customers and consumers 
with visible or non-visible disabilities.
 a Publishing a Global Approach to Mental 
Health and Wellbeing, supported by a 
new Global Wellbeing Hub, to showcase 
our commitment to providing a 
psychologically safe and healthy 
environment where everyone has good 
mental wellbeing. We have now trained 
over 400 Mental Health First Aiders, 2% 
of our employees and double our 1% 
target.

 a Continuing to support recruitment and 

development of women, to move towards 
our gender-diversity targets for FY24 
(see the table to the right). In FY23, 
representation of women increased to 
34% of our senior leaders. Women 
account for 36% of our mid-level leaders 
and 44% of our total workforce. In 
addition, we continued our focus on 
increasing the representation of Black 
and Hispanic/Latino employees in our US 
business, which increased from 16.9% in 
FY22 to 17.5% in FY23. We will continue 
to drive our focus on reinforcing our 
culture of inclusion and belonging within 
our Asian representation, which 
currently makes up 20.4% of our 
employee population in the USA.
 a Expanding benefits in some regions, 
such as enhanced parental leave in 
North America and Spanish Latin 
America, and menopause healthcare in 
the UK and Ireland, to become more 
inclusive and remove barriers for our 
people.

 a Introducing a global voluntary 

self-identification programme to help us 
better understand our people, so we can 
make more-informed decisions on 
inclusivity and representation. The Count 
Me In programme invites our people, if 
they feel comfortable doing so, to 
disclose some of the things that make up 
their identity, like gender and ethnicity.

Employee resource groups (ERGs) continued  
to play an important role in our DEI efforts this 
year and supported global campaigns, such  
as our annual Your Mind Matters week to raise 
awareness of mental health. They also ran 
regional activities to celebrate events, 
including International Women’s Day, 
International Men’s Day, International Day of 
Persons with Disabilities, Pride Month, Black 
History Month and Hispanic History Month.

We are working towards a stronger global 
structure for the ERGs. In FY23, we created a 
global portal to showcase all our ERGs and 
associated events, and enable employees to 
join an ERG at the click of a button. The portal 
provides access to a comprehensive resource 
library complete with event replays, podcasts, 
books and articles, and it increases awareness 
of product initiatives employees can get 
involved in to support financial inclusion.  
In FY24, we aim to significantly increase 
membership of our ERGs, connect them  
with development opportunities and enable 
volunteering to support specific communities. 
We will also invite ERG feedback on new 
products and services before taking them  
to market.

Engaging our people 
We run an annual global survey with Great 
Place to Work (GPTW) to understand employee 
sentiment and identify opportunities to 
maximise employee experience. In FY23,  
70% of our employees participated in our 
second annual GPTW survey, up from 58% the 
previous year, demonstrating that our people 

are keen to let us know their views. We  
saw promising improvements, and overall 
engagement increased by four points to 82%.

We also carry out regular pulse surveys to  
look at and measure leadership effectiveness, 
flexibility, culture and simplicity, to help us 
make ongoing improvements for our people. 

Taking part in the GPTW survey is a key part  
of our People strategy, as it helps to position  
us internally and externally as a top tech 
employer based on real feedback from our 
people. Our survey scores and workplace 
practices mean we are now certified as a 
Great Place to Work in 22 countries. In addition, 
Experian was again included in the Fortune 
100 Best Places to Work in 2022 in the USA, 
UK's Best Workplaces 2023 and Best 
Companies to Work for in IT 2023 in Brazil.  
We have also received further external 
recognition for specific aspects of our people 
agenda, including our commitment to inclusion 
of women and LGBTQ+ colleagues, disability 
equality and mental health (see above and  
our DEI Report for more).

We communicate regularly with our people 
through townhalls, listening forums and 
colleague events. Horizon, our market-leading 
employee communications platform, remains 
popular with employees, with 97% registered 
and 88% regularly active on the platform.

We also encourage our people to contribute 
their ideas through our global hackathons.

Rewarding and recognising our people
We continue to celebrate our Experian Way 
behaviours (see above), resulting in us handing 
out over 32,000 employee-nominated 
recognition awards in FY23. 

2. Growing world-beating leaders 
We have created a new global standard for 
leadership across the business this year, 
defining the characteristics of great leadership 
to help develop our leaders across the Group. 
This year, we launched the Leadership 
Exchange – an online portal with access to 
on-demand development and support. Content 
was co-created with our leaders and supported 
by content from external providers such as 
Harvard Mentor Manager and Bravely Coaching. 

We also refreshed our Experian Business 
Network leadership programme and launched 
a new CEO Forum which offers development 
support and access to top leaders within 
Experian. 

In the FY23 annual GPTW survey, our 
leadership-effectiveness score increased two 
points to 82%. In the February 2023 Pulse 
survey, this score further increased to 87%, 
which places us above the World’s Best 
Workplaces Top 25 benchmark for the first time. 

3. Focusing on tech talent 
Attracting, retaining and developing the best 
tech talent is essential for us to realise our 
ambition of becoming a world-class product 
organisation.

With skills gaps in technical talent being felt 
all around the world, we have had to look to 
alternative avenues to grow and develop  
these skills.

We have continued to expand our early-in-
careers programmes to develop young, 
diverse talent through the organisation. 
For example, our Transforme-se (transform 
yourself) programme in Brazil provides 
young people and under-represented groups, 
such as women, people from low economic 
backgrounds and people with disabilities, with 
technical skills training and apprenticeships.  
To date, we received c.8,000 applications and 
have awarded 280 scholarships.

In the UK and Ireland, we doubled the number 
of graduates and apprentices in our 2022 
cohort to over 100, and have strengthened 
our relationships with local schools and 
universities to support students interested 
in STEM subjects.

For FY23, we continued to use 
SmartRecruiters global applicant-tracking 
system. This supported 949,000 global 
applications and helped us facilitate 5,575 
hires. Our top three sourcing channels were; 
LinkedIn (67%), Glassdoor (14%), and the 
Experian global careers site (10%). These 
channels generated a significant amount of 
reach and engagement, building our brand 
attractiveness and awareness. Glassdoor 
had an impressive 6,900,000 interactions with 
our Experian Glassdoor profile pages and 
advertised jobs. Our Experian global careers 
site had 292,000 unique visitors during FY23.

We have a global talent pool within Experian 
for critical technology skills, and we have been 
focusing on creating a world-class digital 
curriculum for tech talent through 
partnerships with Pluralsight and DataCamp. 
We have seen strong uptake rates of these 
learning resources, and we will continue to 
develop the offering and extend it to all 
colleagues.

Transforme-se 
In Brazil, our Transforme-se programme 
provides women, people from low economic 
backgrounds and people with disabilities, with 
technical skills training and apprenticeships.

4. Preparing our organisation  
for growth
We are taking a stronger approach to our 
workforce planning, so we are clearer on what 
skills we need, where we need them, how 
many people we need, and what timeframe we 
need these skills in. This will enable us to plan 
a strategy to ‘buy, build, borrow or bot’ the 
skills required to meet our business objectives. 

We also aim to close key skills gaps by further 
developing our existing employees. Our global 
frameworks help us identify the skillsets we 
have in the organisation, to make sure the right 
people are working on our most critical 
projects at any given time, as well as providing 
employees with a way to view and compare 
potential roles, identify their own skills gaps, 
and access personalised learning paths. 

5. Supporting colleagues with their 
career development 
With top talent increasingly looking for career 
development opportunities within their 
organisations, we have an opportunity to set 
ourselves apart by becoming somewhere 
people come to grow.

We held our second Global Careers Week in 
January 2023, which was attended by 13,000 
employees. This year’s strapline was 'Ignite 
Your Career' which brought to life elements 
that are critical for career development, such 
as knowing yourself, planning your journey, 
learning, and upskilling to deliver excellence. 
Throughout the week, the sessions reinforced 
our commitment to developing our people, our 
investment in our engineering talent and how 
colleagues can take advantage of the learning 
resources that are available to everyone via 
our internal Career Hub (a world-class digital 
curriculum for our people and a one-stop shop 
for career development needs). During the 
week, the Leadership Exchange portal was 
launched to all people managers and senior 
leaders, and more than 1,000 leaders joined a 
fireside chat with our CEO, Brian Cassin, about 
making leadership our competitive advantage.

Our focus on improving employability is 
already bringing positive results. In FY23  
27.7% of our people moved jobs within 
Experian, up from 18.9% last year, and we want 
to grow this further. In this year’s GPTW survey, 
74% of participating employees agreed with 
the statement that ‘I am offered training or 
development to further myself professionally’ 
– up six points from the previous year overall, 
and for tech talent specifically this score 
increased by nine points to 73%.

Working with integrity
Working with integrity is one of our core values. Our Global Code of Conduct, 
available in several languages, sets out clear guidance to help everyone at 
Experian make the right decisions. We regularly review it to determine if 
updates are required and we will publish our next update in the coming year.

The Global Code of Conduct is supported by 
detailed policies on specific topics such as 
anti-corruption, conflicts of interest, gifts and 
hospitality, fraud management, complaint 
management, fair treatment of vulnerable 
consumers, product development and 
marketing, whistleblowing and tax. 

We are committed to creating and maintaining 
a robust, effective and appropriate control 
environment to recognise where opportunities 
for financial crime exist and mitigate the 
associated risk. We establish and maintain 
processes and procedures to monitor, detect 
and prevent acts of financial crime against 
Experian by third parties or employees, or 
through the unlawful use of or access to our 
products, services or data. If any employees 
are found to have committed any financial 
crime, we will take appropriate disciplinary 
and legal action against those involved. 

Our commitment to doing business 
responsibly includes our approach to tax 
affairs, as set out in our Tax Policy, which is 
included in our annual Tax Report. The report 
explains how we manage taxes and how tax 
fits into our broader ESG agenda, provides 
information on our tax governance and details 
our regional corporate tax contributions.

To view our policies and 
statements, including our  
Code of Conduct

Anti-bribery and corruption 
We take a zero-tolerance approach to bribery 
and corruption, reinforced by our Global Code 
of Conduct and Global Anti-Corruption 
Framework. We prohibit anyone acting on 
behalf of Experian – including employees, third 
parties and suppliers – from offering or 
accepting a bribe, or making a facilitation 
payment to officials, in connection with our 
business. 

Our Global Gifts and Hospitality Policy sets out 
strict ethical standards relating to gifts, 
entertainment, hospitality, sponsorship, travel 
expenses and donations. We also have 
controls to ensure we conduct any 

Scan me  
To view our 2023 Tax Report

sponsorships, charitable contributions, 
lobbying or political donations ethically and in 
compliance with all relevant laws. 

Suppliers are contractually obliged to ensure 
their employees, agents and subcontractors do 
not pay or receive improper bribes, facilitation 
payments, gratuities or kickbacks. If we 
identify any suppliers as high risk for bribery 
or corruption, we refer them to the Compliance 
team for further due diligence, including an 
assessment of corruption, regulatory and 
reputational risks. 

We conduct periodic assessments to check for 
and mitigate corruption risks as part of our 
Compliance Management Programme. We 
also follow rigorous due diligence procedures 
to identify any risk of improper payments 
during mergers and acquisitions, or when 
we enter into joint ventures. 

Our Finance and Global Sourcing teams have 
training and controls to detect and stop 
improper payments, with support from our 
Global Internal Audit team. If we identify any 
concerns, we promptly investigate them and 
take appropriate action.

Training and compliance 
We strive to create a culture of integrity that 
empowers our people to make the right 
choices. Our Global Code of Conduct clearly 
states that everyone at Experian is accountable 
for managing operational risk across our 
business effectively to safeguard our future. 

All employees (including part-time employees 
and contractors) have to confirm they have read 
and understood our Global Code of Conduct 
when they first join Experian. They are then 
required to acknowledge their understanding of, 
and confirm their commitment to, the Global 
Code of Conduct every year, and we make sure 
they do so through our performance review 
process. We also expect managers to be role 
models for ethical behaviour. 

Any breaches of our Global Code of Conduct 
or associated policies could undermine our 
reputation and the trust of our stakeholders. 
Our Three Lines of Defence risk management 
model reinforces our culture of compliance. 
We encourage people to report any suspected 
policy breach or unethical activity without fear 
of reprisal. Anyone who knows about a 
potential violation, and does not report it, 
could face disciplinary action.

We ask employees to talk to their manager in 
the first instance if they have concerns. They 
can also report any concerns, anonymously if 
they choose, through our externally-facilitated 
24-hour Confidential Helpline. The Helpline is 
open to both employees and third parties, and 
provides support in local languages.

We take any allegations of ethical breaches 
very seriously. All reported concerns are 
investigated promptly by relevant functions, 
such as Human Resources, our Global Security 
Office or Global Fraud Investigations, to identify 
root causes and take appropriate corrective 
action. This year, 71 concerns were reported. 
The majority of these (94%) concerned matters 
related to human resources.

Respecting human rights 
We are committed to upholding the United 
Nations Universal Declaration of Human Rights 
(UDHR), the United Nations Guiding Principles 
on Business and Human Rights (UNGP), the 
International Labour Organization (ILO) 
Standards and the Organisation for Economic 
Co-operation and Development (OECD) 
Guidelines for Multinational Enterprises. 

Our commitment to respecting and promoting 
human rights is reflected in our Code of 
Conduct and associated compliance policies – 
which everyone at Experian must confirm their 
commitment to every year. These policies 
make clear that we do not tolerate any 
infringement of human rights in our business 
or our supply chain. 

We have identified the following salient human 
rights for Experian: healthy and safe working 
conditions; workplace security; freedom of 
association; diversity, equity and inclusion; 
absence of modern slavery and forced labour; 
access to grievance mechanisms; data 
protection and privacy; environment and 
carbon emissions. Our statement on salient 
human rights sets out our approach to each of 
these. We recognise that other human rights 
issues may become relevant to Experian in the 
future and we review our salient issues 
regularly, based on best practice.

We are committed to treating all our people 
fairly and with respect. Experian is an 
accredited Living Wage employer in the UK, 
going beyond the legal minimum wage to pay 
employees the amount the Living Wage 
Foundation has calculated to support 

Experian plc Strategic report55

We conduct a risk assessment of all the third 
parties we work with, including suppliers and 
indirect clients. Overseen by our Third Party 
Risk Management team, we assess risks 
related to data security and privacy, business 
continuity, compliance and reputation 
(including bribery and corruption). We will not 
work with – and routinely reject – third parties 
that do not uphold our standards on critical 
issues, such as data security. 

Of the thousands of third parties we work with, 
most fall into the minor or moderate risk 
category in our initial risk assessment. Those 
we consider higher risk – based on factors 
such as the type of product or service they 
provide and the type of data they have access 
to – are subject to more in-depth assessments, 
oversight and controls.

As our first line of defence, the business 
function that has the relationship with the third 
party is responsible for identifying, tracking 
and resolving any issues. We test our controls 
periodically, logging and resolving any issues 
identified through our centralised global 
governance, risk and compliance system. 

We strive to support diverse suppliers through 
our strategic sourcing process, which is 
designed to offer a level playing field for all 
third parties. In the USA, we work with 
organisations such as Disability:IN, the 
National Minority Supplier Development 
Council, the National LGBT Chamber of 
Commerce, the National Veteran-Owned 
Business Association, the US Small Business 
Association and the Women’s Business 
Enterprise National Council. These 
organisations support our year-on-year 
growth of registered diverse and small 
business supplier relationships. This year, we 
launched a new supplier diversity website that 
informs potential suppliers in North America of 
our approach to supplier diversity and invites 
diverse suppliers to register with us.

a reasonable living. As set out in our updated 
Global Code of Conduct, we support our 
employees’ right to affiliate or not affiliate 
with legally sanctioned organisations or 
associations without unlawful interference.

DEI remains a key focus for Experian, not only 
in relation to our people (see pages 51-52), but 
for our clients, consumers and communities. 
Our focus on improving financial health for all 
supports efforts to close the financial wealth 
gap of underserved communities (see page 
42). We are a signatory to the UN Women’s 
Empowerment Principles and our commitment 
to DEI received further recognition this year. 
For example, we were named in Equileap’s Top 
100 Globally for Gender Equality. Experian 
North America achieved a perfect score in the 
Disability Equality Index and retained its rating 
in the Human Rights Campaign Foundation’s 
Corporate Equality Index as one of the best 
places to work for LGBTQ+ employees. We also 
received a Silver Award from Stonewall for our 
commitment to inclusion of LGBTQ+ people in 
the workplace in the UK and Ireland. Our Global 
DEI Report provides more information on our 
strategy and performance in this area. 

Our Supplier Code of Conduct sets out clear 
standards on human rights, and we include 
clauses in our contracts that oblige suppliers 
to protect workers’ rights and freedoms. We 
monitor compliance through our third-party 
risk management framework. We also expect 
suppliers to set similar requirements for their 
own suppliers and subcontractors, to extend 
high standards throughout the supply chain. 

Tackling modern slavery
We recognise that modern slavery can occur 
in any sector, anywhere in the world. We are 
doing all we can to eliminate the practice. 
Experian is a founding member of the 
Slave-Free Alliance (SFA), which brings 
together businesses working towards a 
slave-free world. 

Following implementation of a three-year 
improvement plan based on an initial 
comprehensive assessment by the SFA, we 
have completed a second assessment with the 
SFA this year to identify further opportunities 
to improve our approach to tackling modern 

slavery risks in our business and supply chain. 
A quarterly steering group, headed by our 
Group Chief Procurement Officer, reviews 
and tracks progress.

We undertake an annual assessment of 
high-risk suppliers to ensure they have 
policies and procedures in place to minimise 
the risk of modern slavery. Our process 
involves supplier segmentation, self-
assessment questionnaires, interviews and, 
where appropriate, on-site visits. This year, 
we followed up with a supplier to get further 
evidence related to procedures for visa 
applications for overseas nationals and 
involved our own visa experts to support our 
engagement. Our Modern Slavery Statement 
provides further information on our 
commitment, policies and actions to tackle 
modern slavery risks in our business and 
supply chain. 

Our partnership with Hope for Justice 
supported 544 survivors of modern slavery, 
since October 2020, through advocacy and 
advice services – including helping them prove 
their identity, access credit reports and resolve 
fraudulent debts racked up in their name. An 
additional 13,465 people at risk of exploitation 
have also been engaged through community 
outreach and training to equip them with the 
tools and skills to identify and report modern 
slavery.

Working with suppliers
Our Supplier Code of Conduct represents the 
minimum ethical, labour, human rights and 
environmental standards that all our suppliers 
must meet. As part of their contracts with us, 
all suppliers must confirm they accept our 
standards or have their own equivalent 
standards in place. 

ESG criteria are integrated in our supplier 
selection process alongside commercial 
considerations, including requirements for 
satisfactory governance of areas such as 
bribery, corruption and modern slavery that 
are built into our review processes. We also 
engage with suppliers on climate to help us 
measure and progress towards our Scope 3 
emissions reduction target (see page 60).

Protecting the environment
We will help tackle climate change and reduce our impact on the 
environment.

As an information services business, our most 
material environmental impact is the carbon 
footprint of our operations and value chain. The 
Task Force on Climate-Related Financial 
Disclosures (TCFD) statement sets out our 
commitment to mitigating climate-related 
risks and harnessing opportunities for our 
products and business to support wider 
climate action, in line with the 
recommendations of the TCFD. We also 
monitor and manage other environmental 
impacts. 

External recognition in FY23

CDP Climate Change: ‘A-’ rating

CDP Supplier Engagement Rating: 'A-' rating 

Financial Times: Experian has been named one 
of Europe’s Climate Leaders for 2023 by the 
Financial Times and Statista for the second year 
in a row.

TCFD statement

The climate-related financial disclosures set 
out on pages 56-62 are consistent with the 
TCFD recommendations and recommended 
disclosures (against TCFD categories): 

 a governance (a) and (b) 
 a strategy (a), (b) and (c)
 a risk management (a), (b) and (c) 
 a metrics and targets (a), (b) and (c). 

For strategy disclosures (a) and (b), as we 
continue to upskill internal stakeholders on 
climate change impacts and see our climate 
data and cross-functional collaboration 
mechanisms mature, we expect our approach 
to meeting TCFD recommendations to evolve 
in parallel. 

Governance
The Board oversees our climate strategy, 
including climate-related risks and 
opportunities presented in this TCFD 
statement, and progress towards our targets 
(including our science-based target). See page 
103 for more on the division of responsibilities 
across the Board. 

The Group Operating Committee receives 
regular updates on our climate action plan, 
including progress on strategic drivers to 
address climate-related issues, such as our 
science-based target, the development of our 
Net Zero Transition Plan and our TCFD 
reporting.

The ESG Steering Committee, chaired by the 
Chief Financial Officer, has overall 
responsibility for assessing and monitoring the 
management and performance of all areas of 
ESG, including climate-related risks and 
opportunities. Climate items addressed by the 
ESG Steering Committee this year included 
performance against our targets, development 
of Experian’s Net Zero Transition Plan and 
revision of our Scope 3 emissions methodology 
(see page 60), as well as updates on relevant 
legislation and reporting frameworks. 

The Chief Sustainability Officer is responsible 
at management level for ensuring successful 
implementation of our climate plans and our 
wider ESG strategy, with support from relevant 
teams. See page 39 for more on our ESG 
governance and organisational chart.

Any significant climate-related risks are 
reviewed by the Executive Risk Management 
Committee and the Audit Committee, and 
presented to the Board. We also enter specific 
climate-related risks into our environment 
management systems at Group, country and 
site level, and these become part of our Aspect 
and Impact Register, with plans defined to 
manage the risks, monitor performance and 
drive improvements.

Risk management
We are committed to identifying, assessing and 
managing risks and opportunities presented by 
climate change, both now and in the future.

We manage climate-related risks – strategic, 
financial, operational or regulatory – in the 
same way as our other business risks, as part 
of our overall risk management process for the 
business (see page 78). We apply our 
established four-step framework for managing 
business risks to identify, assess, respond to, 
and report and monitor climate-related risks 
as well as climate-related opportunities:

Step 1: Identification
We identify potential climate-related risks and 
opportunities based on: relevant climate 
change publications and data specific to the 
regions where we operate; disclosures by peer 
companies on their identified climate-related 
risks and opportunities; TCFD guidance and 
reviews on potential risks and opportunities; 
and climate-related risks and opportunities 
previously identified for Experian.

Step 2: Assessment
We evaluate the materiality of identified risks 
and opportunities at least once a year by 
undertaking scenario analyses to assess our 
exposure and vulnerability to climate change 
risks and potential opportunities – in the short 
term (pre-2025), medium term (2025-2030) 
and long term (2030+) – and quantifying the 
potential financial impact of each risk or 
opportunity for our business (see tables on the 
next three pages). These timeframes have 
been chosen taking into account the models 
already used by our Strategy and Risk teams, 
as well as the recognition that climate change 
is an issue that spans beyond 2030.

Step 3: Response

identified risks, if these are not already in 
place, as well as measures to capitalise on

identified opportunities. See more on our 
business management response to specific 
risks and opportunities in the tables below and 
on the following pages. 

Step 4: Reporting and monitoring
Our process for reporting and monitoring 
climate-related risks and opportunities within 
the business, up to Board level, is part of our 
overall ESG governance as described on page 
39. We disclose our most material 
climate-related risks and opportunities in our 
Annual Report and our CDP response. 

Strategy
We assess climate-related risks and 
opportunities across our business units and 
the regions where we operate. Our most 
material risks and opportunities are detailed in 
the tables below and on the following pages.

Material risks are defined as those that have 
the potential to have a significant effect on our 
operations, strategy or financial performance 
if they are not suitably controlled. Material 
opportunities are those that have the potential 
to enhance the financial performance of the 
business. 

This year, we refreshed our assessment of 
material climate-related risks and 
opportunities to take into account changes in 
climate trends or science, as well as emerging 
risks and opportunities. We modelled our 
latest analysis on two climate warming 
scenarios:

 a High-carbon scenario (4°C): A ‘worst-case’ 

scenario of climate change where 
governments fail to introduce policies to 
address climate change beyond those 
already in place, which projects global 

greenhouse gas emissions continuing to rise 
(based on Representative Carbon Pathway, 
RCP8.5). In this scenario, transition risks are 
limited but there are significant physical 
risks associated with rising temperatures 
and weather extremes. RCP8.5 is the 
scenario most widely used by companies, 
governments, and academia. This means a 
high availability of model projections and 
studies to pull from, but also allows for 
comparability. RCP8.5 has several 
assumptions including: high population 
growth, increased coal burning, and a 
continued heavy reliance on fossil fuels. 
However, removing these assumptions, the 
outcomes of RCP8.5 are consistent and 
plausible when compared to other climate 
models.

 a Low-carbon scenario (1.5°C): An ‘aggressive 
mitigation’ scenario that sees early decisive 
policies and action towards a low-carbon 
economy that is sufficient to limit global 
warming to 1.5°C by the end of the century 
(based on the International Energy Agency’s 
(IEA) Sustainable Development Scenario). In 
this scenario, physical risks are limited and 
transition risks predominate. The IEA’s 
Sustainable Development Scenario explores 
a pathway for bringing global energy 
systems to net-zero emissions by 2070. 
Following this pathway would limit global 
warming to 1.8°C (with a 66% probability) 
and would present the best chance of 
limiting warming to 1.5°C by the end of the 
century. The scenario assumes a reduction 
of emissions to 10bn tonnes of CO2e by 2050, 
mostly stemming from the transport and 
power sector, and driven by technological 
progress and regulatory action.

We used these scenarios as they represent 
two opposing pathways: one of rapid policy 
and technological change that helps to limit the 
extent of the physical impacts of climate 
change, and one representing ‘worst case’ 
from a policy perspective such that rising 
greenhouse gas emissions result in significant 
physical climate impacts. We also selected 
these scenarios because of their wide-ranging 
scope, which aligns with the broad range of 
geographies we serve.

Identified risks and opportunities remain 
largely unchanged from previous 
assessments, but we have enhanced our 
disclosures this year to include further 
information on potential financial impacts and 
mitigation activities in relation to each risk and 
opportunity, as set out in the tables below and 
on the following pages. 

Where potential financial impacts are 
quantified, these are based on assumed 
ranges of causal events that preclude 
application of a strict materiality analysis. We 
anticipate a materiality analysis will be enabled 
in future as we further refine our approach to 
quantifying climate-related risks and 
opportunities. In the meantime, we disclose 
estimated ranges, based on plausible 
projections, to indicate an order of magnitude 
of financial impacts associated with specific 
climate-related risks and opportunities. At 
present, there is no material impact of 
climate-related matters on the Group’s 
financial results.

We highlight some of the solutions we have 
developed in relation to climate-related 
opportunities on page 61.

could increase expenses associated with emissions 
tracking, reporting and verification.

We monitor, and engage legal experts on, regulatory and 
industry developments. We have created new roles and 
partnerships to help us understand and prepare for new 
climate-compliance obligations across our regions. Our 
governance and assurance processes are designed to 
help avoid any misstatements in external reporting.

Potential risks and opportunities

Business management response

Risk: Increased operational expenses 
(less than 1%* of annual revenue) 
Although our operations are not emissions-intensive, 
implementation of external carbon pricing (such as 
additional taxes on fuel, energy and aviation) to support 
the transition to a low-carbon economy could increase 
our operational expenses directly or indirectly through 
increased costs of suppliers (primarily related to energy). 
The magnitude of this risk is considered low because, 
currently, electricity costs are less than 1% of operating 
costs.

Opportunity: Reduced operational expenses
Further reductions in energy use and increases in 
self-generation could reduce energy costs.

Making progress towards our science-based target – 
including through energy efficiency measures and 
self-generation – helps mitigate risk associated with 
potential carbon pricing in our direct operations and our 
supply chain. Our supplier engagement programme 
reduces exposure to carbon taxation on purchased goods 
and services, which make up most of our value chain 
carbon footprint. We are also developing a Net Zero 
Transition Plan, in line with the UK’s Transition Plan 
Taskforce draft Disclosure Framework, which will 
enhance emissions reductions across the value chain in 
the medium and long term. 

Potential risks and opportunities

Business management response

Risk: Revenue loss
If we do not adapt and develop products to meet the 
potential increase in client and consumer awareness for 
climate-friendly financial products and investment, 
especially in the low-carbon scenario, we could lose 
business to competitors.

Opportunity: Revenue growth 
Developing products to meet potential increased 
climate-related demand from clients and consumers 
presents an opportunity for us, with use cases including 
portfolio assessment, regulatory reporting, customer 
engagement, application risk assessments and supply 
chain management.

Our products and services are flexible and adaptable to 
low-carbon transitioning, and we are innovating to 
capitalise on opportunities that will help our clients and 
consumers adapt to and mitigate the effects of climate 
change. We are also seeing a marked increase in enquiries 
from clients, such as financial institutions, for data and 
analytics services that can support them in understanding 
emissions in their supply chains, analysing physical and 
transitional climate-related risks in their portfolios, and 
assessing applications based on the climate credentials of 
the assets or organisations to be funded. Our existing 
decisioning tools can help clients meet these needs by 
bringing data and analytics into operational processes and 
organisations. We are also developing new products and 
services specifically designed to capture climate-related 
opportunities for our business by supporting others in 
efforts to understand and reduce their carbon footprints 
(see page 61 for examples).

Potential risks and opportunities

Business management response

We are reducing our climate impact and disclosing our 
climate and wider ESG performance transparently, to 
help maintain our strong reputation with current and 
future investors. 

Risk: Investment loss  
Failure to meet increasing stakeholder and investor 
expectations on climate action and disclosures could 
damage the reputation of our brand. This could: lower 
demand for shares, leading to a reduction in share price 
as investors seek to shift capital away from companies 
that are not managing climate change risks (unable to 
quantify at this point); or removal of Experian from 
climate-specific funds that are invested into on the basis 
of positive climate action and revenue opportunities from 
climate-related products (currently 0.2% of total market 
capitalisation).

Opportunity: Access to finance
A strong response to the climate agenda and 
contributions towards finding solutions could improve 
our brand and reputation, and enable Experian to access 
finance on favourable terms linked to climate, 
sustainability or wider ESG performance.

Transition risks could present a significant challenge to our business, and we are committed to mitigating the potential impacts. Our high-level 
analysis highlighted that our climate action plan is critical to demonstrating strong climate stewardship and progress towards our science-based 
targets, and our approach to carbon reduction and transparent climate disclosures is of paramount importance to our stakeholders.

Increased energy demand to run our infrastructure, 
including cooling for data centres, due to increases to 
external temperatures, could result in increased 
operational expenses.

We are mitigating the risk of rising energy costs through 
planning and implementing energy efficiency measures, 
and transitioning to co-located or cloud-based service 
providers that will reduce our demands for cooling.

Potential risks and opportunities

Business management response

Risk: Expenses from property damage 
Some of our sites are in areas that could experience 
flooding (UK and Ireland), hail or cold-weather damage 
from more extreme weather events (North America). This 
could lead to property loss or damage, increased 
insurance premiums and disruption to business 
operations (see below). There is an estimated US$639m* 
of insured property damage value exposed to some form 
of physical climate risk across our operations. 

Risk: Disruption to business operations 
Extreme weather and related physical damage could 
cause disruption to our operations, workforce and 
suppliers. Our services must be available for our clients 
and consumers 24 hours a day, seven days a week. If there 
was disruption to our services causing an interruption of 
daily revenue as a result of physical climate effects, the 
estimated loss could range from US$1.25m in EMEA/Asia 
Pacific to US$12.1m in North America (based on a daily 
average of FY23 revenue).

We have a range of measures in place to allow us to 
mitigate risks from acute physical risks posed by 
extreme weather conditions, and make our operations 
more resilient in the face of extreme weather in the short 
and medium term. As part of our commitment to reduce 
operational emissions, we are investing in on-site 
renewable energy generation that will also improve 
resilience by providing cleaner back-up electricity in the 
event of extreme weather conditions putting a strain on 
the grid. This year, our insurance providers have 
undertaken climate engineering surveys at our key 
operational sites to help us understand what further 
actions we can take to strengthen our climate resilience.

Risk: Revenue loss 
The chronic impacts of climate change, such as 
increasing temperatures, flooding, storm damage and 
limited access to clean water, will lead to higher levels of 
migration and a global humanitarian crisis that could 
disrupt markets, and prevent clients and consumers 
from accessing our products and services.

Many of our established products and services designed 
to enable financial inclusion for ‘credit invisibles’ could 
help people who have migrated as a result of climate 
change to rebuild their financial identities and credit 
scores. Through our focus on improving financial health 
for all (see page 42), we are innovating to develop further 
solutions that could provide support.

Opportunity: Protecting financial health for all
Our products could help people rebuild their financial 
identities and credit scores if these have been lost or 
damaged through climate migration.

Physical risks from climate change currently have a low impact on Experian’s operations, strategy and financial planning. Our operating model has 
proven to be resilient to significant disruption, as experienced during the COVID-19 pandemic. We currently operate a small number of regional data 
centres that are business-critical assets and exposure to extreme weather events is already considered from a business continuity and disaster 
recovery perspective. However, we understand that under different future scenarios this may change, and we will continue to monitor signposts 
identified as part of our climate scenario exercise. 

The most critical physical risk to our business relates to the chronic effects of climate change and impacts from extreme weather events that could 
lead to climate migrations, which may result in consumers becoming financially excluded as a result of being unable to access their data and 
demonstrate their financial identities. These impacts are most significant under the high-carbon scenario we modelled. 

The climate-related opportunities for our business are greater within the low-carbon future scenario we modelled, as they relate to the potential of 
our business to support and facilitate the transition to a low-carbon future. 

Comprehensive understanding of risk drivers and control measures in place to mitigate, adapt to risk, capitalise on opportunity.
Further work is required to understand regional risk drivers and control measures in place to mitigate, adapt to climate risk, capitalise on opportunity.

Metrics and targets
We are committed to reducing our carbon 
emissions in line with our targets, which are 
validated by the Science Based Targets 
initiative (SBTi), and we have set an additional 
goal to become carbon neutral in our own 
operations by 20301. 

Targets
Our climate targets are to:

 a Become carbon neutral in our own 

operations by 2030¹:

 –  Scope 1 and 2 (1.5°C scenario2): reduce 

absolute Scope 1 and 2 emissions by 50% 
by 2030 (from 2019)

 – Scope 3 (2°C scenario3): reduce absolute 

Scope 3 emissions from purchased goods 
and services, business travel and fuel- 
and energy-related activities4 by 15% by 
2030 (from 2019)

 a Offset 100% of our remaining Scope 1 and 2 

emissions by 2025.

We are working to complete our Net Zero 
Transition Plan in line with the UK’s Transition 
Plan Taskforce draft Disclosure Framework. 
We are also developing a revised Scope 3 
target that takes into account our new 
reporting methodology (see the next column). 

Reducing operational emissions
This year, we reduced our Scope 1 and 2 
market-based emissions by a further 38% to 
10.1 thousand tonnes of CO2 equivalent (CO2e), 
cutting the carbon intensity of our direct 
emissions by 41% to 1.5 tonnes of CO2e per 
US$1m of revenue.

Since 2019, we have reduced our total Scope 1 
and 2 emissions by 65%. This means we are 
currently outperforming and well on track to 
meet our science-based target to reduce these 
emissions by 50% by 2030. We will continue to 
seek ways to minimise the carbon footprint of 
our operations as our business evolves. 

We have achieved this by significantly 
increasing purchasing of renewable electricity, 
as well as improving energy efficiency and 
continuing to embrace flexible ways of working 
that have resulted in an overall decrease in 
building occupancy, and consolidation and 
reduction of office space. We have also 
reduced energy use in our data centres by 3% 
since FY22. 

In the buildings we own or control, we are 
continually looking for opportunities to switch 
to renewable electricity contracts or, where 
feasible, to invest in on-site installations to 
generate our own renewable power. In FY23, 

Solar photovoltaic array in São Carlos

Experian’s London hub

62% of our total electricity came from 
renewable sources globally. We installed our 
first solar photovoltaic array at our offices in 
São Carlos, Brazil, which generates 11.5 MWh 
per month and meets around 10% of the site’s 
electricity demand. More on-site renewable 
installations are planned for FY24. 

We reduced overall energy use by 9% in FY23 
compared with the previous year. Energy 
efficiency measures this year included 
upgrading the lighting at some of our offices in 
Brazil and the UK, and optimising air-
conditioning systems for lower occupancy 
levels in our North American offices. We also 
completed a transformation of our London hub 
in the UK that included maximising natural 
light, upgrading to more energy efficient 
lighting and monitors, and installing high-tech 
connectivity tools in meeting and conference 
rooms to reduce the need for travel by 
enhancing the experience of virtual meetings. 
We also moved to a new corporate 
headquarters in Ireland which has some of the 
highest sustainability credentials in the 
market, being certified as a nearly zero-energy 
building (NZEB) and achieving a LEED 
(Leadership in Energy and Environmental 
Design) Platinum score. 

In addition, we are supporting the transition to 
low-carbon transport by switching our owned 
and controlled fleet to hybrid and electric 
vehicles and installing charging infrastructure 
at our sites. In the UK and Ireland, which 
accounts for 33% of our global fleet, 85% of our 
company cars are already hybrid or electric. 

Enhancing Scope 3 reporting and engaging 
with suppliers
Scope 3 greenhouse gas emissions account 
for the majority (95%) of our total value-chain 
carbon footprint, totalling 178.1 thousand 
tonnes of CO2e in FY23. 

This year, we have worked to improve the way 
we calculate Scope 3 emissions in the 
Purchased Goods and Services category 
(which accounts for 73.5% of our Scope 3 

emissions) to help us better measure progress 
on our journey to decarbonise our value chain. 
Previously, we calculated these emissions 
using the Extended Economic Input-Output 
model that relies on spend data and a small 
pool of emissions factor categories. Now, we 
are using a best-practice hybrid approach, 
where actual emissions provided by our 
suppliers through the CDP Supplier 
Engagement Tool are combined with a much 
larger, more specific pool of emissions factor 
categories. Our emissions calculations for 
FY23 include actual data provided directly by 
suppliers representing 32% of our related 
spend, and we aim to increase this over time 
through ongoing engagement with suppliers. 
See our website for details of the new hybrid 
methodology. 

We have restated previously reported emissions 
for FY22 to show the impact of changing to the 
new hybrid methodology. However, it is not 
possible to recalculate emissions back to 2019, 
the baseline year for our Scope 3 reduction 
target. Therefore, we intend to re-baseline our 
target as part of our net zero transition work. 
The new targets will include all material Scope 
3 categories and will be submitted to the SBTi 
for approval. We will continue to encourage 
more of our suppliers to submit emissions data 
via CDP and to adopt their own science-based 
targets. This will also enable us to explore ways 
to switch to suppliers that can better support 
our decarbonisation targets. We are pleased 
that our continued engagement with suppliers 
has been recognised with an 'A-' rating in the 
CDP supplier engagement ratings.

Towards carbon neutral
Once we have achieved our science-based 
target and reduced our value chain emissions 
as far as possible, we will invest in high-quality 
carbon offsetting projects to offset the 
remaining Scope 1, 2 and 3 emissions within 
the boundaries of our SBTi-approved targets, 
to achieve carbon neutrality in our own 
operations by 2030.

Includes all Scope 1 and 2 emissions, as well as Scope 3 emissions from purchased goods and services, business travel and fuel- and energy-related activities (which represent 83% of our baseline 
emissions in Scope 3) in line with the boundaries covered by our Scope 3 target approved by the Science Based Targets initiative (SBTi). Once we have achieved our SBTi-approved targets, we will invest in 
high-quality carbon offsetting projects to offset the remaining Scope 1, 2 and 3 emissions within the boundaries of our SBTi-approved targets to achieve carbon neutrality in our own operations by 2030.

Promoting biodiversity 
The COP15 Biodiversity Conference in 2022 
highlighted that halting biodiversity loss is a 
global priority and nature has a critical role in 
tackling climate change and meeting the United 
Nations Sustainable Development Goals. 

Our business and operations do not have a 
significant impact on biodiversity and we are 
not dependent on a specific ecosystem service 
for our business and economic activity to 
function. However, we recognise that as a 
global business, we have the power and ability 
to influence change. Climate change and 
biodiversity loss are interconnected, and 
impacting one affects the other. The 
Intergovernmental Panel on Climate Change 
(IPCC) reports that 10% of species are expected 
to face a high risk of extinction if global 
warming rises above 2°C. Our commitment to 
reduce carbon emissions through the Science 
Based Targets initiative, and the reduction of 
our footprint is closely connected to the 
protection of biodiversity. 

We are reviewing how to apply the 
recommendations of the Taskforce on 
Nature-related Financial Disclosures to our 
business, and we are in the early stages of 
assessing biodiversity-related risks and 
opportunities in our operations using the Locate 
Evaluate Assess Prepare framework. 

Monitoring water use 
This year, for the first time, we have collected 
information from the two dedicated data 
centres that use water in cooling systems. 
Based on on-site metering, total water used at 
these sites was 40,119 cubic metres in FY23. 
We will continue to collect and analyse this 
data to help identify ways to reduce water use 
over time. 

Engaging employees 
Local campaigns through the year raised 
awareness among employees of steps they 
can take to help reduce our environmental 
footprint and their own. For example, our 
#LittleGreenSteps initiative ran challenges to 
encourage people to be more conscious of 
environmental impact and what they can do to 
help. As part of this initiative, colleagues in 
Bulgaria, Malaysia and the Netherlands 
volunteered over 270 hours of their time to 
support beach clean-ups and tree planting.

To support this, as part of our secondary 
carbon offsetting commitment, we offset 60% 
of our FY23 Scope 1 and 2 emissions by 
investing in a Verified Carbon Standard 
offsetting project in Kenya. The REDD+ Project 
Phase II – The Community Ranches – from 
Wildlife Works will not only avoid carbon 
emissions, but also support climate adaptation, 
promote biodiversity, bring added value to 
communities and contribute to 11 of the 17 
United Nations Sustainable Development 
Goals. It has achieved Climate, Community and 
Biodiversity Gold Level certification. We have 
procurement criteria which set out the 
requirements of our offset investments and we 
review project monitoring reports annually to 
evaluate the status and deliverables of the 
invested project. 

Harnessing opportunities to help clients 
understand climate risks 
We support clients with data analytics services 
that can help them understand emissions in 
their supply chains. For financial services 
clients, we can help them analyse physical and 
transitional climate-related risks in their 
portfolios, and assess applications based on 
the climate credentials of the assets or 
organisations to be funded. 

Developing these types of products will help us 
capitalise on climate-related opportunities, 
while supporting clients in managing their own 
climate-related risks and opportunities.

Our established decisioning tools can help 
clients meet these needs by bringing data and 
analytics into operational processes and 
organisations. We are also innovating to 
develop bespoke products and services 
specifically designed to help clients better 
assess climate and other ESG-related risks, 
including solutions that enhance visibility of 
risks among small and medium-sized 
enterprises (SMEs) and agribusiness. 
Examples include:

 a ESG Insight: Our ESG Insight product scores 
all UK SMEs for ESG risks (based on Scope 
1, 2 and 3 emissions, as well as social 
impact and governance ratings), enabling 
lenders to better understand ESG risks and 
calculate emissions within their customer 
portfolio. 

 a SME ESG ratings framework: In Europe, 

where financial institutions are required to 
incorporate ESG ratings into their risk 
management frameworks to comply with 
the regulations, we have developed a ratings 
framework that draws on a range of data 
sources, including climate data, to rate SMEs 
on ESG.

 a Sustainability Indicator: Our Sustainability 
Indicator in Spain automatically evaluates 
SMEs on a range of ESG criteria (including 
environmental factors, such as climate) and 

summarises this assessment in a single 
standardised indicator that supports clients’ 
ESG risk assessments and financial 
decisions related to SMEs.

 a Smart ESG platform: Developed specifically 
for agribusiness, our Smart ESG platform 
enables clients in Brazil to assess and 
monitor their portfolio based on compliance 
with ESG regulations, including those 
related to topics such as deforestation, and 
environmental and social violations, to 
support climate and ESG risk mitigation.

Through our Social Innovation programme, we 
are also developing products to support 
climate risk mitigation and adaptation by 
enabling risk assessments and better access 
to credit for smallholder farmers, who can 
then use credit to invest in inputs to reduce 
emissions and enhance climate resilience: 

 a In Brazil, the Smallholders Marketplace we 
launched this year is designed to improve 
access to credit for smallholders in Brazil 
and offers additional benefits through the 
app such as weather alerts, remote sensing 
of farms, training and other resources. 

 a In Asia Pacific, we are developing an 

agriculture index, to be launched in the 
coming year, that will support clients in 
offering affordable finance and insurance to 
smallholders in Asia, which can help their 
productivity and help to protect them from 
climate risks. 

Managing other environmental impacts
We recognise our business has other potential 
impacts on the environment beyond climate 
change. We are committed to identifying, 
assessing and addressing environmental 
risks, including in relation to issues that are 
high on the global agenda, such as single-use 
plastics, biodiversity and water. 

Our environmental management systems help 
us drive continuous improvements in 
minimising the environmental footprint of our 
operations and ensuring we comply with local 
regulations. Local environmental management 
systems across the business are aligned with 
the internationally recognised ISO 14001:2015 
standard, and four of our sites – three in the UK 
and one in Bulgaria – maintain certification to 
this standard through external audits. 

Cutting out single-use plastics
Over the course of this year, we carried out a 
single-use plastics (SUP) pilot to measure our 
SUP footprint, scale up a global baseline and 
inform a roadmap for action. We have 
identified over five SUP types to phase out or 
replace with non-SUP alternatives. Over the 
course of the next two years we anticipate 
this action will remove the vast majority of 
avoidable SUP from our direct operations.

In 2023 we have upgraded our Scope 3 methodology, from using a purely spend-based analysis to also including actual supplier emissions data. We are therefore restating our 2022 Scope 3 figures using 
the same methodology, to provide comparable figures, resulting in restated figures for purchased goods and services, upstream leased assets, capital goods, and investments. Please refer to our 2023 
Carbon Reporting Principles and Methodologies for further detail.
Including Scope 1, Scope 2 (market-based) and total Scope 3.

We are

innovating

to address healthcare’s biggest business

challenges.

Removing the sting from healthcare claims

There is a scary trend in US 
healthcare: claim denials. It is a nasty 
sting in the tail, both for hospitals and 
patients, when after treatment the 
insurance company refuses to pay  
for all or part of it. Denials, often 
automated, have increased 23%  
since 2016.

It is the biggest strategic challenge 
facing hospitals, and they are losing 
billions of dollars in write-offs. With 
manual systems and a staffing 
shortage in back-office operations, 

they frequently don’t have the 
resources to appeal against every 
denial. 

Experian’s AI Advantage uses artificial 
intelligence to supercharge a 
hospital's claims processing. It uses 
machine learning models to generate 
real-time predictions of the most likely 
reasons for which a claim may be 
denied, prior to claim submission. It 
also allows hospitals to segment any 
denials that do occur so that billing 
staff are able to better prioritise their 

work. Claims are processed faster, 
denials are reduced significantly  
and revenue is increased. Leaving 
hospitals to focus on serving  
their patients. 

Experian plc  Annual Report 2023Strategic report64

Non-financial information and s172(1) statement

We report in line with the Non-
Financial Reporting requirement 
as detailed in Sections 414CA and 
414CB of the UK Companies 
Act 2006.

Our aims
Our business model is set out on pages 22-27. 
We use the power of data to create 
opportunities, improve lives and make a 
meaningful difference in society, helping 
individuals and businesses of all sizes, 
to achieve their financial goals.

Non-ﬁnancial risks
The Risk management and principal risks 
section of the Strategic report, starting on 
page 78, sets out the Group’s approach to 
identifying and managing our principal risks 
and uncertainties. Our Three Lines of Defence 
model provides a rigorous governance 
framework, and the list of principal risks 
starting on page 80 gives details of the policies, 
outcomes and due diligence processes that 
control and mitigate those risks.

Section 172

Section 172 legislation, which became 
effective in the UK during FY20, aims to 
help shareholders better understand how 
directors have discharged their duty to 
promote the success of companies, while 
having regard to the matters set out in 
Section 172(1)(a) to (f) of the UK Companies 
Act 2006 (s172 matters). In addition, the 
2018 UK Corporate Governance Code 
recommends that boards describe how 
the matters set out in Section 172 have 
been considered in Board discussions 
and decision-making.

The key areas where non-financial adverse 
impacts could arise are:

1. Respect for human rights
As data custodians, we have a responsibility 
to safeguard consumer privacy, and our five 
Global Data Principles guide how we manage 
and use data, build products and conduct our 
business around the world (see page 45).

Our Global Code of Conduct¹ aligns with the 
United Nations Universal Declaration of Human 
Rights, and our commitment to ensuring an 
ethical supply chain¹ is borne out by our 
membership of the Slave-Free Alliance.

2. Employees
Employee engagement is a key performance 
indicator (see page 21), and we talk on pages 
51-53 about our many programmes and 
initiatives that inspire our people to be their 
best, to bring their whole selves to work, our 
commitment to diversity, equity and inclusion, 
and our recruitment, retention and succession 
practices that help to mitigate the risk of our 
dependence on highly skilled personnel.

3. Environmental matters¹
We take our environmental responsibilities 
seriously, and the reduction of greenhouse gas 
emissions is a key performance indicator for 
us (see page 21). See also page 56 for further 
actions and initiatives Experian is taking to 
help protect the environment².

4. Anti-corruption and anti-bribery
Our Anti-Corruption Framework¹ sets out 
our zero-tolerance policy on bribery and 
corruption in any form, and this message is 
reinforced through mandatory annual training 
for employees.

5. Social matters
Experian has many initiatives in place to 
deliver our purpose of creating a better 
tomorrow for consumers, businesses, our 
people and our communities. The role we play 
benefits everyone: businesses grow, people 
prosper and communities thrive. This happens 
in many ways, including through our core 
business, the development of social innovation 
products, employee volunteering and support 
for community groups and charities.

2  Further detail is available at www.experianplc.com/responsibility/data-and-assurance.

Section 172 defines the duties of company 
directors and concerns the duty to promote 
the success of companies. Throughout FY23, 
the directors of the Company continued to 
exercise these duties while having regard to 
the s172 matters, and also to other relevant 
factors as they reviewed and considered 
proposals from senior management, and 
as they governed the Company on behalf 
of its shareholders through the Board and 
its committees.

Experian plc is a Jersey-incorporated 
company. Nevertheless the Board embraces 
Section 172 and fully supports its aims, 
and we are reporting in line with the UK 
requirement.

We outline below, through use of cross 
reference, where we have considered the 
s172 matters throughout this Annual Report.

details the processes we follow to ensure accuracy of data, the 
regulations we comply with and the consumer websites where we 
detail our approach to data privacy.
In the event of a serious breach, we would disclose information about 
the incident and commit to contact any affected data subjects in a 
timely way. We do not publicly disclose vulnerabilities or lapses due 
to client sensitivities. To the extent that any relevant regulator should 
find fault with our data breach management or data security 
practices, they will publish their findings and any related sanctions. 
There were no new findings or sanctions in FY23.
We report gender and racial/ethnic diversity in the data tables 
available on our website, with our US racial/ethnic diversity shown 
in accordance with the EEO-1 categories. See the Inspiring and 
supporting our people section of our Annual Report (pages 51-53) 
and in our DEI Report.
We report both voluntary and involuntary turnover rates in the data 
tables available on our website.
We report employee engagement as one of our key performance 
indicators for the business. See the Inspiring and supporting our 
people section of our Annual Report (pages 51-53) and the data 
tables available on our website. Our employee engagement score 
in our FY23 Great Place To Work survey was 82%, up four points 
from the previous year.
See our Data Principles (page 45) and the Working with integrity 
section of our Annual Report on (pages 54-55). This latter section 
outlines the importance of our Global Code of Conduct, designed to 
give everyone a clear understanding of our approach to professional 
and ethical standards and ensure employees all know exactly what 
is expected of them individually, and the role they play in helping 
Experian live up to those standards. This code has been approved 
by the Experian plc Board and we are fully committed to 
implementing it across our business.
Material monetary losses associated with legal proceedings, 
sanctions or fines that are a matter of public record are disclosed 
in our Financial Statements (see page 162 onwards). In the case 
of pending and threatened litigation claims, management applies 
judgment as to the likelihood of ultimate liability and recognises 
the liability where the likelihood of potential loss arising is possible 
rather than probable and having a potentially material impact.

*Alternative Performance Measures
We have identified and defined certain non-GAAP measures. These are the key measures 
management uses to assess the underlying performance of our ongoing businesses. 
There is a summary of these measures on page 76 and a fuller explanation in note 7 
to the Group financial statements on pages 175 to 177.

Summary
We achieved a strong financial performance 
in FY23 despite an uncertain macroeconomic 
environment. At constant exchange rates, we 
delivered organic revenue growth of 7%, and 
total revenue growth of 8% after taking into 
account the contribution from acquisitions.

Revenue growth converted well to Benchmark 
EBIT growth and into operating cash flow, with 
Benchmark EBIT up 9% and operating cash 
flow conversion of 98%. Benchmark EPS grew 
strongly by 9%.

After another year of strong growth and cash 
flow conversion, we ended the year in a robust 
financial position with Net debt/Benchmark 
EBITDA of 1.8 times. 

Reflecting the Group's strong performance and 
financial position, the Board has announced 
a full-year dividend increase of 3 US cents 
per share.

Strong and resilient growth record
We have reported organic revenue growth 
every year over the past 17 years, in spite of 
the challenges faced during the global financial 
crisis of 2008 and more recently the COVID-19 
pandemic. 

We continue to diversify our business, 
investing in new market verticals and 
geographies. Through continuous innovation 
and investment, we are able to launch new 
products, bringing solutions to market more 
quickly, harnessing technological 
developments such as big data platforms 
and AI to focus on customer needs. 

Our business model is scalable, allowing us 
to grow revenues quickly at low incremental 
cost, maximising synergies by combining data 
sources and integrating analytics. 

Customer expectations have never been higher, 
nor the pace of technological change faster. We 
are moving more of our technologies to the 
cloud, to give us market-leading data availability 
that allows delivery of cutting-edge products. 

Business-to-Business revenue growth at 
constant exchange rates was 7%, reflecting 
progress in new products, new business wins, 
strong demand for analytics, and the 
development of new markets and products, 
such as the new Ascend module Ascend Ops.

Revenue grew across all regions, at constant 
exchange rates, notwithstanding a softer US 
mortgage market, where revenue declined 
year on year. There was again a strong 
performance in Latin America, where B2B 
organic revenue growth was 13% at constant 
currency, as we continue to benefit from 
uptake of positive data products. Verification 
services performed well, enhanced by recent 
acquisitions. Ascend implementations continue 
to grow as we secured new client wins for our 
global platform. 

We are making progress with the repositioning 
of EMEA/Asia Pacific, focusing on key 
geographies and implementing a programme 
to reduce regional overheads and exit 
sub-scale activities.

Consumer Services continued to perform 
strongly, with organic revenue up by 11% at 
constant exchange rates, reflecting growth in 
the marketplace and upselling of premium 
services. Our free membership base increased 
to 168 million globally. Innovations are 
developing at pace, having a real impact on 
people’s lives as we drive financial inclusion. 
Around 13 million US consumers have 
connected to Experian Boost. More than 
93 million points have been added to credit 
scores using Experian Boost in the last four 
years. Richer features are attracting and 

engaging a larger audience. We are rolling out 
Experian Activate in the USA to help lenders 
target credit offers more precisely, and in 
January 2023 we launched CreditLock in the 
UK, a feature enabling consumers to lock their 
credit report at the touch of a button to prevent 
unauthorised access and avoid fraud.

Our debt resolution product in Brazil, Limpa 
Nome, which helps consumers resolve and 
settle bills, continues to perform strongly. 
In November and December 2022, Serasa 
Experian held its biggest debt renegotiation 
event to date, brokering more than 7.7 million 
deals, with average discounts of 78%. 

Strong Consumer Services growth in North 
America and Latin America was offset by a 
decline in organic revenue in the UK, as 
volumes reduced, reflecting tighter lending 
conditions, as well as reduced premium 
subscription revenue.

Reporting currency 
We report our financial results in US dollars. 
The weakening of our other trading currencies 
during the year, primarily the pound sterling 
and the euro against the US dollar, reduced 
total revenue by US$145m and Benchmark 
EBIT by US$5m. A ± 1% change in the Brazilian 
real or pound sterling exchange rate would 
impact total revenue by ± US$8m respectively.

Benchmark EBIT from ongoing activities was 
US$1,802m (2022: US$ 1,653m), growing 9% 
at constant and actual exchange rates. 
Benchmark EBIT margin from ongoing 
activities was 27.4% (2022: 26.6%), and was 
assisted by foreign exchange movements by 
50 basis points.

We provide details of the principal exchange 
rates used and currency exposures in note 11 
to the Group financial statements on page 185.

Productivity and cost management
In these times of macroeconomic uncertainty, 
productivity is more crucial than ever. 

There is upward pressure on labour-related 
costs from increased inflation and low rates of 
unemployment. A 1% rise in our base payroll 
costs would lead to an additional expense of 
US$24m.

We continue to invest in our EmPower 
productivity programme, global delivery 
centres and new technology to enable 
increasing economies of scale and sharing of 
services, reducing our time to market and 
enhancing our ability to grow profitably. 

Process improvements transform how we 
support our customers, reduce waste and 
create capacity for business reinvestment. 
We now have 2,585 employees trained, 
leveraging Lean Six Sigma process-
improvement methodologies. We have 
completed over 690 projects in FY23 focusing 
on product development, finance, analytics and 
technology functions, with 680 in progress, 
generating savings and improvements in 
operating capacity. 

Our global delivery centres located in Bulgaria, 
Chile, Costa Rica, India and Malaysia, employed 
approximately 4,300 staff at March 2023, and 
will continue expanding as we execute our 
transformation agenda, generating 
productivity savings to reinvest in talent, 
technology, and innovation. They are also 
contributing to the 65% reduction in our 
Scope 1 and 2 emissions since 2019.

We expect employee productivity to grow as 
we increasingly use robots to automate routine 
tasks, improving speed, quality, capacity and 
job satisfaction. Automation is focused on 
sales operations, customer service, finance 
and other back-office functions. 

Since the programme launched we have 
automated manual activity, with approximately 
57 million transactions processed, and c.390 
bots in production in FY23.

Through our Future of Work programme, we 
have increased the flexibility of our workforce, 
allowing employees to work from their home 
or office to best suit their needs. This enables 
us to both retain and attract talent, while 
reducing our dependence on real estate. 

We monitor the macroeconomic environment 
and are taking steps to manage costs 
appropriately, implementing further controls on 
discretionary spending. Rigorous contractual 
frameworks, effective negotiation and volume 
commitments mitigate inflationary pressures.

We remain focused on reviewing and 
identifying opportunities in our contracts with 
key suppliers. For example we recently 
reached agreement with a global web services 
provider that will support the scaling of 

cloud-based solutions in a more sustainable 
manner. 

All of these productivity initiatives are enabling 
us to reinvest savings into our technology and 
our people. New technologies require new 
skills. As we transform our business, we 
create opportunities for our workforce to 
develop and grow with us, maximising their 
expertise. We have created a Career Hub 
delivering top-class training for our 
Leadership, Analytics and Tech employees.

We are offering support to our employees to 
help them cope with heightened inflation and 
cost increases, enabled by the productivity 
savings we are making.

Statutory measures
Revenue grew 5% in the year to US$6,619m 
(2022: US$6,288m) notwithstanding a 
dampened global economy, reflecting the 
resilience of our business. We have an 
outstanding product set unrivalled in breadth 
and depth of capability, strengthening our 
competitive advantage.

Business-to-Business revenue grew 3% to 
US$4,837m (2022: US$4,675m) and Consumer 
Services revenue was up 10% to US$1,782m 
(2022: US$1,613m). Growth was strong in 
North and Latin America, up 8% and 20% 
respectively. Revenue in UK and Ireland was 
down 7%, impacted by the 12% weakening of 
the pound sterling exchange rate against the 
US dollar in the year.

Experian plc  Annual Report 2023Strategic report70

Financial review
continued

Revenue in EMEA/Asia Pacific was similarly 
impacted by adverse exchange rate 
movements, and was down by 14% in the year, 
due to a combination of exchange effects and 
as we exit from non-core activities.

Acquisitions contributed US$37m (2022: 
US$93m) to revenue growth in the year and 
US$3m (2022: US$17m) to profit before tax, 
though we bore a charge of US$45m (2022: 
US$26m) for increased contingent 
consideration due to over-performance on 
prior acquisitions.

Even though our business is less prone to 
macroeconomic impacts than many others, 
it is still susceptible to the general weakening 
of global financial conditions. We incurred a 
non-cash charge of US$179m (2022: US$nil) 
for EMEA goodwill impairment, driven by 
increased discount rates and macroeconomic 
weakness in our European markets.

While our plan to focus our EMEA/Asia Pacific 
operations is progressing well, we incurred 
additional exceptional restructuring costs of 
US$53m (2022: US$20m). The net gain from 
associate disposals of US$1m (2022: US$90m) 
was much reduced. 

The additional costs discussed above 
contributed to the reduction in operating profit 
to US$1,265m from US$1,416m in FY22, down 
11%. Net finance expense increased to US$74m 
(2022: net finance income of US$59m) from a 
movement of US$59m in foreign exchange 
losses on Brazilian real intra-Group funding, 
and other fair value remeasurements. 

Profit before tax declined to US$1,174m (2022: 
US$1,447m), and the tax charge for the year 
increased to US$401m (2022: US$296m), 
34.2% (2022: 20.5%) of profit before tax, 
impacted by the non-deductibility of the 
goodwill impairment and an increase in tax 
on other expenses not deductible of US$46m. 
The impairment of associate investments, 
acquisition and disposal expenses and some 
financing fair value remeasurements are not 
allowable for tax purposes. 

Basic EPS decreased to 84.2 US cents (2022: 
127.5 US cents). The reduction reflects a lower 
profit before tax, no repeat of the prior year 
profit from discontinued operations of US$16m 
and an increased effective tax rate. 

Outlook
Despite increased economic headwinds and 
a challenging global economy, we anticipate 
growth will continue in FY24, with total 
projected organic revenue growth in the range 
of 4-6% for the year as a whole, with modest 
margin improvement. Our products and 
services are often integral to clients’ operating 
processes, generating highly recurring 
revenue. Growth is bolstered by the expansion 
of counter-cyclical revenue streams and the 

diversity of our portfolio. Revenue from our 
strategic investments is starting to scale, with 
new growth areas less affected by the general 
slowdown.

While revenue is expected to decline in some 
areas as macroeconomic growth slows, a 
more difficult marketplace also presents us 
with opportunities, as we help clients navigate 
the macroeconomic environment. Consumer 
demand for credit is generally elevated and 
lender appetite is increasing for analytics to 
monitor affordability and provide cost-of-living 
insights.

We have significant addressable markets, 
estimated at over US$150bn, and the 
development of our unique innovative products 
is allowing us to make headway in these 
markets. We expect further strengthening and 
diversification of our portfolio to enable us to 
be even more resilient than in the global 
financial crisis.

Interest
Benchmark net finance costs increased by 
US$14m, reflecting an uplift in average market 
interest rates as central banks raised rates in 
response to heightened inflation. 

We have maintained a high proportion of debt 
at fixed rates. At 31 March 2023, interest on 
90% of our net funding was at fixed rates 
(2022: 98%), mitigating the impacts of general 
rate rises. This fixing will have a significant 

impact on future interest charges, as indicated 
by the fair value of interest rate swaps, which 
has increased to US$88m (2022: US$41m).

The effective interest rate on loan and bond 
debt, including derivatives, was 2.9% (2022: 
2.7%).

Taxation
Our effective tax rate on Benchmark PBT 
was 26.0% (2022: 25.7%), reflecting the mix 
of profits and prevailing tax rates by territory. 
We expect our effective tax rate on Benchmark 
PBT in FY24 will be around 26-27%, impacted 
by the increase in the main rate of UK 
corporation tax from 19% to 25% from 
1 April 2023.

The equivalent cash tax rate of 31.4% (2022: 
23.8%) is above our Benchmark tax rate and 
we provide a reconciliation in the table below. 
Timing differences on US innovation and 
development expenditure in FY23 are as a 
result of US legislative changes. 'Other' in 
FY23 includes tax on fair value gains on the 
remeasurement of derivatives, and phasing 
of tax payments. 'Other' included the phasing 
of tax payments in FY22. 

While we note proposals that the US legislative 
changes may ultimately be repealed, we 
anticipate that our cash tax rate will align more 
closely to our Benchmark tax rate over the 
medium term, as timing differences unwind.

Earnings per share
Benchmark EPS was 135.1 US cents (2022: 
124.5 US cents), up 9% at actual and constant 
exchange rates. A ± 10% change in the 
Brazilian real exchange rate would impact 
Benchmark EPS by ± 2 US cents. A similar 
change in the pound sterling exchange rate 
would impact Benchmark EPS by less than 
± 1 US cent. We provide further information 
in note 19 to the Group financial statements 
on pages 191 to 192.

Cash and liquidity management
The Group is highly cash generative converting 
98% (2022: 109%) of Benchmark EBIT to 
Benchmark operating cash flow, and with 
Benchmark free cash flow of US$1,109m 
(2022: US$1,311m). The continued strength 
of our Benchmark operating cash flow 
performance reflects the nature of our low 
capital intensity business and financial model, 
and our attention to working capital 
management.

Funding
The Group has ample liquidity and access 
to considerable funding, with undrawn 
committed bank borrowing facilities at 
31 March 2023 of US$2.4bn (2022: US$2.6bn), 
including our core US$1.95bn club facility, 
committed until December 2025. Our 
borrowing facilities ensure the Group has 
sufficient funds available for operations and 
planned growth.

The covenant on our banking facilities requires 
that Benchmark EBIT should cover net interest 
expense, excluding the effects of IFRS 16 
‘Leases’, before financing fair value 
remeasurements, by three times. At 31 March 
2023, this ratio was 15 times (2022: 16 times). 
We have no undue concentration of repayment 
obligations in respect of borrowings and did 
not breach any covenants given on borrowings 
during the year under review or the prior year.

Financial review
continued

Our bonds, which represented 92% (2022: 96%) 
of borrowings at 31 March 2023, totalled 
US$3.8bn (2022: US$3.9bn), and had an 
average remaining tenor of five years. We seek 
to minimise refinancing risk in any given year, 
with no bond refinancing required until 
September 2024, and at 31 March 2023 55% 
(2022: 57%) of borrowings fell due in over 
five years.

We keep our debt levels stable at a low 
multiple of our profits, commensurate with 
maintaining strong investment-grade credit 
ratings (BBB+/Baa1 or above). Our balance 
sheet strength allows us to maintain access to 
cost-effective sources of borrowing. Net debt 
at 31 March 2023 was US$4,030m (2022: 
US$3,950m), 1.8 times Benchmark EBITDA 
(2022: 1.9 times), compared to our target range 
of 2.0 to 2.5 times.

Disciplined capital management
We maintain a disciplined approach to capital 
allocation, balancing organic and strategic 
investments with shareholder returns through 
dividends and share repurchases. The mix 
between these categories varies over time, 
and we assess acquisition opportunities 
against a range of metrics, including economic 
valuations and the earnings enhancement 
we expect them to bring relative to share 
repurchases. Our free cash flow has 
consistently been strong, the foundation 
of our disciplined allocation framework. 
Further information on capital risk 
management is provided in note 8(b) to the 
Group financial statements on page 178.

We executed net share repurchases for a 
cash consideration of US$175m, which mainly 
offset deliveries during the year under 
employee share plans. We expect to execute 
purchases of up to US$150m in the coming 
year.

Net investment of US$1,119m (2022: 
US$1,167m) comprised cash flows for net 
capital expenditure, acquisitions and net 
investments.

Acquisitions

Acquisitions focus on strategic growth 
areas, new markets, or enhance our existing 
business. We completed six acquisitions 
in the year, for a cash consideration of 
US$480m (2022: US$781m), including 
that of CIC Plus, LLC, for US$188m, 
supplementing our verification and 
employer services offering in the USA.

We also purchased the remaining 40% 
interest in the Experian DACH Joint Venture, 
for US$133m.

In April 2023, we agreed to acquire Flexpag 
Tecnologia e Instituição de Pagamento S.A., 
a Brazilian FinTech specialising in digital 
payment solutions, for c.US$49m.

Disposals
We disposed of interests in two small 
subsidiaries in EMEA/Asia Pacific in 
connection with our restructuring 
programme, realising a gain of US$2m. 
In addition, further costs of US$3m were 
incurred following our decision in FY22 
to cease operations in Russia.

US$161m were recognised in OCI. 

Our spend on net share repurchases was 
US$175m (at an average price of 2,524p), 
reducing the number of shares in circulation by 
1.6m (0.17%). During the year, the average 
number of shares in circulation was 914m 
(2022: 914m) and the closing number of shares 
at 31 March 2023 was 912m (2022: 914m). 

Dividends and distributable reserves
Our dividend policy aims to pay dividends over 
time broadly in line with the underlying growth 
in Benchmark EPS, aligning shareholder 
returns with our underlying profitability. Our 
long-term record of profitability and strong 
cash flow conversion has enabled us to pay 
increasing dividends since listing in 2006. 
In the last five years, we have paid ordinary 
dividends of US$2.2bn.

The Board has announced a second interim 
dividend of 37.75 (2022: 35.75) US cents per 
ordinary share, giving a total dividend for the 
year of 54.75 (2022: 51.75) US cents per share, 
which is covered 2.5 times by Benchmark EPS 
(2022: 2.4 times). Ordinary dividends paid in 
the year amounted to US$482m (2022: 
US$444m). 

Experian plc, and the UK entity responsible for 
distributing dividends under the Group’s 
Income Access Share arrangements, have 
significant distributable reserves, which at 
31 March 2023 were US$19.2bn and US$8.6bn 
respectively. See note L to the Company 
financial statements for further detail.

1  For definition of ROCE see ‘Non-GAAP measures’ on page 177. For FY23 the return used in the calculation of ROCE is based on 

Benchmark EBIT of US$1,794m and a Benchmark tax rate of 26.0%.

Experian plc Strategic report75

In addition, the Group is subject to challenge 
by the Brazilian and Colombian tax authorities 
on the deduction for tax purposes of goodwill 
amortisation. The possibility of the claims 
resulting in a liability to the Group is 
considered to be remote. Further information 
on this contingency is provided in note 46 to 
the Group financial statements. 

Deciding whether to recognise deferred tax 
assets is a financial judgment. Assets are 
recognised only when we consider it probable 
that they can be recovered, based on forecasts 
of future profits against which those assets 
may be utilised.

Pensions
The Group is exposed to a number of risks 
inherent in defined benefit pension plans, as 
outlined in note 35(d) to the Group financial 
statements. The principal financial assumption 
used in determining the carrying value of 
pension assets or obligations is the real 
discount rate. If this rate increased or 
decreased by 0.25%, defined benefit 
obligations at 31 March 2023 would change 
by approximately ± US$22m, offset by a 
change in the fair value of plan assets of 
approximately ± US$27m.

The 2022 actuarial valuation of the Group's 
principal defined benefit plan has been agreed, 
and there was a moderate funding surplus.

Litigation
There continue to be an increasing number of 
pending and threatened claims and regulatory 
actions involving the Group across all its major 
geographies which are in various stages of 
investigation or enforcement, and which are 
being vigorously defended, including from the 
Consumer Financial Protection Bureau and 
Federal Trade Commission in the USA, and the 
Information Commissioner’s Office in the UK. 
We do not consider that the outcome of any 
such claims will have a materially adverse 
effect on our financial position.

Return on capital
ROCE for FY23 and FY22 was 16.5% and 15.7% 
respectively. Returns are affected by the timing 
of acquisitions completed part way through 
any given year. Acquisitions largely completed 
early in FY23, contributing to the increased 
return. ROCE is a post-tax measure and we use 
our Benchmark tax rate for ease of calculation. 

Further information on net assets by region 
is given in note 10 to the Group financial 
statements on page 182. 

Financial risk management
The key financial risks specific to our business 
are set out in the Risk management section on 
pages 78 – 85. Our risk landscape continues 
to change as both business and regulatory 
environments evolve.

We continue to monitor inflationary and 
geopolitical risks, including market volatility, 
regulatory and tax policy uncertainty. 

We have identified macroeconomic factors as 
a principal risk, as we operate globally and our 
results could be affected by global, regional or 
national changes in fiscal or monetary policies. 
Detailed narrative disclosures are contained 
in note 8 to the Group financial statements 
on pages 177 to 178, with further numeric 
disclosures for foreign exchange, interest rate 
and credit risk in notes 11, 16, 25 and 31 
respectively.

Estimates and judgments
The Group is subject to a number of risks 
and uncertainties that require us to make 
estimates and judgments. Areas involving 
significant uncertainty are:

Goodwill
Goodwill represents 51% of total assets. 
We test for impairment of goodwill at least 
annually by performing a value-in-use 
calculation for each cash-generating unit 
(CGU), which is based on cash flow projections 
with assumptions. IAS 36 requires us to 
disclose where a reasonably possible 
movement in these key assumptions would 
lead the calculated recoverable amount to be 
equal to the carrying value. These estimates 
are, by nature, subject to uncertainty and the 
key assumptions used by each CGU, and 
sensitivities for the EMEA and Asia Pacific 
CGUs, are set out in note 21 to the Group 
financial statements. Macroeconomic 
conditions have contributed to a non-cash 
impairment of EMEA goodwill of US$179m 
in the year.

Useful life of intangible assets
Our business is subject to technological 
change and competition. We currently 
amortise non-acquisition intangibles over 
a period from three to ten years, with the 
average life being six years. If the useful life 
of our databases and internal use or internally 
generated software either increased or 
decreased by one year, the impact on the 
annual amortisation charge would be a 
decrease of US$68m or an increase of 
US$107m respectively. 

Taxation
We are subject to tax in numerous jurisdictions 
and have a number of open tax returns with 
various tax authorities. It can take many years 
to agree an outcome with a tax authority, 
as there are transactions in the ordinary 
course of business for which the ultimate 
tax determination is uncertain. Our key 
uncertainties relate to the deductibility of 
purchased goodwill, inter-company trading 
and financing. US$102m (2022: US$293m) 
is included in current tax liabilities in relation 
to these judgmental areas, down on FY22 
following agreement of historical tax positions. 
If the resolution of all these uncertainties was 
ultimately adverse, we may be required to pay 
an amount of up to US$24m (2022: US$151m) 
in addition to that currently provided.

Exceptional items and other 
adjustments made to derive 
Benchmark PBT
We make certain adjustments to derive 
Benchmark PBT. These are summarised in 
the table below. Note 7 to the Group financial 
statements explains the reasons for the 
exclusion from our definition of Benchmark 
PBT of Exceptional items and other 
adjustments made to derive Benchmark PBT.

Further information on Exceptional items is 
provided in note 15 to the Group financial 
statements on pages 187 to 188.

Non-GAAP measures
We have identified and defined certain 
non-GAAP measures as the key measures 
used by management to assess the underlying 
performance of the Group’s ongoing 
businesses. 

As a result of our restructuring programme 
in EMEA/Asia Pacific, we have refined the 
definition of Exceptional items, to include 
onerous global support costs associated 
with the closure of significant operations, 
to improve the assessment of underlying 
operating performance as such costs are 
eliminated through restructuring activity. 

The table opposite summarises these 
measures, and there is a fuller explanation 
in note 7 to the Group financial statements 
on pages 175 to 177.

Access to 

accurate and reliable

information is a crucial part of the mortgage lending process.

Verify

Lenders saying yes to more borrowers

Millions of mortgages are applied for 
and approved every year in the USA. 
It is one of the biggest, most stressful 
financial decisions a person can make. 
All being well, it enables them to 
eventually own the home they live in 
and lay the foundation for building 
wealth over time. Mortgages have 
been greatly beneficial to many, with 
over 65% of Americans now owning 
their own home. For lenders, they 
represent a valuable source of fixed 
income, allowing them to plan for the 
growth of their companies efficiently. 

Given the amounts of money involved, 
applicants must provide proof of 
income and job stability. This helps 
give lenders a view of a consumer's 
capacity to repay the mortgage. But it 
can take days or even weeks for a 
loan officer to receive the consumer’s 
pay slips, slowing down the process 
and adding stress for the consumer. 

With millions of trusted employer 
payroll records, Experian Verify can 
automate this process. It uses 
real-time data, on a flexible platform 
that can be tailored to each client’s 
unique needs. 

It enables decisions to be made in 
seconds, securely, reducing stress 
for consumers. It also reduces risk 
for lenders with more accurate and 
up-to-date information, reduces 
their costs and provides a more 
comprehensive view of a consumer’s 
financial health. This enables lenders 
to say yes to more borrowers. 

Lenders also have peace of mind knowing 
Experian Verify supports income and 
employment validation from the US 
Government Sponsored Enterprises (GSEs).

Risk management and principal risks

Identifying and managing risk

Identifying and managing risk is key to our purpose and the delivery of our strategy and objectives. All colleagues 
play a crucial role in managing risks, and doing so helps us create long-term shareholder value and protect our 
business, people, assets, capital and reputation.

Our risk management governance structure

Board

Sets our overarching risk appetite and ensures that we manage risks appropriately across the 
Group. The Board delegates oversight of risk management activities to the Audit Committee.

Audit Committee

Regularly monitors the principal risks and uncertainties identified by our risk assessment 
processes, with the strategies we have developed and the actions we have taken to mitigate them. 
The Committee also continually reviews the effectiveness of our risk management and internal 
control systems, which support our risk identification, assessment and reporting.

Executive Risk Management Committee (ERMC)

Comprises senior Group executives, including the executive directors and the Company Secretary. 
It oversees how we manage global risks. This committee and the risk committees mentioned 
below each meet multiple times a year.

Risk Management and Governance Committees

Security and
Continuity Steering
Committee (SCSC)
is a sub-committee of  
the ERMC. Its primary 
responsibility is to 
oversee management  
of global information 
security, physical security, 
and business continuity.

Tax and Treasury 
Committee
oversees management of 
financial risks, including 
tax, credit, liquidity, 
funding, market and 
currency risks.

Global and Regional 
Strategic Project 
Committees
ensure that we 
appropriately resource 
our strategic projects, that 
they are risk-assessed, 
and commercially and 
technically appraised. The 
committees' conclusions 
are then considered by 
the Board or relevant 
Group Principal Operating 
Subsidiary.

Regional Risk 
Management Committees 
(RRMCs)
oversee management of 
regional risks and feed up 
to the ERMC.

Environmental, Social  
and Governance (ESG) 
Steering Committee
ensures the definition, 
approval and integrated 
delivery of the Group's 
ESG strategy, and is 
chaired by the Chief 
Financial Officer.

Group Operating Committee (OpCo)

The Group Operating Committee comprises our most senior executives. Its remit includes 
identifying, debating and achieving consensus on issues involving strategy, risk, growth, people 
and culture, and operational efficiency. Its meetings generally focus on the key issues facing 
our Group. 

Executive management

Our executive management takes day-to-day responsibility for implementing the Board’s policies 
on risk management and internal control. It designates who is responsible and accountable 
through the design and implementation of all necessary internal control systems, including 
policies, standards and guidance.

Experian plc Strategic report79

Our risk management process

The Board is responsible for maintaining 
and reviewing the effectiveness of our risk 
management activities from a strategic, 
financial, regulatory and operational 
perspective. These activities are designed to 
identify and manage, rather than eliminate, 
the risk of failing to achieve our business 
objectives or strategy. The risk management 
process (see diagram below) is designed to 
identify, assess, respond to, report on and 
monitor the risks that threaten our ability 
to do this, within our risk appetite.

We apply both bottom-up and top-down 
approaches to the management of risk. 
Bottom-up risk management processes, 
operating at a business unit or country level, 
provide visibility of risks and issues across the 
business. These risks and issues are assessed 
and reported to relevant risk management 
committees at a regional and global level. 
Our top-down approach involves senior 
management at a global level and identifies 
the principal and emerging risks that threaten 
achieving our strategy. This ensures that our 
risk response is appropriate.

We follow the Three Lines of Defence approach 
to risk management (see diagram below). 
Risks are owned and managed within the 
business (first line of defence) and reviewed 
by our businesses at least quarterly. Global 
governance teams (from the second line of 
defence) provide oversight and challenge 
of the management of risks and controls, 
including those relating to information security, 
compliance and business continuity. Global 
Internal Audit, as the third line of defence, 
assesses our risks and controls independently 
and objectively. The results of this oversight 
and review process feed into our reporting 
cycle through the risk management 
governance structure.

Risk categories
We adopt a risk category approach to reporting 
risk within the Group. The risk categories 
reflect the overall purpose, strategy and 
business model for the Group, and recognise 
both the external context and our internal 
operating environment. Risk categories 
provide the foundation for the reporting 
of all risks within the Group.

Risk management and principal risks
continued

Risk appetite
The Board sets our overarching risk appetite 
for the principal risks we face across our risk 
categories in the normal course of business. 
We assess the level of risk against the risk 
appetite, to ensure we focus our efforts 
appropriately. We target risks for assessment 
based on gross risk, and measure them based 
on net risk, using a risk and control 
assessment methodology. We then prioritise 
them for mitigation. The Board and Audit 
Committee review the principal and emerging 
risks on an ongoing basis, as does the ERMC. 
We use a variety of information sources to 
show whether we are working within our 
tolerance for these risks, and whether or not 
any of them require additional executive 
attention.

Our risk culture
The Board is committed to maintaining a 
culture that emphasises the importance of 
managing risk, and encourages transparent 
and timely risk reporting. We work to align 
employees’ behaviour, attitudes and incentives 
with our risk appetite and with our risk 
management and other governance policies. 
Our risk governance process reinforces 
and facilitates appropriate ownership, 
accountability, escalation and management 
of our principal and emerging risks. This 
process includes: well-defined roles and 
responsibilities across our Three Lines of 
Defence model; assigning accountability for 
taking risks when making key business 
decisions; documenting clear boundaries 
and behavioural expectations in policies and 
standards, such as within the Group’s Code of 
Conduct; and creating an environment that 
reinforces adherence and accountability. Our 
governance structure is designed to be agile in 
both managing existing risks and reacting to 
any newly identified risks. Principal and 
emerging risks are discussed in one or more 
of our governance forums, and we hold ad hoc 
meetings when needed, to quickly assess and 
determine appropriate risk responses.

Current areas of focus
Our risk landscape continues to change as 
both business and regulatory environments 
evolve.

Last year we completed an external review of 
our operational risk management programme. 
We reported that, in response, we had initiated 
a transformational project and during the year 
we have made substantial progress in 
implementing the recommendations in the 
review. In particular, we have improved the 
way we quantify and assess the severity of our 
key risks, improved the way we assess and 
monitor our emerging risks, and adopted a 
new action-driven response based on four 
new risk response categorisations: Improve/

Influence, Assure, Monitor and Optimise. We 
also enhanced our internal risk governance 
and reporting arrangements and made a 
number of new appointments as we continue 
to build our risk management capability.

In addition, each of the second line functions 
carried out a strategic review with the aim of 
developing an integrated set of strategic plans 
across the second line to harmonise our 
overall risk management process. As part of 
the strategic review, we assessed the maturity 
of our processes across the second line of 
defence and our strategic plans set a clear 
path to deliver an assured maturity level 
across Risk, Information Security and 
Compliance. For further details, see the 
Audit Committee report, page 113.

We expect to continue to make further 
progress on delivering our strategic plan and 
further maturing our overall risk management 
approach through FY24.

Emerging risks
We have made improvements to our emerging 
risk processes to identify and assess risks that 
may, in time, pose a threat to our business 
model or strategy. This horizon scanning 
exercise seeks to identify potential risks and 
emerging trends, looking through various risk 
lenses and over a future time horizon, in some 
cases extending up to five years and beyond. 
This approach enables the consideration of the 
most relevant emerging risks and 
opportunities for Experian and provides 
the opportunity to review and develop 
appropriate risk response strategies to 
address them. Some of the emerging risks 
we are currently monitoring include:

 a Artificial intelligence (AI) and advancing 
technologies: Using AI and other advanced 
technologies to automate a range of 
operational tasks helps Experian stay 
competitive in a rapidly evolving market and 
keep up with consumer demands. However, 
the increasing use of AI and machine learning 
may pose risks related to, for example, 
security, change management and to the 
accuracy and completeness of data and 
related models. Therefore, we must ensure 
that our approach to the use of these 
technologies follows our strong risk 
management and governance processes and 
is compliant with regulatory requirements. 
For example, we have recently established a 
new process to assess the emerging risks 
and opportunities of Generative AI tools 
across our business operations.

 a Geopolitical instability: Geopolitical risk 
is being monitored due to the increasing 
complexity of international relations and 
rise of nationalism and populism. With 
operations in 32 countries, Experian needs 
to regularly review and update its strategy 

to mitigate potential impact and uncertainty 
from geopolitical developments including: 
the war in Ukraine; hardening of technology 
blocs as a result of trade and investment 
controls; relations between China and 
Western countries; and the shifts in political 
power in Latin America.

Climate-related risks
We recognise climate change as one of the 
most critical issues facing global society. The 
main climate-related risks affecting the Group 
relate to: how physical risks such as flooding, 
damage from hail, and freeze damage, could 
cause disruption to our business operations; 
and the risks posed by the transition to a 
low-carbon economy, such as climate change 
regulation and any failure to adapt our 
products and services in markets most 
affected by this change. Climate risk has 
implications relating to several of our existing 
risk categories (and related principal risks), 
and we recognise we need a range of risk 
responses. We continue to monitor, assess and 
manage these risks using our established 
four-step risk management processes. These 
risks, and our response to them, are overseen 
by our ESG Steering Committee. For example, 
this year, our insurance providers have 
undertaken climate engineering surveys at our 
key operational sites to help us understand 
what further actions we can take to strengthen 
our climate resilience. Making continued 
progress towards our science-based emission 
reduction target – including through energy 
efficiency – helps mitigate risk associated with 
potential future carbon pricing and increased 
energy costs. Our approach to Scope 3 
reporting and supplier engagement reduces 
exposure to carbon taxation on purchased 
goods and services, which make up most of 
our value chain carbon footprint. The 
Committee has developed a strategy to 
manage the ongoing climate-related and other 
ESG risks as they present themselves and we 
continue to embed these within our existing 
risk management approach. Further detail on 
how we have incorporated climate-related 
risks into our risk management process is 
available in the Sustainable business section 
(page 40).

Principal risks
The following pages summarise our principal 
risks and uncertainties, with mitigating actions 
for each, and related trends in the risk 
environment, as identified by the Board for the 
year ended 31 March 2023. The Board has 
made revisions to the nature and definitions of 
these risks when compared with prior years: 
consolidated two, and updated and refined 
others. These risks may continue to change 
during the next financial year as the risk 
landscape evolves and emerging risks 
continue to develop.

Experian plc Strategic report81

While we operate in a rapidly evolving legal, 
regulatory and technological landscape and 
a level of uncertainty remains in the 
geopolitical environment, in the second half 
of the financial year we have seen risk trends 
stabilising.

To assess our Group’s viability, the directors 
focused on three principal risks critical to our 
success. These are summarised below and 
discussed in more detail in the viability 
assessment section following the description 
of our principal risks.

 a Data loss/misuse leading to serious 

reputational and brand damage, legal 
penalties and class action litigation.

 a The uncertainty surrounding the geopolitical 

and macroeconomic environment, in 
particular increased inflation and the raising 
of interest rates.

 a New legislation or changes in regulatory 

enforcement changing how we operate our 
business.

Data loss/misuse

We hold and manage sensitive business, 
customer and consumer information that 
increases our exposure and susceptibility to 
cyber attacks or other unauthorised access 
to data, either directly through our online 
systems or indirectly through our partners 
or third-party suppliers.

This risk is considered in the viability 
assessment.

Risk category
Operational

Risk movement
Stable

Potential impact
Loss or unauthorised access to sensitive 
business, customer or consumer data could 
cause problems for consumers, result in 
material loss of business, substantial legal 
liability, regulatory enforcement or significant 
harm to our reputation. The impact of this risk, 
if it materialised, would typically be felt in the 
short term.

Examples of control mitigation
 a We deploy physical and technological security 
measures, combined with monitoring and 
alerting for suspicious activities.

 a We maintain an information security 

programme with strong governance for 
identifying, protecting against, detecting and 
responding to cyber security risks and 
recovering from cyber security incidents.

 a We impose contractual security 

requirements on our partners and 
other third parties that use our data, 
complemented by periodic reviews 
of third-party controls.

 a We maintain insurance coverage, where 

feasible and appropriate.

Risk category
Financial

Risk movement
Stable

Responsibility
Our Global Security Office sets policies and 
standards related to the information security 
programme. Every employee is responsible 
for following security policies and protocols, 
supported by a strong emphasis on training 
and awareness.

Changes this year
External cyber security threats to businesses 
continue to increase in complexity and evolve 
in their nature and scope. Our threat-informed 
defence programme concurrently monitors 
and targets the most active threats to mitigate 
and reduce risks. As our business continues to 
change through both acquisitions and 
technological developments, we remain 
focused on the continuing need to survey the 
internal and external threat landscape and 
develop responses that support our strategy to 
manage the risk.

Our security programme continues to improve 
its maturity relative to industry frameworks 
(e.g. US National Institute of Standards and 
Technology), and we have further enhanced 
our protection, detection and response 
capabilities by strengthening security policies, 
practices and training. We also ensure that we 
apply them consistently across our regions 
and business units. We will continue investing 
in the tools, people, resources and initiatives 
necessary to maintain and improve our global 
information security programme.

More information on our approach to treating 
data with respect is available in our 
Sustainable business section (page 45).

Macroeconomic

We operate globally and our results could be 
affected by global, regional or national changes 
in fiscal or monetary policies.

A substantial change in credit markets in the 
USA, Brazil or the UK could harm our financial 
performance and growth potential in those 
countries.

A substantial or sustained rise in US, EU or UK 
interest rates could impact lending and 
consumer spending. It could also increase our 
future cost of borrowings.

We present our Group financial statements in 
US dollars. However, we transact business in a 
number of currencies. Changes in other 
currencies relative to the US dollar affect our 
financial results.

This risk is considered in the viability 
assessment.

Potential impact
The USA, Brazil and UK markets are significant 
contributors to our revenue.

A reduction in one or more of these markets 
for consumer and business credit services 
could reduce our revenue and profit. 

We benefit from the strengthening of 
currencies relative to the US dollar and are 
adversely affected by currencies weakening 
relative to it.

We have outstanding debt denominated 
principally in euros, pounds sterling and US 
dollars. As this debt matures, we may need to 
replace it with borrowings at higher interest 
rates.

The impact of this risk, if it materialised, would 
typically be felt in the short to long term.

Examples of control mitigation
 a We have a diverse portfolio by region, 
product, sector and client. We provide 
cyclical and counter-cyclical products and 
services.

 a We convert cash balances in foreign 

currencies into US dollars.

 a We fix the interest rates on a proportion of 

our borrowings.

 a We review contingency plans in our key 

markets for specific potential responses to 
evolving financial conditions.

Responsibility
Our corporate and business unit finance 
functions monitor our external landscape, 
and work with business units to develop and 
implement appropriate responses.

Changes this year
During 2022, the global economy saw a more 
moderate performance when compared to the 
2021 rebound (6.1% growth), with the global 
Gross Domestic Product (GDP) growing 3.1% 
(at March 2023). The forecasts show a decline 
in GDP for the UK in 2023, with modest growth 
expected in 2024. 2023 GDP expectations in 
our largest market, the USA, are expected to 
be flat versus 2022, with low growth expected 
in 2024. Overall, global GDP is expected to 
remain positive with growth expected in 2023.

Elevated inflation rates continue to exist in the 
market compared to historical levels. Factors 
such as the impact of inflation on our base 
payroll cost and technology spend as well as 
other issues such as supply chain pressures 
could lead to higher operating costs. We 
monitor cost pressure points to mitigate 
inflation and maintain a focus on cost 
management and efficiency.

Risk management and principal risks
continued

Despite the softer macroeconomic backdrop 
and tightening in lending criteria by some 
clients, we continue to perform well 
competitively and access higher growth 
opportunities with a very substantial quantum 
of addressable opportunity. Businesses 
continue to need to generate productivity gains 
while delivering better digital experiences for 
their customers and our rich datasets, which 
are delivered through some of the world’s 
most technologically advanced solutions, 
enable them to do this.

We continue to analyse the impact of changes 
in economic conditions on Group revenues and 
have considered different economic scenarios 
in our viability assessment. We will continue to 
refine and assure the readiness of our 
strategic options if the external 
macroeconomic factors have a bigger impact 
on our performance.

While we continue to monitor new and evolving 
legislation relating to tax, this risk has reduced 
in the year due to a reduction in the number of 
open tax enquiries. In the last six months the 
range of external macroeconomic factors have 
moderated their rate of change and so we 
assess our macroeconomic risk movement as 
broadly stable.

Legislative/regulatory change 
and compliance

We hold and manage sensitive consumer 
information and we must comply with many 
complex privacy and consumer protection 
laws, regulations and contractual obligations. 
New laws, new or novel interpretations of 
existing laws, changes to existing regulations 
and heightened regulatory scrutiny, will also 
affect how we operate. For example, 
regulatory interpretation of complex, 
principles-based privacy regulations could 
affect how we collect and process information 
for marketing, risk management and fraud 
detection.

This risk is considered in the viability 
assessment.

Potential impact
Non-compliance may result in material 
litigation, including class actions, as well as 
regulatory actions. These could result in civil 
or criminal liability or penalties, damage to our 
reputation or significant changes to parts of 
our business. We may also suffer increased 
costs or reduced revenue resulting from 
modified business practices, adopting new 
procedures, self-regulation or litigation or 
regulatory actions resulting in liability, fines or 

changes in our business practices. The impact 
of this risk, if it materialised, would typically be 
felt in the short to long term.

Examples of control mitigation
 a We maintain a compliance management 
framework that includes defined policies, 
procedures and controls for Experian 
employees, business processes, and third 
parties such as our data resellers.

 a Our global Compliance team has 

region-specific regulatory expertise and 
works with our businesses to identify and 
adopt balanced compliance strategies.

 a We assess the appropriateness of using 
data in new and changing products and 
services.

 a We operate a horizon scanning process to 
identify potential changes in laws and 
regulation and assess their impact.

 a Our Government Affairs strategic plan and 
policy-influencing activity seeks to respond 
to legislative proposals and influence their 
outcome to mitigate impacts on Experian 
strategy.

 a We vigorously defend all pending and 

threatened claims, employing internal and 
external counsel to manage and conclude 
such proceedings effectively.

Responsibility
Our Legal, Government Affairs and Compliance 
functions work with our business units to 
understand the impact of relevant laws and 
regulations, including any regulatory 
interpretations and associated implications. 
Our business units put in place appropriate 
procedures and controls designed to ensure 
compliance.

Changes this year
We have faced continued heightened 
regulatory scrutiny, and regulatory and 
government enquiries and investigations in 
several jurisdictions. The laws and regulations 
to which we are subject are complex, 
principles-based, and may be subject to 
interpretations, which can lead to actual and 
potential differences in how regulations are 
now interpreted and enforced in many of the 
jurisdictions in which we operate. In some 
cases these differences in interpretations may 
have to be decided in the courts. We highlight 
some significant updates below:

 a In the USA, the Consumer Financial 

Protection Bureau (CFPB) conducts regular 
and ongoing supervisory examinations of 
various aspects of our credit reference 
business. The CFPB has increased its 
supervisory and enforcement activities 
generally in the financial services industry, 
with a focus on accuracy, fairness, financial 
inclusion and anti-discrimination. During 
2021, among other matters, the CFPB 

conducted supervisory examinations 
relating to our consumer-facing dispute 
resolution processes for credit reports and 
to Experian Boost. The CFPB has referred 
the results of these examinations to their 
Enforcement Division for investigation. We 
have responded to various data requests on 
these matters over the past year.

 a The US Federal Trade Commission (FTC) has 

also generally increased its regulatory 
activities in a number of areas that may 
impact the financial services industry, 
including marketing, competition, privacy 
and other consumer-facing regulations. 
During the year the FTC has also alleged 
certain violations of law relating to Experian 
Consumer Services' practices for emailing 
its membership base. Experian intends to 
continue to fully co-operate with our 
regulators and, where necessary, vigorously 
defend our practices.

 a Some US state privacy laws have come into 

effect, with laws in additional states to 
follow throughout the year, as well as 
ongoing rulemaking under those laws now 
in effect. A number of other states have 
privacy laws under consideration and are 
expected to enact privacy laws before 
a national privacy standard may be 
established, if at all. In the meantime, 
divergence in state laws may have an 
impact on products and services, as well 
as on compliance regimes.

 a Over the past year, the number of US class 

action lawsuits has remained steady, 
however individual consumer cases are 
trending up. While we are managing the 
effects associated with these investigations 
and lawsuits, the costs of responding to the 
increased regulatory scrutiny and defending 
litigation are rising and consequently the 
risk of potential liability and impact on some 
parts of our business remains significant.

 a In Brazil, the general data protection law 

(LGPD) has been effective since September 
2020. The LGPD may have an impact on how 
businesses operate in certain markets, 
including marketing services. In addition, the 
LGPD created the Brazilian National Data 
Protection Authority (the ANPD), which 
exercises certain roles of education, 
enforcement, investigation, and regulation, 
including the determination of rules and 
interpretation of data protections laws. 
While we have implemented our rigorous 
compliance programme based on the 
principles outlined in the law, we have 
already seen some different regulatory 
interpretations of these principles and 
how they relate to our Marketing Services 
business. The Federal District public 
prosecutor filed a class action against 
Serasa Experian, alleging violations to the 
LGPD in failing to obtain consumer consent 

Experian plc Strategic report83

prior to disclosing and using personal data 
for marketing purposes in two specific 
solutions. A final decision has been issued, 
accepting the legitimate interest as a legal 
ground but requiring a high level of 
transparency regarding the use of 
consumers' data. We are no longer providing 
those two marketing solutions.

 a In the UK, the Government has published an 
updated version of the Data Protection and 
Digital Information Bill that now reflects its 
ambitions to tailor the UK’s data protection 
framework to UK needs – in particular to 
encourage economic growth and innovation 
through use of data in balance with privacy 
protection. The Government aims for the Bill 
to be passed this year. The UK Financial 
Conduct Authority (FCA) has published an 
interim report as part of their Market Study 
into the Credit Information sector. The report 
proposes improvements to how data 
sharing is governed and how good 
outcomes are achieved for consumers in 
the use of credit data. Experian remains 
engaged with the FCA and will consult 
further as appropriate. The FCA’s new 
Consumer Duty rules must be implemented 
by July 2023. These will require firms to act 
to deliver good outcomes, including fair 
value for consumers, where it has material 
influence on those outcomes. We have a 
defined implementation plan and 
programme to meet the timelines. We have 
continued to see close supervision by the 
FCA around compliance with their rules 
and principles, particularly relating to the 
importance of the role of credit reference 
agencies to the financial services industry 
and responsibilities to those whose data is 
held on our bureaux. Their focus continues 
to be on financial liquidity, operational 
resilience, cyber and operational risk.

 a In the UK, in February 2023, Experian’s 

appeal to the First Tier Tribunal against the 
Information Commissioner's Office (ICO) 
Enforcement Notice from 2018 was 
substantially successful. The Tribunal set 
aside the eight requirements from the ICO’s 
Enforcement Notice. It issued a substitute 
enforcement notice which contained the 
requirement that if Experian continues to 
use data from certain public data sources, 
it must notify those whose data has been 
received only from those public data 
sources of its data processing. In line with 
its public statements, the ICO is appealing 
the decision and we expect the hearing of 
that appeal to take place in the latter part of 
2023. The substitute enforcement notice is 
stayed pending the outcome of the appeal.

 a In the EU, the European Commission 

published its proposal for the Artificial 
Intelligence Regulation. We are actively 
involved through our European industry 

trade body (ACCIS) and through additional 
efforts to shape the development of the 
legislative process to minimise risk to our 
business. There are pending cases in the 
European Union Court of Justice whose 
outcome could have a potential negative 
impact on our business: the case SCHUFA 
Holding and Others (Scoring), C-634/21 
could lead to the need to obtain an 
individual’s validly given consent to create a 
credit score; the cases SCHUFA Holding and 
Others ('Libération de reliquat de dette'), 
C-26/22 and C-64/22 could shorten the data 
retention periods for data collected from 
public registries.

 a In Spain, a ministerial order was issued in 

July 2020 which has the potential to lead to a 
public credit registry. One impact would be 
that banks would not be required to share 
positive data with private bureaux, which in 
turn will limit access to positive data for 
non-bank lenders, thus maintaining their 
market concentration. We launched a 
judicial review against the ministerial order 
in September 2020. The first instance 
judgment for the court upheld the order and 
we launched an appeal to the Supreme 
Court. We expect a decision in 2024.

 a In South Africa, bureaux either require prior 
authorisation or an approved industry Code 
of Conduct to process data under the 
Protection of Personal Information Act 
(POPIA). The industry Code of Conduct has 
been approved and published by the 
Information Regulator. The Government 
announced its exploration of the 
establishment of a static public credit 
register for reporting purposes under the 
National Credit Act (NCA). If the register 
includes all data, there is a risk that the 
static register can be converted into another 
competing bureau in the market.

 a In Australia, the Attorney General’s Office 
released 116 proposals that may form the 
basis of new privacy regulation in Australia. 
Key proposals deal with issues around 
consent which is likely to impact our 
targeting business.

 a In India, the Reserve Bank of India (RBI) has 

announced a draft bill to establish a National 
Financial Information Registry. The RBI has 
long proposed a public credit registry and 
Experian continues to monitor the proposed 
requirements.

Resiliency

Delivery of our products and services depends 
on a number of key IT systems and processes 
that expose our clients, consumers and 
businesses to serious disruption in the event 
of systems or operational failures.

Risk category

Stable

Potential impact
Failure to manage service availability and 
enterprise resiliency and its impact on clients 
and/or consumers within established risk 
tolerance levels could have a materially 
adverse effect on our business, financial 
performance, financial condition and 
reputation. The impact of this risk, if it 
materialised, would typically be felt in the 
short term.

Examples of control mitigation
 a Our operations are designed to avoid 

material and sustained disruption to our 
businesses, clients and consumers.

 a We design applications to be resilient and 

with a balance between longevity, 
sustainability and speed.

 a We maintain a global integrated business 

continuity framework that includes 
industry-appropriate policies, procedures 
and controls for all our systems and related 
processes, as well as ongoing review, 
monitoring and escalation activities.

 a We maintain back-up data centres.

Responsibility
Our corporate and business technology teams, 
assisted by the Business Continuity function, 
are responsible for maintaining appropriate 
primary and back-up infrastructure to 
minimise disruption.

Changes this year
Throughout the year we experienced isolated 
events that tested our plans and processes. 
We continue to closely monitor our 
infrastructure and processes to manage our 
commitments to clients, consumers and 
regulators.

Migrating to the cloud presents an opportunity 
to simplify the scale and complexity of our 
product portfolio and technical estate as 
reduced complexity drives down cost and 
increases reliability. We are adopting a 
strategic 'cloud first' model with consolidated, 
cloud-adjacent co-located data centres. 
This creates strategically configured services, 
organised across regions and availability 
zones, ensuring greater resilience.

In common with many organisations, Experian 
faces a continued threat from ransomware 
and other cyber attacks. We continue to assess 
the potential impact of these threats as the 
nature and sophistication of these attacks 
continually evolves. Our global ransomware 
preparedness and associated response 
includes a number of key initiatives aimed at 
continually improving our existing capability in 
this area.

Risk management and principal risks
continued

Continued uncertainty driven by geopolitical 
volatility is driving focus on supply chain/
operational resiliency. We continue to see 
longer lead times for procurement of 
technology.

A global initiative continues progress to 
maximise business value and maintain 
leadership through accelerated technology 
transformation delivering standardised 
enterprise services and automating 
'Everything as Code' to sustain delivery at 
scale. The benefits of this are to create 
increasingly sophisticated automation and 
monitoring leading to a reduction in the time 
taken to detect and resolve issues.

Business conduct

At Experian, we place the utmost importance 
on operating with honesty, integrity and high 
ethical standards. And we are committed to 
maintaining the highest level of 
professionalism in the conduct of our business.

Potential impact
Failure to conduct our business operations in 
an appropriate manner could adversely affect 
our clients, consumers or counterparties. 
The impact of this risk, if it materialised, would 
typically be felt in the short term.

Examples of control mitigation
 a We enforce our Global Code of Conduct, 
Anti-Corruption Policy, and Gifts and 
Hospitality Policy. If we believe employees 
or suppliers are not following our conduct 
standards, we will investigate thoroughly 
and take disciplinary action where 
appropriate.

 a Experian operates a Confidential Helpline for 
anyone who needs to raise a concern about 
our conduct. This is facilitated by an external 
provider and managed by Global Internal 
Audit.

Responsibility
Our Group Risk and Compliance functions set 
policies and standards, including the Global 
Code of Conduct. All employees are 
accountable for understanding and following 
our policies and conduct standards.

Changes this year
Regulators have continued to put public trust 
and consumer and investor protection at the 
centre of their mission statements and have 
promoted prudent conduct risk management. 

Our periodic employee surveys provide a clear 
understanding of our approach to professional 
and ethical standards as well as ensuring that 
all employees know exactly what’s expected of 
them individually. We continue to see strong 
scores in our conduct questions in these 
surveys and our people continue to attest to 
our Code of Conduct.

We regularly evaluate our policies and related 
procedures to ensure that we stay up to speed 
with external and internal expectations.

Potential impact
Not having the right people could materially 
affect our ability to innovate our products,

Examples of control mitigation
 a In every region, we have ongoing 

programmes for recruitment, personal and 
career development, and talent identification 
and development.

 a As part of our strategy, we conduct periodic 
employee surveys. We track progress on 
our action plans.

 a We offer competitive compensation and 
benefits, and review them regularly.

 a We monitor attrition rates, with a focus on 
individuals designated as high talent or in 
strategically important roles.

Responsibility
Our business units work with the Human 
Resources function to set and implement 
talent management strategies.

Changes this year
We continue to effectively manage our ability to 
attract, develop and retain employee talent. 
The external talent market risk is reducing, 
with considerable reductions in volatility of 
attrition rates and acquisition timelines, 
created previously by heightened activity 
following the COVID-19 pandemic and the large 
technology companies’ hiring activities. As the 
external market volatility has reduced, attrition 
rates in Experian overall and across key skill 
categories have also reduced. 

We continue to be attractive as an employer, 
with clear positioning around our brand and 
culture, along with our approach to diversity, 
equity and inclusion, and have developed a 
reputation as a sought-after organisation to 
work for.

We monitor employee engagement through a 
variety of channels and continue to implement 
the action plans from our periodic surveys. 
In addition to high response rates, our latest 
surveys continue to show strong engagement, 
enablement and leadership scores.

Further information on our people agenda is 
available in our Sustainable business section 
on pages 51-53.

Competition

We operate in dynamic markets such as 
business and consumer credit information, 
decisioning software, fraud, marketing, and 
consumer services. Our competitive landscape 
is still evolving, with traditional players 
reinventing themselves, emerging players 
investing heavily and new entrants making 
commitments in new technologies or 
approaches to our markets. There is a risk that 
we will not respond adequately to such 
disruptions, or that our products and services 
will fail to meet changing client and consumer 
preferences.

Risk category
Strategic

Risk movement
Stable

Potential impact
Price reductions may reduce our margins and 
financial results. Increased competition may 
reduce our market share, harm our ability to 
obtain new clients or retain existing ones, 
affect our ability to recruit talent, and influence 
our investment decisions. We might also be 
unable to support changes in the way our 
businesses and clients use and purchase 
information, affecting our operating results. 
The impact of this risk, if it materialised, would 
typically be felt in the long term.

Examples of control mitigation
 a We continue to research and invest in new 

data sources, analytics, technology, 
capabilities and talent to pursue our 
strategic plan.

 a We continue to develop innovative products 
that use our scale and expertise and allow 
us to deploy capabilities in new and existing 
markets and geographies.

Experian plc Strategic report85

Changes this year
We continue to analyse opportunities and 
threats to our business model and work to 
address such opportunities and threats 
through acquisitions, investments, strategic 
partnerships and new technologies where 
appropriate. 

As we continue to invest significantly in 
acquisitions, the successful delivery of these 
initiatives remains critical for achieving our 
growth ambitions and expected returns. While 
public company valuations have generally 
declined in the year, price discipline remains 
important in assessing privately owned 
businesses. The changing market environment 
continues to inform our investment strategy 
and we remain focused on allocating capital 
to the most important strategic priorities.

During the year we have optimised our core 
diligence and integration processes to bring 
greater risk focus and prioritise key areas for 
management attention.

 a We use rigorous processes to identify and 
select our development investments, so we 
can efficiently and effectively introduce new 
products and solutions to the market.

 a Where appropriate, and available, we make 
acquisitions, minority investments and enter 
into strategic alliances, to acquire new 
capabilities and enter into new markets.

Responsibility
Our Corporate Development and Experian 
Ventures teams, as well as our business units, 
monitor the competitive landscape, to develop 
and implement appropriate actions.

Changes this year
We are proactive in our efforts to evaluate 
competitors and markets, and pursue 
investments and enhancements to our data, 
analytics, technology and capabilities where 
appropriate, available and feasible.

Traditional competitors continue to pursue 
differentiated data assets, adjacent vertical 
expansion, and new geographic markets. In the 
Consumer Services space, other firms have 
become bigger competitors in recent years as 
we have expanded in areas such as digital 
marketplaces and identity protection. We feel 
confident in Experian’s relative position and 
competitive advantages, but the broader 
landscape continues to evolve.

There is a long-term competitive risk to 
consider related to newer entrants building 
information networks based on consumer 
data. While most of them may not be trying to 
build a credit bureau or fraud prevention 
business as such, this is not many degrees 
away from our core business and is being 
closely monitored.

Certain governments and central banks in 
countries where we have credit bureaux are 
collecting loan data from banks, principally 
for systemic risk analysis, though some may 
share individual loan data with lenders, which 
has the potential to compete with some of our 
credit reference data services. The timing and 
whether any government agencies choose 
to go down this route is uncertain. Further 
updates on legal and regulatory developments 
relating to aspects of this risk are included 
above on page 82.

Investment outcomes

We critically evaluate, and may invest in, equity 
investments and other growth opportunities, 
including internal performance improvement 
programmes. To the extent invested, any of 
these may not produce the desired financial or 
operating results.

Potential impact
Failure to successfully implement our key 
business strategies could have a materially 
adverse effect on our ability to achieve our 
growth targets.

Poorly executed business acquisitions or 
partnerships could result in material loss of 
business, increased costs, reduced revenue, 
substantial legal liability, regulatory 
enforcement actions and significant harm 
to our reputation.

The impact of this risk, if it materialised, would 
typically be felt in the long term.

Viability and going concern

Viability
The Group has continued to demonstrate its 
resilient business model and diverse strategy, 
both of which are described earlier in the 
Strategic report. They exemplify our 
underlying purpose to create a better 
tomorrow, how we create value for our 
stakeholders and communities, and how our 
data and analytics are helping address the 
changing needs of consumers and businesses. 
Our strategy has enabled our business to grow 
and achieve consistently good financial results 
over the past decade, despite changes in the 
economic cycle.

Our viability assessment focuses on the 
expected future solvency of the Group in the 
face of the more severe, but plausible, 
unexpected events. We use the liquidity 
modelling from the going concern assessment 
as a base, and layer on the effects of downside 
scenarios to assess the magnitude and 
practicality of measures we could take to 
continue trading in the face of such events. 
We are not expecting the current economic 
environment, under any plausible 
circumstances, to develop into a scenario 
that could threaten our viability.

We consider current-year business 
performance and our future prospects by 
conducting a regular cycle of strategic 
planning, budgeting and forecasting. These 
processes appraise revenue, Benchmark EBIT, 
cash flows, dividend cover, committed and 
forecast funding, liquidity positions and other 
key financial ratios, including those relevant 
to maintaining our investment-grade credit 
ratings.

Time horizons affecting prospects

Solvency
The Group had:

 a at 31 March 2023, undrawn committed bank 
borrowing facilities of US$2.4bn, which have 
an average remaining tenor of three years 
(2022: three years);

 a only one borrowing facility covenant, 

requiring Benchmark EBIT to exceed three 
times net interest expense before financing 
fair value remeasurements (as at 31 March 
2023 our cover is 15 times); and

 a Benchmark operating cash inflows of 

US$1.8bn and Benchmark interest expense 
of US$0.1bn for FY23.

Assessment period
There are a wide variety of time horizons 
relevant to managing our business and some 
of these are highlighted in the chart below. In 
conducting our viability assessment, we have 
focused on a three-year timeline because we 
believe our three-year financial planning 
process provides the strongest basis for 
reviewing the outlook for our business beyond 
the current financial year.

The assessment process
While we assess our prospects throughout 
our planning cycle, we specifically review our 
three-year growth expectations and the 
external environment as part of the annual 
strategic planning process. The Board 
participates in this review, using the January 
strategy meeting as a focal point.

Assessment of viability
The Group continues to be subject to its 
principal risks, which we submit to a rigorous 
process of continuous reassessment (see the 
principal risks section on pages 78 to 85 in the 
Strategic report). We have considered which 
principal risks could have the most significant 
and direct impact on the viability of the Group 
during the three-year period of assessment, 
and they are shown overleaf, with the 
scenarios used to model those risks. 
Climate-related risks and financial impacts 
have also been assessed, but are not 
considered material over the period of 
viability assessment (see the TCFD statement 
on page 56).

Our modelling shows that:

 a under our harshest ‘severe but plausible’ 
scenario (which could cost us around 
US$1.3bn over three years), we would 
comfortably maintain sufficient drawn and 
undrawn borrowing capacity and satisfy all 
borrowing facility covenants;

 a further significant headroom could be made 
available by scaling back capital investment 
or operating expenditure, reducing returns 
to shareholders, or increasing our target 
leverage range; and

 a in all scenarios, our debt covenant would 

be comfortably satisfied.

The results of the scenario testing show that, 
due to our diversified nature – which includes 
significant counter-cyclical protection, the 
resilience of the core business, its substantial 
free cash flows and its strong investment-
grade credit ratings – we would withstand the 
considered scenarios were these to occur 
during the forecast period.

The directors also reviewed and considered 
the outcome of the reverse stress test. This 
demonstrated that only a catastrophic fall in 
cash flows, well beyond that which could 
plausibly occur, would exhaust all headroom 
in the viability model. 

In the event of such a significant scenario 
occurring, management would have a number 
of more severe mitigating cost reduction or 
financing actions, over and above those 
modelled in our base scenario, which could be 
taken to safeguard the viability of the Group 
and provide further additional headroom.

other business lines and other regions. We 
modelled the costs of contacting consumers

regulatory actions, less insurance 
recoveries anticipated. We also 
benchmarked our modelling to market data 
available for costs disclosed by others in 
similar circumstances.

Key assumptions
The directors have made the following key 
assumptions:

 a The Group continues to achieve strong cash 

flow conversion, and maintains its 
investment-grade credit ratings such that 
funding in the form of capital markets debt, 
committed bank borrowing facilities or 
alternatives is available in all plausible 
market conditions to renew debt as it 
matures and to raise new debt, maintaining 
a Net debt/Benchmark EBITDA leverage 
range of 2.0–2.5x, in line with our target 
range.

 a Effective tax rates remain broadly stable 
(before the impact of any changes of 
legislation) over the medium term.

 a In assessing viability, it is assumed that the 
detailed risk management process as 
outlined on page 79 captures all plausible 
risks, and that the mitigating actions are 
implemented on a timely basis and have the 
intended impact.

directors confirm that they have a reasonable 
expectation that the Group will be able to 
continue in operation and meet its liabilities as 
they fall due over the three-year period ending 
31 March 2026. Looking further forward, the 
directors have considered whether they are 
aware of any specific relevant factors beyond 
the three-year horizon that would threaten the 
long-term financial stability of the Group and 
have confirmed that, other than the uncertainty 
surrounding the geopolitical and 
macroeconomic environment, they are not 
aware of any.

as they fall due, and have a reasonable 
expectation that the Group and the Company 
will have adequate resources to continue their 
operational existence, for at least 12 months 
from the date of signing these financial 
statements. The directors therefore consider it 
appropriate to adopt the going concern basis of 
accounting in preparing the financial 
statements. In reaching this conclusion, the 
directors noted the Group’s strong cash 
performance in the year, and its resilience in 
the face of a viability reverse stress test 
scenario.

authorised committee of the Board of directors

Our going concern assessment focuses on 
immediately available sources of liquidity to

perform a review of indicators typical of 
emerging going concern issues, and have 
identified none.

Based on their assessment of prospects and 
viability, and the Board’s rigorous assessment

Chair’s introduction

Good corporate governance is key to promoting 
long-term sustainable success for the benefit 
of all our stakeholders. It is at the heart 
of our business and Board decisions and 
aligns with our culture, values and ethics.

Mike Rogers 
Chair

Chair’s introduction
I am pleased to present, on behalf of the Board, 
the corporate governance statement of the 
Company for the year ended 31 March 2023. 
This report summarises the role and activities 
of the Board, its principal committees and the 
directors in providing effective leadership to 
promote long-term sustainable success for 
Experian’s shareholders, and helping Experian 
contribute to wider society. 

It was very pleasing that the Board was able 
to meet in person this year for all its meetings, 
given the impact of the COVID-19 pandemic in 
recent years. The Board visited our Brazilian 
and UK and Ireland businesses and colleagues, 
and also again spent time with our North 
America business in Costa Mesa, California. 
Board members benefit hugely from these 
visits which, among other things, allow them 
to get a meaningful sense of how the culture 
across the business aligns with Experian’s 
purpose, values and strategy. 

The Board’s collective view of the importance 
of good governance remains unchanged. 
The Board needs to ensure continued good 
oversight of strategy, operations and 
governance, to provide challenge, support 
and guidance to the executive team and the 
business. The Board is also conscious of the 
important role that it plays to ensure that we 

operate at all times in a manner that is 
consistent with the highest corporate 
governance standards. 

Strategy
Strategic oversight and implementation are 
key responsibilities of the Board and were 
reflected during the year through a number of 
activities. The Board spent a number of days 
together reviewing the Group’s FY24 strategy, 
received a mid-year update on strategic 
progress, as well as regular updates from the 
Chief Executive Officer, Chief Financial Officer 
and Chief Operating Officer. The Audit 
Committee, under its new Chair Jonathan 
Howell, reviewed the strategies of the key 
second line of defence risk, cyber security and 
compliance functions, and received regular 
updates from them, as well as dealing with the 
Committee's regular business. Alison Brittain, 
the Senior Independent Director, took over as 
our Remuneration Committee Chair, and spent 
considerable time during the year reviewing 
reward-related matters in the run-up to a 
remuneration policy year. This year was also 
an active one for Board composition and, as 
Chair of the Nomination and Corporate 
Governance Committee, I ensured that there 
was a smooth handover of Committee chair 
responsibilities, and a well-run process to 
appoint and induct new Board members. 

89

Environmental, Social and 
Governance (ESG)
As well as the strategic objectives of the 
business, a critical area that the Board and 
the business have focused on is to ensure 
that Experian maintains and elevates its 
contribution to wider society. Already we have 
made noteworthy progress on our ESG 
performance, including achieving our Social 
Innovation programme target of reaching 100 
million people before the end of FY23, two 
years ahead of target; achieving our target of 
connecting with 100 million people through 
United for Financial Health before the end of 
FY23, one year ahead of target; and expanding 
our People strategy to include an updated 
Diversity, Equity and Inclusion (DEI) strategy. 
Our next steps will include increasing the level 
of planning and assurance we need to have for 
new ESG targets, and clearly demonstrating 
and communicating the breadth of positive 
impact we can have on consumers and 
businesses across the globe.

Board composition
The Board continued to execute its succession 
plans during the year, and a number of Board 
changes were made. Jonathan Howell became 
Chair of the Audit Committee on 1 July 2022, in 
place of Deirdre Mahlan. At the Annual General 
Meeting on 21 July 2022, Deirdre Mahlan, 
George Rose and Kerry Williams left the Board, 
Craig Boundy (our Chief Operating Officer) was 
appointed as a director, and Alison Brittain was 
appointed as our Senior Independent Director 
and Chair of the Remuneration Committee, 
replacing George Rose. All these changes 
had been well planned and considered by 
the Nomination and Corporate Governance 
Committee over a number of meetings. During 
the year we appointed Kathleen DeRose, Louise 
Pentland and Esther Lee as new non-executive 
directors. Kathleen brings financial services 
expertise to the Board, with a focus on 
investment management as well as significant 
FinTech experience, and Louise has significant 
legal and regulatory experience from FinTech, 
technology and digital industries. Esther is very 
well placed, qualified and experienced to 
support Experian with her extensive knowledge 
of consumers and insight into their needs. 
Finally, on 31 January 2023, Dr Ruba Borno 
stepped down from the Board after a successful 
tenure. 

I am pleased to report that the Experian Board 
exceeds the FTSE Women Leaders Review 
targets, with 45% Board female representation, 
and Alison Brittain is Experian’s Senior 
Independent Director. We also exceed the 
Parker Review targets for director ethnicity. 
While this is all positive, the Board will continue 
to oversee the development of an inclusive 
environment, and ensure a diverse pipeline, 
among its many other activities.

Board evaluation 
We conducted an external Board evaluation 
during the year and the overall conclusion was 
that the Board was considered to be one of the 
best boards that Manchester Square Partners 
(MSP) had worked with in recent years. The 
Board had been strong three years previously, 
when MSP conducted the Board review, and 
was now even better, despite the external 
challenges over that time. As a result, there 
were only a small number of recommended 
actions coming out of the MSP evaluation 
report which are outlined later in this report. 
The Board had become more discursive. There 
was alignment around the challenges and 
emerging risks facing the Group and a 
significant improvement in actions around 
talent development and diversity under the 
leadership of the Chief People Officer. In terms 
of current performance, the Board continues to 
function extremely well and in line with 
first-class corporate governance standards. 
Board dynamics remain strong, demonstrating 
the smoothness of the transition from several 
highly regarded and influential directors to 
their successors. 

Conclusion
I hope you find this Corporate governance 
report helpful in understanding the 
governance processes we have in place at 
Experian, and what we have done in terms 
of the recommendations of the UK Corporate 
Governance Code. The Board is well placed 
to provide the strategic oversight and 
stewardship required to ensure that Experian 
continues to deliver long-term sustainable 
success.

The 2023 Annual General Meeting will be 
held on 19 July 2023. Further details will 
be published in the Notice of Annual General 
Meeting, which has been sent or made 
available to shareholders, and is also 
available on the Company’s website,  
www.experianplc.com.

Statement of compliance 
For the year ended 31 March 2023, other than 
for one element of Provision 38 in relation to 
the alignment of pension contribution rates 
in respect of which the Company became 
compliant on 1 January 2023 (as discussed 
below), the Company complied with all the 
provisions of the UK Financial Reporting 
Council’s (FRC’s) Corporate Governance Code 
(as published in July 2018), the UK Financial 
Conduct Authority’s (FCA's) Disclosure 
Guidance and Transparency Rules sourcebook 
sections 7.1 and 7.2 (which set out certain 
mandatory disclosure requirements), the FCA’s 
Listing Rules 9.8.6R, 9.8.7R and 9.8.7AR which 
include the ‘comply or explain’ requirement 
and, on a voluntary basis, the UK Department 
for Business and Trade Directors’ 
Remuneration Reporting Regulations and 
Narrative Reporting Regulations. These 
documents are publicly available as follows: 

 a The Corporate Governance Code can be 

found at www.frc.org.uk. 

 a The FCA’s Disclosure Guidance and 
Transparency Rules sourcebook as 
well as Listing Rules can be found at

Regulations and Narrative Reporting 
Regulations can be found at www.gov.uk. 

In addition, the FRC Guidance on Risk 
Management, Internal Control and Related 
Financial and Business Reporting can be

Provision 38 – as explained in our 2022 Annual 
Report, the Company was in partial compliance 
with Provision 38 of the Corporate Governance 
Code with respect to alignment of pension 
contribution rates of the executive directors 
with the wider workforce for the period to 
1 January 2023. The non-alignment arose 
from the pension contribution rates of our 
two existing UK-based executive directors 
being unaligned with the wider UK workforce. 
This was remedied on 1 January 2023, in line 
with the expected timeframe set out in our 
2022 Annual Report.

Experian plc Governance91

Application of the UK Corporate 
Governance Code 2018 
The FRC promotes high-quality corporate 
governance and reporting through the UK 
Corporate Governance Code (the Code), 
which all companies with a Premium Listing 
on the London Stock Exchange are required 
to either comply with in full, or explain why, 
and to what extent, they do not fully comply 
(‘comply or explain’). This Governance 
section of the Annual Report explains how 
each of the Code principles, as set out below, 
has been applied.

Section 1: Board Leadership and 
Company Purpose 
Principle A: A successful company is led 
by an effective and entrepreneurial board, 
whose role is to promote the long-term 
sustainable success of the company, 
generating value for shareholders and 
contributing to wider society. See pages 92 
to 93. 

Principle B: The board should establish the 
company’s purpose, values and strategy, and 
satisfy itself that these and its culture are 
aligned. All directors must act with integrity, 
lead by example and promote the desired 
culture. See page 100. 

Principle C: The board should ensure that 
the necessary resources are in place for the 
company to meet its objectives and measure 
performance against them. The board 
should also establish a framework of 
prudent and effective controls, which 
enable risk to be assessed and managed. 
See page 102. 

Principle D: In order for the company to 
meet its responsibilities to shareholders and 
stakeholders, the board should ensure 
effective engagement with, and encourage 
participation from, these parties. See pages 
104 to 107. 

Principle E: The board should ensure that 
workforce policies and practices are 
consistent with the company’s values and 
support its long-term sustainable success. 
The workforce should be able to raise any 
matters of concern. See page 107.

Section 2: Division of Responsibilities 
Principle F: The chair leads the board and 
is responsible for its overall effectiveness 
in directing the company. They should 
demonstrate objective judgment throughout 
their tenure and promote a culture of 
openness and debate. In addition, the chair 
facilitates constructive board relations and 
the effective contribution of all non-executive 
directors, and ensures that directors receive 
accurate, timely and clear information. 
See page 103. 

Principle G: The board should include 
an appropriate combination of executive 
and non-executive (and, in particular, 
independent non-executive) directors, 
such that no one individual or small group 
of individuals dominates the board’s 
decision-making. There should be a clear 
division of responsibilities between the 
leadership of the board and the executive 
leadership of the company’s business. 
See page 103. 

Principle H: Non-executive directors should 
have sufficient time to meet their board 
responsibilities. They should provide 
constructive challenge, strategic guidance, 
offer specialist advice and hold management 
to account. See page 107. 

Principle I: The board, supported by the 
company secretary, should ensure that it has 
the policies, processes, information, time 
and resources it needs in order to function 
effectively and efficiently. See pages 103 
and 107. 

Section 3: Composition, Succession 
and Evaluation 
Principle J: Appointments to the board 
should be subject to a formal, rigorous and 
transparent procedure, and an effective 
succession plan should be maintained for 
board and senior management. Both 
appointments and succession plans should 
be based on merit and objective criteria and, 
within this context, should promote diversity 
of gender, social and ethnic backgrounds, 
cognitive and personal strengths. 
See pages 110 and 111. 

Principle K: The board and its committees 
should have a combination of skills, 
experience and knowledge. Consideration 
should be given to the length of service of 
the board as a whole and membership 
regularly refreshed. See pages 94 to 96.

Principle L: Annual evaluation of the board 
should consider its composition, diversity 
and how effectively members work together 
to achieve objectives. Individual evaluation 
should demonstrate whether each director 
continues to contribute effectively. See 
pages 111 and 112. 

Section 4: Audit, Risk and Internal 
Control 
Principle M: The board should establish 
formal and transparent policies and 
procedures to ensure the independence and 
effectiveness of internal and external audit 
functions and satisfy itself on the integrity 
of financial and narrative statements. 
See pages 117 to 119. 

Principle N: The board should present a fair, 
balanced and understandable assessment 
of the company’s position and prospects. 
See page 116. 

Principle O: The board should establish 
procedures to manage risk, oversee the 
internal control framework, and determine 
the nature and extent of the principal risks 
the company is willing to take in order to 
achieve its long-term strategic objectives. 
See pages 119 to 120 and the Risk section of 
the Strategic report.

Section 5: Remuneration 
Principle P: Remuneration policies and 
practices should be designed to support 
strategy and promote long-term sustainable 
success. Executive remuneration should be 
aligned to company purpose and values, and 
be clearly linked to the successful delivery 
of the company’s long-term strategy. 
See page 126. 

Principle Q: A formal and transparent 
procedure for developing policy on executive 
remuneration and determining director and 
senior management remuneration should be 
established. No director should be involved 
in deciding their own remuneration outcome. 
See pages 121 to 123 and 138. 

Principle R: Directors should exercise 
independent judgment and discretion 
when authorising remuneration outcomes, 
taking account of company and individual 
performance, and wider circumstances. 
See page 123.

Corporate governance at a glance
The composition of the Board is subject to 
ongoing review, with considerations including 
diversity and maintaining the correct balance 
of skills, experience, knowledge and tenure. 
All appointments result from a formal and 
rigorous search, responsibility for which is 
delegated to the Nomination and Corporate 
Governance Committee. It is recognised that 
a diverse Board with a range of views, insights, 
perspectives, and opinions enhances Board 
decision-making and effectiveness. The Board 
is satisfied that its current composition 
exhibits a diverse mix of skills, professional 
and industry backgrounds, geographical 
experience and expertise, gender, age, tenure 
and ethnicity. 

Board and senior management diversity
Diversity and inclusion are embedded within 
our culture. The Board remains committed 
to having an inclusive culture that recognises 
the importance of gender, social and ethnic 
diversity, and the benefits gained from 
different perspectives.

This section outlines the key diversity and 
inclusion metrics for Board members and 
executive management (as at 31 March 2023, 
being the chosen reference date within this 
accounting period, as required by the Listing 
Rules LR 9.8.6(9)–(11)). This section also 
includes details of tenure, age, skills and 
experience.

Gender and ethnic diversity
The FCA, in its capacity as the UK Listing 
Authority, introduced new rules during 2022 
that require listed companies to publish 
information on female and ethnic representation 
on the Board and in senior management. This 
year is our first year to report on these new 
requirements. The tables opposite outline the 
current gender and ethnic diversity of the 
Board and executive management.

Non-executive directors’ key skills and 
experience
The Board recognises the relationship 
between the delivery of the Company strategy 
and objectives and the skills needed on the 
Board now and in the future. The mix of key 
skills, experience and knowledge of the 
non-executive directors set out opposite 
provides insight for the Board and the 
Nomination and Corporate Governance 
Committee to ensure the Board and its 
committees are optimally composed to 
maximise their effectiveness.

Role of the directors 
The Board provides entrepreneurial leadership 
and sets the Company’s purpose, strategy and 
values, ensuring these are aligned with our 
culture. It is responsible for monitoring 
progress against Experian’s strategic 
objectives, approving proposed actions and 
ensuring that the necessary resources are 
available for long-term sustainable success, to 
generate value for shareholders and contribute 
to wider society. The Board is supported by its 
committees, the executive directors, key 
operating subsidiaries and the Group 
Operating Committee, while retaining exclusive 
control and oversight over the decisions set out 
in the Schedule of Matters Reserved for the 
Board.

In addition, the Board has reserved decisions 
about certain key activities to itself, including:

A. Strategy and management – approval and 
oversight of Experian’s long-term objectives 
and commercial (and ESG) strategy, approval 
of annual operating and capital expenditure 
budgets, and oversight and monitoring of 
operations. 

B. Structure and capital/Financial reporting 
and controls/Risk management – changes in 
the Group capital or corporate structure. 
Approval of the Group’s results, dividends, 
dividend policy, significant changes in 
accounting policy, tax policy and treasury 
policy. 

C. Contracts – approval of major or strategic 
capital projects, and of major acquisitions, 
disposals and investments. 

D. Communication – approval of key 
stakeholder documents, circulars, 
prospectuses, and reviewing investor 
sentiment. 

E. Board membership/Delegation of 
authority/Corporate governance/Policies 
– approval of changes to Board composition, 
ensuring adequate succession planning, 
reviewing reports from Board committees, 
reviewing governance arrangements, and 
approval of various policies. 

Details of the activities of the Board during the 
year under these headings are on page 99. 

A high-level statement of the types of decisions 
that have been delegated by the Board is 
shown in the Governance framework diagram 
on page 102. 

The strategic framework considered by the 
Board includes details of the foundations that 
allow us to deliver our growth aspirations, 
for example embedding a high-performance 
culture, ensuring sustainability through strong 
client relationships and reinvestment following 
productivity improvements. The Board also 
reviews strategy and major initiatives 
throughout the year (as indicated on the 
Strategic and budget planning process chart). 

The budget discussions in March are focused 
on ensuring that we have the right resources 
to deliver the agreed strategy. These 
discussions include detailed focus on both 
regional and global business budgets. The 
Board continually monitors management and 
financial performance against the Group’s 
objectives. To enable it to do this the Board 
receives updates, at every scheduled Board 
meeting, on operational and financial matters 
as well as any major initiatives underway. The 
Board also receives relevant between-meeting 
updates, to allow for appropriate oversight 
and monitoring. The Board conducts post- 
investment reviews on an agreed timeline, for 
any acquisitions it has previously approved.

You can read about the Board’s procedures 
to manage risk, oversee the internal control 
framework, and determine the nature and 
extent of the principal risks the Company 
is willing to take to achieve its strategic 
objectives, in the Risk management and 
internal control systems section on pages 119 
and 120. 

The Board delegates management of the 
Group’s day-to-day activities but is accountable 
to shareholders for delivering financial 
performance and long-term shareholder 
value. To achieve this, the Board has put in 
place a framework of controls, including 
clear and robust procedures and delegated 
authorities, which enables the Group to 
appraise and manage risk effectively. This 
framework is illustrated in the Governance 
framework diagram on page 102. 

The Board sets the Group’s strategy, and in 
January 2023 reviewed the proposed strategic 
plan presented by senior management. Our 
high-level strategy is unchanged from that 
which we set out in January 2022 (and in 
previous years): front and centre is the 
purpose that Experian was built on – being 
a force for financial wellbeing and inclusion 
that brings financial power to all is central 
to our brand, articulated by our people and 
mutually reinforced by our culture. Across 
the organisation, our people take pride in the 
positive impacts we have across the markets 
and societies in which we operate. The core 
of our strategy remains having the deepest, 
broadest and most unique datasets available 
in our markets. Over the past decade, we have 
invested strongly in our people and the 
organisation, creating a unique foundation for 
future growth. We have redefined Experian in 
the eyes of many stakeholders, while entering 
new spaces and stretching the boundaries of 
our ambition. As always, there is more to do to 
strengthen the business and realise our vision. 
The growth opportunities for Experian remain 
large and we believe we are well positioned for 
the future. 

This year, the strategy presentations took 
place, face-to-face, over two days at our North 
America operational headquarters in Costa 
Mesa, California, with senior leaders from 
across the Experian business. This time allows 
the Board to critically assess the proposed 
strategy with management, before considering 
it for approval. This year’s presentations 
included regional and business updates. The 
business strategic updates included the newly 
formed Experian Software Solutions (ESS) 
business. Regional strategic updates included 
the EMEA and Asia Pacific transformation 
journey, and North America, including a deep- 
dive into various business units.

In March 2023, the Chief Technology Officer 
presented the Board with a review of the 
technology strategy. The Board also received 
and discussed an ESG strategy update with 
the Chief Sustainability Officer. The update 
included details of how we are operationalising 
our ESG strategy: continuing to drive progress 
across the breadth of ESG, ensuring we have 
robust execution plans to achieve our existing 
commitments, while considering where 
additional commitments may be needed. In 
July 2022, the Board travelled to the UK and 
visited our UK and Ireland operational 
headquarters and reviewed the regional 
strategy with management. In September 
2022, the Board spent time in São Paulo, Brazil, 
where they reviewed the Latin America 
strategy.

Board meetings 
The Board meets sufficiently regularly to 
discharge its duties, and holds additional 
meetings when required, for example for a 
specific transaction. Each scheduled meeting 
is normally held over two or three days, with 
Board committee meetings also taking place 
during this time. Spending this time together 
further enhances the effectiveness of the 

Board and its committees and contributes 
to the cohesive and collegiate Board culture. 
The Board met overseas twice this year, 
which allowed management and employees 
to present to it and to meet the directors 
informally. In September 2022, the Board spent 
three days in São Paulo, Brazil, and held Board 
and committee meetings during the visit and 
reviewed the Latin America strategy. The 

Board spent time at our North America 
operational headquarters in Costa Mesa, 
California, USA, in January 2023. In July 2022, 
the Board also travelled to the UK and visited 
our UK and Ireland operational headquarters 
in Nottingham, and reviewed the regional 
strategy with management before holding 
Board and committee meetings in Dublin, 
Ireland.

Culture
The UK Corporate Governance Code 
emphasises the importance of the role of 
the Board regarding culture, with specific 
recommendations that the Board assesses 
and monitors culture, and ensures that 
workforce policies, practices and behaviours 
are aligned with the Company’s purpose, 
values and strategy. We are confident that the 
information the Board and its committees 
review, the activities that Board members 
engage in, and Experian’s existing structures 
and processes, mean that Experian and the 
Board are meeting the recommendations 
of the Code. 

One of the primary ways the Board can 
experience, assess and evaluate culture 
is through meeting with colleagues in the 
business. This year, we were able to achieve 
this with the Board meeting senior regional 
leaders and employees in Nottingham, UK, 
São Paulo, Brazil and Costa Mesa, USA. 
As well as this, the Board continued to engage 
with employees as much as possible during 
the year: for example, all Group Operating 
Committee members attended the strategy 
presentations with the Board in January 2023, 
and the Board received a number of updates 
from management during the year.

As part of their induction programmes, 
Kathleen DeRose and Louise Pentland visited 
the Experian DataLab in the USA. Alison 
Brittain, our Remuneration Committee Chair, 
met in person with the Experian People Forum 
in Nottingham, UK in March 2023. In addition, 
to celebrate International Women’s Day 2023, 
employees were invited to join Brian Cassin 
and Jennifer Schulz (Chief Executive Officer, 
North America) for an interactive webcast 
discussion with Kathleen DeRose and Louise 

Kathleen DeRose and Louise Pentland visited the Experian DataLab in the USA.

Pentland, two of our non-executive directors, 
to hear their stories. Employees were also 
given the opportunity to mark International 
Women’s Day by being asked to nominate 
women who had been an inspiration, 
supportive, had excelled in their achievements 
or had gone above and beyond. Management 
encourages all employees to challenge gender 
stereotypes, call out discrimination, draw 
attention to bias, and seek out inclusion. 

Each year at its September and March 
meetings, the Audit Committee reviews calls 
made to the Confidential Helpline. All calls 
are investigated by Global Internal Audit, 
in conjunction with HR or Compliance, as 
appropriate. As the business has moved to 
a hybrid model of working, communications 
have been reviewed and refreshed to ensure 

sufficient awareness of the Confidential 
Helpline. This includes notifications in different 
languages, inclusion in email newsletters, 
computer lock screens, and email and intranet 
reminders.

In addition to the above, Experian and the 
Board promote a positive and supportive 
culture in other ways, including: 

 a Turkey and Syria were hit particularly hard 
with a devastating earthquake in February 
2023. Experian has employees who are 
from that region and who have relatives 
and friends that were impacted. Our top 
priority was the safety and health of our 
employees as well as their loved ones 
and we monitored the situation closely. 
The Experian Cares Fund (which provides 
financial assistance) is available for 
employees or their immediate family, should 
they have been affected by a traumatic life 
event, such as a natural disaster, accident, 
domestic abuse, illness or other unforeseen 
circumstances. Ahbap, a well-known local 
NGO, supported people affected by the 
earthquake in accessing first aid, shelter, 
and essential products and rebuilding 
their homes. Experian made a corporate 
donation and was able to facilitate and 
match employees’ donations directly to 
Ahbap via Benevity, our online giving portal.

Additional ways that the Board monitors and assesses culture

Who
The Board

What
 a The Chief Executive Officer’s report, circulated before every scheduled Board meeting, contains a detailed People update, 

Board members

which includes culture, and an ESG update. 

 a The Board regularly considers the results of people sentiment and pulse surveys.
 a Board meetings in FY23 in São Paulo, Brazil and Costa Mesa, California enabled the Board to engage with employees and 
senior regional management. The Board also spent time with our UK and Ireland business and colleagues in July 2022.

 a Visiting Group business locations enables the Board to spend time with employees of varying seniority and assess 

culture in a local context. All Board meetings during the year were held in person, and these allowed the Board to engage 
with the business.

 a Two of our new non-executive directors, Kathleen DeRose and Louise Pentland, spent time at the DataLab in San Diego, 

California as part of their induction programme in January 2023. 

Audit Committee

 a The Committee’s oversight of interactions with government and regulators, and the perspective provided by Global

Governance Committee

Internal Audit, can give an indication of culture. The Committee and the Board receive relevant updates at every meeting, 
and management is transparent and responsive to challenge.

 a Twice a year, the Committee reviews calls made to the Confidential Helpline.
 a The Committee reviews an ‘Overview of employee pay and related policies’ paper, designed to provide an overview of pay 
structures at Experian and their alignment with our purpose, values and strategy. This allows the Committee to ensure 
that relevant policies and practices are consistent with Experian’s values. 

 a The Committee Chair met with the UK and Ireland Experian People Forum in March 2023, and feedback was provided to 
the Board. The key points/topics from the update included employee feedback on how the Company had addressed the 
issue of cost-of-living support and broader reflections on culture in Experian. 

 a The Committee reviews our UK gender pay gap disclosures every year, on behalf of the Board.
 a In January 2023, the Committee considered the annual People Strategy, Talent and Culture update from the Chief People 
Officer, which included details of global people strategy progress, talent and leadership, culture and the employee value 
proposition, and the priorities for FY24. 

 a The Committee also received a DEI update from the Chief People Officer and Global Chief DEI Officer which included 

details on DEI progress, diversity in senior leader hires and an update on the three-year strategy.

Governance framework

Global Delegated Authorities Matrix
This key Group governance document 
comprises the schedule of matters reserved to 
the Board, the Board committees’ terms of 
reference and the authority levels for the 

Group’s principal subsidiaries, directors and 
senior executives. For matters not reserved to 
the Board, the matrix prescribes the cascade 
of authorities delegated throughout the Group 
by respective Group companies, together with 

their monetary limits. The Board monitors the 
exercise of delegations to the Group’s principal 
subsidiaries, which are reported to it at each 
Board meeting. Regional matrices are also in 
place.

Delegated authority flow

Board

See Board of 
directors  
on pages 92 
to 93

Principal subsidiaries 
These are Group companies to which the Board has delegated 
certain decision-making powers, for example: implementing 
decisions agreed in principle by the Board; executive 
management of the operations of the Group within the strategy 
and budget approved by the Board; acquisitions and disposals 
with a value up to US$50m; and capital expenditure projects.

Group Operating Committee (OpCo) 

The OpCo comprises the most senior executives from the Group. Its remit includes identifying, debating and achieving 
consensus on issues involving strategy, growth, people and culture, and operational efficiency. It also focuses on 
ensuring strong communication and co-operative working relationships among the top team. Its meetings tend to be 
issues oriented and focus on selected Group issues worthy of debate.

Risk management committees (executive and regional) 

 a Executive Risk Management Committee (ERMC) comprises senior Group executives, including the executive 
directors and the Company Secretary. Its primary responsibility is to oversee the management of global risks. 
The regional risk management committees oversee the management of regional risks, consistent with Experian’s 
risk appetite, strategies and objectives, and are comprised of senior regional leaders. 

Remuneration Committee
See report on  
page 121

 a Security and Continuity Steering Committee (SCSC) is a sub-committee of the ERMC. The SCSC’s primary 

responsibility is to oversee management of global information security, physical security, and business continuity 
risks, consistent with Experian’s risk appetite, strategies and objectives.

Tax and Treasury Committee (TTC)

This committee comprises senior executives with financial and tax expertise, and includes the Chief Financial Officer. 
The TTC oversees the management of financial risk, including tax, liquidity, funding, market and currency risks. 

Environmental, Social and Governance (ESG) Steering Committee

The dedicated ESG committee comprises senior executives from a wide range of areas throughout the Group, and is 
chaired by the Chief Financial Officer. The purpose and primary duty of the ESG Steering Committee is to support the 
definition, approval and integrated delivery of the Group’s ESG strategy.

Strategic project committees (global and regional)

These committees comprise the most senior global and regional executives. Their remit is to oversee a process to 
ensure that all strategic projects are appropriately resourced, risk assessed and commercially, financially and 
technically appraised. A similar body, the Investment Committee, performs the same function in respect of proposals 
regarding minority investments. Depending on the outcome of the discussions, the committees’ conclusions are then 
considered by the board of the relevant Group company for approval.

Global Internal Audit (GIA)

GIA conducts a range of independent audit reviews throughout the Group during the year and is represented at each 
Audit Committee meeting. GIA’s plans, results and key findings are presented to, and discussed with, the Audit 
Committee. The internal audit programme and methodology are aligned to the risk categories and risk assessment 
parameters established by Global Risk Management. GIA also makes use of risk assessment information at a business 
level, in planning and conducting its audits.

Private shareholders – The Company 
Secretary, Charles Brown, oversees 
communication with private shareholders, and 
ensures direct responses as appropriate in 
respect of any matters raised by shareholders. 
The Company issues a ‘Shareholder Questions’ 
card each year, together with the AGM 
documentation. The Company responded to 
shareholders directly, as appropriate, following 
the 2022 AGM. 

Investor relations app – This contains 
information about our financial performance, 
together with reports, presentations and news 
of upcoming events. 

Website – Our website is an important channel 
for communicating with all stakeholders, 
including shareholders. All material 
information reported to the regulatory news 
services is published at www.experianplc.
com/investors/regulatory-news, together 
with copies of full-year and half-year results 
announcements and trading updates.

Shareholder and stakeholder 
engagement 
The UK Corporate Governance Code 
encourages boards to have a clear 
understanding of the views of shareholders. 
Companies are also encouraged to seek 
regular engagement with major shareholders 
in order to understand their views.

In addition, the Code states that the Board 
should understand the views of the Company’s 
other key stakeholders and describe how their 
interests have been considered in discussions 
and decision-making. Details regarding key 
stakeholders are on page 105. 

Shareholders
We are committed to open and regular 
communication and engagement with 
shareholders at any time of the year, and our 
communications with shareholders (and proxy 
advisory bodies) will always offer invitations 
to meet with the Chair or any of the Board 
Committee chairs. 

Board – Investor relations, and external 
communications and media, reports are 
circulated before every Board meeting. 
The investor relations report contains a 
commentary on key events in Experian’s 
main markets, share price performance, 
market movements, investor feedback from 
management/analyst meetings, broker and 
analyst forecasts and recommendations, 
investor relations activities (including ESG), 
and shareholder analysis. The external 
communications and media update provides 
details of the focus of external communication 
activities, which has included innovation, 
financial health, data security and integrity, 
and people. The Chief Communications Officer 
provides regular updates at Board meetings. 

Engagement with investors – The Chair of the 
Remuneration Committee wrote to our major 
shareholders and the main UK and US proxy 
advisory bodies in November 2022 and again 
in February 2023. She outlined the changes 
made to the Remuneration Policy since 2017 
and our continued commitment to employee 
support. The Board Chair also made himself 
available to meet with shareholders during the 
year, and met with shareholders to discuss 
governance, strategy and risk oversight. 

Investors and analysts – The executive team 
runs an ongoing programme of dialogue with 
institutional investors and analysts, through 
which they discuss a wide range of issues 
including strategy, performance, management 
and governance. Experian also engages with 
investors through industry conferences and 
by hosting events with members of the senior 
management team. The announcements of 
the full-year and half-year results and trading 
updates provide opportunities for us to answer 
questions from analysts, covering a wide 
range of topics. This year, executive 
management attended conferences and 
investor meetings virtually and in person 
(Scotland and London). 

Annual General Meeting – The AGM provides 
a valuable opportunity for the Board to 
communicate with shareholders. The majority 
of directors attended the 2022 AGM, including 
the Audit, Remuneration, and Nomination and 
Corporate Governance Committee chairs. 
The 2023 AGM will take place on Wednesday 
19 July 2023 in Dublin, Ireland. Shareholders 
are encouraged to use proxy voting on the 
resolutions put forward, all of which (except 
for procedural resolutions) are taken by a poll. 
In 2022, voting levels at the AGM were 75.89% 
of the Company’s issued share capital.

Board visits to various business sites

Workforce engagement
The UK Corporate Governance Code requires 
companies to select one or a combination of 
prescribed methods for the Board to engage 
with the workforce. If a particular method is 
not appropriate for a company, it may explain 
the alternative arrangements in place and why 
these are considered effective. The Board has 
always felt well informed about workforce 
views and matters, including in relation to 
pay and related policy arrangements for the 
broader employee population. As a result, 
no single approach recommended in the Code 
was considered appropriate for our business. 
The Board instead adopted a combination 
of methods to comply with the Code’s 
requirements. These are summarised below, 
and include:

 a There are regular people and sentiment 

survey updates to the Board, and reporting 
at every scheduled Board meeting on people 
matters. People, talent and culture updates 
are also provided to the Nomination and 
Corporate Governance Committee, offering 
a valuable insight into workforce matters. 

 a Any relevant business cases reviewed by 

the Board include an evaluation of potential 
impacts of the transaction on the Group’s 
stakeholders, including employees. 

 a The Remuneration Committee annually 
considers an extensive paper setting out 
details of all-employee pay and workforce 
policies across Experian. The discussions 
on this topic provide helpful insights for 
framing pay considerations. 

 a The Remuneration Committee Chair 

annually attends a meeting of the UK and 
Ireland Experian People Forum (see Our 
people, in the table on page 105), providing 
the opportunity to gain first-hand feedback 
in two-way discussions with the workforce, 
which is invaluable. The employee insights 
and views gathered are shared with the full 
Board, allowing the Board to hear directly 
from the wider workforce. 

 a The Board meets with employees in person 
outside the Boardroom environment during 
the year. 

In coming to this approach, the Board is 
satisfied that the approach is appropriate for 
Experian and that the Board keeps workforce 
considerations to the fore in its deliberations. 

Considering our stakeholders in our 
decision-making 
The Code also recommends that the Board 
should describe how stakeholder interests 
have been considered in Board discussions 
and decision-making. We have processes in 
place to capture and consider stakeholders’ 
views (including the matters contained in 
Section 172 of the UK Companies Act 2006, on 
a voluntary basis) and feed them into Board 
decision-making. 

All material business cases considered in the 
Group (for example, mergers, acquisitions and 
major capital investments) include an analysis 
of the stakeholder considerations, anticipated 
impact and mitigations. This process helps the 
Board to perform the duties outlined in Section 
172 of the UK Companies Act 2006 and 

provides assurance to the Board that 
potential impacts on stakeholders have been 
considered in the development of the proposal. 
The impact on stakeholders, their views and 
their feedback are collectively at the heart 
of Board discussions and actions. The Board 
will continue to enhance ways to ensure that 
stakeholders are given consideration as part 
of the Board’s decision-making. 

An example of how this process works in 
practice is outlined below, where Board 
consideration of a strategic acquisition 
included a review of the standing stakeholder 
impact analysis.

In June 2020, Experian acquired 60% of the 
Arvato Financial Solutions Risk Management 
Division from Arvato Financial Solutions (AFS), 
creating the Experian DACH Joint Venture. 
In November 2022, the Board reviewed, 
considered and approved the early buyout of 
AFS’s 40% stake ahead of the pre-determined 
option date. Experian DACH is one of the 
leading bureaux in Germany, a vertical leader 
in the insurance, financial services, 
telecommunications, e-commerce and 
payments verticals. The bureau’s competitive 
advantage comes from the exclusive operation 
of an insurance claims data pool, while 
negative data is sourced from suppliers, 
including exclusive supply from AFS’s German 
Debt Collection Agency (DCA) which is the 
second largest in the market.

Independence 
As required by the Code, the Board considers 
each of the non-executive directors to be 
independent in character and judgment and 
believes there are no relationships or 
circumstances that are likely to affect (or could 
appear to affect) each director’s judgment.

Conflicts of interest, and external 
appointments 
The Company’s articles of association allow 
the Board to authorise actual or potential 
conflicts of interest. The authorisation 
procedure involves Group Corporate 
Secretariat issuing guidance and a 
questionnaire each August, asking directors 
to identify any conflicts or potential conflicts, 
which the Board then considers at its 
September meeting. In addition, directors are 
expected to advise the Company Secretary of 
any actual or potential conflicts as soon as they 
arise so the Board can consider them at the 
next available opportunity. In the Board’s view, 
this procedure operated effectively during 
the year under review. The Board also has a 
process in place whereby directors’ proposed 
external or additional appointments are 
reviewed and considered for approval by 
the Board.

In terms of the ability to raise matters of 
concern, Experian is committed to achieving 
the highest possible standards of quality, 
honesty, openness and accountability, and 
there is an expectation that employees 
maintain high standards in accordance with 
the Global Code of Conduct. There is also a 
culture of openness and accountability, and all 
employees are encouraged to raise any 
concerns about the way in which the business 
is run at an early stage so that any concerns 
can be dealt with effectively. A confidential 
helpline, facilitated by an external provider, is 
available for employees who wish to raise any 
concerns. Calls to the Confidential Helpline, 
and any actions required, are reviewed by the 
Audit Committee at least every six months. 

Non-executive director appointment 
Non-executive directors are initially appointed 
for three years. This may, subject to 
satisfactory performance and election or 
re-election by the shareholders, be extended 
by mutual agreement. They normally serve 
for a maximum of nine years, through three 
terms, each of three years’ duration. 

Meetings of non-executive directors 
In addition to attending Board and committee 
meetings, the non-executive directors 
normally meet separately with the Chair, and 
often also with the Chief Executive Officer, 
at the end of each scheduled Board meeting. 
The non-executive directors also meet 
privately at least once a year with the Senior 
Independent Director, without the Chair 
present, and did so once during the year 
to discuss matters including the Chair’s 
performance. 

Board information 
All directors receive financial and operational 
information each month to help them 
discharge their duties. Board papers are 
circulated digitally at least one week before 
each Board meeting, to ensure directors have 
time to review them. Directors have access 
to independent professional advice at the 
Company’s expense, if they consider it 
appropriate. No director obtained any such 
advice during the year ended 31 March 2023. 

A briefing paper was circulated to the Board 
ahead of its November 2022 meeting, outlining 
the strategic rationale for the transaction, as 
well as the financial evaluation and deal 
structure. The Group’s Chief Investment Officer 
attended the meeting and presented, with the 
Chief Executive Officer, the business case to 
the Board. At the EMEA/Asia Pacific regional 
level, and as part of the FY24 Strategic plan 
preparation, we considered how we might 
position Experian DACH as a platform for 
growth. In considering the acquisition, the 
Board reviewed the stakeholder impact 
analysis which had been prepared (and which 
is prepared for all acquisition business cases). 
The analysis identified the following 
stakeholder impacts and actions/mitigations: 

 a Full Experian ownership would result in 

stronger cultural alignment and certainty 
over identity. As part of a Value Creation 
Plan to drive growth for the business 
under our full ownership, employees 
would continue to be treated fairly and 
in accordance with the relevant laws 
and conditions applicable.

 a Customers and suppliers were expected 
to react positively, having access to the 
breadth of Experian’s global products 
and data services.

 a There was no material community or 
environmental impact anticipated. 

 a The full acquisition was expected to have 
a meaningfully positive long-term impact 
on the stakeholders.

Workforce policies and practices 
The Board is expected to ensure that: 
workforce policies and practices are 
consistent with the Company’s values; that 
they support its long-term sustainable 
success; and that the workforce can raise 
any matters of concern. An example of the 
alignment of policies and practices is how 
the Group manages anti-bribery and 
anti-corruption.

A strong compliance culture at the heart of our 
strategy helps ensure that we comply both 
with the laws that apply to our business and 
with our Global Code of Conduct. The Board 
sets the tone and leads by example and is 
one of the most important influences on the 
Company’s commitment to preventing bribery 
and corruption. 

Our Anti-Corruption Framework sets out 
our zero-tolerance policy on bribery and 
corruption in any form, and this message is 
reinforced through mandatory annual training 
for employees. We also extend this framework 
to our third-party network and business 
partners, which helps to instil our values 
in every aspect of our business.

Composition and experience
 a Mike Rogers has chaired the Committee 

since July 2019.

 a The Board considers the Committee 

members to be independent 
non-executive directors, in line with the 
UK Corporate Governance Code. 

 a The Committee met six times during the 

year ended 31 March 2023. 

 a The Chief People Officer, the Chief 

Communications Officer and the Global 
Chief Diversity, Equity and Inclusion 
Officer were invited to attend certain 
meetings. 

 a The Chief Executive Officer was also 
invited to attend all meetings and 
provided valuable input to the 
discussions.

The Committee has maintained its focus on the 
executive talent pipeline and senior 
management succession plans, reflecting the 
Board’s responsibility to ensure appropriate 
plans are in place. A succession planning 
update was provided at a number of 
Committee meetings. Included in the updates 
were reviews of executive management 
succession coverage. The Committee valued 
receiving these analyses of the Experian talent 
development structure, and how it influences 
Experian’s culture.

During the year, on the recommendation of the 
Committee, we welcomed Craig Boundy, 
Kathleen DeRose, Louise Pentland and Esther 
Lee as new directors, and Kerry Williams, 
Deirdre Mahlan, George Rose and Dr Ruba 
Borno stepped down as directors. Craig 
replaced Kerry as an executive director of the 
Company in July 2022 (having taken over as 
Chief Operating Officer on 1 April 2022). Craig 
had successfully led Experian's North America 
region for seven years, having joined Experian 
in November 2011 to lead the UK and Ireland 
region, and has operated in a variety of leading 
management positions. Kathleen and Louise 
were appointed to the Board on 1 November 
2022, as independent non-executive directors. 
As well as bringing significant FinTech 
experience to the Experian Board, Kathleen 
brings financial services expertise with a focus 
on investment management. Louise brings 
significant legal and regulatory experience 
from FinTech, technology and digital industries. 
Esther joined the Board on 31 March 2023 as 
an independent non-executive director, and 
she is very well placed, qualified and 
experienced to support Experian with her 
extensive knowledge of consumers and 
insights into their needs. Each new 
appointment brings a wealth of experience 
from a wide range of international businesses 
and has a great deal to offer Experian. They 
have considerable executive and non-executive 
listed boardroom experience, which will 
further enhance the strength, depth and 
effectiveness of the Board. Jonathan Howell 
became Chair of the Audit Committee on 1 July 
2022, in place of Deirdre Mahlan, and on 
21 July 2022, Alison Brittain was appointed as 
our Senior Independent Director and Chair of 
the Remuneration Committee, replacing 
George Rose.

These Board changes coincided well with 
the timing of our external Board evaluation 
(recommended at least every three years in 
the Code). In May 2022, we reviewed and 
agreed the timing and approach for the FY23 
external Board evaluation and appointed the 
external evaluator, Manchester Square 
Partners. They had undertaken the FY20 
external Board evaluation and this 
appointment provided a good level of continuity 
for the FY23 external evaluation. You can read 
more about the process and outcomes on 
pages 111 to 112.

As well as recruiting new Board members, 
we continue to ensure that the composition of 
the Board and its committees are regularly 
reviewed and that there is a balance of skills 
and experience, independence and knowledge 
on the Board as well as diversity in the 
broadest sense, including gender and ethnicity. 
As part of the Board’s succession planning, we 
reviewed the overall skill sets of the Board, 
Board tenure and how the Board works 
together as a team. We also considered our 

longer-term succession planning and the skills 
we would need to 'future proof' the leadership 
of the business.

To progress in creating a better tomorrow, 
we must also ensure our global DEI strategy 
connects with, and supports, the needs of the 
regions where we do business. Our deep 
commitment to DEI is entrenched throughout 
Experian. The Committee received and 
discussed a detailed Global People Update 
which included the DEI plan from our Chief 
People Officer, Jacky Simmonds, and our 
Global Chief Diversity, Equity and Inclusion 
Officer, Wil Lewis, in January 2023. In FY24 and 
beyond, we will continue with our product-
centred approach across the regions while 
working to increase diverse representation 
and delivering education on why increased 
diversity has commercial benefit.

The Committee considered the proposed 
election or re-election of directors at the 
Annual General Meeting, recommended 
Caroline Donahue’s re-appointment as a 
director, reviewed the draft corporate 
governance section of the Annual Report, 
and reviewed various company law and 
governance changes. 

The Committee was in place throughout the 
year ended 31 March 2023.

Committee’s key roles and 
responsibilities 
Good governance and strong, responsible, 
balanced leadership are critical to business 
success and to creating both long-term 
shareholder value and a strong, sustainable 
culture. As a Committee, our responsibilities 
include:

 a Ensuring we have appropriate procedures 
for nominating, selecting, training and 
evaluating directors, and that adequate 
succession plans are in place. 

 a Reviewing the Board’s structure, size, 
composition and succession needs; 
considering the balance of membership and 
the Board’s required balance of skills, 
experience, independence, knowledge and 
diversity. 

 a Identifying and nominating, for the Board’s 

approval, suitable candidates to fill 
vacancies for non-executive directors and, 
with the Chief Executive Officer’s assistance, 
executive directors. Board appointments are 
made on merit and against objective criteria, 
to ensure the Board maintains its balance of 
skills, experience, independence, knowledge 
and diversity.

 a Reviewing legislative, regulatory and 

corporate governance developments and 
making recommendations to the Board; and 
ensuring that the Company observes the 
standards and disclosures recommended 
by the UK Corporate Governance Code.

Process for Board appointments

Step 1

When making Board appointments, the 
Committee reviews and approves an outline 
brief and role specification and appoints one or 
more search agents for the assignment. We 
disclose the name of the search agent and any 
other connection they have with Experian in 
the Annual Report following the appointment. 
The specification and the search are discussed 
with the search agents, who then prepare an 
initial longlist of candidates. The Committee 
defines a shortlist and holds interviews. 
Ultimately, the Committee makes a 
recommendation to the Board for its 
consideration. Following Board approval, the 
appointment is announced in line with the 
requirements of the UK Financial Conduct 
Authority's (FCA’s) Listing Rules. In due course, 
a tailored induction programme is developed 
for the new director(s). We engaged Odgers 
Berndtson as the specialist search firm for the 
recruitment of Kathleen DeRose, Louise 
Pentland and Esther Lee, who were appointed 
during the year. Odgers Berndtson does not 
provide additional services to the Group.

Board composition
The Board comprises the independent Chair, 
Mike Rogers, three executive directors and 
seven independent non-executive directors, 
including the Senior Independent Director, 
Alison Brittain. Alison is also the Chair of the 
Remuneration Committee. Jonathan Howell is 
the Chair of the Audit Committee and Mike 
Rogers is the Chair of the Nomination and 
Corporate Governance Committee. The 
Nomination and Corporate Governance 
Committee regularly evaluates Board 
composition from a number of perspectives, 
including diversity and orderly succession. 
This year was a busy one for Board 
composition, with key Board member changes 
during the year. The changes regarding 
Committee chairs were carefully planned and 
orchestrated over an extended period: 
Jonathan Howell was appointed to the Board in 
2021 and Alison Brittain was appointed to the 
Board in 2020. The non-executive director 
succession process has proceeded well, and 
there has been an effective transition of Audit 
and Remuneration Committee chair roles from 
Deirdre Mahlan and George Rose, to Jonathan 
Howell and Alison Brittain, both of whom have 
brought critical insights and strong 
contributions, and stepped easily into their 
roles.

Induction and training 
The Company has procedures to ensure newly 
appointed directors receive formal induction, 
and this involves meetings with senior 
executives and functional leaders. A tailored 
induction programme is designed for each 
new non-executive director who joins the 
Board, to ensure they are equipped with the 
knowledge and materials necessary to add 
value. Individual induction programmes are 
usually completed within the first six months 
of a director’s appointment and the Company 
Secretary assists and supports throughout the 
induction process. The programmes are 
reviewed regularly to consider directors’ 
feedback and are continually updated and 
improved. 

As well as visits to the business, the Board also 
receives requisite and appropriate updates 
throughout the year. This year, sessions 
included: 

 a An update/training session for the Audit 

Committee on audit and corporate reform, 
potential impacts on Experian and actions 
being taken by Experian to ensure 
readiness. 

 a An external update to the Remuneration 

Committee on trends in remuneration and 
corporate governance.

We develop a comprehensive and tailored 
induction programme for each newly 
appointed independent non-executive director, 
based on their experience, background and the 
requirements of the role. The programme 
consists of meetings and main operating site 
visits as appropriate, designed to help the new 
independent non-executive director 
understand their responsibilities and help 
them to make a valuable contribution to the 
Board. On 1 November 2022, Kathleen DeRose 
and Louise Pentland joined the Board as 
independent non-executive directors. Their 
induction sessions were held from November 
2022 to February 2023, with follow-on ad hoc 
meetings as requested. All sessions were held 
with the relevant business or regional leader 
(for Business/Operations updates) and 
relevant functional executive for the 
Corporate/Governance updates. Pre-reading/
viewing material was made available, including 
Group strategy presentations.

In January 2023, the Board held its meeting in 
our operational headquarters in Costa Mesa, 
California. As part of their induction 
programme, Kathleen and Louise travelled to 
San Diego, California and visited the Experian 
DataLab there, where they received 
presentations and demonstrations from senior 
management on Experian Ascend Technology 

Platform, Signal hub and CrossCore Identity 
exchange. They also met and had a working 
lunch with employees and management of 
the DataLab. This provided Kathleen and 
Louise with an opportunity to gain a deeper 
understanding of our culture and to engage 
with our people within the business. 

“Spending time with key people 
throughout the business and visiting 
the Experian DataLab in California 
during January 2023 helped me get 
a greater sense of the culture within 
the Group.” 
Kathleen DeRose

“My induction sessions focused 
on building my knowledge of 
the different businesses within 
Experian, which helps me to 
better support and contribute 
to Board discussions.”
Louise Pentland

Diversity 
At Experian our belief is that diversity, equity 
and inclusion are essential to our purpose of 
creating a better tomorrow, together, by 
making positive change in the world and 
actively supporting efforts to close the 
financial wealth gap for underserved 
communities. We actively support the potential 
of all expressions of diversity, including but not 
limited to thought, style, sexual orientation, 
gender identity/expression, race, ethnicity, 
disability, culture and experience. We welcome 
people of all backgrounds to bring their whole 
selves to Experian. 

The Board’s diversity policy is unchanged. We 
strongly believe that diversity throughout the 
Group and at Board level is a driver of business 
success. We respect, value and welcome all 
forms of diversity, and seek to reflect the 
diversity of our clients, investors and 
employees in our Board. We recruit talented 
Board members, who have the appropriate 
mix of skills, capabilities and market 
knowledge to ensure the Board is effective. 
When recruiting, we look across all sectors 
and non-traditional talent pools, and we 
require diversity on our candidate shortlists.

In line with the new requirements of the UK 
Financial Conduct Authority (FCA) Listing 
Rules, companies must report information and 
disclose against targets regarding the 
representation of women and ethnic minorities 
on their boards and executive management. 

Board evaluation

The Code specifies that the Board should 
undertake a formal and rigorous annual 
evaluation of its own performance and that of 
its committees and individual directors, and 
that the Board should also have an externally 
facilitated evaluation at least once every three 
years. 

FY23 was Year 1 of our Board’s three-year 
review cycle, and an external evaluation was 
conducted by Manchester Square Partners 
(MSP) (who have no other connection with the 
Group or Board members) to provide the Board 
with greater insights into its performance and 
to identify opportunities to further increase and 
improve its overall effectiveness.

MSP held meetings with the Chair and the 
Company Secretary to agree the scope and 
relevant topics for consideration, and reviewed 
Board and committee meeting papers for the 
previous 12 months. A principal from MSP then 
observed the Board, Audit, Remuneration, and 
Nomination and Corporate Governance 
Committee meetings in November 2022, to 
gain further insight into Board members’ 
interactions and Board and committee 

It is Experian’s first year reporting under these 
rules. The current female representation on 
the Board is 45%, which exceeds the 
requirement of the new rules. We continue to 
monitor closely the numbers submitted as part 
of the FTSE Women Leaders Review around 
the position of our executive committee and 
their direct reports. The proportion of women 
in this population currently stands at 27%. As 
part of our commitment to continue to improve 
our gender diversity, we have put in place a 
three-year target of 30% for this group. This, 
alongside the targets set for senior and 
mid-level leaders within Experian, will ensure 
a strong pipeline of women for our most senior 
positions over time. In addition, the March 2023 
Parker Review Committee update regarding 
ethnic diversity confirmed that we exceeded 
their Board ethnic diversity recommendations. 

We continue to recognise the significant 
benefits of a diverse Board and, when 
recruiting, will continue to seek to address any 
diversity gaps on our Board, including gender 
and ethnicity. In July 2022, Alison Brittain was 
appointed as Senior Independent Director and 
Chair of the Remuneration Committee in place 
of George Rose. Both positions are regarded as 
senior roles within Experian, and the Senior 
Independent Director role is considered as a 
senior Board position under the new FCA rules. 
Throughout the year, the Board included at 
least one independent non-executive director 
of an ethnic minority background.

At Experian, we embrace diversity and 
appreciate different perspectives and the 
unique value each employee brings. 
Fundamentally, we do not discriminate against 
anyone based on race, colour, religion, gender, 
sexual orientation, gender identity or 
expression, national origin, disability, age, 
covered veteran status, or any other 
characteristic protected by law. We are 
dedicated to providing a safe, healthy and 
productive work environment for all 
employees. We are committed to respecting 
and promoting human rights and we do not 
tolerate any infringement of these rights in our 
business or our supply chain. The Group’s Code 
of Conduct applies to everyone at Experian, 
including contractors, suppliers and others 
who do business with us. Contractors and 
suppliers performing work on behalf of 
Experian are expected to comply with the law 
and the portions of the Group’s Code of 
Conduct that apply to them.

As well as the Board policy outlined above, the 
Group’s Code of Conduct further outlines our 
approach and how we think about diversity. 
We understand the fundamental value that 
diversity, equity and inclusion bring to our 
business, and there are many ongoing 
initiatives to support a work environment in 
which everyone is treated with fairness and 
respect, has equal access to opportunities 
and resources, and can contribute fully to 
our success.

performance. Board members were sent a 
briefing note, including an outline of the 
interview framework, ahead of individual 
meetings, lasting at least one hour in each 
case, with MSP in November and December 
2022.

Following the above, the Chair and then the 
Chair and Company Secretary met with MSP to 
review and discuss the findings. 

An evaluation report was prepared and 
presented to the Board by MSP at the January 
2023 Board meeting. The report included 
details of the context of the review, summary 
observations and details of each area reviewed, 
which included strategy development and 
review and strategic priorities, operational 
challenges, perceived risks and risk 
management, relations with stakeholders, 
talent management, leadership development 
and succession planning, the Board’s role and 
dynamics, Board composition, succession and 
engagement, and purpose, values and culture. 
While the report noted that there were no 
immediate experience gaps on the Board, 
future non-executive director recruitment 

would continue to focus on the wider diversity 
of the Board, cultural fit, strength of voice and 
seniority of experience.

The FY24 focus areas agreed by the Board, 
taking account of the specific outputs of the 
evaluation process, appear on the following 
page, and an update of progress against the 
areas of focus the Board agreed as part of the 
previous year’s evaluation is also provided. 
Follow-up to the key potential action points 
noted in the report was discussed by the 
Nomination and Corporate Governance 
Committee at its March 2023 meeting. 

Overall, the conclusion of the evaluation was 
that Board performance is strong and is 
considered among best in class but that there 
is also no complacency. All directors are 
ambitious for the business and keen to realise 
its full potential. They recognise the challenges 
faced by Experian strategically, operationally 
and financially through the next stage of its 
development. There is broad alignment on 
what the Board needs to do, and continue to do, 
to be even more effective going forward. In 
addition to the formal external evaluation, the

directors each met the Chair to discuss their 
performance and any development needs in 
March 2023. The Senior Independent Director 
evaluated the Chair, considering input from 
other directors. A performance evaluation 
discussion was included on the agendas of 
principal Board committee meetings in FY23, 
supported by an analysis of how each 
committee was performing against the key 
duties and responsibilities in its terms of 
reference.

Regulation 

Focus
A key focus area for the Nomination and Corporate Governance 
Committee in FY22 was executive, and Board Senior 
Independent Director (SID) and Committee Chair, succession. 
During FY23, Kerry Williams will transition out of his role as 
Chief Operating Officer (COO), and retire from the Board at the 
Annual General Meeting in July 2022. Craig Boundy will succeed 
Kerry as COO, and be appointed to the Board on Kerry’s 
retirement. In addition, Alison Brittain will become SID and 
Remuneration Committee Chair, and Jonathan Howell will be 
appointed as Audit Committee Chair. Given the importance of 
these roles, the Board and Nomination and Corporate 
Governance Committee will closely oversee and monitor the 
appointments and transitions, and will also provide input on 
Group Operating Committee roles, including areas for 
development.
The Board and Audit Committee receive regular legal, 
regulatory and compliance updates, including the activities of 
key regulators such as the UK Financial Conduct Authority and 
the US Consumer Financial Protection Bureau. These updates 
are provided by the Group’s General Counsel, and the Board 
and Audit Committee have noted a recent potential increase in 
regulatory activity globally. Below Board level, these matters 
are kept under ongoing review throughout the business. The 
Board and Audit Committee will continue their close monitoring 
of the position, including latest developments, impacts on the 
business and progress with regulatory engagement.

Progress
There were key Board member changes during the year, as 
outlined in this report. The changes regarding Committee chairs 
were carefully planned and orchestrated over an extended 
period, with Jonathan Howell appointed in 2021 and Alison 
Brittain appointed in 2020. The non-executive director 
succession process has proceeded well, and there has been 
an effective transition from Deirdre Mahlan and George Rose, 
to Alison Brittain and Jonathan Howell, both of whom are 
considered excellent additions who have brought critical 
insights and strong contributions, and stepped easily into 
their roles. 

The Nomination and Corporate Governance Committee 
continues to regularly review and monitor executive succession.

In September 2022, the Audit Committee reviewed an 
integrated set of plans to guide the continued development of 
the business in risk, information security, and privacy, ethics 
and compliance. The leaders of these functions presented their 
strategic and tactical updates to the Committee, focused on 
effective risk management, employee accountability, and 
recognising the increased expectations of regulators and 
clients, and the continued development and expansion of 
Experian’s business. 

In addition, and reflecting the importance of the second line 
functions, new and elevated leadership was put in place.

FY24 focus areas agreed following the FY23 review

Area
Ongoing education of non-executive 
directors (NEDs)

Talent mapping

Focus
The Board recognises the high quality and the varied level of experience of the Board NEDs, and has kept under review 
the best approach to ongoing education, with a view to prioritising topics around the risks and opportunities from 
emerging regulatory themes and how the Board could influence these. It is intended to build on the current NED 
education and opportunities for further exposure to the business, through increased exposure to subject-matter experts 
and invitations to client conferences and other role-specific meetings.
The Nomination and Corporate Governance Committee will increase its understanding and oversight of the succession 
planning that is undertaken below the level of the Group Operating Committee. This will include identification of 
strengths, development needs and future potential of identified successors through the development of a talent map 
that will be presented to the Committee.

Having been appointed as Chair of the 
Committee in July 2022, I am pleased to 
present my first report to shareholders on how 
the Committee carried out its responsibilities 
during the year. It was a busy year for the 
Committee, which remains an essential part 
of Experian’s overall governance framework. 
The Board has delegated to the Committee 
the responsibility to oversee and assess the 
integrity of the Group’s financial reporting, risk 
management and internal control procedures, 
review of cyber security matters and the work 
of both the internal audit function and the 
external auditor, KPMG LLP. 

Included in this report are: specific areas of 
focus for the Committee during the year 
(including consideration of key elements of the 
proposed UK audit and corporate governance 
reforms); and strategic updates on our second 
line of defence functions (Group Risk 
Management, Information Security, and 
Privacy, Ethics and Compliance). The report 
also provides details of the significant 
accounting and reporting matters the 
Committee considered in relation to the 
financial statements and how these were 
addressed, and how the Committee concluded 
that the 2023 Annual Report was fair, balanced 
and understandable.

Committee received and discussed 
important second line of defence updates 
from the senior management leaders of

and Privacy, Ethics and Compliance. 
 a A wide range of measures has been 

implemented in recent years to strengthen

three functions. 

cadence of reporting across the Group’s risk 
management programme. 

 a The next phase in the strategic approach 
was to harmonise the overall approach, 
including management of the most material 
risks. 

 a As part of the update, the Committee 
reviewed and discussed key strategic 
updates for each of the three second line of 
defence functions. 

 a The intention was to bring a consistent 
approach, strategic goal, taxonomy, and 

 a The Committee also considered and 

approved updated terms of reference for 
each second line of defence function.

Significant accounting and reporting matters

At each meeting, the Committee receives a formal financial update from the Chief Financial Officer and/or the Global Financial Controller informing the 
Committee of developments in the Group’s reporting and accounting environment, and compliance with relevant reporting standards. During the year, the 
Committee assessed the overall quality of financial reporting through review and discussion of the significant accounting matters and the half-year and 
annual financial statements. 

The Committee’s review included assessing the appropriateness of the Group’s accounting policies and practices, confirming their compliance with 
financial reporting standards and relevant statutory requirements, and reviewing the adequacy of disclosures in the financial statements. In performing 
its review of the Group’s financial reporting, the Committee considered and challenged the work, judgments, and conclusions of management. The 
external auditor also provided the Committee with reports setting out its findings and conclusions on the accounting treatments included in the financial 
statements, which the external auditor is able to discuss privately, without the presence of management, with the Committee. 

The table below summarises the significant accounting and reporting matters considered by the Committee in relation to the Group’s financial statements 
and the way they were challenged by the Committee and concluded upon. These matters, together with any other significant considerations of the 
Committee, are reported to the Board. The minutes of each Audit Committee meeting are also circulated to all members of the Board.

Significant matter
Impairment review – goodwill and other 
intangible assets

Response and challenge
A summary of the annual impairment analysis and underlying process was provided to the 
Committee. 

Given the size of the Group’s goodwill and 
other intangible assets, the recoverability of 
these assets is a significant area of focus for 
the Committee. 

Higher interest rates and macroeconomic 
weakness in our European markets have 
reduced the value-in-use of the Group’s EMEA 
cash generating unit (CGU), with an 
impairment of US$179m recorded in the year. 

The value-in-use of all other CGUs continued 
to sufficiently exceed their carrying amounts.

Litigation and contingent liabilities

The operating activities of the Group are 
subject to regulation across a high number 
of geographical markets. 

The volume and size of outstanding claims the 
Group is subject to mean that the judgments 
applied when assessing the likelihood of a 
liability crystalising can have a significant 
impact. 

The Committee received an update and 
analysis of open litigation and regulatory 
matters affecting the Group, including the 
enforcement notice from the UK Information 
Commissioner’s Office.

The Committee considered the level at which goodwill is tested and whether this was 
impacted by the Group’s restructuring activity in EMEA and Asia Pacific. The Committee 
concluded a consistent approach to the prior year was appropriate. 

The Committee scrutinised the methodology, inputs, and assumptions applied by 
management, in particular ensuring that changes in the macroeconomic environment were 
appropriately captured. This included acknowledging the use of external sources to support 
and corroborate management’s inputs. 

The external auditor, KPMG, provided an update to the Committee on the procedures 
performed over the Group’s impairment analysis, alongside their findings and conclusions on 
the reasonableness of the key inputs into the analysis. These were discussed with KPMG at 
the relevant Committee meeting. 

The Committee further enquired as to whether any other reasonable changes in assumptions 
would result in a materially different impairment charge in EMEA or generate an impairment 
in Asia Pacific. The Committee agreed with management’s proposed sensitivity disclosures 
for EMEA and Asia Pacific.
The Committee has challenged management on the key judgments and assumptions made 
in assessing whether a provision or contingent liability disclosure is required. 

The Committee met with the Group’s legal counsel, received regular litigation updates, 
and considered external advice in order to facilitate this process, alongside the feedback 
provided from KPMG on the conclusion of their relevant audit procedures. 

The Committee concluded that these matters had been appropriately provided for at 
31 March 2023. 

The Committee considered and concurred with the proposed contingent liability disclosures 
included in the notes to the Group financial statements.

Significant matter
Tax

The Group is subject to tax in numerous 
jurisdictions. The Group has a number of open 
tax returns with various tax authorities with 
whom it is in active dialogue.

The key uncertainties in the year related to 
the deductibility of purchased goodwill, 
inter-company trading and financing. 
US$102m (2022: US$293m) is included in 
current tax liabilities in relation to these 
judgmental areas. 
Going concern and viability assessments

Given the level of management judgment 
required in forming conclusions with regard 
to the going concern and viability 
assessments, these are key areas of focus for 
the Committee. 

Response and challenge
The Committee received a regular update from management on the adequacy of provisions in 
respect of significant open tax matters. The review included details of ongoing 
correspondence with tax authorities in the UK, the USA and Brazil and the principal areas of 
tax challenge.

Cross reference
See note 17 
to the Group 
financial 
statements.

The Committee considered the evidence available to management in respect of these open 
matters and challenged the judgments adopted by management.

KPMG briefed the Committee on the output of their audit procedures over uncertain tax 
liabilities, and their conclusion on the provisions made by management.

The Committee concurred with management’s assessment of open tax matters, noting the 
significant decline during the year following the agreement of some historical tax positions.

The Committee challenged and reviewed management’s process for assessing the Group’s 
longer-term viability, the appropriateness of the viability scenarios identified, and the 
reasonableness of key assumptions used by management in calculating the financial impact 
of a viability scenario arising over the forecast period.

The Committee reviewed the results of management’s scenario-specific stress testing for 
both going concern and viability, as well as reverse stress testing, which demonstrated the 
resilience of the Group.

As part of its review and challenge, the Committee took into consideration updates provided 
by KPMG on its procedures and conclusions on the viability of the Group.

The Committee considered and concurred with management’s assessment and recommended 
to the Board the preparation of the financial statements on the going concern basis.

See page 86 
for the Group’s 
going concern 
and viability 
statements. 

Fair, balanced and understandable – what do we do?

Each year, in line with the UK Corporate Governance Code and the Committee’s terms of reference, the Committee is asked to consider, and recommend 
to the Board, whether or not the Annual Report is fair, balanced and understandable (FBU) and whether or not it provides the information necessary for 
shareholders to assess the Group’s position and performance, business model and strategy. There is an established process to support the Audit 
Committee in making this assessment, and we follow broadly the same process for the Group’s half-yearly financial report. 

The main elements of the process are: 
 a A list of ‘key areas to focus on’ was 

previously shared with the Annual Report 
team. The team is reminded of the 
requirement annually and asked to reflect 
this in their drafting. 

 a An internal FBU committee considered the 
Annual Report in May 2023, ahead of the 
Audit Committee meeting. A wide range 
of functions are represented on this 
committee, including executives from 
finance, communications, investor relations, 
legal and corporate secretariat. The external 
auditor also supports the committee. 
 a In advance of its May 2023 meeting, the 

Audit Committee received a near-final draft 
of the Annual Report, together with a 
reminder of the areas to focus on. The FBU 
committee’s observations and conclusions 
were also relayed to the Audit Committee.

 a Following its review this year, the Audit 

Committee concluded that it was 
appropriate to confirm to the Board that 
the 2023 Annual Report was fair, balanced 
and understandable, and provided the 
information necessary for shareholders 
to assess the Group’s position and 
performance, business model and 
strategy. The FBU statement appears 
in the Directors’ report.

The 'key areas to focus on' included 
ensuring that: 
 a The overall message of the narrative 

reporting is consistent with the primary 
financial statements.

 a The overall message of the narrative 

reporting is appropriate, in the context 
of the industry and the wider economic 
environment.

 a The Annual Report is consistent with 
messages already communicated to 
investors, analysts and other stakeholders.
 a The Annual Report, taken as a whole, is fair, 

balanced and understandable.

 a The Chair and Chief Executive Officer’s 
statements include a balanced view of 
the Group’s performance and prospects, 
and of the industry and market as a whole.
 a Any summaries or highlights capture the 
big picture of the Group appropriately.
 a Case studies or examples are of strategic 
importance and do not over-emphasise 
immaterial matters.

Experian plc GovernanceCode principle Audit, Risk and Internal Control117

Speciﬁc areas of focus
The Committee spent time on the following 
specific areas during the year to consider and 
challenge relevant, current and important 
issues: 

 a At each Committee meeting, consideration 
was given to the Group’s operations, risks 
and controls. Specifically, this included 
consideration of the impact of the 
macroeconomic environment upon the 
Group’s wider Enterprise Risk Management 
Framework, emerging risks, business 
continuity planning strategy and significant 
reporting and accounting matters.

 a The Committee received a detailed update in 
November 2022 from the Global Financial 
Controller, with input from KPMG, on the key 
elements of the UK Department for 
Business, Energy and Industrial Strategy 
(BEIS) consultation on the proposed audit 
and corporate governance reform. The 
Committee was presented with the potential 
implications for the Group’s internal control 
and risk management systems and related 
external disclosures. 

Whistleblowing and fraud 
management 
Experian offers employees a Confidential 
Helpline to capture all complaints and 
whistleblowing allegations. During the year, the 
Committee agreed to maintain this service as 
the primary method for staff to raise queries 
that they do not feel comfortable raising with 
their manager. The Confidential Helpline was 
already publicised on the intranet and in the 
Global Code of Conduct. During the year, 
communication was extended to include 
references to the Confidential Helpline in other 
key policies, such as Anti-Bribery and 
Corruption and Gifts and Hospitality to further 
increase awareness of the availability of event 
reporting. Processes with Human Resources 
were formalised to ensure that any significant 
issues that they are made aware of, and are 
reported by any line manager, are escalated to 
Internal Audit for inclusion in their reporting to 
the Committee. At the September 2022 and 
March 2023 meetings, the Committee received 
an update including any matters relating to an 
allegation or potential instance of fraud. 

Information security
At each Committee meeting a Cyber Security 
update was reviewed. This report provides a 
summary of the key information security risks 
and threats that the Group faces and an update 
on the cyber security capabilities and 
engagement across the Group.

The Group’s cyber security strategy and 
capability is measured against a globally 
recognised standard – the US National Institute 
of Standards & Technology (NIST) framework. 
This provides an understanding of cyber 
security risks and development of customised 
measures to assess and manage risks. As 
noted above, the cyber security strategy for 
the Group was approved by the Committee in 
September 2022, focused on capability, 
engagement with business units/the first line 
of defence and further evolving the information 
security maturity of the business. The overall 
intention is to drive capability versus the risk 
facing the Group, through a threat-informed 
approach.

Internal audit
The role of Internal Audit is to provide 
independent, objective assurance and 
consulting activity to the Committee and 
management. Internal Audit brings a 
systematic, disciplined approach to evaluate 
and improve the effectiveness of risk 
management, controls, and governance 
processes. The audit team is independent from 
the business and reports to the Head of Global 
Internal Audit who, in turn, reports functionally 
to the Audit Committee and administratively to 
the Chief Financial Officer. The Committee/
Committee Chair approves the appointment, 
remuneration, and removal of the Head of 
Global Internal Audit. The Head of Global 
Internal Audit has the right of direct access to 
the Audit Committee and the Chair of the 
Board, and the audit team have no direct 
operational responsibility or authority over any 
of the activities they review. At the end of each 
scheduled meeting, the Head of Global Internal 
Audit meets with the Committee to discuss any 
relevant matters without management being 
present. 

At each meeting, the Head of Global Internal 
Audit presents an update to the Committee. 
This includes the progress against the audit 
plan, and a report on the audit findings and 
themes. In addition, at the meeting in March 
2023, the Committee reviewed and approved 
the Global Internal Audit Strategy and Plan for 
the year. 

Each September, Internal Audit updates the 
Audit Committee on key elements of the 
advisory support provided to the business over 
the previous 12 months, in addition to its 
regular audit reporting work. Internal Audit 
assisted in many areas and below is a sample 
of these. 

Internal Audit:

 a continued to work with the other governance 
functions in the development of the Group’s 
risk framework model

 a provided thematic analysis and support to 
the sub-groups involved in a mergers and 
acquisitions project to improve due diligence 
and integration processes globally

 a provided advisory feedback and guidance as 
part of Technology Lifecycle Management 
and Configuration Management process/
technology updates

 a was engaged and involved in a Global Cloud 
Technology strategy forum to provide risk 
monitoring and advisory feedback. 

The specific objectives, authority, scope, and 
responsibilities of the Internal Audit team are 
set out in more detail in the Experian Internal 
Audit terms of reference, which are reviewed 
annually by the Committee. The Committee 
also considers and evaluates the level of 
Internal Audit resource and its quality, 
experience and expertise, supplemented as 
appropriate by third-party support and subject 
matter expertise, to ensure it is appropriate to 
provide the required level of assurance. 

In line with the Chartered Institute of Internal 
Auditors’ (IIA) Code of Practice, the 
effectiveness of Internal Audit is reviewed by 
the Committee on an annual basis and is also 
subject to an external quality assessment 
(EQA). There is a four-year evaluation cycle for 
Experian’s Internal Audit function, the structure 
of which is a full external quality assessment 
every four years, and follow-up interim 
external quality assessments and internal 
reviews in the intervening period.

A full EQA took place during the year, 
undertaken by PwC. The process included: 

 a interviews with stakeholders (including 

non-executive directors, executive directors 
and senior management across Experian 
including the Chair of the Audit Committee 
and the Chief Executive Officer)

 a workshops held with the Internal Audit team 

members

 a review of a survey sent to all members of 

the Internal Audit team

 a a Digital Fitness Assurance Assessment 
carried out as a self-assessment with the 
Global Head of IT Audit

 a a review of Internal Audit’s structure and 

remit, audit approach and human resource 
capability 

 a a review of internal audit files from the 
previous 12 months across the areas of

management being present. The Committee 
reviewed the content of the independence 
letter and the management representation 
letter, as well as engagement terms. 

In September 2022, the Committee reviewed 
the conclusions of the evaluation. The report 
highlighted that Internal Audit is built upon 
strong foundations: there is a solid 
methodology and approach underpinned by 
the growing use of technology, quality work, 
focused goal-setting and performance 
management, and an experienced and 
competent team. The report concluded that 
Experian Global Internal Audit benchmarks 
well against peer groups, and complied with 
the IIA Standards for Internal Audit. There were 
a number of non-urgent recommendations 
and actions highlighted. The Head of Global 
Internal Audit has reported back to the 
Committee on these matters, and 
implemented changes where appropriate. 

External auditor 

Tenure and tendering 
KPMG LLP (KPMG) is the Group’s current 
external auditor, and has been since July 2016, 
following the conclusion of an audit tender 
process in September 2015. There are 
currently no contractual obligations restricting 
our choice of external auditor and we confirm 
that we have complied with the provisions of 
the UK Competition and Markets Authority 
(Mandatory Use of Competitive Tender 
Processes and Audit Committee 
responsibilities) Order 2014 for the financial 
year under review. 

Each year, the Committee makes a 
recommendation to the Board whether the 
external auditor should be reappointed. Before 
making that recommendation, the Committee 
considers the auditor’s effectiveness, including 
its independence, objectivity and scepticism. 

Effectiveness, audit quality, 
independence and appointment 
At its September 2022 meeting, the Audit 
Committee reviewed and discussed KPMG’s 
audit strategy for the year ended 31 March 
2023. In March 2023, the Committee received 
detailed updates on the audit’s progress, which 
included details of the external auditor’s 
actions, such as the audit procedures 
undertaken, the audit’s coverage, and the 
status of any significant findings, as well as 
details of key matters arising from the audit 
and assessments of management’s judgments 
on them. At the end of each scheduled 
meeting, KPMG meets with the Committee to 
discuss any relevant matters without 

The terms of reference of the Audit Committee 
include a requirement to assess annually 
the effectiveness of the external auditor. 
This is in line with the FRC’s Guidance on 
Audit Committees (April 2016). Internal Audit 
supports the Audit Committee by gathering 
information to complete this review and issued 
questionnaires to the Board members and 
certain senior management, as well as a more 
detailed set of questions to senior finance 
leadership. 

The evaluation focused on the four key areas 
used in the FRC’s December 2019 ‘Practice aid 
for audit committees’: mindset and culture; 
skills, character and knowledge; quality 
control; and judgment. The Committee also 
reflected on the assurance on financial 
statements, the audit teams and 
communication, as well as considering 
external regulatory updates on the external 
auditor received during the year. 

The overall results of the evaluation were 
positive. In general, KPMG was felt to be 
effective and collaborative throughout the 
audit process. It provided robust challenge, 
demonstrated sound judgment and 
communications were clear. Overall, KPMG 
had provided an effective and robust audit. 
Suggestions for improvements were made, 
which have been discussed with KPMG – these 
included allowing the Chair of the Audit 
Committee to meet more of the KPMG team 
and having it provide appropriate updates on 
new accounting or regulatory matters. 

The Committee also evaluates the quality of 
the audit (along with the effectiveness review 
described above) in the following ways: 

Meeting attendance by the external auditor 
– KPMG attends all scheduled Committee 
meetings and, during the year, reported to the 
Committee on the components of the audit 
plan, additional or forthcoming requirements 
or regulatory changes, audit findings and 
half-year review findings. 

Audit Quality Inspection and Supervision Report 
(AQR) – In July 2022, the FRC published its AQR 
for KPMG, which set out the FRC’s findings on 
key matters relevant to audit quality and is 
primarily based on a sample of individual 
audits (mainly public interest entities – PIEs) 
and their assessment of elements of the firm’s 
systems of quality control. The inspection 
results for KPMG had improved since last year, 
although some findings were identified for 
KPMG in relation to banking entities. 

Independence
To ensure auditor objectivity and 
independence, the Committee reviews 
potential threats to independence and the 
associated safeguards during the year. The 
safeguards that KPMG had in place during 
the year to maintain independence included 
annual confirmation by KPMG staff of 
compliance with ethics and independence 
policies and procedures. KPMG also had in 
place underlying safeguards to maintain 
independence by: instilling professional values; 
communications; international accountability; 
and independent reviews. There was also 
appropriate pre-approval for non-audit 
services, which are provided only if 
permissible under relevant ethical standards. 
Details of this policy are laid out on page 119.

During the year, KPMG reported to the 
Committee that certain member firms had 
provided non-permitted services (which have 
now been terminated) to a small number of 
Experian subsidiaries (further information is 
provided in the KPMG audit report). The entities 
concerned are not in scope for the Group audit, 
the work was administrative in nature, and 
was conducted after the Group audit opinion 
was signed by KPMG for each of the impacted 
financial years. Based on the Committee’s 
assessment of the matter, KPMG’s integrity, 
objectivity, and independence has not been 
compromised in any way. 

Following the year-end audit, neither Experian 
nor any of its subsidiary companies will 
employ any audit partner or audit team 
member in a position which could have a 
significant influence on the Group’s accounting 
policies or the content of its financial 
statements until a cooling-off period has 
elapsed. The cooling-off period is two years in 
respect of an audit partner, and one year in 
respect of a director, where they have worked 
on the audit of Experian plc or its subsidiaries. 

The Committee will receive an update if any 
audit team members are recruited into senior 
positions by Experian, followed thereafter by 
annual reporting on numbers of former auditor 
senior employees, should any remain. 

The Committee also considered the 
independence of the external auditor’s 
partners and staff involved in the audit 
process. KPMG has confirmed that all its 
partners and staff complied with its ethics and 
independence policies and procedures that are 
consistent with the FRC’s ethical standards, 
including that none of its employees working 
on the Experian audit holds publicly listed 
securities issued by Experian. In addition, the 

Experian plc GovernanceCode principle Audit, Risk and Internal Control119

Committee acknowledges management’s 
internal assessment that no employee in a key 
financial reporting oversight role has a close 
relationship with any KPMG employee which 
may impact their independence.

The Committee concluded that the external 
auditor had maintained its objectivity and 
independence throughout the year. 

Non-audit services 
KPMG provides certain other services to 
Experian. To ensure auditor objectivity and 
independence, we have a policy relating to 
providing such services. The policy includes 
financial limits above which any proposed 
non-audit services must be pre-approved, 
depending on the expenditure proposed. 
The Committee receives half-yearly reports 
providing details of non-audit assignments 
carried out by the external auditor, together 
with the related fees. Under the policy, 
non-audit fees paid to KPMG are capped at 
30% of the fees for audit services, except in 
exceptional circumstances. Pre-approval by 
the Audit Committee or Audit Committee Chair 
is required in that situation. An analysis of fees 
paid to the external auditor for the year ended 
31 March 2023 is set out in note 14 to the 
Group financial statements. 

Auditor re-appointment 
Having considered the effectiveness and 
independence of KPMG as summarised above, 
the Committee recommended to the Board 
that a resolution to re-appoint KPMG be 
proposed at the 2023 AGM, which the Board 
reviewed and approved.

Provision of non-audit services

Background 
The Audit Committee annually reviews the 
policy on the provision of non-audit services 
and recruitment of former auditor employees, 
and the latest review took place in March 2023. 
The Committee considered the application of 
the policy, and confirmed it was properly and 
consistently applied during the year. The policy, 
a summary of which is set out below, 
recognises the importance of the external 
auditor’s independence and objectivity.

Policy 
The external auditor is prohibited from 
providing any services other than those 
directly associated with the audit or required 
by legislation and/or permitted by FRC ethical 

guidance. These limited services are detailed 
in the non-audit services policy, which is 
reviewed and approved by the Committee on 
an annual basis. 

The appointment of the external auditor for any 
non-audit work up to US$50,000 must be 
approved by the Global Financial Controller. 
The appointment of the external auditor for any 
non-audit work where the expected fees are 
over US$50,000 and up to US$100,000 requires 
the approval, in advance, of the Group Chief 
Financial Officer. Where the expected fees are 
over US$100,000, the approval of the Chair of 
the Audit Committee is required in advance. 

Where cumulative annual fees exceed the 30% 
annual limit, all expenditure must be approved 
by the Audit Committee. All expenditure is 
subject to a tender process, unless express 
permission is provided by the Chair of the Audit 
Committee, the Chief Financial Officer or the 
Global Financial Controller based on the above 
approval limits. Any expenditure below 
US$100,000 not subject to a tender will be 
notified to the Chair of the Audit Committee 
annually. 

Commercial agreements where Experian 
provides services to the auditor must be 
approved by the Global Financial Controller 
and not exceed the lower of 5% of the local 
Experian entity’s total revenue and 
US$250,000, and all transactions should be 
undertaken on an arm’s length basis. 
Transactions in excess of this limit require 
approval of the Chair of the Audit Committee 
in advance. 

The Committee receives half-yearly reports 
providing details of assignments and related 
fees carried out by the external auditor in 
addition to their normal work. 

Risk management and internal control 
The Board is responsible for maintaining and 
reviewing the effectiveness of our risk 
management activities from a strategic, 
financial, regulatory, and operational 
perspective. These activities are designed to 
identify and manage, rather than eliminate, the 
risk of failure to achieve business objectives or 
to successfully deliver our business strategy. 
In line with the Code, on behalf of the Board, 
the Audit Committee monitors our risk 
management and internal control systems, 
robustly assesses the principal risks identified 
by our risk management processes (including 
those that would threaten our business model, 
future performance, solvency or liquidity), and 
monitors actions taken to mitigate them. 

During the year, and as outlined earlier, the 
Committee received second line of defence 
strategic updates at its September 2022 
meeting, comprising details of the plans for 

Group Risk, Cyber Security, and Privacy, Ethics 
and Compliance. The Committee also noted the 
new second line of defence leadership 
structure, including the appointment of a new 
Group Chief Risk Officer (CRO), Global Chief 
Privacy, Ethics and Regulatory Compliance 
Officer and a new Group Chief Information 
Security Officer (CISO). As well as the strategic 
updates, the Committee was briefed on tactical 
measures already underway, on a 
threat-informed basis, to manage and mitigate 
near-term reductions in areas of risk critical to 
the defence of the Experian business. These 
measures are focused on complex areas 
where a need to rapidly evolve the process, 
controls and operational assurance of 
implementation has been identified. Our risk 
management processes are designed to 
identify, assess, respond to, report on and 
monitor the risks that threaten our ability to 
achieve our business strategy and objectives, 
within our risk appetite. 

There is an ongoing process for identifying, 
evaluating, and managing the principal and 
emerging risks we face. This process was in 
place for the financial year and up to the date 
of approval of this Annual Report. Full details 
of our risk management and internal control 
systems and processes can be found in the 
Risk management and principal risks section 
of the Strategic report on page 78. The Audit 
Committee considers emerging risks with 
management as part of the standing risk 
management update it receives.

Effectiveness of the risk management 
and internal control systems
Experian’s risk management programme 
is regularly reviewed, and we engaged 
an external firm previously to assess the 
current state and identify opportunities for 
improvement. The scope was focused 
generally on risk management organisational 
structure and management, with a particular 
emphasis on operational risk management. 
The output of the external review work 
was used to adjust the Enterprise Risk 
Management (ERM) programme and set 
goals for the next one to three years. 
The implementation plan, reviewed by the 
Audit Committee, contained a number of 
recommendations on operational risk which 
we continue to implement (further detail is 
available in the Risk section). 

In line with the Code, the Audit Committee 
(on behalf of the Board) monitors our risk 
management and internal control systems, 
robustly assesses the principal risks identified 
by our risk assessment processes (including 
those that would threaten our business model, 
future performance, solvency or liquidity), 
and monitors actions taken to mitigate them. 
For certain joint arrangements, the Committee 
relies on the systems of internal control

operating within Experian partners’ 
infrastructure and the obligations of partners’ 
boards, relating to the effectiveness of their 
own systems.

The Code requires companies to review the 
effectiveness of their risk management and 
internal control systems, at least annually. 
The Audit Committee performs this review 
under delegated authority from the Board. 

Through a combination of ongoing and annual 
reviews, the Committee is able to review the 
effectiveness of the Group’s risk management 
and internal control system. 

The annual review of effectiveness considered 
that:

 a there was a process in place to determine 
the nature and extent of the principal risks 
the Company was willing to take in order to 
achieve its long-term strategic objectives

 a there was an ongoing process for 

identifying, evaluating, and managing the 
emerging and principal risks faced by the 
Group that was regularly reviewed by the 
Committee

 a processes were in place throughout the year 
ended 31 March 2023, and which would 
remain in place up to the date of approval of 
the Annual Report

 a the effectiveness of such processes was 

reviewed by the Board

 a the information the Board received was 
sufficient to enable it to review the 
effectiveness of the Group’s risk 
management and internal control systems.

Following this year’s review, the Committee, on 
behalf of the Board, considers that the 
information it received enabled it to review the 
effectiveness of the Group’s system of internal 
control and risk management in accordance 
with the FRC’s ‘Guidance on Risk Management, 
Internal Control and Related Financial and 
Business Reporting’ and that there were, and 
the system has, no significant failings or 
weaknesses.

Introduction
I am pleased to report that FY23 was 
another strong year for our business. 
High single-digit revenue and Benchmark 
EBIT growth is a notable achievement. This 
level of performance in the face of external 
operating environment challenges was a 
reflection of the sustainability of the 
business, the quality of our leadership team 
and the dedication and performance focus 
of our people.

We continue to reap the rewards of a number 
of key decisions that have been made in 
recent times. When uncertainty arrived in 
the form of the COVID-19 pandemic, we 
chose to maintain our key strategic 
investments, including increasing our focus 
in key areas such as our Consumer Services 
business. Importantly, we also put measures 
in place to support all our employees 
working from home, including introducing 
a number of 'people first' policies to enable 
employees to balance their work and 
personal life. As the working world 
transitioned to a hybrid model, we were in 
the fortunate position of already having the 
policies, processes and overall support to 
be very effective in the new ways of working.

As we have implemented these good 
practices over the last few years, the 
business has continued to grow, and I am 
pleased to be able to note another year of 
impressive financial results. 

Stakeholder experience in FY23 

Our ambition to grow remains at the forefront 
of our business strategy and is an integral part 
of our culture. Our culture and investment in 
innovation and growth creates a mindset – 
arguably even more valuable in challenging 
operating circumstances – that has driven our 
track record of strong financial performance 
and fuels both our short- and longer-term 
growth ambitions.

Protecting our people
We have an overarching ‘people first’ philosophy 
and protecting our employees is a key focus for 
us. The majority of our workforce continues to 
work from home as hybrid and remote working 
have become established business practices. 
In FY23, we further developed the policies and 
practices that were established following the 
onset of the COVID-19 pandemic. 

Our track record of providing support for those 
employees who need it most has come to the 
fore again during this latest financial year. The 
most recent example being a one-off allowance 
for our lowest paid UK employees to help with 
the impact of rising inflation. In addition, we took 
the opportunity to remind all our employees 
about the resources and support that are 
available to them as part of our financial 
wellbeing offer. This includes support across 
a whole range of topics including financial 
planning, mortgage advice, loan and debt 
management, helpful guides, tax planning and 
financial protection as well as highlighting our 
employee benefits.

Report on directors’ remuneration
continued

As our business results have evidenced, our 
approach to supporting our employees with 
specific issues or broader developments, such 
as more flexible working, results in a more 
engaged and motivated workforce. According to 
employee feedback, this is enabling us to attract 
and retain talent, which is critical to our growth 
ambitions. 

People ﬁrst initiatives
Some examples of the policies introduced to 
ensure that we maintain our focus on our 
employees are outlined below:

 a Enhanced flexible working policies, including 

global adoption of hybrid working and 
refurbished/new offices to provide 
collaborative and flexible working 
environments

 a Providing training to support employees 
with their preferred way of working

 a Family-friendly policies, including improved 
maternity, paternity and neonatal leave
 a Increased mental health and wellness 

programmes

 a We invested in a world-class digital learning 

platform.

Over the past three years, we have been 
impressed by the resilience, commitment and 
productivity of our employees as they overcame 
the challenges of the pandemic. Again in FY23, 
the collaborative and innovative culture at 
Experian played an important role in the 
delivery of a strong overall performance. 
Supporting and developing our people will 
remain a key strategic enabler for Experian as 
an important way to recognise the commitment 
and productivity of our employees.

FY23 performance 
I am pleased to report that FY23 was another 
strong year for Experian. In the current 
economic circumstances, to deliver high 
single-digit growth in both revenue and 
Benchmark earnings reflects the quality and 
resilience of the business. We believe that 
these results demonstrate the important 
combination of a robust business strategy and 
the proven ability to execute that strategy.

We set stretch targets that would require us to 
deliver sustainable high single-digit growth in 
FY23 and the Group achieved this ambition, 
with Benchmark EBIT growth of 9%, revenue 
performance growth of 8% and Benchmark 
EPS growth of 9%, all at constant exchange 
rates. These high single-digit performance 
levels were also reflected in our share price, 
which increased by 11% over the three-year 
performance period3.

While achieving financial results is 
undoubtedly very important, the Committee 
undertakes a holistic approach to assessing 
the Company’s performance by reviewing a 
broad range of metrics.

3  Three-month average to 31 March 2023 of £28.54 

compared to the three-month average to 31 March 2020 
of £25.63.

These broad non-financial measures include, 
but are not limited to, employee engagement, 
diversity and inclusion, impact on the 
environment, and customer satisfaction. In this 
way, we ensure the financial outputs are a fair 
and true reflection of the Group’s overall 
performance over the period.

We are very transparent about our targets and 
progress towards them in many areas, such as 
diversity and impact on the environment, but 
we do not include these and other 
non-financial metrics in our incentive plans. 
However, that in no way dilutes their 
importance to the Group. They are regularly 
reviewed by the Board and they remain key 
considerations for the Committee’s review of 
short- and longer-term performance.

How is our performance reflected in 
executive pay?
Salary: During the year the Committee 
approved salary increases of 2.4% – 2.5% for 
the executive directors. As in previous years, 
and aligned with our policy, these increases 
were in line with or below the increases 
awarded to the general employee population 
across the Group.

Annual bonus: The Committee always seeks to 
set stretch annual bonus performance targets 
that reflect our strong pay-for-performance 
philosophy. For FY23, the Committee set 
targets that reflected our unchanged ambition 
of strong levels of growth. Despite the 
anticipated challenges of a volatile external 
environment, the performance range was set 
with a true stretch that required high 
single-digit growth to achieve target and 
double-digit growth to achieve maximum 
results.

In FY23, Latin America once again achieved 
outstanding, double-digit Benchmark EBIT and 
organic revenue growth. All other regions also 
delivered single-digit growth*. This strong 
performance pushed the Group to high 
single-digit growth for both annual bonus 
performance metrics. FY23 revenue 
performance growth, for annual bonus 
purposes, was 8% and this high level of 
revenue performance, combined with strong 
returns on strategic investments and prudent 
financial management of expenses, flowed 
through to Benchmark EBIT growth of 9% for 
FY23.

As a result of the combined revenue growth 
and Benchmark EBIT growth performance, the 
overall bonus for FY23 will be paid out at 59% 
of maximum for each of the executive 
directors.

Following a review of the Group’s financial 
performance and consideration of all 
business priorities, including those that 
are non-financial in nature, the Committee 
was satisfied that the level of bonus payout 
aligned fairly and accurately to the year’s 
achievements. Therefore, no discretion 
(upwards or downwards) was deemed 
necessary. Full details of the annual bonus 
outcomes are set out in the Annual report on 
directors’ remuneration.

Long-term incentives (LTI): The Performance 
Share Plan (PSP) and Co-investment Plan (CIP) 
awards granted in 2020 will vest on 11 June 
2023. The 2020 LTI targets were set in 
November 2020, when our growth ambitions 
were to achieve sustainable annual high 
single-digit growth. The strong financial 
performance in FY23 follows a resilient 
FY21 and a very good FY22 performance. 
We continue to believe that a healthy, 
well-run business will create wealth for its 
shareholders, and over the last three years 
Experian has achieved:

 a 11% average increase per annum in adjusted 

Benchmark EPS

 a US$5.2bn three-year cumulative 
Benchmark operating cash flow

 a 17% adjusted Return on capital employed
 a 11% share price growth
 a £4.8bn of value creation through market 
capitalisation growth and dividends.

This strong performance underpins the overall 
vesting levels of the PSP, which vested at 75%, 
and of the CIP, which vested at 100%. While the 
impact of the pandemic in the first year of the 
performance period undoubtedly affected the 
potential performance outcomes that may 
have otherwise been achieved, no adjustments 
were made in assessing the performance 
outturns for the 2020 LTI plans.

Experian plc GovernanceCode principle Remuneration123

As with the annual bonus plan, the Committee 
considered the LTI vesting levels in the context 
of both the current economic environment and 
the Group’s holistic performance over the 
three-year period. It was decided that the 
formulaic vesting levels appropriately reflect 
the strong business outcomes achieved over 
the three-year performance period.

In line with our remuneration principles, 
a substantial portion of the CEO’s single 
figure value is determined by long-term 
performance. For FY23, 67% of the CEO’s 
single figure value is due to the vesting 
levels of the LTI plans. It is important to note 
that all shareholders, including employee 
shareholders, could have benefitted from 
the same share price growth and dividend 
return over the same three-year period.

Pay in the wider workforce

Employee engagement
The Remuneration Committee is well informed 
about the pay and related policy arrangements 
for the broader employee population at 
Experian. As the Committee had existing 
processes in place to gain an extensive 
understanding of employee pay, prior to 
the introduction of the 2018 UK Corporate 
Governance Code (the Code) requirements, 
no single approach recommended in the Code 
was considered appropriate for our business. 
We have therefore adopted a combination of 
the suggested methods to comply with the 
Code’s requirements.

Each year, as part of the Committee’s standing 
agenda, we are provided with an extensive 
paper setting out details of all employee pay 
and workforce policies across Experian. The 
discussions on this topic have enabled us to 
proactively incorporate wider employee pay 
as important context for framing executive 
pay considerations. This year we were also 
provided with greater insights into the 
remuneration and benefit arrangements, 
including gender pay positioning in our major 
regions, which facilitated informative and 
insightful discussions regarding diversity, 
equity and inclusion (DEI) practices in our 
major markets.

Following in my predecessor's footsteps, 
this year I had the opportunity to further 
supplement the Committee’s understanding 
of the pay and related policies for the broader 
workforce by attending our UK and Ireland 
Experian People Forum, in person. The 
two-way discussions were open and candid, 
which provided powerful feedback. 
Unsurprisingly, the cost-of-living issue was 
on the agenda and pleasingly the forum 
expressed an overwhelmingly positive 
employee response to the measures that had 
been put in place to support our lower-earning 
employees. I was very impressed with the 

level of engagement from employees and the 
nature of the discussions on every topic from 
Sharesave limits to the flexible ways of 
working.

It was apparent that employees appreciate the 
open and honest engagement style that our 
senior leaders consistently demonstrate. The 
continuing investments that have been made 
into employee mental health and financial 
wellbeing were hugely valued. Employee 
appreciation for the enhanced flexibility 
provided in working from home and the 
developing practice of hybrid and remote 
working was voiced strongly. We decided to 
invest in making our work locations more 
attractive places for employees whose 
preference is to work from an office 
environment. With our enhanced flexible-
working environment and supporting policies 
combined with our broader reward offering, 
I was pleased to hear that we are well 
positioned to continue to attract and retain 
key talent.

People and culture
The Experian Way is our unique and consistent 
way of working globally and informs how our 
people act and behave, thus shaping our 
culture. Experian's culture is a key enabler of 
our success, as evidenced by our track record 
of strong financial performance. Creating 
and maintaining an agile, innovative, high- 
performance culture remains a key priority for 
Experian as we look to maintain and further 
develop an environment that enables our 
employees to perform and be successful. 

The collegiate nature of the Experian Way, 
generated via our connected global network, 
has undoubtedly supported the achievement 
of our very strong financial results. The early 
indications are that we are successfully 
addressing the challenge of maintaining our 
strong culture in the new working world, 
where remote working becomes the normal 
practice and the majority of the workforce 
work remotely.

We started to participate in the Great Place 
To Work global survey in 2021, and the results 
to date show that the employee-focused 
initiatives introduced in recent years have been 
appreciated by our employees. Measuring 
culture is undeniably difficult but it is clearly 
a key enabler of business performance. 
To inform our own assessment of culture, the 
Committee considers a range of quantitative 
culture-related data. The quantitative data 
may also provide useful information for our 
investors and other stakeholders. Further 
insights on these important metrics can 
be found in the Sustainable Business 
Performance Data, including specific 
disclosures on Experian employee attrition 
and workforce composition. Details on DEI 
can be found on pages 51 and 52.

Experian’s executive remuneration 
policy
In recent years, we have benefitted from open 
and constructive shareholder engagement, 
which led to a number of changes to our 
Remuneration Policy at the 2020 AGM. 
Following these changes, we have been 
consistently applying the Remuneration Policy, 
and also incorporated some governance-led 
best-practice elements as appropriate. I was 
very pleased to see the strong level of 
shareholder support we received for our 
Remuneration Report at the 2022 AGM (95.7%). 
This Annual Report on directors’ remuneration 
will be put to shareholders for an advisory vote 
at the AGM on 19 July 2023, and we hope to 
receive investor support as no changes have 
been made to the policy.

The Committee proactively considers 
the incentive arrangements each year, to 
ensure they continue to be fit for purpose and 
aligned with the Group’s long-term strategy. 
It is also important for the Policy to reflect 
the rapidly changing environment which 
we operate in. The Committee is confident 
our current Remuneration Policy remains 
the most appropriate for our business, 
and its application is a critical enabler of 
our long-term strategic objectives, as it is 
designed to: 

 a achieve strong financial performance
 a incentivise long-term sustainable growth 
 a ensure effective shareholder alignment
 a facilitate the attraction of critical talent.

We have remained consistent with the Policy 
and approach throughout the external 
environment challenges of recent – and still 
current – times that has enabled Experian to 
focus on our long-term growth strategy. Our 
Remuneration Policy, and in particular its 
incentive plans, continued to test and motivate 
our leadership teams to successfully achieve 
exceptional growth. Importantly, we were able 
to retain critical talent and we did not need to:

 a make any changes to our current LTI plans, 

including the performance targets
 a make any change to the performance 
metrics or evaluation methodology.

In November 2022 and again in February 2023, 
we issued letters to our major shareholders 
and the proxy advisory bodies. These letters 
were an update on our approach to executive 
pay in FY23 and our Remuneration Policy, to 
invite any comments and feedback. We were 
very pleased to receive a lot of support for our 
current approach to executive remuneration. 
For full transparency we have included some 
details on the questions raised and our 
responses, to provide some additional context.

Q&A

Q: Is Experian making any changes to the 
Remuneration Policy when it is renewed 
at the 2023 AGM?

A: No. We are simply incorporating the 
recently made change to align the pension 
provision of our incumbent UK-based 
executive directors to that of the majority 
of the UK wider workforce. As we have 
previously disclosed, the Committee 
proactively considers the Remuneration Policy 
each year, to ensure it continues to be fit for 
purpose, remains aligned with the Group’s 
long-term strategy, and also reflects the 
rapidly changing environment we operate in. 
The proposed policy will be put to 
shareholders for approval under an advisory 
vote at the AGM on 19 July 2023.

We do not therefore propose to make any 
changes to our Remuneration Policy in 2023. 
However, we highly value our investors' 
insights and will maintain our approach to 
meaningful, open and honest engagement.

Q: Does Experian anticipate 
incorporating environmental, social 
and governance (ESG) metrics into the 
executive incentive plans?

A: To date, we have undertaken a number of 
steps to ensure that we continue to operate 
very responsibly across the ESG spectrum as 
part of the Company’s ‘DNA’ without needing 
to incorporate a specific metric into our 
incentive plans.

During the process of considering the 
renewal of our Remuneration Policy this year, 
the Board and Remuneration Committee 
have thought long and hard about our 
position in relation to ESG. For example, 
some observers suggest that including 
Scope 1, 2 or 3 emissions incentive targets 
would be straightforward. However, it’s 
important to note that we are not a 

carbon-intense business and are already 
making very good progress on carbon 
reductions and include significant details in 
our Annual Report. As we have a strong 
preference to reward our executive directors 
for the achievement of strategic rather than 
baseline objectives, carbon targets do not 
seem to us to be the right area for focus.

We believe any metric included would need 
to resonate strongly with our purpose of 
creating a better tomorrow by improving 
financial inclusion. Our view is that 
determining an appropriate financial 
inclusion metric is far from straightforward 
and thus it will take time to develop and test 
a metric that is robust enough to include in an 
incentive framework. Financial inclusion is 
not only about improving the access to 
financial resources. It is important to 
understand the true benefits of that access. It 
is arguably slightly easier to develop a metric 
that could be used in our Consumer Services 
business but focusing solely on such a metric 
could inadvertently skew our incentive 
approach away from the full breadth of our 
businesses across the Group. So, we will 
continue to explore the potential introduction 
of a purpose-driven ESG metric and maintain 
our very constructive engagement with our 
major shareholders on that journey. 

Q: Many FTSE 100 companies are 
looking to support their employees 
as they face the cost-of-living crisis. 
What steps, if any, has Experian taken 
to help the wider workforce?

A: As we have previously disclosed, even 
before the onset of the COVID-19 pandemic, 
our focus had been on ensuring we continue to 
protect our employees, our shareholders, and 
the societies in which we operate. We ensured 
that all our employees were provided with 
important support to deal with both the 
personal and professional challenges to be 
able to work safely and effectively from home. 

We also recognised the hard work and 
commitment of our employees by granting 
US$800 worth of Thank You Shares to all 
employees below senior management level.

Thank You Shares
 a In August 2021, we granted shares 

worth US$800 to all employees below 
senior management, with the promise 
of a further two-for-one matching share 
award in August 2024 if employees 
chose to retain their original share 
award. 

 a The purpose of the Award was to thank 
employees for their dedication and 
resilience over the pandemic, and by 
offering the award in shares together 
with the future matching award, we can 
ensure all employees can benefit from 
our future share price growth ambitions. 

 a The plan was very well received by 

employees, with 75% of employees still 
holding their original shares more than 
21 months after the original grant.

The current cost-of-living challenge has again 
demonstrated our strong track record of 
putting our employees first by focusing on 
those who need the support the most. As an 
example, our lowest paid UK employees have 
received a one-off allowance to help with the 
impact of rising inflation. In addition, we have 
taken the opportunity to remind all our 
employees about the resources and support 
that are available to them as part of our 
financial wellbeing offer. This includes support 
across a whole range of topics including 
financial planning, mortgage advice, loan and 
debt management, helpful guides, tax 
planning and financial protection as well as 
highlighting our employee benefits.

Looking forward
Following another year of delivering strong 
financial growth, we look forward with a lot of 
positive momentum. The external environment 
continues to bring many challenges but I 
remain very confident that we will continue to 
achieve our ambitions of strong growth and 
financial outcomes, and high levels of business 
performance underpinned by long-term 
strategy and investment. The combination of 
the investments that we have made, the 
decisions that we have taken and a focus on 

executing our business plans across all our 
key markets, can make FY24 another good 
performance year for Experian. 

I joined the Experian Board in September 2020 
and when I became Remuneration Committee 
Chair at the conclusion of the 2022 AGM, I was 
very pleased to be inheriting the role with very 
strong shareholder engagement and support 
for our executive remuneration arrangements. 
In advance of this year’s Remuneration Policy 
vote, I have been hugely encouraged by the 
nature of our shareholder consultation. 

The engagement has been conducted in our 
usual open and constructive manner and the 
ability to listen, discuss and act upon the 
insightful feedback from our major 
shareholders and the proxy advisory bodies is 
incredibly valuable. 

I hope that I have provided some helpful 
background and broader context on Experian's 
FY23 performance that enables shareholders 
to support both our Remuneration Policy and 
our Annual report on directors’ remuneration 
at the 2023 AGM.

Executive director remuneration arrangements for FY24
 a Salary increases of 2.5% awarded to executive directors effective 

1 June 2023.

 a Pension contributions for UK-based executive directors were 

aligned with the rate provided to the majority of the UK workforce 
(10% of salary) from 1 January 2023 (previously already aligned 
in USA). 

 a Annual bonus based on Benchmark EBIT (80%) and revenue 
performance (20%). The opportunity is 200% of base salary. 
Half of any payout must be deferred into the CIP for three years.
 a CIP awards will be based on cumulative Benchmark operating 

cash flow (50%) and adjusted Benchmark EPS (50%). The 
maximum award remains a 2:1 match.

 a PSP awards will be based on TSR (25%), adjusted ROCE (25%) and 
adjusted Benchmark EPS (50%) performance. The opportunity of 
200% of base salary is unchanged.

 a Two-year post-vest holding period applies to both CIP and 

PSP awards.

 a Malus and clawback provisions apply to all incentive awards. 
 a Existing in-employment shareholding guidelines will apply for 

two years post-employment.

The above charts are prepared on the following basis:
Fixed pay: includes FY24 base salary, FY24 cash in lieu of pension allowances and assumes a similar value of benefits as FY23.
Target: includes fixed pay plus the level of performance required to deliver 50% of the maximum annual bonus, and 50% of the maximum PSP and CIP awards respectively, with the CIP matching award 
being based on 100% deferral.
Maximum: includes fixed pay plus the maximum annual bonus payment and full vesting of the CIP and PSP awards, with the CIP matching award being based on 100% deferral of a maximum annual 
bonus. 
Maximum: with 50% share price increase: includes all elements included in maximum and assumes the share price increases 50% above that on the date of grant. The 50% share price increase has been 
applied to shares received under the PSP and matching shares awarded under the CIP. Dividend equivalents are excluded from the above scenario models.

1  For Kerry Williams and Craig Boundy, the salary also reflects the timing of US payroll payments and time served during the financial year as an executive director.
2  Value delivered through performance is calculated as the number of shares vesting under the CIP and PSP multiplied by the share price on the date of grant. None of the executive directors exercised share 

options in the year ended 31 March 2023. For Kerry Williams and Craig Boundy this reflects time served during the financial year as an executive director.

3  For FY23, the value delivered through share price growth and dividends is calculated as (i) the difference between the average share price in the last three months of the financial year and the share price 

on the date of grant multiplied by the number of vested performance shares, plus (ii) dividend equivalent payments for the number of vested performance shares. 

4  For FY23, the total single figure of remuneration for Brian Cassin and Lloyd Pitchford in US$, applying the average exchange rate over the year of £1:US$1.2046 (2022: £1:US$1.3665), is US$8.9m 

(2022: US$11.7m) and US$5.5m (2022: US$7.3m) respectively.

Benefits and pension
Taxable benefits include life insurance, private healthcare, a company car or car allowance and, where relevant, the value of any gain realised on 
exercising Sharesave options.

Brian Cassin and Lloyd Pitchford are eligible to participate in a defined contribution pension plan but elected not to do so during the year ended 
31 March 2023. In 2023, Brian Cassin received a cash supplement of £177,677 (2022: £198,250), and Lloyd Pitchford received a cash supplement 
of £109,750 (2022: £122,500), in lieu of their pension contributions.

Kerry Williams participated in a defined contribution plan (401k). The company contribution to this during the part of the year that he served as an 
executive director was US$4,423 (2022: US$11,831). Craig Boundy does not participate in a defined contribution plan (401k).

No executive director has a prospective right to a defined benefit pension.

Annual bonus
Overview
All Experian employees participate in a variable pay plan. We have one annual bonus plan in operation across Experian and the majority (c.16,000) of 
our workforce participate in this plan. The remainder of employees participate in a sales commission plan. How the annual bonus plan works varies 
slightly depending on region and grade. For the vast majority of employees, annual bonus awards are based on the performance of their particular 
business line or region.

Executive directors are required to defer half of any annual bonus earned for three years through the CIP, although they may choose to defer more. 
This year, as in previous years, all three executive directors in office at 31 March 2023 chose to voluntarily defer their full bonus payments into the CIP.

Our executive annual bonus plan is based upon two performance metrics, which are Benchmark EBIT growth (80% weighting) and revenue 
performance (20% weighting). Benchmark EBIT is an important earnings metric and focuses on items directly within management’s control. 
To balance the profit focus of Benchmark EBIT, revenue performance growth was added to the bonus plan in FY20 to provide an important quality 
of earnings element to the annual performance.

How do we set the bonus targets?
Performance-related pay is a key component of our reward structure for all employees and, as such, setting stretch targets is a critical focus area for 
the Committee. Every year we undertake a rigorous exercise to ensure our targets are sufficiently stretching, taking into consideration the external 
marketplace and our own performance aspirations. The Committee considers targets at two separate Remuneration Committee meetings during the 
year:

Step 1 

Step 2 

Step 3 

In January, the Committee considers the 
wider market context, and is presented with
an early indication of how performance is 
tracking in the current year. 

The Committee’s independent remuneration 
advisers are invited to provide the Committee 
with a wider assessment of the pay and 
governance environments in the relevant 
locations for our business.    

In March, budgets for the forthcoming year 
are discussed and agreed by the Board.

At its March meeting, the Committee  
has a first look at possible targets for the 
forthcoming year, taking into account a 
number of factors including: 

the strategic plan

brokers’ earnings estimates

wider economic expectations 

our key competitors’ earnings estimates,
including a number of different peer
groups. 

By the time the Committee meets again 
in May, budgets for the forthcoming year 
have been agreed and the performance 
outcomes for the current year have been 
reviewed by our auditor. 

The Committee takes these into account 
during its determination of prior year 
outcomes and its final review of the 
targets for the current year, before 
signing them off. 

The Committee is able to take a holistic approach to setting targets, as all our non-executive directors sit on the Remuneration Committee, as well as 
on all of our other principal Board Committees. This ensures Committee members are fully apprised of the wider business context and the Group’s 
business prospects over the coming years, particularly as the Board meeting to discuss the budget and business plan usually takes place prior to the 
Remuneration Committee meeting.

Annual bonus outcome
Revenue performance is calculated as the Group total revenue growth after the removal of intra-Group sales, and Benchmark EBIT is based on 
ongoing activities. Performance is measured on a constant currency basis to strip out the effects of exchange rate fluctuations, which are outside of 
management’s control. The Committee also excludes the impact of any material acquisitions or disposals made in the year, to ensure both metrics are 
measured consistently, which is in line with our approach to long-term incentive plan measures.

The FY23 annual bonus targets were set at a stretch level that, for both metrics, required double-digit growth to achieve maximum. Building on the 
resilient performance of recent years, these targets were designed to signal our continued growth ambitions.

Before approving the annual bonus outcomes, the Committee discussed whether or not the proposed payout was appropriate in the context of both 
the current external environment and the Group’s wider business performance during the year. The Committee also considers other factors reviewed 
by the Board, such as our Net Promoter Score, employee experience, employee engagement results, direct employee feedback to the Committee 
Chair at the People Forum, and the broader stakeholder experience over the financial year.

The Committee agreed that the Company’s financial performance was aligned with its holistic assessment of performance and was also satisfied 
that it did not need to exercise any discretion, and that the level of bonus payout was appropriate. 

As such, the resulting annual bonus outcomes for each executive director (up to a maximum of 200% of salary), for the year ended 31 March 2023, 
are set out in the table below.

1  Bonus amounts for Craig Boundy and Kerry Williams reflect the time served as an executive director during the financial year.

Each of the eligible executive directors has elected to defer their full bonus into Experian shares under the CIP for a three-year period. Deferred bonus 
shares are not subject to any further conditions but may be matched, subject to the conditions set out in the CIP awards section below. 

Share-based incentives
The share-based incentive amount included in the single total figure of remuneration is the combined value of the CIP and PSP awards vesting in 
respect of the relevant financial year. For FY23, these relate to the awards granted on 11 June 2020 and for FY22 they relate to the awards granted 
on 12 June 2019. Vesting in 2023 for both the CIP and PSP awards is determined based on performance over the three years ended 31 March 2023, 
as well as continued service. 

The 2020 LTI targets were set in November 2020, when our growth ambitions were to achieve sustainable annual high single-digit growth and the 
Committee has not exercised any discretion, nor made any adjustments, in determining the vesting outcomes for the 2020 LTI awards. Our resilient 
performance in the first year of the performance period at the onset of the global COVID-19 pandemic, combined with our strong financial 
performance in second and third years of the performance period, resulted in the formulaic vesting results outlined in the table below. The Committee 
reviewed the financial performance, but also considered the experience of our investors, employees and other stakeholders over the three-year 
performance period. Through this broadest lens, the Committee judged the formulaic results to be fair and balanced and, as such, did not make any 
adjustments to the vesting results. The tables below show the performance achieved on the targets for the CIP and PSP awards granted in June 2020:

In line with the approach taken in previous years, the cumulative Benchmark operating cash flow targets shown above have been adjusted compared to those originally set to take into account the impact 
of acquisitions and disposals made over the performance period. The actual cumulative Benchmark operating cash flow over the performance period, of US$5.2bn, is determined on a constant currency 
basis. This is in line with our approach for all performance metrics, to ensure that awards are measured on a consistent basis.

No discretion was applied in determining the share-based payments that vested in either FY23 or FY22.

Shares awarded in the above table to Craig Boundy were made prior to his appointment as a director.

The value of Craig Boundy’s and Kerry Williams’ shares has been converted into US dollars at a rate of £1:US$1.22, which is the average rate during 
the last three months of FY23.

Dividend equivalents of 148.25 US cents per share will be paid on vested shares. These represent the value of the dividends that would have been paid 
to the owner of one share between the date of grant and the date of vesting.

The chart to the right shows the make-up of the CEO’s FY23 single figure 
value, including £4.9m relating to the LTI. 

Of the £4.9m LTI value disclosed for the CEO, 92% is the value at grant, 
3.9% is the value of dividend equivalent payments and 4.1% is a result of 
share price growth between the grant date and the average price over 
the last three months of the financial year.

What share-based incentive awards did we make in the year? (audited)
On 8 June 2022, awards were granted to the executive directors under the CIP and PSP. The face value of awards made to Brian Cassin and Lloyd 
Pitchford is shown in pounds sterling; the face value of awards made to Craig Boundy and Kerry Williams is shown in US dollars. The number of 
shares awarded to Craig Boundy and Kerry Williams was calculated using the average exchange rate for the three days prior to grant of £1:US$1.24. 
All awards have been calculated using a three-day average share price.

In line with the CIP rules, invested shares for Brian Cassin and Lloyd Pitchford were purchased with their bonuses net of tax. In line with the rules of 
The Experian North America Co-investment Plan, invested shares for Craig Boundy and Kerry Williams were calculated with reference to their gross 
bonuses. Matching awards are based on the gross value of the bonus deferred.

The Committee retains the right to vary the level of vesting if it believes the level of vesting determined by measuring performance is inconsistent 
with the Group’s underlying financial and operational performance over the performance period. These awards will also only vest if the Committee 
is satisfied the vesting is not based on materially misstated financial results.

CEO pay ratio 
Experian follows good corporate governance and transparency in reporting remuneration for our executive directors and employees. We have 
presented below the CEO pay ratio for the year ended 31 March 2023, in line with the UK regulatory requirements. The pay ratios have been calculated 
using Option A of the three methodologies provided under the regulations, which we believe is the most statistically accurate approach.

Experian plc GovernanceCode principle Remuneration133

The CEO value used is the total single figure remuneration data for FY23 of £7.4m, as outlined on page 127. For UK employees, total pay and benefits 
are based on actual earnings for the year to 31 March 2023. Annual incentive payments for employees have been calculated using the Experian Group 
financial performance outcome for FY23, as disclosed on page 129, rather than any regional or market business performance results, to ensure a 
like-for-like comparison across remuneration structures. Selected employee grades below senior leaders level are also eligible for annual awards of 
restricted stock, rather than the performance share awards provided to senior leaders. Where applicable, the LTI value for employees has been 
calculated by applying the average share price for the three months prior to 31 March 2023 to the number of restricted stock awards granted to the 
employee in June 2020. We adopted this approach to provide a like-for-like comparison and ensure the share price growth over the previous three 
years is reflected equally in both the CEO and employee LTI values. Employees on inbound and outbound international assignments to and from the 
UK have been excluded from the analysis as their remuneration structures understandably deviate from the standard approach for UK employees. 
In line with the guidance, only individuals employed for the full year have been included in the analysis.

Observations on change in CEO pay ratio
The CEO voluntarily waived 25% of his salary for six months in FY21, resulting in a significantly lower salary than in a ‘normal’ year. The FY23 CEO 
single figure has decreased by c.26% compared to FY22. By comparison, the total pay and benefits provided to UK employees in FY23 increased. As a 
result, the FY23 CEO pay ratios for all percentiles are lower than FY22, but importantly are significantly lower than for FY20 which, as a more typical 
performance year, is arguably a more appropriate comparison for change. 

The primary reason for the lower FY23 CEO pay ratio is the value of the LTI received by the CEO in FY23. As outlined earlier in the Report, the 
Committee did not exercise any discretion, nor make any adjustments, in determining the vesting outcomes for either the 2019 or 2020 LTI awards. 
While the FY23 performance was very resilient, and resulted in strong LTI vesting outturns, the performance was not as strong as FY22 and this has 
resulted in a lower FY23 single figure value. By way of comparison, the total pay and benefit amounts received by UK employees in FY23 are higher 
than in FY22 due to the introduction of additional benefit policies in FY23, including increased bonus opportunities for UK employees in response to 
employee feedback gathered as part of the UK Total Reward Optimisation project. 

The Committee believes it is appropriate that a significant proportion of total remuneration for executive directors is ‘at risk’ and based entirely on 
Group performance, which is within their power to influence. In line with our remuneration principles, the proportion of total compensation that is ‘at 
risk’ increases with employee seniority within the Group. The remuneration framework is designed to offer market-competitive total compensation. 
All UK employees participate in a variable pay plan. We have one annual bonus plan in operation across Experian and the majority (c.16,000) of our 
workforce participate in this plan, providing them with the opportunity to benefit from the financial performance they help achieve. 

Understandably, more of the CEO’s total target remuneration (71%) is ‘at risk’ compared to c.8% on average for UK-based employees. As evidenced in 
both FY23 and FY22, the CEO pay ratio is therefore likely to vary over time, potentially significantly, based on the Group’s performance outcomes. 

Observations on FY23 pay ratio
The median pay ratio for FY23 of 97:1 reflects not only the strong performance achieved in FY23, but also the resilient performance achieved in the 
preceding two financial years, which are reflected in the CEO’s LTI vesting values. As LTI values can be highly variable, in part due to fluctuations in 
share price, a supplemental pay ratio has been provided below, where the value of LTIs has been excluded. The CEO single figure value excluding 
LTI compensation was £2.4m for FY23.

Some important additional context regarding our FY23 CEO pay ratio includes the following:

 a We have a rigorous approach to salary management that is underpinned by regular market benchmarking to ensure we offer competitive rates of 

pay across the business. We undertake regular reviews to maintain appropriate positioning with external market-linked salary ranges. 

 a Experian has been a Living Wage employer in the UK since 2015, and the median salary for our UK employees (as reflected in the table on the 

previous page) is more than 50% above the UK average.

 a The Committee always has the context of the all-employee pay review budget when determining salary increases for the CEO, and ensures any 

percentage increase for the CEO does not exceed that provided to employees. In FY23, the average increase for the UK employee base pay was 4% 
and a 2.5% increase was provided to the CEO. For FY24, the UK salary review budget is 3%, while the CEO’s salary will increase by 2.5%. 
 a An ‘individual performance modifier’ is also applied in calculating the annual bonus payments for employees, to ensure the outstanding 

contribution of high-performing individuals is reflected through higher bonus payments. Individual performance modifiers do not apply to senior 
management, including the CEO. As such, to ensure a like-for-like comparison with the CEO single figure, the employee calculations, as outlined on 
the previous page, do not reflect the impact of individual performance modifiers, which would have considerably increased the annual bonus 
payments for employees and reduced the CEO pay ratio accordingly. 

 a We have not included the value of our Sharesave scheme in the all-employee values on the previous page. We firmly believe in the value of 

employee share ownership and encourage employees to participate in our Sharesave offering, which is a tax-efficient plan in the UK and allows 
employees to share in Experian’s growth and success. Around 75% of UK employees participate in Sharesave and the average profit received by 
UK employees at maturity in FY23 was £2,365, but this value has not been included in the all-employee values on page 134.

Annual report on directors’ remuneration

How has our Board of directors' pay changed compared to the wider workforce?
The table below sets out the percentage change in the Board of directors' salaries/fees, benefits and annual bonus between FY21, FY22 and FY23, 
and how this compares to the average percentage change for our UK employees. While the Regulations require the employee comparison against 
employees of Experian plc, the proportion of our workforce employed by Experian plc is comparatively very small. We have therefore elected, as in 
previous years to provide the comparison with our UK employees, which we believe provides an appropriately representative analysis. We have 
selected this group of employees because Experian operates in 32 countries and, as such, has widely varying approaches to pay across different 
regions. This approach also avoids the complexities involved in collating and comparing remuneration data across different regional populations, 
including the impact of foreign exchange rate movements. The figures for UK employees are consistent with the information used to prepare the CEO 
pay ratio analysis, but reflect average salaries and average employee numbers each year, rather than percentile data. For the CEO, the annual bonus 
is based on Group performance. As previously disclosed, in FY21 the executive directors each waived 25% of their salaries for six months and this is 
behind the year-on-year base salary change for Brian Cassin, Lloyd Pitchford and Kerry Williams.

1  The increase in taxable benefits for Lloyd Pitchford is entirely attributable to the value of his SAYE options which vested in FY22.
2  Dr Ruba Borna, Deirdre Mahlan and George Rose all stepped down from the Board in FY23 and therefore their fees earned in FY23 compared to FY22 are lower.
3  Alison Brittain's increase reflects additional responsibilities as Senior Independent Director. Jonathan Howell became Chair of the Audit Committee.

How do we intend to implement the remuneration policy next year?

Salary
The table below outlines the salary increases that will take effect from 1 June 2023 for each executive director. The employee salary review budget 
for FY24 is 3% for our employees both in the USA and the UK.

Annual bonus
For the year ending 31 March 2024, the annual bonus opportunity and the performance measures the executive directors are assessed on will remain 
unchanged from FY23.

In line with our policy, we will disclose the targets for the annual bonus in next year’s Annual report on directors’ remuneration. While the FY24 annual 
bonus targets cannot be disclosed due to their commercial sensitivity, they reflect our resilience in the face of the challenging outlook for the year 
ahead. Annual bonus will be subject to clawback provisions, allowing the Group to recover all or part of any payment for a period of three years from 
payment. In addition, the Committee can vary the level of payout if it considers that the formulaic payout determined by measuring performance is 
inconsistent with the Group’s actual underlying financial and operational performance.

Performance is measured on a constant currency basis to strip out the effects of exchange rate fluctuations, which are outside of management’s 
control. The Committee also excludes the impact of any material acquisitions or disposals made in the year to ensure both metrics are measured 
consistently, which is in line with our approach to long-term incentive plan measures.

Experian plc GovernanceCode principle Remuneration135

Share-based incentives
While deferral of 50% is compulsory, the executive directors have each elected to defer the full 100% of their FY23 bonuses into the CIP. We expect to 
grant matching shares in the first quarter of the year ending 31 March 2024, on a two-for-one basis. We also expect to grant PSP awards equivalent to 
200% of salary at the same time. The CIP and PSP awards will vest subject to meeting the following targets, which will be measured over three years, 
with a further two-year holding period applying:

Performance measure
CIP awards
Benchmark Earnings per share (average annual growth)2
Cumulative Benchmark operating cash flow
PSP awards
Benchmark Earnings per share (average annual growth)2

The Committee selected adjusted Benchmark EPS, cumulative Benchmark operating cash flow and adjusted ROCE as performance metrics for our 
long-term incentive plans, as they reflect three of our key performance indicators. As such, using these measures directly links Experian’s long-term 
incentive arrangements to our strategic ambitions and business objectives. In addition, using relative TSR recognises the importance of creating value 
for shareholders. We believe these measures to be the most appropriate measures of the Group’s success and, together with our annual bonus 
measures, they ensure that executive directors are incentivised to achieve a wide range of business and financial measures over both the short and 
long term. The structure differentiates the role of each of our long-term incentive plans: the PSP incentivises returns and the CIP incentivises cash 
discipline. However, given that growth is so fundamental to our business strategy, growth in Benchmark EPS runs across both of the long-term 
incentive plans.

Vesting of CIP and PSP awards will be subject to the Committee being satisfied that the vesting is not based on materially misstated financial results. 
The Committee also retains the discretion to vary the level of vesting if it considers the level of vesting determined by measuring performance is 
inconsistent with the Group’s underlying financial and operational performance. These awards will all be subject to clawback provisions, allowing the 
Company to recover all or part of any vested award during the holding period.

TSR performance
We measure our TSR performance relative to the FTSE 100 Index, rather than to a bespoke comparator group. Our usual comparator companies are 
Bread Financial, CoreLogic, Dun & Bradstreet, Equifax, FICO, LiveRamp, Moody’s, RELX, Thomson Reuters and TransUnion. However, we believe it 
would be difficult to compare our TSR performance with them on a consistent basis, since many of them are listed in different markets and, as such, 
may be subject to different market forces. Nevertheless, the Committee uses them as a reference point when reviewing other aspects of executive 
director pay.

Additional disclosures

Directors’ shareholdings and share interests (audited)
We believe it is important that executive directors build up a significant holding in Experian shares, to align their interests with those of shareholders. 
Under our guidelines, the CEO should hold the equivalent of at least three times his or her base salary in Experian shares and other executive directors 
should hold the equivalent of at least two times their base salary. These guidelines include invested or deferred shares held under the CIP, but not 
unvested matching shares. Shares that have vested but are subject to the two-year holding period will also count towards the guideline. Until the 
shareholding guideline is met, we expect executive directors to retain at least 50% of any shares vesting (net of tax) under a share award. Unvested shares 
do not count towards the guideline.

We also have guidelines for non-executive directors to build up a holding in Experian’s shares at least equal to their annual fee. Each financial year, the net 
fee for the first quarter is used to purchase Experian shares until the non-executive director reaches this holding.

As set out in the table below, our executive directors already significantly exceed their personal shareholding guidelines, demonstrating their alignment 
to shareholder interests as well as their commitment to Experian. To further strengthen this alignment post-employment, the Remuneration Committee 
introduced a two-year post-employment shareholding guideline as part of the 2020 Policy review.

Payments made to former directors (audited)
Three former directors of Experian Finance plc (formerly GUS plc) received unfunded pensions from the Group. One of the former directors is now 
paid under the Secured Unfunded Retirement Benefit Scheme, which provides security for the unfunded pensions of executives affected by the 
His Majesty’s Revenue and Customs (HMRC) earnings cap. The total unfunded pensions paid to the former directors amounted to £814,000 in the year 
ended 31 March 2023. As previously disclosed, Kerry Williams stepped down from the Board at last year’s AGM on 21 July 2022 but continued to work 
for the Group before retiring on 31 March 2023. He continued to receive his salary (US$1,075,000) and other contractual benefits during this time and 
remained incentive eligible until his final day of employment as is our standard practice. He did not receive any additional or exceptional payments 
as part of his leaving (retirement) arrangements.

Payments for loss of office (audited)
No payments for loss of office were made in the year (2022: US$nil).

This feedback was provided to the Board thereafter. 

 a Chair wrote to major shareholders and the proxy advisory bodies to maintain the existing engagement levels and to offer the opportunity to discuss 
any topics of interest. Chair subsequently met with everyone who wished to avail of that opportunity. The themes and discussion points of those 
meetings were provided to the Board thereafter. 

Advice provided to the Committee
In making its decisions, the Committee consults the Chair, the Chief Executive Officer and the Chief People Officer where required.

We also invite members of the Global Reward team to attend Committee meetings as appropriate. We normally consult the Chief Financial Officer 
about performance conditions applying to short- and long-term incentive arrangements, to ensure they are appropriately financially stretching. 
However, we do not consider it appropriate that executives are present when their own remuneration arrangements are being discussed.

The Committee has access to independent consultants to ensure it receives objective advice. We reviewed our external advisers in 2013 and 
appointed Towers Watson Ltd (Willis Towers Watson), who remained our external advisers throughout the year ended 31 March 2023. Willis Towers 
Watson provides other services to Experian globally, including advice on benefits and provision of market data.

Additionally, Ellason LLP (Ellason) provided incentive plan award valuations and remuneration data, as well as supporting data for the target 
calibration process. Ellason does not provide any other services to the Group.

Willis Towers Watson and Ellason are members of the Remuneration Consultants Group and voluntarily operate under the Code of Conduct in relation 
to executive remuneration consulting in the UK. The Committee was satisfied that their advice was objective and independent.

The fees paid to these advisers for services to the Committee in the year ended 31 March 2023, based on hours spent, were as follows:

Directors’ remuneration policy

The Directors’ remuneration policy was last approved by shareholders at the AGM on 22 July 2020. Shareholder approval will be sought at the 2023 
AGM for the Policy as set out below.

The 2023 Policy table below includes the changes already made and supported by shareholders in the last three years. The most recent change was 
to introduce the pension provision alignment for UK-based executive directors. This change was signalled to shareholders well in advance of its 
introduction. From 1 January 2023, the pension provision for UK-based executive directors was aligned to the pension provision for the majority of the 
UK employee workforce. Alongside the Policy table, we have also included the Which clawback provisions apply? section, which we consider to be the 
most helpful sections of the Policy for investors. No other changes are being made to the policy.

The full and original version of the Policy, as approved by shareholders, is available on the Experian corporate website via www.experianplc.com/
investors/reports.

Operation

Maximum potential value

Performance metrics 
and weightings

Base salary is paid in equal instalments during the year.

Salaries are reviewed annually, with any increases 
generally taking effect from 1 June.

Salary levels and increases take into account a 
number of factors, including the approach to employee 
remuneration throughout the Group, prevailing 
economic conditions, best practice and positioning 
against the market.

Annual executive director salary 
increases will, in normal 
circumstances, be limited to the 
increases awarded across the 
Group as a whole.

Higher increases may be made in 
exceptional circumstances including, 
but not limited to, a change in role or 
responsibility, and will take account 
of market practice in relation to the 
new role.

When the Committee considers 
salary increases, it takes into 
account individual performance 
over the preceding financial year.

The Group provides a range of market-competitive 
benefits that include, but are not limited to, healthcare, 
financial and tax advice, death-in-service provision and 
company car or allowance.

Executive directors can also participate in any of the 
Group’s all-employee share plans, for example the 
Sharesave plan, on the same basis as other eligible 
employees.

In the USA, eligible executive directors may participate 
in a deferred compensation plan, which is standard 
market practice in the USA.

For expatriate assignments, we retain the flexibility to 
tailor benefits to the circumstances of the assignment.

Additional benefits may include relocation expenses at 
the beginning and end of each assignment, housing 
allowance and school fees.

Pension arrangements are in line with local 
market practice.

In the UK, the Group operates a defined contribution 
plan, with company contributions set as a percentage 
of base salary. If impacted by His Majesty’s Revenue 
and Customs (HMRC) pension limits, an individual 
may elect to receive a cash allowance instead.

In the USA, executive directors are eligible to join 
a defined contribution plan.

The cost of providing such benefits 
may vary from year to year, reflecting 
the cost to the Group.

None.

The Committee sets benefits at a level 
it considers appropriate against 
relevant market practice, the role and 
particular circumstances (for example, 
in the case of expatriate benefits, 
where the individual is required to 
relocate).

In the UK, the cash payment or pension 
contribution for executive directors is 
normally equal to 10% of annual gross 
base salary, which aligns to the wider 
UK employee workforce.

None.

In the USA, the contribution rate is up 
to 4% of earnings, up to an annual 
compensation limit set by the US 
Internal Revenue Service.

If required, pension arrangements 
in other jurisdictions would be in line 
with local market practice.

level of bonus to be paid.

Half of any bonus must be deferred for a period of 
three years. However, the executive director may elect 
to defer up to 100% of their bonus into the CIP. Where 
they elect not to do so, payment is made as soon as 
practicable after the financial year end.

Malus and clawback provisions apply, under which 
annual bonus payments may be reduced or recovered 
in certain circumstances. Further details about our 
clawback and malus policy are set out in the Which 
clawback provisions apply? section of the report.

Threshold performance results in 
a bonus payout equivalent to 25% 
of the maximum. No bonus is payable 
for below-threshold performance.

Achieving target performance results 
in a bonus payout equivalent to 50% 
of the maximum.

Achieving maximum performance 
results in a full bonus payout of 
200% of salary.

The annual bonus may be based 
entirely on financial performance 
or on a combination of financial, 
strategic and/or operational 
objectives.

However, the financial element 
will comprise at least 70% of the 
bonus.

The Committee retains the ability 
to exercise its judgment to vary 
the level of payout if it considers 
that the formulaic payout 
determined by measuring 
performance is inconsistent with 
the Group’s actual underlying 
financial and operational 
performance.

Co-investment Plans 
Aligns with shareholder 
interests through voluntary 
investment of personal 
capital, delivery of Experian 
shares and the long-term 
time horizons.

Use of stretch financial

Aligns with shareholder 
interests through delivery 
of shares and the 
long-term time horizons.

Participants are invited to invest between 50% and 
100% of their annual bonus into Experian shares.

A conditional award of matching shares or nil-cost 
options is granted on a two-for-one basis on the gross 
bonus deferred, and vests after three years subject to 
achieving performance targets over the three-year 
period. Any vested awards are subject to a further 
two-year holding period.

Dividend equivalents accrue on all awards of shares.

Malus and clawback provisions apply, under which 
CIP awards may be reduced or recovered in certain 
circumstances. Further details about our malus and 
clawback policy are set out in the Which clawback 
provisions apply? section of the report.

Maximum award levels depend on 
the bonus deferred, which will be 
matched on up to a two-for-one basis.

There is no vesting for below-
threshold performance.

Achieving threshold performance 
results in 25% vesting of the matching 
shares.

Achieving target performance results 
in 50% vesting of the matching shares.

Achieving maximum performance 
results in full vesting of the matching 
shares.

Awards vest based on financial 
performance and subject to the 
Committee being satisfied that the 
vesting is not based on materially 
misstated financial results.

The Committee retains the 
discretion to exercise its judgment 
to vary the level of vesting if it 
considers the formulaic vesting 
level determined by measuring 
performance to be inconsistent 
with the Group’s actual underlying 
financial and operational 
performance.

Participants receive an annual award of conditional 
shares or nil-cost options, which vest after three years, 
subject to achieving performance targets over the 
three-year period. Any vested awards are subject to 
a further two-year holding period.

Normal maximum award levels are 
200% of salary.

Awards of up to 400% of salary may 
be made in exceptional circumstances 
such as recruitment.

Dividend equivalents accrue on all awards of shares.

Malus and clawback provisions apply, under which 
PSP awards may be reduced or recovered in certain 
circumstances. Further details about our malus 
and clawback policy are set out in the Which clawback 
provisions apply? section of the report.

There is no vesting for below-
threshold performance.

Achieving threshold performance 
results in 25% of the shares vesting.

Achieving maximum performance 
results in full vesting of the shares.

Vesting of up to 25% of the awards 
is based on a share-based metric, 
with the balance based on 
financial performance.

The Committee retains the ability 
to vary the level of vesting if it 
considers the formulaic vesting 
level determined by measuring 
performance to be inconsistent 
with the Group’s actual underlying 
financial and operational 
performance.

and promote a long-term 
approach to performance 
and risk management.

During employment:

N/A

N/A

Executive directors are required to establish and 
maintain a minimum personal shareholding equal in 
value to 3x base salary for the CEO and 2x base salary 
for other executive directors.

Executive directors are required to retain at least 50% of 
any shares vesting under the CIP and PSP (net of tax) 
until their during-employment shareholding guideline 
has been met.

Shares held beneficially, shares subject to a 
post-vesting holding period and invested or deferred CIP 
shares will count when assessing the guideline. Share 
awards that are still subject to performance conditions 
and matching shares under the CIP are not included.

Post-employment:

For two years following cessation, (former) executive 
directors are required to retain the lower of:
 a their actual shareholding immediately prior 

to cessation; and

 a their shareholding guideline immediately prior 

to cessation.

In determining the actual shareholding at cessation, 
shares acquired from own purchases will not be 
counted.

Independent Chair and non-executive director (NED) fees
To attract individuals with a 
broad range of experience 
and skills, to oversee the 
implementation of our 
strategy.

The Chair is paid an annual fee in equal instalments.  
The Group may provide the Chair with a limited range  
of benefits such as healthcare, tax advice or use of a 
car.

The NEDs are paid a basic fee plus additional fees for 
chairing a Board Committee and for the role of Deputy 
Chair or Senior Independent Director. NED fees are 
paid in equal quarterly instalments during the year. 
The net fee for the first quarter of the financial year is 
used to purchase Experian shares for NEDs and/or the 
Chair (as applicable), until the individual has met their 
shareholding guideline of 1x their estimated annual fee 
(excluding travel fees).

No performance-related 
arrangements are in place 
for the Chair or the NEDs.

The Committee sets the Chair’s 
fees, while NED fees are set by 
the Board. Both are set based on a 
number of factors, including the time 
commitment required and positioning 
against the market.

Fees are normally reviewed every 
two years.

Share Option Plan (SOP) 
Provides focus on 
increasing Experian’s 
share price over the 
medium to longer term.

NEDs receive an additional fee where attendance at 
Board meetings involves intercontinental travel from 
their home location. The Company may settle any tax 
due on travel expenses incurred by the Chair and NEDs.

Options are granted with an exercise price equivalent 
to the market value of an Experian share at the date 
of grant. These vest subject to achieving performance 
targets that are tested over a three-year period and 
are exercisable for seven years thereafter.

No option grants have been made since 2009 and the 
Committee has agreed that no further awards will be 
made, unless warranted by exceptional circumstances 
such as recruitment.

Malus and clawback provisions apply, under which 
SOP awards may be reduced or recovered in certain 
circumstances. Further details about our clawback 
and malus policy are set out in the Which clawback 
provisions apply? section of the report.

Normal maximum award levels are 
200% of salary.

The vesting of options is based on 
financial performance targets.

Grants of up to 400% of salary may be 
made in exceptional circumstances 
such as on recruitment.

There is no vesting for below-threshold 
performance.

Achieving threshold performance 
results in 25% of the options vesting.

Achieving maximum performance 
results in full vesting of the options.

Which clawback provisions apply? 
Clawback or malus applies to the Company’s incentive plans for five years from grant.

Under these provisions, the Committee may apply malus or clawback in circumstances that have:

 a resulted in a level of vesting or payment that is higher than would otherwise have been, because of a material misstatement of the Group’s financial 

results; or

 a led to a material financial or reputational loss for the Group, due to serious individual misconduct.

Under our malus and clawback policy, should a trigger event be identified, a Clawback Committee would be appointed by the Remuneration 
Committee to investigate the issue. The Clawback Committee would report back with recommendations on whether malus or clawback should 
be applied, which individuals this should affect, which remuneration should be subject to malus or clawback and the value that should be affected. 
The Remuneration Committee would then have final sign-off on any decision to operate malus or clawback.

Legacy arrangements
The Committee reserves the right to make any remuneration payments and payments for loss of office (including exercising any discretions available 
to it in connection with such payments), notwithstanding that they are not in line with the policy set out in this report where the entitlement to the 
payment arose (i) before the 2023 AGM; (ii) at a time when the relevant individual was not a director of the Company and, in the opinion of the 
Committee, the payment was not in consideration for the individual becoming a director of the Company; or (iii) under a remuneration policy previously 
approved by the Company’s shareholders. For these purposes, entitlements arising under the Company’s previous remuneration policy (as approved 
by shareholders at the 2020 AGM) will be incorporated into this policy and ‘payments’ includes the Committee satisfying awards of variable 
remuneration, and an entitlement under an award over shares arises at the time the award is granted.

How does our executive remuneration align with the pay of employees across the Group?
Salary

The salary review date for executive directors aligns with the salary review date for all our employees: 1 June each year.

Benefits and pension

Annual bonus

Long-term incentives

Pay scenarios

Executive director increases are aligned with typical increases awarded across the Group, under normal circumstances.
Benefits and pension arrangements are determined based on local market practice for all of our employees across the 
Group, including executive directors. From 2023 we have aligned the employer pension contributions for UK-based executive 
directors with those provided to the wider UK workforce. Our US executive director’s pension contribution is currently aligned, 
and will continue to be, with the US workforce.
All of our contracted employees participate in either an annual bonus plan or a commission scheme.

For the annual bonus, the opportunity and performance measures vary depending on grade, location and business unit, 
however the structure is broadly consistent for all employees.
Pay for senior management is primarily differentiated through the use of our long-term incentive plans. Executive directors 
and around 1,800 senior managers participate in either the PSP and CIP, or receive restricted share awards. As such, their 
pay is contingent on the achievement of performance targets and/or delivered in shares. This makes outcomes conditional 
on successfully delivering our business strategy and, in doing so, incentivises the delivery of long-term shareholder returns.

The above charts are prepared on the following basis:
Fixed pay: includes FY24 base salary, FY24 cash in lieu of pension allowances and assumes a similar value of benefits as FY23.
Target: includes fixed pay plus the level of performance required to deliver 50% of the maximum annual bonus, and 50% of the maximum PSP and CIP awards respectively, with the CIP matching award 
being based on 100% deferral.
Maximum: includes fixed pay plus the maximum annual bonus payment and full vesting of the CIP and PSP awards, with the CIP matching award being based on 100% deferral of a maximum annual 
bonus. 
Maximum: with 50% share price increase: includes all elements included in maximum and assumes the share price increases 50% above that on the date of grant. The 50% share price increase has been 
applied to shares received under the PSP and matching shares awarded under the CIP. Dividend equivalents are excluded from the above scenario models.

Directors’ remuneration policy
continued

Our approach to pay on recruitment of executive directors
As a global organisation, Experian competes for executive talent in 32 countries. In the marketplace of big-platform, FinTech companies, the demand 
for talented leaders often outstrips supply. From time to time, it may be necessary to appoint high-calibre executives to the Board, either by recruiting 
externally or by promoting from within the Group.

In developing a remuneration package for a newly appointed executive director, we would generally set a base salary which takes into account factors 
such as the individual’s skills and experience, the role they would be taking up, internal relativities, the marketplace they will operate in and their 
current remuneration package. The incentive arrangements and benefits we offer, including any relocation arrangements, would be in line with the 
remuneration policy set out in this report.

Maximum level of variable remuneration
We have set the usual maximum level of variable remuneration on recruitment at 800% of base salary. This is in line with the normal levels under our 
variable remuneration structure, and covers the maximum annual bonus, the maximum face value of a matching award under the CIP and the normal 
maximum face value of an award under the PSP.

When recruiting an executive director, the Committee would always seek to apply the normal maximum limits. However, we may, in exceptional 
circumstances, make use of one or more of the higher limits outlined in the remuneration policy if we felt this was necessary in order to secure the 
appointment of a particular individual.

In the case of an internal promotion to the Board, any existing variable pay element or benefit may be allowed to continue on the same terms.

Buyout awards
For an external appointment to the Board, the Committee may offer further one-off cash and/or share-based remuneration, to compensate the 
individual for forfeiting any incentive awards made to them by their former employer. We would aim to make this equivalent in value, by taking into 
account the likelihood of vesting, after assessing the conditions attached to any such awards. As far as possible, we would also replicate the form 
(i.e. whether cash or share-based) and the timeframe in which vesting was scheduled to occur. These awards may be granted under the terms of 
UK Listing Rule 9.4.2.

Directors’ service contracts and policy on payments for loss of office

Current contracts
Brian Cassin and Lloyd Pitchford have service agreements which are terminable by 12 months’ notice from Experian Limited or six months’ notice 
from them. The agreement provides for payment in lieu of notice in respect of base salary only.

Craig Boundy has a service agreement with Experian Services Corp. (ESC) that is terminable by 12 months’ notice from ESC or six months’ notice 
from him. The agreement provides for payment in lieu of notice in respect of base salary only.

Non-executive directors do not have service contracts but each has a letter of appointment with no provision for any termination payment. Each 
appointment is for a renewable three-year term, subject to election or re-election by shareholders, but may be terminated by either party on one 
month’s written notice (six months’ notice in the case of the Chair). Upon termination a non-executive director will be entitled to receive fees and 
benefits up to the date of termination.

Policy for new hires
Our policy for new hires is that service contracts will generally require no more than 12 months’ notice of termination of employment and will follow 
the UK Corporate Governance Code (the Code) guidelines. We believe that this is in line with best practice, remains market competitive and allows 
Experian to recruit people who we identify as critical to our future performance.

Policy on payments for loss of office
The table below sets out our policy for how we treat executive directors leaving the Group (subject to the current contractual commitments described above).

We reserve the right to make additional exit payments if we need to discharge an existing legal obligation (or pay damages for breaching an 
obligation). We also reserve the right to make an exit payment by way of settlement or compromise of any claim arising in connection with terminating 
a director's office or employment.

Base salary, pension 
and benefits

Voluntary resignation or termination
Paid, and eligible for, up to the date of 
termination and for any holidays not taken 
as at that date.

Annual bonus

Normally no annual bonus is paid in respect 
of a financial year if an individual has left 
employment or is under notice prior to the 
bonus payment date.

In the exceptional event any bonus is paid, 
any election already made to defer annual 
bonus under the CIP will not apply.

Other circumstances such as death, ill health, retirement, disability
Paid, and eligible for, up to the date of death or leaving and for any holidays not taken 
as at that date.

If, in the judgment of the Committee, exceptional circumstances apply, such as in the 
case of death, the Committee may agree to a different approach from that outlined 
above, for example not applying pro-rating to a payment or not terminating family 
medical cover immediately.
Annual bonus will usually be paid on the normal bonus payment date, in line with 
performance achieved, pro-rated for the proportion of the financial year worked.

If the Committee judges that exceptional circumstances apply, for example in the 
case of death, the Committee may agree that it is not appropriate to time pro-rate 
the annual bonus payment.

Any election already made to defer annual bonus under the CIP will not apply.

Unvested share options will lapse.

Vested options will not lapse and will remain

Committee discretion, the options will lapse 
on the date of cessation of employment.

Awards under 
all-employee plans

In accordance with the relevant tax 
regulations or plan rules.

Other circumstances such as death, ill health, retirement, disability
Invested or deferred shares will be transferred to the individual or, in case of death, their 
estate.
In the case of death, performance conditions will cease to apply and unvested awards 
will vest immediately.

In all other cases, subject to the Committee’s discretion and its view of the director’s 
performance, unvested awards will vest at the end of the performance period and 
remain subject to the relevant performance conditions.

In all circumstances, the number of shares vesting will normally be reduced pro rata, 
to reflect the number of months from the start of the performance period to the date of 
cessation of employment as a proportion of the performance period. If the Committee 
judges that exceptional circumstances apply, for example in the case of death, the 
Committee may agree that it is not appropriate to time pro-rate the number of shares 
vesting.

Vested awards structured as nil-cost options which have not been exercised may be 
exercised up to the normal lapse date.
In the case of death, unvested share options will vest immediately and will remain 
exercisable for 12 months. Any vested share options will also remain exercisable for 
12 months. 

In all other cases, any vested options will remain exercisable for six months following 
cessation of employment. 

Unvested options, subject to the Committee’s discretion, will vest at the end of the 
performance period and remain subject to the relevant performance conditions. The 
number of options vesting will normally be reduced pro rata, to reflect the number of 
months from the start of the performance period to the date of cessation of employment 
as a proportion of the performance period. These options will be exercisable for six 
months following vesting.
In accordance with the relevant plan rules and tax regulations.

For executive directors who leave the Group in other circumstances, the treatment will normally fall between the two described above. In any event, 
the overall treatment will be subject to the Committee’s judgment.

If there is a change of control, executive directors may exchange their incentive awards (other than CIP invested shares) for awards in the acquiring 
company. CIP invested shares will be transferred to the individual. Alternatively, incentive awards may vest to the extent that the performance 
condition has been satisfied. In this circumstance, CIP matching shares and PSP shares will be pro-rated to reflect the number of months from the 
start of the performance period to the date of the change of control as a proportion of the performance period.

Statement of consideration of employee and shareholder views
While the Committee’s remit understandably includes the executive directors’ remuneration, we also approve the remuneration structure for other 
senior executives and work closely with the Global Reward team to ensure a consistent approach is taken to remuneration more widely across the 
Group. When setting the remuneration policy for the executive directors, we also take into account the pay, employment conditions and remuneration 
trends across the Group, particularly in determining annual salary increases.

As part of the Committee’s standard annual agenda we are provided with an extensive paper setting out details of all employee pay and workforce 
policies across Experian. The discussions on this topic provide the Committee with helpful insights for framing executive pay considerations. This year, 
the Chair of the Committee enhanced this level of insight by attending the UK and Ireland Experian People Forum to explain to forum members how 
executive pay arrangements align with wider Group pay policy and invited the forum members to share their views on executive pay arrangements. 
Additionally, as outlined earlier in this report, every year we review and act upon the outcome of our regular people surveys, and the Committee 
members are provided with a summary of both the survey results and actions taken. The Company also engaged with shareholders in designing the 
policy as outlined on page 123. 

The Chair of the Committee frequently writes to our largest shareholders and investor representative bodies, such as the Investment Association, 
Glass Lewis and Institutional Shareholder Services Inc., to seek their input on any proposed changes to our remuneration structure or broader 
directors’ remuneration policy. We then engage in further discussion and clarification, to help them make an informed voting decision as required. 
Any major concerns are discussed with the Committee Chair first, and the rest of the Committee as appropriate.

At the Committee’s first meeting following each AGM, we consider all the shareholder feedback received in relation to the AGM. We also consider this 
feedback, and any other feedback received during meetings or from any correspondence, as part of our annual review of remuneration policy, which 
normally takes place at our meetings in November and January.

Restrictions on transfers of shares 
and/or voting rights
The Company is not aware of any agreements 
between shareholders that may result in 
restrictions on the transfer of securities and/or 
voting rights and, apart from the matters 
described below, there are no restrictions on 
the transfer of the Company’s ordinary shares 
and/or voting rights:

 a Certain restrictions on transfers of shares 
may from time to time be imposed by, for 
example, share dealing regulations. In 
certain situations, directors and certain 
employees must seek the Company’s 
approval to deal in its shares. 

 a Some of Experian’s share-based employee 
incentive plans include restrictions on the 
transfer of shares, while the shares are 
subject to the plan concerned.

 a As described in the Report on directors’ 

remuneration, non-executive directors must 
hold a proportion of their fees in shares, at 
least equal to their annual fee. These shares 
may not normally be transferred during 
their period of office.

 a Where participants in a share-based 
employee incentive plan operated by 
Experian are the beneficial owners of the 
shares but not the registered owner, the 
voting rights are normally exercised by the 
registered owner at the direction of the 
participants.

 a Shares carry no voting rights while they are 

held in treasury. 

 a The deferred shares in the Company carry 

no voting rights.

 a Unless the directors determine otherwise, 

members are not entitled to vote personally 
or by proxy at a shareholders’ meeting, or 
to exercise any other member’s right in 
relation to shareholders’ meetings, in 
respect of any share for which any call or 
other sum payable to the Company remains 
unpaid.

Substantial shareholdings 
The Company’s articles of association oblige 
shareholders to comply with the notification 
obligations contained in the UK Disclosure 
Guidance and Transparency Rules sourcebook. 
As at 16 May 2023, the Company had been 
notified of the indirect interest below in its 
issued ordinary share capital or voting rights 
in respect of the year.

Number of ordinary shares/
voting rights
46,017,010

Percentage of issued share 
capital/voting rights
4.9%

 a Unless the directors determine otherwise, 

members are not entitled to vote personally 
or by proxy at a shareholders’ meeting, or 
to exercise any other member’s right in 
relation to shareholders’ meetings, if the 
member fails to provide the Company 
with the required information concerning 
interests in those shares, within the 
prescribed period after being served with 
a notice under the Company’s articles of 
association.

 a The Company’s articles of association state 

that, except for certain limited 
circumstances, if the number of shares in 
the Company beneficially owned by 
residents of the USA exceeds a defined 
permitted maximum and the directors give 
notice to the holder(s) of such shares, the 
shares do not give their holder(s) the right to 
receive notice of, attend or vote at the 
Company’s general meetings. 

Details of deadlines for voting at the 2023 AGM 
are contained in the notice of meeting that has 
been circulated to shareholders, and which 
can also be viewed at the Company’s website.

Purchase, cancellation and holdings 
of own shares 
The existing authority for the Company to 
purchase its own shares was given at the AGM 
held on 21 July 2022. It permits the Company 
to purchase 92,080,068 of its own shares in the 
market. 

On 18 May 2022, the Company announced its 
intention to repurchase shares, through a net 
US$175m share repurchase programme. 
During the year ended 31 March 2023, the 
Company purchased 4,754,551 of its own 
shares, at a cost of US$149m (with 2,559,609 
shares purchased before the 2022 AGM). No 
shares have been purchased by the Company 
since 31 March 2023. All shares purchased 
have been retained as treasury shares.

On 13 June 2022 and 30 June 2022, the 
Company transferred 958,028 and 10,579 
ordinary shares respectively from treasury 
to Computershare Investor Services plc and 
Computershare Trustees (Jersey) Limited, 
the administrator and trustee respectively of 
Experian’s share plans, for nil consideration, 
to be used to meet obligations under employee 
share plans. 

As at the date of approval of this Annual 
Report, the Company holds 52,222,358 (2022: 
48,436,414) of its own shares as treasury 
shares, and had an unexpired authority to 
purchase up to 89,885,126 of its own shares. 
Details of the new authority being requested at 
the 2023 AGM are contained in the circular to 
shareholders, which either accompanies this 
Annual Report or is available on the Company’s 
website at www.experianplc.com. 

Details of the shares in the Company 
purchased by and held under The Experian plc 
Employee Share Trust and the Experian UK 
Approved All Employee Share Plan are set out 
in note R to the Company financial statements.

Signiﬁcant agreements – change 
of control 
The Group is party to a number of agreements 
that take effect, alter, terminate, or have the 
potential to do so, upon a change of control of 
the Company following a takeover bid. These 
agreements are as follows: 

 a The Group’s banking facilities contain 

provisions which, in the event of a change of 
control, could result in their renegotiation or 
withdrawal. 

 a The Group’s Euronotes allow holders to 

require repayment of the notes, if a rating 
agency re-rates the notes to below 
investment grade, following a change of 
control. 

 a All of Experian’s share-based employee 

incentive plans contain provisions relating 
to a change of control. Outstanding awards 
and options would normally vest and 
become exercisable, subject to satisfaction 
of any performance conditions at that time. 

 a The Group is party to a limited number of 
operational arrangements that can be 
terminated or altered upon a change of 
control of the Company, but these are not 
considered to be individually significant to 
the Group’s business as a whole. In certain 
cases, it is considered that their disclosure 
would be seriously prejudicial to the 
Company.

 a The provisions in directors’ service 

contracts relating to a change of control of 
the Company are described in the Report on 
directors’ remuneration.

Employment information 

Employment of people with disabilities 
People with disabilities have equal 
opportunities when applying for vacancies. 
In addition to complying with legislative 
requirements, the Group has procedures 
to ensure it treats employees with disabilities 
fairly and manages their training and career 
development needs carefully. The policies are 
considered to operate effectively. The Group 
supports employees who become disabled 
during the course of their employment, by 
offering re-training or re-deployment, to 
enable them to remain with the Group 
whenever possible.

Employee involvement 
Experian is committed to employee 
involvement throughout the business. The 
Group is intent on motivating staff, keeping 
them informed on matters that concern them 
in the context of their employment, and 
involving them through local consultative 
procedures. Where there are recognition 
agreements with trade unions, the consultation 
process is established through national and 
local trade union representatives and through 
joint consultation committees. 

Employees are kept well informed on matters 
of interest and the financial and economic 
factors affecting the Group’s performance. 
This is done through management channels, 
conferences, meetings, publications and 
intranet sites. More detail on employee 
engagement, together with information on 
corporate responsibility, diversity, succession 
planning and talent development, can be found 
in the Sustainable business section of the 
Strategic report. 

Experian supports employee share ownership 
by providing, whenever possible, employee 
share plan arrangements that are intended 
to align employees’ interests with those of 
shareholders.

Auditor information

Relevant audit information 
As at 16 May 2023, so far as each director is 
aware, there is no relevant information needed 
by the auditor in connection with preparing the 
audit report, of which the auditor is unaware, 
and all directors have taken all steps they 
ought to have taken as directors to make 
themselves aware of any relevant audit 
information and to establish that the auditor 
is aware of it. 

Independent auditor 
The auditor, KPMG LLP, has indicated its 
willingness to continue in office and a 
resolution that it be re-appointed as the 
Company’s auditor will be proposed at 
the AGM.

Statement of directors’ responsibilities
The directors are responsible for: 

 a Preparing the Annual Report, the Group 
and Company financial statements in 
accordance with applicable law and 
regulations. The directors have decided 
to prepare voluntarily a directors’ 
remuneration report in accordance with 
Schedule 8 to The Large and Medium-sized 
Companies and Groups (Accounts and 
Reports) Regulations 2008 made under 
the UK Companies Act 2006, as if those 
requirements applied to the Company.
 a Preparing financial statements which give 
a true and fair view of the state of affairs at 
the balance sheet date, and the profit or loss 
for the period then ended of (a) the Group 
(in accordance with IFRSs as adopted for 
use in the European Union and UK-adopted 
IFRS and IASB-IFRS), and (b) the Company 
(in accordance with UK Accounting 
Standards including FRS 101 ‘Reduced 
Disclosure Framework’).

 a Keeping sufficient accounting records that 
disclose, with reasonable accuracy, at any 
time, the financial position of the Group and 
the Company and enable them to ensure the 
Group financial statements comply with 
applicable laws.

 a Maintaining such internal control as they 
determine is necessary to enable the 
preparation of financial statements free 
from material misstatement, whether 
due to fraud or error, and have general 
responsibility for taking the steps 
reasonably open to them to safeguard 
the assets of the Group and the Company 
and to prevent and detect fraud and other 
irregularities.

 a The maintenance and integrity of the 

statutory and audited information on the 
Company’s website. Jersey legislation and 
UK regulations governing the preparation 
and dissemination of financial statements 
may differ from requirements in other 
jurisdictions.

In addition, the directors consider that, 
in preparing the financial statements:

 a suitable accounting policies have been 

selected and applied consistently
 a judgments and estimates made have 
been reasonable, relevant and reliable

 a the Group financial statements comply with 
IFRSs as adopted for use in the European 
Union and UK-adopted IFRS and IASB-IFRS
 a the Company financial statements comply 
with UK Accounting Standards including 
FRS 101 ‘Reduced Disclosure Framework’, 
subject to any material departures disclosed 
and explained in the financial statements

 a the Group’s and Company’s ability to 

continue as a going concern has been 
assessed and, as applicable, matters related 
to going concern have been disclosed

 a it is appropriate that the Group and 

Company financial statements have been 
prepared on the going concern basis, unless 
it is intended to liquidate the Company or any 
Group company, or to cease operations or 
there is no realistic alternative to do so.

The directors also confirm that, to the best of 
their knowledge, the financial statements are 
prepared in accordance with the applicable 
set of accounting standards, give a true and 
fair view of the assets, liabilities, financial 
position and profit of the Company and the 
undertakings included in the consolidation 
taken as a whole; and the Strategic report 
contains a fair review of the development and 
performance of the business and the position 
of the Company and the undertakings included 
in the consolidation taken as a whole, together 
with a description of the principal risks and 
uncertainties they face. 

In addition, each of the directors considers that 
the Annual Report and financial statements, 
taken as a whole, is fair, balanced and 
understandable, and provides the information 
necessary for shareholders to assess the 
Group’s position and performance, business 
model and strategy.

Independent auditor’s report
To the members of Experian plc

1. Our opinion is unmodiﬁed
In our opinion:
 a the Group financial statements give a true and fair view, in accordance with UK-adopted international accounting standards (“UK-IFRS”) and 

International Financial Reporting Standards as adopted by the European Union (“EU-IFRS”), of the Group’s affairs as at 31 March 2023 and of its profit 
for the year then ended;

 a the Parent Company financial statements give a true and fair view, in accordance with UK accounting standards, including FRS 101 Reduced 

Disclosure Framework, of the Parent Company’s affairs as at 31 March 2023 and of its profit for the year then ended; and

 a the Group and Parent Company financial statements have been prepared in accordance with the requirements of the Companies (Jersey) Law 1991.

Additional opinion in relation to IFRS as adopted by the International Accounting Standards Board (“IASB”)
As explained in note 2 to the Group financial statements, the Group, in addition to applying both UK-IFRS and EU-IFRS, has also applied IFRS as issued by 
the IASB. In our opinion, the Group financial statements have been properly prepared in accordance with IFRS as issued by the IASB.

What our opinion covers
We have audited the Group and Parent Company financial statements of Experian plc (“the Company”) for the year ended 31 March 2023 (FY23) included 
in the Annual Report and Accounts, which comprise:

Group 
Group income statement, Group statement of comprehensive income, Group 
balance sheet, Group statement of changes in equity and Group cash flow 
statement.

Notes 1 to 48 to the Group financial statements, including the accounting 
policies in note 5.

Parent Company (Experian plc)
Company profit and loss account, Company statement of comprehensive 
income, Company balance sheet and Company statement of changes in equity.

Notes A to T to the Parent Company financial statements, including the 
accounting policies in note D.

Basis for opinion
We conducted our audit in accordance with International Standards on Auditing (UK) (“ISAs (UK)”) and applicable law. Our responsibilities are described 
below. We believe that the audit evidence we have obtained is a sufficient and appropriate basis for our opinion. Our audit opinion and matters included 
in this report are consistent with those discussed and included in our reporting to the Audit Committee.

We have fulfilled our ethical responsibilities under, and we remain independent of the Group in accordance with, UK ethical requirements including the 
Financial Reporting Council (“FRC”) Ethical Standard as applied to listed public interest entities.

2. Overview of our Audit
Factors driving our view of risks
Following our FY22 audit and considering developments affecting the Experian plc Group since then, our 
assessment of risks and our view of how these impact the audit of the financial statements has been 
updated.

An agreement has been reached with the UK tax authorities for the Group’s most significant uncertain tax 
position such that we no longer consider that provisions for uncertain tax positions represents a key audit 
matter for the current year audit.

As a result of a more challenging trading environment and macro-economic factors causing adverse 
movements in the key assumptions used in the impairment reviews, the risk associated with the 
recoverability of goodwill in respect of the EMEA and Asia Pacific cash generating units has increased 
from FY22.

The industry that the Group operates in is subject to increasingly complex legislation and regulators, 
particularly in the United States, are continuing at their high levels of scrutiny. We therefore consider that 
the risk associated with litigation and contingent liabilities as a whole, continues to be heightened, 
consistent with FY22.

Key Audit Matters
Recoverability of goodwill in 
respect of the EMEA and 
APAC cash generating units
Litigation and contingent 
liabilities
Recoverability of the Parent 
Company’s investment in 
subsidiaries

Vs FY22

Item
4.1

4.2

4.3

Our assessment is that the risk of recoverability of the Parent Company’s investments in subsidiaries 
remains consistent with FY22.
Audit Committee interaction
During the year, the Audit Committee met four times. KPMG are invited to attend all Audit Committee meetings and are provided with an opportunity to meet with 
the Audit Committee in private sessions without the executive directors being present. For each key audit matter, we have set out communications with the Audit 
Committee in section 4, including matters that required particular judgment for each. 

The matters included in the Audit Committee Chair’s report on page 113 are materially consistent with our observations of those meetings.

Experian plc Financial statements151

2. Overview of our Audit continued
Our independence
We have fulfilled our ethical responsibilities and we remain independent of the Group in accordance with 
UK ethical requirements including the FRC Ethical Standard as applied to listed public interest entities. 
Apart from the matters noted below, we have not performed any non-audit services during the year ended 
31 March 2023 or subsequently which are prohibited by the FRC Ethical Standard. 

During 2023, we identified that certain KPMG member firms had provided preparation of local GAAP 
financial statement services and in some cases foreign language translation services over the period FY18 
to FY23 to entities which are residual components and therefore not in scope for the Group audit. The 
services, which have been terminated, were administrative in nature and did not involve any management 
decision-making or bookkeeping. The work in each case was undertaken after the Group audit opinion 
was signed by KPMG LLP for each of the impacted financial years and had no direct or indirect effect on 
Experian plc’s consolidated financial statements. In our professional judgment, we confirm that based on 
our assessment of the breach, our integrity and objectivity as auditor has not been compromised and we 
believe that an objective, reasonable and informed third party would conclude that the provision of this 
service would not impair our integrity or objectivity for any of the impacted financial years. The Audit 
Committee have concurred with this view.

We were first appointed as auditor by the shareholders for the year ended 31 March 2017. The period of 
total uninterrupted engagement is for the seven financial years ended 31 March 2023. The Group 
engagement partner is required to rotate every five years. As these are the first set of the Group’s financial 
statements signed by Zulfikar Kamran Walji, he will be required to rotate off after the FY27 audit. The 
average tenure of partners responsible for component audits as set out in section 7 below is three years, 
with the shortest being one and the longest being four.

The scope of our work is influenced by our view of materiality and our assessed risk of material 
misstatement.

Materiality levels used in our audit

We have determined overall materiality for the Group financial statements as a whole at US$70m (FY22: 
US$61m) and for the Parent Company financial statements as a whole at US$25m (FY22: US$25m).

Group

Consistent with FY22, we determined that profit before tax from continuing operations (PBTCO) remains 
the appropriate benchmark for the Group considering the sector in which the Group operates, its 
ownership and financing structure, and the focus of users of the financial statements. For FY23, we have 
normalised this benchmark to exclude the significant impairment charge of goodwill and charges 
associated with the significant restructuring programme. As such, we based our Group materiality on 
profit before tax from continuing operations before the impairment of goodwill and restructuring costs, 
of which it represents 5.0% (FY22: 4.2%).

Materiality for the Parent Company financial statements was determined with reference to a benchmark 
of Parent Company total assets of which it represents 0.1% (FY22: 0.1%).

2. Overview of our Audit continued
Group scope (Item 7 below)
We have performed risk assessment and planning procedures to determine which of the Group’s 
components are likely to include risks of material misstatement to the Group financial statements, the 
type of procedures to be performed at these components and the extent of involvement required from our 
component auditors around the world.

We identified three (FY22: three) components as individually financially significant components and full 
scope audits were performed on these components by component auditors (KPMG member firms). The 
work on the Parent Company was performed by the Group team.

We have also considered the extent to which the Group has established shared service centres in the UK, 
USA, Malaysia, Costa Rica and Bulgaria. The outputs of these centres are included in the financial 
information of the reporting components and therefore they are not considered to be separate reporting 
components.

We have performed certain audit procedures centrally across the Group, details of which are included in 
Section 7. In addition, we have performed Group level analysis on the remaining out of scope components 
to determine whether further risks of material misstatement exist in those components.

The components within the scope of our work accounted for the percentages illustrated opposite.

We consider the scope of our audit, as communicated to the Audit Committee, to be an appropriate basis 
for our audit opinion.

The impact of climate change on audit
We have considered the potential impacts of climate change on the financial statements as part of planning our audit.

As the Group has set out on page 57-59, climate change has the potential to give rise to a number of transition risks, physical risks and opportunities. The Group 
has stated its commitment to become carbon neutral across its own operations by 2030.

The areas of its financial statements that are most likely to be potentially affected by climate related changes and initiatives are balances subject to forward 
looking assessments such as impairment tests for indefinite and other long lived non-current assets. The Group considered the impact of climate change and the 
Group’s targets in the preparation of the financial statements, as described in note 3 in relation to impairment, and this did not have a material effect on the 
consolidated financial statements.

We performed a risk assessment, taking into account climate change risks and the commitments made by the Group. This included enquiries of management, 
consideration of the Group’s processes for assessing the potential impact of climate change risk on the Group’s financial statements, assessing the Task Force on 
Climate Related Financial Disclosures scenario analysis performed by the Group and reading the Group’s CDP submission.

Based on our risk assessment we determined that, taking into account the limited extent of the impact of climate change on financial forecasts used to determine 
the recoverability of goodwill, there are no significant risks of material misstatement in relation to climate change. Therefore, we assessed that the impact on our 
audit is not significant for this financial year.

There was no significant impact of climate change on our key audit matters included in section 4. 

We have read the Group’s disclosure of climate related information in the Sustainable business section of the Annual Report and Accounts as set out on pages 36 
to 63 and considered consistency with the financial statements and our audit knowledge.

Experian plc Financial statements153

3. Going concern, viability and principal risks and uncertainties
The directors have prepared the financial statements on the going concern basis as they do not intend to liquidate the Group or the Parent Company or 
to cease their operations, and as they have concluded that the Group’s and the Parent Company’s financial position means that this is realistic. They have 
also concluded that there are no material uncertainties that could have cast significant doubt over their ability to continue as a going concern for at least 
a year from the date of approval of the financial statements (the 'going concern period').

Our conclusions
 a We consider that the directors’ use of the going 
concern basis of accounting in the preparation 
of the financial statements is appropriate;
 a We have not identified, and concur with the 
directors’ assessment that there is not, a 
material uncertainty related to events or 
conditions that, individually or collectively, may 
cast significant doubt on the Group’s or Parent 
Company's ability to continue as a going 
concern for the going concern period;
 a We have nothing material to add or draw 
attention to in relation to the directors’ 
statement in note 2 to the financial statements 
on the use of the going concern basis of 
accounting with no material uncertainties that 
may cast significant doubt over the Group and 
Parent Company’s use of that basis for the 
going concern period, and we found the going 
concern disclosure in note 2 to be acceptable.

Our reporting
 a We have nothing material to add or draw 
attention to in relation to these disclosures.
 a We have concluded that these disclosures are 

materially consistent with the financial 
statements and our audit knowledge.

Going concern 
We used our knowledge of the Group, its industry, and the general economic environment to identify the 
inherent risks to its business model and analysed how those risks might affect the Group’s and Parent 
Company’s financial resources or ability to continue operations over the going concern period. The risk 
that we considered most likely to adversely affect the Group’s and Parent Company’s available financial 
resources and metrics relevant to debt covenants over this period, is the loss or misuse of data resulting 
from a ransomware incident, leading to serious reputational and brand damage, legal penalties, and class 
action litigation.

We considered whether these risks could plausibly affect the liquidity or covenant compliance in the going 
concern period by assessing the degree of downside assumption that, individually and collectively, could 
result in a liquidity issue, taking into account the Group’s current and projected cash and facilities (a 
reverse stress test). We also assessed the completeness of the going concern disclosure.

Accordingly, based on those procedures, we found the directors’ use of the going concern basis of 
accounting without any material uncertainty for the Group and Parent Company to be acceptable. 
However, as we cannot predict all future events or conditions and as subsequent events may result in 
outcomes that are inconsistent with judgments that were reasonable at the time they were made, the 
above conclusions are not a guarantee that the Group or the Parent Company will continue in operation.

Disclosures of emerging and principal risks and longer-term viability
Our responsibility 

We are required to perform procedures to identify whether there is a material inconsistency between the 
directors’ disclosures in respect of emerging and principal risks and the viability statement, and the 
financial statements and our audit knowledge. 

Based on those procedures, we have nothing material to add or draw attention to in relation to: 
 a the directors’ confirmation within the viability statement on page 87 that they have carried out a robust 
assessment of the emerging and principal risks facing the Group, including those that would threaten 
its business model, future performance, solvency and liquidity; 

 a the Emerging and Principal Risks disclosures describing these risks and how emerging risks are 

identified and explaining how they are being managed and mitigated; and 

 a the directors’ explanation in the viability statement of how they have assessed the prospects of the 

Group, over what period they have done so and why they considered that period to be appropriate, and 
their statement as to whether they have a reasonable expectation that the Group will be able to 
continue in operation and meet its liabilities as they fall due over the period of their assessment, 
including any related disclosures drawing attention to any necessary qualifications or assumptions. 

Our work is limited to assessing these matters in the context of only the knowledge acquired during our 
financial statements audit. As we cannot predict all future events or conditions and as subsequent events 
may result in outcomes that are inconsistent with judgements that were reasonable at the time they were 
made, the absence of anything to report on these statements is not a guarantee as to the Group’s and 
Parent Company’s longer-term viability.

4. Key audit matters (KAMs)
What we mean
Key audit matters are those matters that, in our professional judgment, were of most significance in the audit of the financial statements and include the most 
significant assessed risks of material misstatement (whether or not due to fraud) identified by us, including those which had the greatest effect on: 
 a the overall audit strategy; 
 a the allocation of resources in the audit; and
 a directing the efforts of the engagement team.

We summarise below the key audit matters in decreasing order of audit significance, in arriving at our audit opinion above, together with our key audit 
procedures to address those matters and our results from those procedures in order that the Company’s members, as a body, may better understand 
the process by which we arrived at our audit opinion. These matters were addressed, and our results are based on procedures undertaken, in the context 
of, and solely for the purpose of our audit of the financial statements as a whole, and in forming our opinion thereon, and consequently are incidental to 
that opinion, and we do not provide a separate opinion on these matters.

As a result of a more challenging trading environment and 
macro-economic factors causing adverse movements in the 
key assumptions used in the impairment reviews, the risk 
associated with the recoverability of goodwill in respect of the 
EMEA and APAC cash generating units has increased from 
FY22.

Our results
FY23: Acceptable

FY22: Acceptable

Description of the Key Audit Matter
Forecast based assessment:

The estimated recoverable amount of the EMEA cash generating unit 
(“CGU”) was below the carrying value of the CGU’s assets and an 
impairment charge has been recognised in the period. The APAC 
CGU’s estimated recoverable amount provides relatively low 
headroom compared to the Group’s other CGUs where there is 
significant headroom between the value-in-use and carrying value 
of CGU assets.

The carrying values of both CGUs are sensitive to changes in key 
assumptions, principally relating to revenue, profit margins, 
long-term growth rates and discount rates, which could have a 
material impact on the carrying value of the associated goodwill in 
APAC and EMEA and impairment charge recognised for EMEA.

The effect of these matters is that, as part of our risk assessment, 
we determined that the recoverability of the EMEA and APAC 
goodwill has a high degree of estimation uncertainty, with a potential 
range of reasonable outcomes greater than our materiality for the 
financial statements as a whole. The financial statements (note 21) 
disclose the sensitivity estimated by the Group.

Our response to the risk
We performed the tests below rather than seeking to rely on any of the Group's controls 
because the nature of the balance is such that we would expect to obtain audit evidence 
primarily through the detailed procedures described.

Our procedures to address the risk included:

Assessing methodology: We assessed whether the principles and integrity of the cash 
flow model used to estimate their recoverable amounts is in accordance with the 
relevant accounting standards;

Assessing impact of restructuring: We assessed the impact of the restructuring in the 
regions on the determination of CGUs for the purpose of goodwill impairment 
assessments;

Challenging growth assumptions: We challenged the Group’s assumptions on revenue, 
profit margins and long term growth rates by corroborating these where possible to 
other sources of information, such as board-approved strategy plans, and external 
sources;

Our sector experience: We critically assessed the appropriateness of the discount rates 
applied through the use of our valuations specialists;

Sensitivity analysis: We performed both breakeven and severe but plausible downside 
sensitivity analysis on the key assumptions noted above to identify sensitivity to potential 
impairments;

Historical comparisons: We evaluated the track record of historical assumptions used 
against actual results achieved; and

Assessing transparency: We assessed whether the Group’s disclosures about the 
sensitivity of the outcome of the impairment assessment to a reasonably possible 
change in key assumptions reflected the risks inherent in the valuation of goodwill.

Communications with Experian plc’s Audit Committee

Our discussions with and reporting to the Audit Committee included:
 a Our audit approach as set out above, including not placing any reliance on controls and the involvement of our valuation specialists;
 a Our conclusions from the procedures performed; and
 a Our views on the disclosures included with respect to the impairment charge for EMEA and the sensitivity of the impairment conclusions to reasonably possible 

changes in assumptions.

Areas of particular auditor judgement

We identified the following as the areas of particular auditor judgement:
 a The estimate is particularly sensitive to key assumptions in the impairment model including revenue growth rates, profit margins, long-term growth rates and 

discount rates and auditor judgement is required to assess whether the directors’ overall estimate falls within an acceptable range.

Our results

We found the Group’s conclusion that there is no impairment of goodwill for the APAC CGU and the goodwill balance and the related impairment charge 
recognised for the EMEA CGU to be acceptable (FY22 result: acceptable).

Further information in the Annual Report and Accounts: See the Audit Committee Report on page 115 for details on how the Audit Committee considered 
impairment of goodwill as an area of significant attention, notes 5 and 6 for the accounting policy on goodwill, and note 21 for the financial disclosures.

4.2 Litigation and contingent liabilities (Group)
Financial Statement Elements

Contingent liability disclosures

FY23

FY22

Note 46 disclosures

Description of the Key Audit Matter
Dispute outcome:

The Group operates in an industry with continuously high levels of 
regulation and is subject to enforcement activity and litigations. 
Those with significant judgement involved include enforcement 
activity by the US Consumer Financial Protection Bureau (CFPB), the 
US Federal Trade Commission (FTC), and litigation by the UK 
Information Commissioner’s Office (ICO) and the Brazilian tax 
authorities. 

We do not assess there to be a significant risk in relation to 
estimation uncertainty for these enforcement activities and 
litigations as an outflow is either not considered probable at this 
stage, or they relate to contingent liabilities which are not estimates. 

However, there remains significant judgment around assessing 
whether any outflow is probable and could be reliably estimated, 
and if not the associated disclosures of contingent liabilities. 

Our assessment of risk vs FY22

The industry that the Group operates in is subject to 
increasingly complex legislation and regulators, particularly 
in the United States, are continuing at their high levels of 
scrutiny. We therefore consider that the risk associated with 
litigation and contingent liabilities as a whole continues to be 
heightened, consistent with FY22.

Our results
FY23: Acceptable

FY22: Acceptable

Our response to the risk
We performed the tests below rather than seeking to rely on any of the Group’s controls 
because the nature of the area is such that we would expect to obtain audit evidence 
primarily through the detailed procedures described.

Our procedures to address the risk included:

Enquiry of lawyers: On all significant enforcement actions and litigations, where 
appropriate, we assessed correspondence and enquired with the Group’s external 
lawyers to corroborate our understanding of these matters, accompanied by 
discussions with the Group’s internal counsel;

Challenging judgment: We obtained detailed updates from the Group around significant 
existing and potential enforcement actions and litigations and challenged the key 
judgments and assumptions made in assessing whether a provision is required and/or 
whether a contingent liability disclosure is required based on our knowledge of the 
Group and experience of the industry in which it operates using our own legal and tax 
specialists where applicable;

Historical comparisons: We compared the outcomes of historical enforcement action 
and litigation to current cases with similar fact patterns; and 

Assessing transparency: We assessed whether the Group’s disclosures detailing 
significant proceedings adequately disclose the potential liabilities of the Group.

Communications with Experian plc’s Audit Committee

Our discussions with and reporting to the Audit Committee included:
 a Our audit approach as set out above, including not placing any reliance on controls and the involvement of our tax and legal specialists;
 a Our conclusions from the procedures performed; and
 a Our views on the contingent liability disclosures included with respect to the current regulatory investigations.

Areas of particular auditor judgment

We identified the following as the areas of particular auditor judgment:
 a The appropriateness of the contingent liability disclosures with respect to the current enforcement activity and tax litigation and the conclusion that no 

provision is required in respect of these matters. 

Our results

We consider the contingent liability disclosures made to be acceptable (FY22 result: acceptable).

Further information in the Annual Report and Accounts: See the Audit Committee Report on page 115 for details on how the Audit Committee considered 
litigation, tax and other regulatory matters as an area of significant attention, note 5 and 6 for the accounting policy on contingencies, and Note 46 for the 
financial disclosures.

Description of the Key Audit Matter
Low risk, high value:

The carrying amount of the Parent Company’s investments in 
subsidiaries represents 99% (FY22: 100%) of the Parent Company’s 
total assets. 

Their recoverability is not at a high risk of significant misstatement or 
subject to significant judgment. The impairment charge recognised in 
the year is also not subject to judgement or estimation uncertainty as 
the charge did not rely on an analysis of future cash flows in its 
determination, and the net asset position of the subsidiary was an 
appropriate estimate of the recoverable amount of this investment as 
it no longer has any underlying activity to generate future cash flows. 
However, due to their materiality in the context of the Parent Company 
financial statements, this is considered to be the area that had the 
greatest effect on our overall Parent Company audit.
Communications with Experian plc’s Audit Committee

Our response to the risk
We performed the tests below rather than seeking to rely on any of the Group's controls 
because the nature of the balance is such that we would expect to obtain audit evidence 
primarily through the detailed procedures described.

Our procedures to address the risk included:

Tests of detail: We compared the carrying amount of 100% of investments in 
subsidiaries with the relevant subsidiaries’ draft balance sheets to identify whether their 
net assets, being an approximation of the minimum recoverable amount of the related 
investments and amounts owed by subsidiary undertakings, were in excess of their 
carrying amount, and assessing whether those subsidiaries have historically been profit 
making.

Our discussions with and reporting to the Audit Committee included:
 a Our audit approach as set out above, including not placing any reliance on controls; and
 a Our conclusions from the procedures performed.

Areas of particular auditor judgment

We did not identify any areas of particular auditor judgment.

Our results

We found the balance of the Parent Company’s investments in subsidiaries and the related impairment charge, to be acceptable (FY22 result: acceptable).

5. Our ability to detect irregularities, and our response

Fraud – identifying and responding to risks of material 
misstatement due to fraud
Fraud risk assessment
To identify risks of material misstatement due to fraud (“fraud risks”) we 
assessed events or conditions that could indicate an incentive or pressure to 
commit fraud or provide an opportunity to commit fraud. 

Our risk assessment procedures included:
 a Enquiring of directors, the Audit Committee, Internal Audit and inspection of 
policy documentation as to the Group’s high-level policies and procedures 
to prevent and detect fraud, including the internal audit function, and the 
Group’s channel for “whistleblowing”, as well as whether they have 
knowledge of any actual, suspected or alleged fraud;

 a Reading Board, Audit Committee, Remuneration Committee, Nomination 

and Corporate Governance Committee minutes;

 a Considering remuneration incentive schemes and performance targets 
for management and directors including the targets for management 
remuneration linked to the Co-investment Plans and Performance Share 
Plan share incentive plans;

 a Using analytical procedures to identify any unusual or unexpected 

relationships; and

 a Discussions among the engagement team regarding how and where fraud 
might occur in the financial statements and any potential indicators of 
fraud. The discussions also involved our forensic specialists to assist us in 
identifying fraud risks based on discussions of the circumstances of the 
Group and Company, including consideration of fraudulent schemes that 
had arisen in similar sectors and industries. The forensic specialists 
participated in the initial fraud risk assessment discussions.

Risk communications
We communicated identified fraud risks throughout the audit team and 
remained alert to any indications of fraud throughout the audit. This included 
communication from the Group audit team to full scope component audit 
teams of relevant fraud risks identified at the Group level and request to full 
scope component audit teams to report to the Group audit team any instances 
of fraud that could give rise to a material misstatement in the Group financial 
statements.
Fraud risks
As required by auditing standards, we perform procedures to address the risk 
of management override of controls and the risk of fraudulent revenue 
recognition, in particular inappropriate recognition of revenue within the 
licences and professional services revenue stream, significant contracts 
within data breach revenue, and the risk that Group and component 
management may make inappropriate accounting entries.

We did not identify any additional fraud risks.
Procedures to address fraud risks
We performed substantive audit procedures including: 
 a Identifying journal entries to test for all full scope components and central 
entities based on risk criteria and comparing the identified entries to 
supporting documentation. These included those posted to unusual 
accounts, journal entries without description, postings between benchmark 
and non-benchmark that increase benchmark Earnings Before Interest and 
Tax (EBIT) and journals posted by unexpected users.

 a Assessing a sample of contracts within the licences and professional 

services revenue stream and significant data breach revenue, where the 
revenue recognised within these streams was significant for full scope 
components (being North America and the UK).

Work on the fraud risks was performed by a combination of component 
auditors and the Group audit team. 

Experian plc Financial statements157

Laws and regulations – identifying and responding to risks 
of material misstatement relating to compliance with laws 
and regulations 
Laws and regulations risk assessment
We identified areas of laws and regulations that could reasonably be expected 
to have a material effect on the financial statements from:
 a Our general commercial and sector experience; 
 a Enquiries with the directors and other management (as required by auditing 

standards);

 a Inspection of the Group’s key regulatory and legal correspondence;
 a Discussions with the directors and inspection of the policies and procedures 

regarding compliance with laws and regulations; and

 a Relevant discussions with the Group’s internal and external legal counsel.

Our risk assessment also considered instances of non-compliance with laws 
and regulations and enforcement actions against the Group during the year 
and specifically those that could reasonably be expected to have a material 
effect on the financial statements. 

As the Group is regulated, our assessment of risks involved gaining an 
understanding of the control environment including the entity’s procedures for 
complying with regulatory requirements.
Risk communications
We communicated identified laws and regulations throughout our team and 
remained alert to any indications of non-compliance throughout the audit. This 
included communication from the Group audit team to full scope component 
audit teams of relevant laws and regulations identified at the Group level and 
a request for full scope component auditors to report to the Group audit team 
any instances of non-compliance with laws and regulations that could give 
rise to a material misstatement in the Group financial statements.
Direct laws context and link to audit
The potential effect of these laws and regulations on the financial statements 
varies considerably.

First, the Group is subject to laws and regulations that directly affect the 
financial statements including:
 a Financial reporting legislation (including related companies legislation);
 a Distributable profits legislation;
 a Taxation legislation; and
 a Pension legislation

We assessed the extent of compliance with these laws and regulations as part 
of our procedures on the related financial statement items. 

More significant indirect law/regulation areas
Secondly, the Group is subject to many other laws and regulations where the 
consequences of non-compliance could have a material effect on amounts or 
disclosures in the financial statements, for instance through the imposition of 
fines or litigation. 

We identified the following areas as those most likely to have such an effect: 
 a Data protection legislation;
 a Health and safety legislation;
 a Anti-bribery and corruption laws;
 a Employment law; and
 a Certain aspects of company legislation recognising the financial and 

regulated nature of the Group’s activities.

Auditing standards limit the required audit procedures to identify 
non-compliance with these laws and regulations to enquiry of the directors 
and other management and inspection of regulatory and legal 
correspondence, if any. Therefore, if a breach of operational regulations is not 
disclosed to us or evident from relevant correspondence, an audit will not 
detect that breach.
Link to Key Audit Matters (KAMs)
Further detail in respect of litigations and contingent liabilities is set out in the 
key audit matter disclosures in section 4.2 of this report.
Known actual or suspected matters
For the contingent liabilities disclosed in note 46 we assessed disclosures 
against our understanding from legal correspondence and procedures 
performed in response to the key audit matter set out in section 4.2.
Actual or suspected breaches discussed with the Audit Committee
We discussed with the Audit Committee other matters related to actual or 
suspected breaches of laws or regulations, for which disclosure is not 
necessary, and considered any implications for our audit.

Context
Context of the ability of the audit to detect fraud or breaches of law or 
regulation
Owing to the inherent limitations of an audit, there is an unavoidable risk that 
we may not have detected some material misstatements in the financial 
statements, even though we have properly planned and performed our audit 
in accordance with auditing standards. For example, the further removed 
non-compliance with laws and regulations is from the events and transactions 
reflected in the financial statements, the less likely the inherently limited 
procedures required by auditing standards would identify it. In addition, as 
with any audit, there remained a higher risk of non-detection of fraud, as fraud 
may involve collusion, forgery, intentional omissions, misrepresentations, or 
the override of internal controls. Our audit procedures are designed to detect 
material misstatement. We are not responsible for preventing non-compliance 
or fraud and cannot be expected to detect non-compliance with all laws and 
regulations.

6. Our determination of materiality
The scope of our audit was influenced by our application of materiality. 
We set quantitative thresholds and overlay qualitative considerations to 
help us determine the scope of our audit and the nature, timing and extent 
of our procedures, and in evaluating the effect of misstatements, both 
individually and in the aggregate, on the financial statements as a whole. 

US$70m (FY22: US$61m) 
Materiality for the Group financial statements as a whole
What we mean

A quantitative reference for the purpose of planning and performing our audit.

Basis for determining materiality and judgments applied

Materiality for the Group financial statements as a whole was set at US$70m 
(FY22: US$61m). This was determined with reference to a benchmark of 
normalised PBTCO. 

Consistent with FY22, we determined that PBTCO remains the appropriate 
benchmark for the Group considering the sector in which the Group operates, 
its ownership and financing structure, and the focus of users of the financial 
statements. We normalised this by adding back adjustments that do not 
represent the normal, continuing operations. The items we adjusted for were 
the significant impairment charge of goodwill (US$179m) and restructuring 
charges associated with the significant programme (US$53m) as disclosed 
in note 15 (FY22: no adjustments). As such, we based our Group materiality 
on Group normalised PBTCO of US$1,406m (FY22: PBTCO of US$1,447m). 

Our Group materiality of US$70m was determined by applying a percentage 
to the normalised PBTCO. When using a benchmark of normalised PBTCO to 
determine overall materiality, KPMG’s approach for listed entities considers 
a guideline range 3% – 5% of the measure. In setting overall Group materiality, 
we applied a percentage of 5.0% (FY22: 4.2%) to the benchmark. 

Materiality for the Parent Company financial statements as a whole was set 
at US$25m (FY22: US$25m), determined with reference to a benchmark of 
Parent Company total assets, of which it represents 0.1% (FY22: 0.1%).

US$53m (FY22: US$46m)
Performance materiality
What we mean

Our procedures on individual account balances and disclosures were 
performed to a lower threshold, performance materiality, so as to reduce to 
an acceptable level the risk that individually immaterial misstatements in 
individual account balances add up to a material amount across the financial 
statements as a whole.

Basis for determining performance materiality and judgments applied

We have considered performance materiality at a level of 75% (FY22: 75%) 
of materiality for Experian plc’s Group financial statements as a whole to be 
appropriate. 

The Parent Company performance materiality was set at US$19m (FY22: 
US$19m), which equates to 75% (FY22: 75%) of materiality for the Parent 
Company financial statements as a whole. 

We applied this percentage in our determination of performance materiality 
because we did not identify any factors indicating an elevated level of risk.

US$3.5m (FY22: US$3.0m)
Audit misstatement posting threshold
What we mean

This is the amount below which identified misstatements are considered to 
be clearly trivial from a quantitative point of view. We may become aware of 
misstatements below this threshold which could alter the nature, timing and 
scope of our audit procedures, for example if we identify smaller 
misstatements which are indicators of fraud. 

This is also the amount above which all misstatements identified are 
communicated to Experian plc’s Audit Committee..

Basis for determining the audit misstatement posting threshold and 
judgments applied

We set our audit misstatement posting threshold at 5% (FY22: 5%) of our 
materiality for the Group financial statements. We also report to the Audit 
Committee any other identified misstatements that warrant reporting on 
qualitative grounds.

In addition to representing 5.0% (FY22: 4.2%) of normalised PBTCO, the overall materiality for the Group financial statements of US$70m (FY22: US$61m) 
compares as follows to the main financial statement caption amounts:

Group audit team oversight
What we mean

The extent of the Group audit team’s involvement in component audits. 
In working with component auditors, we:
 a Held planning calls and visited all components in person to discuss the 

significant areas of the audit relevant to the components, including the key 
audit matters in respect of litigation and contingent liabilities.

 a Issued Group audit instructions to component auditors on the scope of their 
work, including specifying the minimum procedures to perform in their 
audit of significant risk areas, including litigation and contingent liabilities, 
management override of controls and revenue recognition. 

 a Held risk assessment update discussions with all component audit teams 
before the commencement of the final phases of the audit led by the Group 
engagement partner.

 a Organised regular video conferences with the component teams as the 

audit progressed to understand and challenge the audit approach. At these 
meetings, the findings reported to the Group team were discussed in more 
detail, and any further work required by the Group team was then 
performed by the component audit teams.

 a Inspected the component audit teams’ key work papers (using remote 

technology capabilities) to evaluate the quality of execution of the audits of 
the components, with a particular focus on work related to key audit 
matters and significant risks.

7. The scope of our audit
Group scope
What we mean

How the Group audit team determined the procedures to be performed across 
the Group.

The Group has 198 (FY22: 231) reporting components. In order to determine 
the work performed at the reporting component level, we identified those 
components which we considered to be of individual financial significance, 
those which were significant due to risk and those remaining components on 
which we required procedures to be performed to provide us with the 
evidence we required in order to conclude on the Group financial statements 
as a whole.

We determined individually financially significant components as those 
contributing at least 10% (FY22: 5%) of Group revenue or Group total assets. 
We selected Group revenue and Group total assets because these are the 
most representative of the relative size of the components. We identified three 
(FY22: three) components as individually financially significant components 
and full scope audits were performed on these components by component 
auditors (KPMG member firms). The work on the Parent Company was 
performed by the Group team.

The remaining 9% (FY22: 11%) of total Group revenue, 15% (FY22: 10%) of total 
profits and losses that made up Group profit before tax and 10% (FY22: 10%) 
of total Group assets is represented by 195 (FY22: 228) reporting components, 
none of which individually represented more than 2% (FY22: 3%) of any of total 
Group revenue, total profits and losses that made up Group profit before tax or 
total Group assets. For these residual components, we performed analysis at 
an aggregated Group level to re-examine our assessment that there were no 
significant risks of material misstatement within these.

The components within the scope of our work accounted for the percentages 
included in Item 2 – Group scope. The materiality levels applied to the audit of 
these components of Experian plc are set out below:

Scope

Number of components

Full scope audit

3 (FY22: 3)

Range of materiality 
applied
US$21m – US$52m 
(FY22: US$13m – US$45m)

The Group operates five shared service centres in the UK, USA, Malaysia, 
Costa Rica and Bulgaria, the outputs of which are included in the financial 
information of the reporting components they service and therefore they are 
not separate reporting components. Each of the service centres is subject to 
specified risk-focused audit procedures, predominantly the testing of 
transaction processing and review controls. Additional procedures are 
performed at certain reporting components to address the audit risks not 
covered by the work performed over the shared service centres. 

The Group audit team also performed testing of general controls over IT 
systems and automated process controls on behalf of the components 
because of the use of one Group-wide IT system in use at all in-scope 
components. The Group team communicated the results of these procedures 
to the component teams. The Group team also performed procedures on 
treasury related balances because these operations are managed centrally 
and on the goodwill impairment charge excluded from normalised Group 
profit before tax.

The Group team instructed component auditors as to the significant areas to 
be covered, including the relevant risks detailed above and the information to 
be reported back. The Group team approved the component materiality levels, 
as detailed in the table above, having regard to the mix of size and risk profile 
of the Group across the components.

We were able to rely upon the Group's internal control over financial reporting 
in several areas of our audit, where our controls testing supported this 
approach, which enabled us to reduce the scope of our substantive audit work; 
in the other areas the scope of the audit work performed was fully substantive.

8. Other information in the Annual Report and Accounts
The directors are responsible for the other information presented in the Annual Report together with the financial statements. Our opinion on the 
financial statements does not cover the other information and, accordingly, we do not express an audit opinion or, except as explicitly stated below, any 
form of assurance conclusion thereon. 

All other information
Our responsibility 

Our responsibility is to read the other information and, in doing so, consider whether, based on our 
financial statements audit work, the information therein is materially misstated or inconsistent with the 
financial statements or our audit knowledge. 
Report on Directors’ remuneration
Our responsibility 

In addition to our audit of the financial statements, the directors have engaged us to audit the information 
in the Report on Directors’ Remuneration that is described as having been audited, which the directors 
have decided to prepare as if the Company were required to comply with the requirements of Schedule 8 
to The Large and Medium-sized Companies and Groups (Accounts and Reports) Regulations 2008 (S.I. 
2008 No. 410) made under the UK Companies Act 2006.
Corporate governance disclosures
Our responsibility 

We are required to perform procedures to identify whether there is a material inconsistency between the 
financial statements and our audit knowledge, and:
 a the directors’ statement that they consider that the annual report and financial statements taken as a 

whole is fair, balanced and understandable, and provides the information necessary for shareholders to 
assess the Group’s position and performance, business model and strategy; 

 a the section of the annual report describing the work of the Audit Committee, including the significant 
issues that the Audit Committee considered in relation to the financial statements, and how these 
issues were addressed; and

 a the section of the annual report that describes the review of the effectiveness of the Group’s risk 

management and internal control systems.

We are also required to review the part of the Corporate Governance Report relating to the Group’s 
compliance with the provisions of the UK Corporate Governance Code specified by the Listing Rules for our 
review. 
Other matters on which we are required to report by exception
Our responsibility 

Under the Companies (Jersey) Law 1991, we are required to report to you if, in our opinion: 
 a proper accounting records have not been kept by the Parent Company, or proper returns adequate for 

our audit have not been received from branches not visited by us; or 

 a the Parent Company financial statements are not in agreement with the accounting records and 

returns; or 

 a we have not received all the information and explanations we require for our audit.

Our reporting

Based solely on that work we have not identified 
material misstatements or inconsistencies in the 
other information. 

Our reporting

In our opinion the part of the Report on Directors’ 
Remuneration to be audited has been properly 
prepared in accordance with the UK Companies 
Act 2006, as if those requirements applied to the 
Company.

Our reporting

Based on those procedures, we have concluded 
that each of these disclosures is materially 
consistent with the financial statements and our 
audit knowledge.

We have nothing to report in this respect.

Our reporting

We have nothing to report in these respects.

9. Respective responsibilities 

Directors’ responsibilities 
As explained more fully in their statement set out on page 148, the 
directors are responsible for: the preparation of the financial statements 
including being satisfied that they give a true and fair view; such internal 
control as they determine is necessary to enable the preparation of 
financial statements that are free from material misstatement, whether 
due to fraud or error; assessing the Group and Parent Company’s ability to 
continue as a going concern, disclosing, as applicable, matters related to 
going concern; and using the going concern basis of accounting unless 
they either intend to liquidate the Group or the Parent Company or to 
cease operations, or have no realistic alternative but to do so. 

Auditor’s responsibilities 
Our objectives are to obtain reasonable assurance about whether the 
financial statements as a whole are free from material misstatement, 
whether due to fraud or error, and to issue our opinion in an auditor’s 
report. Reasonable assurance is a high level of assurance, but does not 
guarantee that an audit conducted in accordance with ISAs (UK) will 
always detect a material misstatement when it exists. Misstatements can 
arise from fraud or error and are considered material if, individually or in 
aggregate, they could reasonably be expected to influence the economic 
decisions of users taken on the basis of the financial statements. 

A fuller description of our responsibilities is provided on the FRC’s website 
at www.frc.org.uk/auditorsresponsibilities. 

The Company will be including these financial statements in an annual 
financial report prepared using the single electronic reporting format 
specified in the TD ESEF Regulation. This auditor’s report provides no 
assurance over whether the annual financial report has been prepared 
in accordance with that format.

10. The purpose of our audit work and to whom we owe 
our responsibilities 
This report is made solely to the Company’s members, as a body, in 
accordance with Article 113A of the Companies (Jersey) Law 1991 and 
the terms of engagement by the Company. Our audit work has been 
undertaken so that we might state to the Company’s members those 
matters we are required to state to them in an auditor’s report, and the 
further matters we are required to state to them in accordance with the 
terms agreed with the Company, and for no other purpose. To the fullest 
extent permitted by law, we do not accept or assume responsibility to 
anyone other than the Company and the Company’s members, as a body, 
for our audit work, for this report, or for the opinions we have formed.

 a prepared on the going concern basis and under the historical cost 

convention, as modified for the revaluation of certain financial assets 
and financial liabilities;

 a presented in US dollars, the most representative currency of the 
Group’s operations, and generally rounded to the nearest million;

 a prepared using the principal exchange rates set out in note 11; and

 a designed to voluntarily include disclosures in line with those parts of 
the UK Companies Act 2006 applicable to companies reporting under 
that law.

There has been no change in the basis of preparation of the Group 
financial statements since the Annual Report for the year ended 31 March 
2022. 

The use of critical accounting estimates and management judgment is 
required in applying the accounting policies. Areas involving a higher 
degree of judgment or complexity, or where assumptions and estimates 
are significant to the Group financial statements, are highlighted in note 6.

Going concern
In adopting the going concern basis for preparing these financial 
statements, the directors have considered the business activities, the 
principal risks and uncertainties and the other matters discussed in 
connection with the Viability statement. 

At 31 March 2023, the Group had undrawn committed bank borrowing 
facilities of US$2.4bn (2022: US$2.6bn) which have an average remaining 
tenor of three years (2022: three years).

The directors believe that the Group and the Company are well placed to 
manage their financing and other business risks satisfactorily, and have a 
reasonable expectation that the Group and the Company will have 
adequate resources to continue their operational existence for at least 12 
months from the date of signing these financial statements. The directors 
therefore consider it appropriate to adopt the going concern basis of 
accounting in preparing the financial statements. In reaching this 
conclusion, the directors noted the Group’s strong cash performance in 
the year, and its resilience in the face of a viability reverse stress-test 
scenario.

3. Climate-related matters
As an information services business, our main environmental impact is 
the carbon footprint generated from our operations and value chain. The 
majority of our footprint is made up of greenhouse gas emissions from 
purchased goods and services, upstream leased assets including 
third-party data centres and capital goods, with emissions from our direct 
operations making up approximately 5%.

We are committed to reducing our carbon emissions and to becoming 
carbon neutral in our own operations by 2030. We continue to develop 
our plans to decarbonise our business further and reduce energy 
consumption at our data centres and across the Group. We have reduced 
our Scope 1 and 2 emissions by 65% since 2019.

We recognise the importance of identifying and effectively managing the 
physical and transitional risks that climate change poses to our operations 
and consider the impact of climate-related matters, including legislation, 
on our business. 

The following climate change considerations have been made in 
preparing the Group financial statements: 

 a The impact in the going concern period or on the viability of the Group 

over the next three years, as referenced in the Strategic report. 

 a The impact on factors such as residual values, useful lives and 

depreciation methods that determine the carrying value of non-current 
assets (notes 21 to 23). 

 a The impact on forecasts of cash flows used in impairment 

assessments for the value-in-use of non-current assets including 
goodwill (notes 21 to 23).

 a The impact on forecasts of cash flows used in the fair value 

measurement of assets and liabilities (note 32).

 a The impact on post-employment benefit assets (note 36).

At present, there is no material impact of climate-related matters on the 
Group’s financial results or on going concern or viability.

4. Recent accounting developments
There have been no accounting standards, amendments or interpretations 
effective for the first time in these financial statements which have had a 
material impact on the financial statements.

The following amendments to standards were effective for Experian from 
1 April 2022:

Onerous Contracts – Cost of Fulfilling a Contract 
(Amendments to IAS 37)
An onerous contract is one under which the unavoidable costs of meeting 
the contract obligations exceed the economic benefits expected to be 
received. The amendments to IAS 37 ‘Provisions, Contingent Liabilities and 
Contingent Assets’ clarify that the costs relating directly to a contract 
consist of both the incremental costs to fulfil it, and an allocation of other 
direct costs. As a result of the amendments, certain other directly related 
costs are now included when determining the costs of fulfilling onerous 
contracts.

The amendments apply prospectively to contracts existing at the date 
when the amendments are first applied. The Group has analysed all 
contracts existing at 1 April 2022 and determined that none of them 
would be identified as onerous applying the refined accounting policy, 
consequently there is no impact on opening equity balances at 1 April 
2022 as a result of this change.

4. Recent accounting developments continued
Reference to the Conceptual Framework – Amendments to 
IFRS 3 ‘Business Combinations’
The amendments update a reference to the Conceptual Framework for 
Financial Reporting without changing the accounting requirements for 
business combinations, and add an exception to the requirement to refer 
to the framework to determine what constitutes an asset or a liability. 
The amendments also clarify that contingent assets do not qualify for 
recognition at the acquisition date.

In accordance with the transitional provisions, the Group applied the 
amendments prospectively, to business combinations occurring after 
1 April 2022. These amendments had no impact on the Group financial 
statements.

Property, Plant and Equipment: Proceeds before Intended 
Use (Amendments to IAS 16)
The amendment to IAS 16 ‘Property, Plant and Equipment’ prohibits the 
deduction from the cost of property, plant and equipment of proceeds 
received from selling items produced while an asset is being prepared for 
its intended use. Instead, the proceeds and related cost are recognised in 
profit or loss. These amendments had no impact on the Group financial 
statements as there were no sales of such items in the year.

Standards issued but not yet effective:

Disclosure of Accounting Policies – Amendments to IAS 1 
‘Presentation of Financial Statements’ and IFRS Practice 
Statement 2 ‘Making Materiality Judgements’
In February 2021, the IASB issued amendments to IAS 1 and IFRS 
Practice Statement 2. The amendments to IAS 1 require disclosure of 
material accounting policies rather than significant accounting policies. 
The amendments to IFRS Practice Statement 2 provide guidance on how 
to apply the concept of materiality to accounting policy disclosures.

The amendments to IAS 1 are applicable for Experian from 1 April 2023. 
The Group is currently reviewing its accounting policy disclosures to align 
with the amended requirements.

Definition of Accounting Estimates – Amendments to IAS 
8 ‘Accounting Policies, Changes in Accounting Estimates 
and Errors’
In February 2021, the IASB also issued amendments to IAS 8. The 
amendments clarify how to distinguish changes in accounting policies 
from changes in accounting estimates and are applicable for Experian 
from 1 April 2023. The amendments are not expected to have a material 
impact on the Group’s financial statements.

Deferred Tax related to Assets and Liabilities arising from 
a Single Transaction – Amendments to IAS 12 ‘Income Taxes’
In May 2021, the IASB issued amendments to IAS 12. The amendments 
require deferred tax to be recognised on transactions that, on initial 
recognition, give rise to equal amounts of taxable and deductible 
temporary differences. The amendments are effective for the Group from 
1 April 2023, and it is expected that there will be no impact on retained 
earnings given the Group has previously applied the ‘integrally linked’ 
approach which results in a similar outcome to the amendments.

There are no other new standards, amendments to existing standards, 
or interpretations that are not yet effective, that are expected to have 
a material impact on the Group’s financial results. Accounting 
developments are routinely reviewed by the Group and its financial 
reporting systems are adapted as appropriate. 

5. Signiﬁcant accounting policies
The significant accounting policies applied are summarised below. They 
have been applied consistently to both years presented. The explanations 
of these policies focus on areas where judgment is applied or which are 
particularly important in the financial statements. For ease of reference, 
the content within this note is arranged as follows:

 a sections (a) to (d) – content that applies generally to the preparation 

of these financial statements;

 a sections (e) to (q) – balance sheet policies, to be read in conjunction with 

specific notes as indicated;

 a sections (r) to (y) – income statement policies, to be read in conjunction 

with specific notes as indicated; and

 a section (z) – the policy and presentation principles adopted for 

disclosing segment information, in accordance with IFRS 8 ‘Operating 
Segments’.

(a) Basis of consolidation
The Group financial statements incorporate the financial statements 
of the Company and its subsidiary undertakings. 

Subsidiaries
Subsidiaries are fully consolidated from the date on which control is 
transferred to the Group and cease to be consolidated from the date that 
the Group no longer has control. All business combinations are accounted 
for using the acquisition method. 

Intra-Group transactions, balances and unrealised gains on transactions 
between Group companies are eliminated on consolidation. Unrealised 
losses are also eliminated unless the transaction provides evidence of 
an impairment of the asset transferred.

Accounting policies of subsidiaries and segments are consistent with 
the policies adopted by the Group for the purposes of the Group’s 
consolidation. The Group financial statements incorporate the financial 
statements of the Company and its subsidiary undertakings for the year 
ended 31 March 2023. A full list of subsidiary undertakings is given in 
note T to the Company financial statements.

Associates
Interests in associates are accounted for using the equity method. 
They are initially recognised at cost, which includes transaction costs. 
Subsequent to initial recognition, the Group financial statements include 
the Group’s share of the profit or loss and other comprehensive income of 
equity-accounted investees, until the date on which significant influence 
ceases. Gains or losses on disposal are recognised within operating profit.

Non-controlling interests
The non-controlling interests in the Group balance sheet represent the 
share of net assets of subsidiary undertakings held outside the Group. The 
movement in the year comprises the profit attributable to such interests 
together with any dividends paid, movements in respect of corporate 
transactions and related exchange differences.

The Group treats transactions with non-controlling interests that do not 
result in a loss of control as transactions with equity owners of the Group. 
For purchases from non-controlling interests, the difference between any 
consideration paid and the relevant share acquired of the carrying value 
of the net assets of the subsidiary is recorded in equity. Gains or losses on 
disposals to non-controlling interests are also recorded in equity.

Where put option agreements are in place in respect of shares held by 
non-controlling shareholders, the liability is stated at the present value of 
the expected future payments. Such liabilities are shown as financial 
liabilities in the Group balance sheet. The change in the value of such 
options in the year is recognised in the Group income statement within net 

Notes to the Group financial statements continuedExperian plc Financial statements169

5. Signiﬁcant accounting policies continued
finance costs, while any change in that value attributable to exchange rate 
movements is recognised directly in Other comprehensive income (OCI).

Where put option agreements are in place the Group adopts the 
‘anticipated acquisition’ approach, recording the other side of the put 
liability against goodwill, with no subsequent profits attributed to 
non-controlling interests.

(b) Foreign currency translation
Transactions and balances
Transactions in foreign currencies are recorded in the functional currency 
of the relevant Group undertaking at the exchange rate prevailing on the 
date of the transaction. At each balance sheet date, monetary assets and 
liabilities denominated in foreign currencies are retranslated at the 
exchange rate prevailing at the balance sheet date. Translation differences 
on monetary items are taken to the Group income statement except when 
recognised in OCI, as qualifying net investment hedges or cash flow 
hedges. Translation differences on non-monetary financial assets 
revalued through OCI are reported as part of the fair value gains or 
losses in OCI.

Group undertakings
The results and financial position of Group undertakings whose functional 
currencies are not the US dollar are translated into US dollars as follows:

 a Income and expenses are generally translated at the average exchange 
rate for the year. Where this average is not a reasonable approximation 
of the cumulative effect of the rates prevailing on the transaction dates, 
income and expenses are translated at the rates on the dates of the 
transactions.

 a Assets and liabilities are translated at the closing exchange rate on 

the balance sheet date.

 a All resulting exchange differences are recognised in OCI and as a 

separate component of equity.

On consolidation, exchange differences arising from the translation of the 
net investment in Group undertakings whose functional currencies are 
not the US dollar, and of borrowings and other currency instruments 
designated as hedges of such investments, are recognised in OCI to the 
extent that such hedges are effective. Tax attributable to those exchange 
differences is taken directly to OCI. When such undertakings are sold, 
these exchange differences are recognised in the Group income 
statement as part of the gain or loss on sale. Goodwill and fair value 
adjustments arising on the acquisition of such undertakings are treated 
as assets and liabilities of the entities and are translated into US dollars 
at the closing exchange rate.

(c) Fair value estimation
The fair values of derivative financial instruments and other financial 
assets and liabilities are determined by using market data and 
established estimation techniques such as discounted cash flow and 
option valuation models. The fair value of foreign exchange contracts is 
based on a comparison of the contractual and year-end exchange rates. 
The fair values of other derivative financial instruments are estimated by 
discounting the future cash flows to net present values, using appropriate 
market rates prevailing at the balance sheet date.

(d) Impairment of non-financial assets
Assets that are not subject to amortisation or depreciation are tested 
annually for impairment. Assets that are subject to amortisation or 
depreciation are reviewed for impairment when there is an indication 
that the carrying amount may not be recoverable. Climate-related matters 
are considered to identify whether any are an indicator of impairment. 
An impairment charge is recognised for the amount by which an asset’s 

carrying amount exceeds its recoverable amount, which is the higher 
of an asset’s fair value less costs of disposal and value-in-use. For the 
purposes of assessing impairment, assets are grouped into cash 
generating units (CGUs), determined by the lowest levels for which 
there are separately identifiable cash flows.

(e) Goodwill (note 21)
Goodwill is stated at cost less any accumulated impairment, where cost is 
the excess of the fair value of the consideration payable for an acquisition 
over the fair value at the date of acquisition of the Group’s share of 
identifiable net assets of a subsidiary or associate acquired. Fair values 
are attributed to the identifiable assets, liabilities and contingent liabilities 
that existed at the date of acquisition, reflecting their condition at that 
date. Adjustments are made where necessary to align the accounting 
policies of acquired businesses with those of the Group. Goodwill is not 
amortised but is tested annually for impairment, or more frequently if 
there is an indication that it may be impaired. An impairment charge is 
recognised in the Group income statement for any amount by which the 
carrying value of the goodwill exceeds the recoverable amount.

Goodwill is allocated to CGUs and monitored for internal management 
purposes by operating segment. The allocation is made to those CGUs 
or groups of CGUs that are expected to benefit from the business 
combination in which the goodwill arose. 

Gains and losses on the disposal of an undertaking take account of the 
carrying amount of goodwill relating to the undertaking sold, allocated 
where necessary on the basis of relative fair value, unless another 
method is determined to be more appropriate.

(f) Other intangible assets (note 22)
Acquisition intangibles
Intangible assets acquired as part of a business combination are 
capitalised on acquisition at fair value and separately from goodwill, 
if those assets are identifiable (separable or arising from legal rights). 
Such assets are referred to as acquisition intangibles in these financial 
statements. Amortisation is charged on a straight-line basis as follows:

 a Customer and other relationships – over three to 18 years, based on 

management’s estimates of the average lives of such relationships, and 
reflecting their long-term nature.

 a Acquired software development – over three to eight years, based on 

the asset’s expected life.

 a Marketing-related assets (trademarks and licences) – over their 

contractual lives, up to a maximum of 20 years.

 a Marketing-related assets (trade names) – over three to 14 years, based 

on management’s expected retention of trade names within the 
business.

Other intangibles
Other intangibles are capitalised at cost. Certain costs incurred in the 
developmental phase of an internal project are capitalised provided that a 
number of criteria are satisfied. These include the technical feasibility of 
completing the asset so that it is available for use or sale, the availability 
of adequate resources to complete the development and to use or sell the 
asset, and how the asset will generate probable future economic benefit.

The cost of such assets with finite useful economic or contractual lives is 
amortised on a straight-line basis over those lives. The carrying values 
are reviewed for impairment when events or changes in circumstances 
indicate that the carrying values may not be recoverable. If impaired, the 
carrying values are written down to the higher of fair value less costs of 
disposal and value-in-use, which is determined by reference to projected 
future income streams using assumptions in respect of profitability and 
growth.

5. Signiﬁcant accounting policies continued
Further details on the capitalisation and amortisation policy for the key 
asset classifications within other intangibles are: 

 a Databases – capitalised databases, which comprise the data purchase 
and capture costs of internally developed databases, are amortised 
over three to seven years.

(j) Financial assets and liabilities (note 31)
Financial assets
We classify our financial assets into the following measurement 
categories, with the classification determined on initial recognition 
and dependent on the purpose for which such assets are acquired: 

 a those subsequently measured at fair value (either through OCI or 

 a Computer software (internal use) – computer software licences 

purchased for internal use are capitalised on the basis of the costs 
incurred to purchase and bring into use the specific software. These 
costs are amortised over three to ten years.

 a Computer software (internally generated) – costs directly associated 

with producing identifiable and unique software products controlled by 
the Group, and that will generate economic benefits beyond one year, 
are recognised as intangible assets. These costs are amortised over 
three to ten years.

Research expenditure, other costs associated with developing or 
maintaining computer software programs or databases, and configuration 
and customisation costs incurred in Software as a Service arrangements, 
are recognised in the Group income statement as incurred.

(g) Property, plant and equipment (note 23)
Purchased items of property, plant and equipment are held at cost less 
accumulated depreciation and any impairment in value. Cost includes the 
original purchase price of the asset and amounts attributable to bringing 
the asset to its working condition for its intended use.

Depreciation is charged on a straight-line basis as follows:

 a Freehold properties – over 50 years.

 a Leasehold improvements to short leasehold properties – over the 

remaining period of the lease.

 a Plant and equipment – over three to ten years, according to the asset’s 
estimated useful life. Technology-based assets are typically depreciated 
over three to five years, motor vehicles over four to five years, with 
other infrastructure assets depreciated over five to ten years.

The Group has reviewed the useful lives of its data centres and main plant 
and equipment assets to determine if any are affected by climate-related 
matters or the commitment to become carbon neutral in our own 
operations by 2030, and concluded that no changes are required.

(h) Trade and other receivables (note 25)
Trade receivables and contract assets are initially recognised at fair value 
and subsequently measured at this value less loss allowances. Where the 
time value of money is material, receivables are then carried at amortised 
cost using the effective interest method, less loss allowances.

We apply the IFRS 9 simplified lifetime expected credit loss approach. 
Expected credit losses are determined using a combination of historical 
experience and forward-looking information. Impairment losses or credits 
in respect of trade receivables and contract assets are recognised in the 
Group income statement, within other operating charges.

(i) Cash and cash equivalents (note 26)
Cash and cash equivalents include cash in hand, term and call deposits 
held with banks and other short-term, highly liquid investments with 
original maturities of three months or less. Bank overdrafts are shown 
within borrowings in current liabilities in the Group balance sheet. 
For the purposes of the Group cash flow statement, cash and cash 
equivalents are reported net of bank overdrafts.

through profit or loss), and

 a those measured at amortised cost.

Directly attributable transaction costs are expensed where an asset is 
carried at ‘fair value through profit or loss’ (FVPL) and added to the fair 
value of the asset otherwise.

Financial assets with embedded derivatives are considered in their 
entirety when determining whether their cash flows are solely a payment 
of principal and interest. 

Debt instruments
Measurement of debt instruments depends on the Group’s business 
model for managing the asset and the cash flow characteristics of the 
asset. There are three measurement categories into which the Group 
classifies debt instruments:

 a Amortised cost: Assets that are held for collection of contractual cash 
flows, where those cash flows are solely repayments of principal and 
interest, are measured at amortised cost. Interest income from these 
financial assets is recognised using the effective interest method. Any 
impairment or gain or loss on derecognition is recognised directly in 
the Group income statement.

 a Fair value through Other comprehensive income (FVOCI): Assets that 
are held both for the collection of contractual cash flows and for their 
sale, where the asset’s cash flows solely represent payments of 
principal and interest, are measured at FVOCI. Movements in the 
carrying amount are taken through OCI, however recognition of 
impairment gains or losses, interest income and foreign exchange 
gains or losses are recognised in the Group income statement. 

 a FVPL: Assets that do not meet the criteria for amortised cost or FVOCI 
are measured at FVPL. A gain or loss on a debt instrument that is 
subsequently measured at FVPL is recognised in the Group income 
statement and presented net within other gains or losses in the period 
in which it arises.

Equity instruments
We measure all equity instruments at fair value. Where we have elected to 
present fair value gains or losses on equity investments in OCI, there is no 
subsequent reclassification of fair value gains or losses to the Group 
income statement following the derecognition of the investment. 
Dividends from such investments are normally recognised as other 
income when the Group’s right to receive payments is established.

Changes in the fair value of financial assets at FVPL are recognised in 
other gains or losses in the Group income statement. Impairment losses, 
and reversals of impairment losses, on equity investments measured at 
FVOCI are not reported separately from other changes in fair value.

Impairment
The loss allowances for financial assets are based on assumptions about 
significant increases in credit risk and subsequent risk of default. We use 
judgment in making these assumptions and selecting the inputs to the 
impairment calculation, based on the Group’s history, existing market 
conditions and forward-looking estimates at the end of each reporting 
period.

5. Signiﬁcant accounting policies continued
Financial liabilities
Financial liabilities are measured subsequently at amortised cost using 
the effective interest method or at FVPL. Financial liabilities are classified 
at FVPL when the financial liability is held for trading, it is a derivative or it 
is designated at FVPL on initial recognition. Financial liabilities at FVPL are 
measured at fair value, with any net gains or losses arising on changes in 
fair value, including any interest expense, recognised in the Group income 
statement. 

Other financial liabilities are subsequently measured at amortised cost 
using the effective interest method. Interest expense, foreign exchange 
gains and losses and any gain or loss on derecognition are recognised 
in the Group income statement. 

The effective interest method is a method of calculating the amortised 
cost of a financial liability and of allocating interest expense over the 
relevant period. The effective interest rate is the rate that exactly 
discounts estimated future cash payments, including all fees that form 
an integral part of the effective interest rate, transaction costs and other 
premiums or discounts, through the expected life of the financial liability.

Derivatives used for hedging
The Group uses derivative financial instruments to manage its exposures 
to fluctuations in foreign exchange rates, interest rates and certain 
obligations relating to share incentive plans, including social security 
obligations. Instruments used include interest rate swaps, cross-currency 
swaps, foreign exchange contracts and equity swaps. These are 
recognised as assets or liabilities as appropriate and are classified as 
non-current, unless they mature within one year of the balance sheet 
date.

Derivatives are initially recognised at their fair value on the date the 
contract is entered into, and are subsequently remeasured at their fair 
value. The method of recognising the resulting gain or loss depends on 
whether the derivative is designated as a hedging instrument and, if so, 
the nature of the hedge relationship.

The Group designates certain derivatives as either fair value hedges or 
cash flow hedges. Fair value hedges are hedges of the fair value of a 
recognised asset or liability. Cash flow hedges are hedges of highly 
probable future foreign currency cash flows. The Group does not currently 
enter into net investment hedges.

We document the relationship between hedging instruments and hedged 
items, and our risk management objective and strategy for undertaking 
hedge transactions, at the hedge inception. We also document our 
assessment of whether the derivatives used in hedging meet the hedge 
effectiveness criteria set out in IFRS 9. This assessment is performed at 
every reporting date throughout the life of the hedge to confirm that the 
hedge continues to meet the hedge effectiveness criteria. Hedge 
accounting is discontinued when the hedging instrument expires, is sold, 
terminated or exercised, or no longer qualifies for hedge accounting. 

Amounts payable or receivable in respect of interest rate swaps, together 
with the interest differentials reflected in foreign exchange contracts, are 
recognised in net finance costs over the period of the contract.

Changes in the fair value of derivatives that are designated and qualify as 
fair value hedging instruments are recognised in the Group income 
statement, together with any changes in the fair value of the hedged asset 
or liability that are attributable to the hedged risk. The ineffective portion 
of a fair value hedge is recognised in net finance costs in the Group 
income statement.

The effective portion of changes in the fair value of derivatives that are 
designated and qualify as cash flow hedging instruments is recognised in 
OCI, while any ineffective part is recognised in the Group income 
statement. Amounts recorded in OCI are recycled to the Group income 
statement in the same period in which the underlying foreign currency 
exposure affects the Group income statement.

Non-hedging derivatives
Changes in the fair value of derivative instruments which are used to 
manage exposures, but are not part of a documented hedge relationship 
under IFRS 9, are recognised immediately in the Group income statement. 
Cost and income amounts in respect of derivatives entered into in 
connection with social security obligations on employee share incentive 
plans, other than amounts of a financing nature, are charged or credited 
within labour costs. Other costs and changes in the fair value of such 
derivatives are charged or credited within financing fair value 
remeasurements in the Group income statement.

(k) Trade and other payables (note 27)
Trade payables and contract liabilities are recognised initially at fair value. 
Where the time value of money is material, payables and contract 
liabilities are then carried at amortised cost using the effective interest 
method.

(l) Borrowings (note 28)
Borrowings are recognised initially at fair value, net of any transaction 
costs incurred. Borrowings are subsequently stated at amortised cost, 
except where they are hedged by an effective fair value hedge, in which 
case the carrying value is adjusted to reflect the fair value movements 
associated with the hedged risk.

Borrowings are classified as non-current to the extent that the Group has 
an unconditional right to defer settlement of the liability for at least one 
year after the balance sheet date.

(m) Leases (note 30)
The Group undertakes an assessment of whether a contract is or contains 
a lease at its inception. The assessment establishes whether the Group 
obtains substantially all the economic benefits from the use of an asset 
and whether we have the right to direct its use.

Low-value lease payments are recognised as an expense, on a 
straight-line basis over the lease term. For other leases we recognise both 
a right-of-use asset and a lease liability at the commencement date of a 
lease contract.

The right-of-use asset is initially measured at cost, comprising the initial 
amount of the lease liability adjusted for payments made at or before the 
commencement date, plus initial direct costs and an estimate of the cost 
of any obligation to refurbish the asset or site, less lease incentives.

Subsequently, right-of-use assets are measured at cost less accumulated 
depreciation and impairment losses and are adjusted for any 
remeasurement of the lease liability. Depreciation is calculated on a 
straight-line basis over the shorter of the lease period or the estimated 
useful life of the right-of-use asset, which is determined on a basis 
consistent with purchased assets (note 5(g)).

The lease term comprises the non-cancellable period of a lease, plus 
periods covered by an extension option, if it is reasonably certain to be 
exercised, and periods covered by a termination option if it is reasonably 
certain not to be exercised.

The lease liability is initially measured at the present value of lease 
payments that are outstanding at the commencement date, discounted 
at the interest rate implicit in the lease, or if that rate cannot be easily 
determined, the Group’s incremental borrowing rate.

Experian plc  Annual Report 2023Financial statements172

5. Signiﬁcant accounting policies continued
Lease payments comprise payments of fixed principal, less any lease 
incentives, variable elements linked to an index, guaranteed residuals or 
buy-out options that are reasonably certain to be exercised. They include 
payments in respect of optional renewal periods where these are 
reasonably certain to be exercised or early termination payments where 
the lease term reflects such an option.

The lease liability is remeasured when there is a change in future lease 
payments arising from a change in an index or rate, if there is a change in 
the Group’s estimate of the amount expected to be payable under a 
residual value guarantee, or if the Group changes its assessment of 
whether it will exercise a purchase, extension or termination option.

When a lease liability is remeasured, a corresponding adjustment is made 
to the carrying amount of the right-of-use asset or is recognised in the 
Group income statement if the asset is fully depreciated.

The Group presents right-of-use assets within property, plant and 
equipment and lease obligations within the Group balance sheet.

(n) Post-employment benefit assets and obligations 
(note 36)
Defined benefit pension arrangements – funded plans
The post-employment benefit assets and obligations recognised in the 
Group balance sheet in respect of funded plans comprise the fair value of 
plan assets of funded plans less the present value of the related defined 
benefit obligation at that date. The defined benefit obligation is calculated 
annually by independent qualified actuaries, using the projected unit 
credit method. 

The present value of the defined benefit obligation is determined by 
discounting the estimated future cash outflows, using market yields 
on high-quality corporate pound sterling bonds with maturity terms 
consistent with the estimated average term of the related pension liability.

Actuarial gains and losses arising from experience adjustments, and 
changes in actuarial assumptions, are recognised immediately in the 
Group statement of comprehensive income.

The pension cost recognised in the Group income statement comprises 
the cost of benefits accrued plus interest on the opening net defined 
benefit obligation or asset. Service costs and financing income and 
expenses are recognised separately in the Group income statement. 
Plan expenses are deducted from the expected return on the plan assets 
over the year.

Defined benefit pension arrangements – unfunded plans
Unfunded pension obligations are determined and accounted for 
in accordance with the principles used in respect of the funded 
arrangements.

Defined contribution pension arrangements
The assets of defined contribution plans are held separately in 
independently administered funds. The pension cost recognised in the 
Group income statement represents the contributions payable by the 
Group to these funds, in respect of the year.

Post-retirement healthcare obligations
Obligations in respect of post-retirement healthcare plans are calculated 
annually by independent qualified actuaries, using an actuarial 
methodology similar to that for the funded defined benefit pension 
arrangements. 

Actuarial gains and losses arising from experience adjustments, and 
changes in actuarial assumptions, are recognised in the Group statement 
of comprehensive income. The cost recognised in the Group income 
statement comprises only interest on the obligations.

(o) Provisions (note 38)
A provision is recognised when the Group has a present obligation as a 
result of a past event, it is probable that an outflow of resources will be 
required to settle the obligation, and a reliable estimate can be made of 
the amount of the obligation.

The provision is measured at the best estimate of the expenditure required 
to settle the obligation at the reporting date, discounted at a pre-tax rate 
reflecting current market assessments of the time value of money and 
risks specific to the liability. The unwinding of the discount is recognised as 
a finance expense in the Group income statement. In making its estimates, 
management takes into account the advice of legal counsel.

Restructuring provisions are recognised only when the Group has 
approved a detailed formal plan that identifies the business or part of the 
business concerned, and the restructuring has commenced or its main 
features have been announced to those affected by it. Future operating 
losses are not provided for.

(p) Own shares (note 40)
The Group has a number of equity-settled, share-based employee 
incentive plans. In connection with these, shares in the Company are held 
by The Experian plc Employee Share Trust and the Experian UK Approved 
All-Employee Share Plan. The assets of these entities mainly comprise 
Experian plc shares, which are shown as a deduction from equity at cost.

Shares in the Company purchased and held as treasury shares, in 
connection with the above plans and any share purchase programme, are 
also shown as a deduction from equity at cost. The par value of shares in 
the Company that are purchased and cancelled, in connection with any 
share purchase programme, is accounted for as a reduction in called-up 
share capital with any cost in excess of that amount being deducted from 
retained earnings.

(q) Assets and liabilities classified as held-for-sale (note 43)
Assets and liabilities are classified as held-for-sale when their carrying 
amounts are to be recovered or settled principally through a sale 
transaction and a sale is considered highly probable. They are stated 
at the lower of the carrying amount and fair value less costs to sell. 
No depreciation or amortisation is charged in respect of non-current 
assets classified as held-for-sale. 

(r) Revenue recognition (note 9)
Revenue is stated net of any sales taxes, rebates and discounts and 
reflects the amount of consideration we expect to receive in exchange 
for the transfer of promised goods and services.

Total consideration from contracts with customers is allocated to the 
performance obligations identified based on their standalone selling price, 
and is recognised when those performance obligations are satisfied and 
the control of goods or services is transferred to the customer, either over 
time or at a point in time.

 a The provision and processing of transactional data is distinguished 

between contracts that:

 – provide a service on a per unit basis, where the transfer to the 
customer of each completed unit is considered satisfaction of 
a single performance obligation. Revenue is recognised on the 
transfer of each unit;

 – provide a service to the customer over the contractual term, 

normally between one and five years, where revenue is recognised 
on the transfer of this service to customers. For the majority of 
contracts this means revenue is spread evenly over the contract 
term, as customers simultaneously receive and consume the 
benefits of the service;

Notes to the Group financial statements continuedExperian plc Financial statements173

5. Signiﬁcant accounting policies continued

 – require an enhanced service at the start, where revenue is 

recognised to reflect the upfront benefit the customer receives and 
consumes. Revenue for such contracts is recognised proportionally 
in line with the costs of providing the service.

 a Revenue from referral fees for credit products and white-label 

partnerships is recognised as transactional revenue.

 a Revenue from transactional batch data arrangements that include an 
ongoing update service is apportioned across each delivery to the 
customer and is recognised when the delivery is complete, and control 
of the batch data passes to the customer. Performance obligations are 
determined based on the frequency of data refresh: one-off, quarterly, 
monthly, or real-time.

 a Subscription and membership fees for continuous access to a service 
are recognised over the period to which they relate, usually 1, 12 or 24 
months. Customers simultaneously receive and consume the benefits 
of the service; therefore, revenue is recognised evenly over the 
subscription or membership term. 

 a Revenue for one-off credit reports is recognised when the report is 

delivered to the consumer.

 a Software licence and implementation services are primarily accounted 
for as a single performance obligation, with revenue recognised when 
the combined offering is delivered to the customer. Contract terms 
normally vary between one and five years. These services are 
distinguished between: 

 – Experian-hosted solutions, where the customer has the right to 

access a software solution over a specified time period. Customers 
simultaneously receive and consume the benefits of the service and 
revenue is spread evenly over the period that the service is available; 
and 

 – On-premise software licence arrangements, where the software 
solution is installed in an environment controlled by the customer. 
The arrangement represents a right to use licence and so the 
performance obligation is considered to be fulfilled on delivery 
completion, when control of the configured solution is passed to 
the customer. Revenue is recognised at that point in time.

 a The delivery of support and maintenance agreements is generally 
considered to be a separate performance obligation to provide a 
technical support service including minor updates. Contract terms are 
often aligned with licence terms. Customers simultaneously receive 
and consume the benefits of the service, therefore revenue is spread 
evenly over the term of the maintenance period.

 a The provision of distinct standalone consultancy and professional 

services is distinguished between:

 – Professional consultancy services where the performance obligation 
is the provision of personnel. Customers simultaneously receive and 
consume the benefits of the service, and revenue is recognised over 
time, in line with hours provided; and

 – The provision of analytical models and analyses, where the 

performance obligation is a deliverable, or a series of deliverables, 
and revenue is recognised on delivery when control is passed to the 
customer. 

Sales are typically invoiced in the geographic area in which the customer 
is located. As a result, the geographic location of the invoicing undertaking 
is used to attribute revenue to individual countries.

Accrued income balances, which represent the right to consideration in 
exchange for goods or services that we have transferred to a customer, 
are assessed as to whether they meet the definition of a contract asset:

 a When the right to consideration is conditional on something other than 
the passage of time, a balance is classified as a contract asset. This 
arises where there are further performance obligations to be satisfied 
as part of the contract with the customer and typically includes 
balances relating to software licensing contracts.

 a When the right to consideration is conditional only on the passage of 
time, the balance does not meet the definition of a contract asset and 
is classified as an unbilled receivable. This typically arises where the 
timing of the related billing cycle occurs in a period after the 
performance obligation is satisfied. 

Costs incurred prior to the satisfaction or partial satisfaction of a 
performance obligation are first assessed to see if they are within the 
scope of other standards. Where they are not, certain costs are recognised 
as an asset providing they relate directly to a contract (or an anticipated 
contract), generate or enhance resources that will be used in satisfying 
(or to continue to satisfy) performance obligations in the future and are 
expected to be recovered from the customer. Costs which meet these 
criteria are deferred as contract costs and these are amortised on a 
systematic basis consistent with the pattern of transfer of the related 
goods or services.

 a Costs to obtain a contract predominantly comprise sales commissions 

costs. 

 a Costs to fulfil a contract predominantly comprise labour costs directly 

relating to the implementation services provided. 

If evidence emerges that a contract is loss making, no further costs are 
capitalised and any related contract assets are reviewed for impairment. 
A provision for future losses is established when the unavoidable costs 
of the contract exceed the economic benefits expected to be received.

Contract liabilities arise when we have an obligation to transfer future 
goods or services to a customer for which we have received 
consideration, or the amount is due from the customer, and include both 
deferred income balances and specific reserves.

(s) Operating charges
Operating charges are reported by nature in the Group income statement, 
reflecting the Group’s cost-management control structure.

Details of the types of charges within labour costs in respect of share 
incentive plans are set out in note 5(v). Those for post-employment 
benefits are set out in note 5(n).

Details of the Group’s amortisation and depreciation policy are given in 
notes 5(f), 5(g) and 5(m). The principles upon which impairment charges 
of tangible and intangible assets are recognised are set out in notes 5(d), 
5(e) and 5(f).

(t) Net finance (income)/expense (note 16)
Incremental transaction costs which are directly attributable to the issue 
of debt are capitalised and amortised over the expected life of the 
borrowing, using the effective interest method. All other borrowing costs 
are charged in the Group income statement in the year in which they are 
incurred.

Amounts payable or receivable in respect of interest rate swaps are taken 
to net finance costs over the periods of the contracts, together with the 
interest differentials reflected in foreign exchange contracts.

Details of the nature of movements in the fair value of derivatives which 
are reported as financial fair value remeasurements are included in note 
5(j). The change in the year in the present value of put option agreements, 
in respect of shares held by non-controlling shareholders, is recognised 
as a financing fair value remeasurement within net finance costs.

Experian plc  Annual Report 2023Financial statements174

5. Signiﬁcant accounting policies continued
(u) Tax (note 17)
The tax charge or credit for the year is recognised in the Group income 
statement, except for tax on items recognised in OCI or directly in equity. 

Current tax is calculated on the basis of the tax laws substantively enacted 
at the balance sheet date in the countries where the Group operates. 
Current tax assets and liabilities are offset where there is a legally 
enforceable right of offset. 

Uncertain tax positions are considered on an individual basis. Where 
management considers it probable that an additional outflow will result 
from any given position, a provision is made. Such provisions are 
measured using management’s best estimate of the most likely outcome. 

Deferred tax is provided in full on temporary differences arising between 
the tax bases of assets and liabilities and their carrying amounts in the 
Group financial statements. Deferred tax is not recognised on taxable 
temporary differences arising on the initial recognition of goodwill. 
Deferred tax is not accounted for when it arises from the initial recognition 
of an asset or liability in a transaction, other than a business combination, 
that at the time of the transaction affects neither accounting nor taxable 
profit or loss. Deferred tax assets and liabilities are calculated at the tax 
rates that are expected to apply when the asset is realised or the liability 
settled, based on the tax rates and laws that have been enacted or 
substantively enacted by the balance sheet date in the countries where 
the Group operates.

Deferred tax assets are recognised in respect of tax losses carried 
forward and other temporary differences, to the extent that it is probable 
that the related tax benefit will be realised through future taxable profits. 
Deferred tax is provided on temporary differences arising on investments 
in subsidiaries and associates, except where the Group controls the timing 
of the reversal of the temporary difference and it is probable that the 
temporary difference will not reverse in the foreseeable future. Deferred 
tax assets and liabilities are offset where there is a legally enforceable 
right to offset current tax assets and liabilities and where they relate to 
the same tax authority.

(v) Share incentive plans (note 34)
The fair value of share incentives granted in connection with the Group’s 
equity-settled, share-based employee incentive plans is recognised as 
an expense on a straight-line basis over the vesting period. Fair value is 
measured using whichever of the Black-Scholes model, Monte Carlo 
model or closing market price is most appropriate. The Group takes into 
account the best estimate of the number of awards and options expected 
to vest and revises such estimates at each balance sheet date. 
Non-market performance conditions are included in the vesting 
estimates. Market-based performance conditions are included in the 
fair value measurement but are not revised for actual performance.

(w) Contingent consideration (note 31(h))
The initially recorded cost of any acquisition includes a reasonable 
estimate of the fair value of any contingent amounts expected to be 
payable in the future. Any cost or benefit arising when such estimates are 
revised is recognised in the Group income statement (note 15). 

Where part or all of the amount of disposal consideration is contingent 
on future events, the disposal proceeds initially recorded include a 
reasonable estimate of the value of the contingent amounts expected 
to be receivable and payable in the future. The proceeds and profit or 
loss on disposal are adjusted when revised estimates are made, with 
corresponding adjustments made to receivables and payables as 
appropriate, until the ultimate outcome is known and the related 
consideration received.

(x) Discontinued operations (note 18)
A discontinued operation is a component of the Group’s business that 
represents a separate geographic area of operation or a separate major 
line of business. Classification as a discontinued operation occurs upon 
disposal or earlier, if the operation meets the criteria to be classified as 
held-for-sale. Discontinued operations are presented in the Group income 
statement as a separate line and are shown net of tax.

When an operation is classified as a discontinued operation, comparatives 
in the Group income statement and the Group statement of 
comprehensive income are re-presented as if the operation had been 
discontinued from the start of the comparator year. 

(y) Earnings per share (EPS) (note 19)
Earnings per share are reported in accordance with IAS 33.

(z) Segment information policy and presentation principles 
(note 10)
We are organised into, and managed on a worldwide basis through, the 
following five operating segments, which are based on geographic areas 
and supported by central functions:

 a North America

 a Latin America

 a UK and Ireland

 a Europe, Middle East and Africa (EMEA) and

 a Asia Pacific.

The chief operating decision maker makes operating decisions, allocates 
resources and assesses the performance of these operating segments on 
the basis of Benchmark EBIT, as defined in note 7.

The ‘All other segments’ category required to be disclosed has been 
captioned as EMEA/Asia Pacific in these financial statements. This 
combines information in respect of the EMEA and Asia Pacific segments, 
as neither of these operating segments is individually reportable, on the 
basis of their share of the Group’s revenue, reported profit or loss, and 
assets.

We separately present information equivalent to segment disclosures in 
respect of the costs of our central functions, under the caption ‘Central 
Activities’, as management believes that this information is helpful to 
users of the financial statements. Costs reported for Central Activities 
include costs arising from finance, treasury and other global functions.

Inter-segment transactions are entered into under the normal 
commercial terms and conditions that would be available to third parties. 
Such transactions do not have a material impact on the Group’s results. 

Segment assets consist primarily of property, plant and equipment, 
intangible assets including goodwill, derivatives designated as hedges of 
future commercial transactions, contract assets and receivables. They 
exclude tax assets, cash and cash equivalents, and derivatives designated 
as hedges of borrowings. Segment liabilities comprise operating and 
contract liabilities, including derivatives designated as hedges of future 
commercial transactions and lease obligations. They exclude tax liabilities, 
borrowings, other than lease obligations, and related hedging derivatives. 
Net assets reported for Central Activities comprise corporate head office 
assets and liabilities, including certain post-employment benefit assets 
and obligations, and derivative assets and liabilities. Capital expenditure 
comprises additions to property, plant and equipment and intangible 
assets, other than additions through business combinations or to 
right-of-use assets.

Notes to the Group financial statements continuedExperian plc Financial statements175

5. Signiﬁcant accounting policies continued
Information required to be presented also includes analysis of the Group’s 
revenues by groups of service lines. This is supplemented by voluntary 
disclosure of the profitability of those groups of service lines. For ease of 
reference, we use the term ‘business segments’ when discussing the 
results of groups of service lines. Our two business segments, details of 
which are given in the Strategic report section of this Annual Report, are:

 a Business-to-Business

 a Consumer Services.

The North America, Latin America and the UK and Ireland operating 
segments derive revenues from both of the Group’s business segments. 
The EMEA and Asia Pacific segments currently do not derive revenue 
from the Consumer Services business segment.

Reportable segment information for the full year provided to the chief 
operating decision maker is set out in note 10(a).

6. Critical accounting estimates, assumptions and 
judgments

(a) Critical accounting estimates and assumptions
In preparing these financial statements, management is required to make 
estimates and assumptions that affect the reported amount of revenues, 
expenses, assets, liabilities and the disclosure of contingent liabilities. The 
resulting accounting estimates, which are based on management’s best 
judgment at the date of these financial statements, will seldom equal the 
subsequent actual amounts. The estimates and assumptions that have a 
significant risk of causing a material adjustment to the carrying amounts 
of assets and liabilities within the next financial year are summarised 
below, with further information provided within the Financial review in the 
Strategic report. Revenue recognition is excluded from this summary on 
the grounds that the policy adopted in this area is sufficiently objective.

Goodwill (note 21)
The Group tests goodwill for impairment annually, or more frequently if 
there is an indication that it may be impaired. The recoverable amount of 
each group of CGUs is generally determined on the basis of value-in-use 
calculations, which require the use of cash flow projections based on 
financial forecasts, looking forward five years. Three-year growth 
expectations are reviewed as part of the annual strategic planning 
process and forecasts for years beyond this are extrapolated based on 
management’s best estimates. Management determines budgeted profit 
margin based on past performance and its expectations for the market’s 
development. Cash flows after the five year forecast period are 
extrapolated using estimated growth rates that do not exceed the 
long-term average growth rate for the CGU’s markets. The discount rates 
used reflect the Group’s pre-tax weighted average cost of capital (WACC), 
as adjusted for region-specific risks and other factors. Discount rates 
have increased during the year ended 31 March 2023 primarily as a result 
of increases in 20-year US Treasury yields, which are used as the 
estimated risk-free rates in the cost of capital calculations.

Post-employment benefits (note 36)
Accounting for the Group’s post-employment benefit obligations requires 
management to exercise judgment and make a number of assumptions 
about uncertain events. The key sources of estimation uncertainty are the 
discount rate applied to future cash flows, the expected rate of future 
inflationary increases and the life expectancy of the schemes’ members.

The estimates in respect of these critical assumptions are made after 
seeking advice from independent qualified actuaries. The discount rate, 
inflation rate and mortality assumptions may have a material effect in 
determining the defined benefit pension obligations and the amounts 
reported in the Group financial statements. 

Information regarding actuarial assumptions and sensitivities to changes 
in the critical accounting estimates are provided in note 36.

(b) Critical judgments
In applying the Group’s accounting policies, management has made 
judgments that have a significant effect on the amounts recognised in the 
Group financial statements and the reported amounts of assets, liabilities, 
income and expenses. Actual results may differ from these estimates. 
Estimates and underlying assumptions are reviewed on an ongoing basis. 
Revisions to estimates are recognised prospectively. 

The most significant of these judgments are in respect of intangible 
assets and contingencies:

Intangible assets
Certain costs incurred in the developmental phase of an internal project, 
which include the development of databases, internal use software and 
internally generated software, are capitalised as intangible assets if a 
number of criteria are met. Management has made judgments and 
assumptions when assessing whether a project meets these criteria, and 
on measuring the costs and the economic life attributed to such projects. 

On acquisition, specific intangible assets are identified and recognised 
separately from goodwill and then amortised over their estimated useful 
lives. These include items such as brand names and customer lists, to 
which value is first attributed at the time of acquisition. The capitalisation 
of these assets and the related amortisation charges are based on 
judgments about the value and economic life of such items. 

The economic lives of intangible assets are estimated at between three 
and ten years for internal projects and between two and 20 years for 
acquisition intangibles. Amortisation methods, useful lives and residual 
values are reviewed at each reporting date and adjusted if appropriate. 

Further details of the amounts of, and movements in, such assets are 
given in note 22.

Contingencies
In the case of pending and threatened litigation claims, management has 
formed a judgment as to the likelihood of ultimate liability. No liability has 
been recognised where the likelihood of any loss arising is possible rather 
than probable.

7. Use of non-GAAP measures in the Group ﬁnancial 
statements
As detailed below, the Group has identified and defined certain measures 
that it uses to understand and manage its performance. The measures 
are not defined under IFRS and they may not be directly comparable with 
other companies’ adjusted performance measures. These non-GAAP 
measures are not intended to be a substitute for any IFRS measures of 
performance but management considers them to be key measures used 
within the business for assessing the underlying performance of the 
Group’s ongoing businesses.

Management no longer uses Benchmark PBT per share as a measure for 
assessing underlying performance; this definition has therefore been 
removed from our non-GAAP measures.

As a result of our restructuring programme in EMEA/Asia Pacific we have 
refined the definition of Exceptional items to include onerous global 
support costs associated with the closure of significant operations, to aid 
assessment of underlying operating performance as such costs are 
eliminated through restructuring activity.

Experian plc  Annual Report 2023Financial statements176

7. Use of non-GAAP measures in the Group ﬁnancial 
statements continued

(a) Benchmark profit before tax (Benchmark PBT) 
(note 10(a)(i))
Benchmark PBT is disclosed to indicate the Group’s underlying 
profitability. It is defined as profit before amortisation and impairment of 
acquisition intangibles, impairment of goodwill, acquisition expenses, 
adjustments to contingent consideration, Exceptional items, financing fair 
value remeasurements, tax (and interest thereon) and discontinued 
operations. It includes the Group’s share of continuing associates’ 
Benchmark post-tax results.

An explanation of the basis on which we report Exceptional items is 
provided in note 7(l). Other adjustments, in addition to Exceptional items, 
made to derive Benchmark PBT are explained as follows:

 a Charges for the amortisation and impairment of acquisition intangibles 
are excluded from the calculation of Benchmark PBT because these 
charges are based on judgments about their value and economic life 
and bear no relation to the Group’s underlying ongoing performance. 
Impairment of goodwill is similarly excluded from the calculation of 
Benchmark PBT.

 a Acquisition and disposal expenses (representing the incidental costs 
of acquisitions and disposals, one-time integration costs and other 
corporate transaction expenses) relating to successful, active or 
aborted acquisitions and disposals are excluded from the definition 
of Benchmark PBT as they bear no relation to the Group’s underlying 
ongoing performance or to the performance of any acquired 
businesses. Adjustments to contingent consideration are similarly 
excluded from the definition of Benchmark PBT.

 a Charges and credits for financing fair value remeasurements within 

finance expense in the Group income statement are excluded from the 
definition of Benchmark PBT. These include retranslation of intra-Group 
funding, and that element of the Group’s derivatives that is ineligible for 
hedge accounting, together with gains and losses on put options in 
respect of acquisitions. Amounts recognised generally arise from 
market movements and accordingly bear no direct relation to the 
Group’s underlying performance.

(b) Benchmark earnings before interest and tax (Benchmark 
EBIT) and margin (Benchmark EBIT margin) (note 10(a)(i))
Benchmark EBIT is defined as Benchmark PBT before the net interest 
expense charged therein and accordingly excludes Exceptional items as 
defined below. Benchmark EBIT margin is Benchmark EBIT from ongoing 
activities expressed as a percentage of revenue from ongoing activities.

(c) Benchmark earnings before interest, tax, depreciation 
and amortisation (Benchmark EBITDA)
Benchmark EBITDA is defined as Benchmark EBIT before the depreciation 
and amortisation charged therein (note 13).

(d) Exited business activities
Exited business activities are businesses sold, closed or identified for 
closure during a financial year. These are treated as exited business 
activities for both revenue and Benchmark EBIT purposes. The results of 
exited business activities are disclosed separately with the results of the 
prior period re-presented in the segmental analyses as appropriate. This 
measure differs from the definition of discontinued operations in IFRS 5.

(e) Ongoing activities
The results of businesses trading at 31 March 2023, that are not disclosed 
as exited business activities, are reported as ongoing activities.

(f) Constant exchange rates
To highlight our organic performance, we discuss our results in terms 
of growth at constant exchange rates, unless otherwise stated. This 
represents growth calculated after translating both years’ performance 
at the prior year’s average exchange rates.

(g) Total growth (note 10(a)(ii))
This is the year-on-year change in the performance of our activities at 
actual exchange rates. Total growth at constant exchange rates removes 
the translational foreign exchange effects arising on the consolidation of 
our activities and comprises one of our measures of performance at 
constant exchange rates.

(h) Organic revenue growth (note 10(a)(ii))
This is the year-on-year change in the revenue of ongoing activities, 
translated at constant exchange rates, excluding acquisitions until the first 
anniversary of their consolidation.

(i) Benchmark earnings and Total Benchmark earnings 
(note 19)
Benchmark earnings comprises Benchmark PBT less attributable tax and 
non-controlling interests. The attributable tax for this purpose excludes 
significant tax credits and charges arising in the year which, in view of 
their size or nature, are not comparable with previous years, together with 
tax arising on Exceptional items and on other adjustments made to derive 
Benchmark PBT. Benchmark PBT less attributable tax is designated as 
Total Benchmark earnings. 

(j) Benchmark earnings per share (Benchmark EPS) 
(note 19)
Benchmark EPS comprises Benchmark earnings divided by the weighted 
average number of issued ordinary shares, as adjusted for own shares 
held.

(k) Benchmark tax charge and rate (note 17(b)(ii))
The Benchmark tax charge is the tax charge applicable to Benchmark 
PBT. It differs from the tax charge by tax attributable to Exceptional items 
and other adjustments made to derive Benchmark PBT, and exceptional 
tax charges. A reconciliation is provided in note 17(b)(ii) to these financial 
statements. The Benchmark effective rate of tax is calculated by dividing 
the Benchmark tax charge by Benchmark PBT.

(l) Exceptional items (note 15(a))
The separate reporting of Exceptional items gives an indication of the 
Group’s underlying performance. Exceptional items include those arising 
from the profit or loss on disposal of businesses, closure costs of 
significant operations (including onerous global support costs associated 
with these operations), costs of significant restructuring programmes and 
other financially significant one-off items. All other restructuring costs are 
charged against Benchmark EBIT, in the segments in which they are 
incurred.

(m) Full-year dividend per share (note 20)
Full-year dividend per share comprises the total of dividends per share 
announced in respect of the financial year. 

Notes to the Group financial statements continuedExperian plc Financial statements177

7. Use of non-GAAP measures in the Group ﬁnancial 
statements continued

(n) Benchmark operating and Benchmark free cash flow
Benchmark operating cash flow is Benchmark EBIT plus amortisation, 
depreciation and charges in respect of share-based incentive plans, less 
capital expenditure net of disposal proceeds and adjusted for changes in 
working capital, principal lease payments and the Group’s share of the 
Benchmark profit or loss retained in continuing associates. Benchmark 
free cash flow is derived from Benchmark operating cash flow by 
excluding net interest, tax paid in respect of continuing operations and 
dividends paid to non-controlling interests.

(o) Cash flow conversion
Cash flow conversion is Benchmark operating cash flow expressed as a 
percentage of Benchmark EBIT.

(p) Net debt and Net funding (note 29) 
Net debt is borrowings (and the fair value of derivatives hedging 
borrowings) excluding accrued interest, less cash and cash equivalents 
and other highly liquid bank deposits with original maturities greater than 
three months. Net funding is borrowings (and the fair value of the effective 
portion of derivatives hedging borrowings) excluding accrued interest, 
less cash held in Group Treasury.

(q) Return on capital employed (ROCE) (note 10(a)(iii))
ROCE is defined as Benchmark EBIT less tax at the Benchmark rate 
divided by a three-point average of capital employed, in continuing 
operations, over the year. Capital employed is net assets less 
non-controlling interests and right-of-use assets, further adjusted to add 
or deduct the net tax liability or asset and to add Net debt. 

8. Financial risk management

(a) Financial risk factors
The Group’s activities expose it to a variety of financial risks. These are 
market risk, including foreign exchange risk and interest rate risk, credit 
risk, and liquidity risk. These risks are unchanged from those reported in 
the 2022 Annual Report. The numeric disclosures in respect of financial 
risks are included within later notes to the financial statements, to provide 
a more transparent link between financial risks and results.

Financial risks represent part of the Group’s risks in relation to its strategy 
and business objectives. There is a full discussion of the most significant 
risks in the Risk management section of this Annual Report. The Group’s 
financial risk management focuses on the unpredictability of financial 
markets and seeks to minimise potentially adverse effects on the Group’s 
financial performance. The Group seeks to reduce its exposure to financial 
risks and uses derivative financial instruments to hedge certain risk 
exposures. Such derivative financial instruments are also used to manage 
the Group’s borrowings so that amounts are held in currencies broadly in 
the same proportion as the Group’s main earnings. However, the Group 
does not, nor does it currently intend to, borrow in the Brazilian real or the 
Colombian peso.

The Group also ensures surplus funds are prudently managed and 
controlled.

Foreign exchange risk
The Group is exposed to foreign exchange risk from future commercial 
transactions, recognised assets and liabilities and investments in, and 
loans between, Group undertakings with different functional currencies. 
The Group manages such risk, primarily within undertakings whose 
functional currencies are the US dollar, by:

 a entering into forward foreign exchange contracts in the relevant 
currencies in respect of investments in entities with functional 
currencies other than the US dollar, whose net assets are exposed to 
foreign exchange translation risk;

 a swapping the proceeds of certain bonds issued in pounds sterling and 

euros into US dollars;

 a managing the liquidity of Group undertakings in the functional currency 
of those undertakings by using an in-house banking structure and 
hedging any remaining foreign currency exposures with forward 
foreign exchange contracts;

 a denominating internal loans in relevant currencies, to match the 

currencies of assets and liabilities in entities with different functional 
currencies; and

 a using forward foreign exchange contracts to hedge certain future 

commercial transactions.

The principal transaction exposures are to the pound sterling and the 
euro. An indication of the sensitivity to foreign exchange risk is given in 
note 11.

Interest rate risk
The Group’s interest rate risk arises principally from components of its 
Net debt that are at variable rates.

The Group has a policy of normally maintaining between 50% and 100% 
of Net funding at rates that are fixed for more than six months. The Group 
manages its interest rate exposure by: 

 a using fixed and floating rate borrowings, interest rate swaps and 

cross-currency interest rate swaps to adjust the balance between the 
two; and

 a mixing the duration of borrowings and interest rate swaps to smooth 

the impact of interest rate fluctuations.

Managing interest rate benchmark reform and associated risks
A fundamental reform of interest rate benchmarks is taking place globally, 
involving the replacement of many London interbank offered rates 
(LIBOR). Historically our main floating rate borrowings and derivatives 
have been indexed to pound sterling and US dollar LIBOR. We have 
amended our revolving credit facilities and other financial instruments, so 
that pound sterling exposures are now indexed to Sterling Overnight Index 
Average (SONIA) rate, and US dollar exposures to the Secured Overnight 
Financing Rate (SOFR).

Derivatives
The Group has transacted cross-currency swaps, interest rate swaps and 
equity swaps for risk management purposes. As at 31 March 2022, these 
swaps had floating legs that were indexed to US dollar LIBOR. During the 
year, the Group modified such derivatives to reference SOFR, which had 
no impact on the hedge accounting relationships in line with the phase 2 
interest rate benchmark reform guidance. Derivatives previously indexed 
to pound sterling LIBOR were modified to reference SONIA in the year 
ended 31 March 2022. The impact of the reform was immaterial for these 
instruments.

Hedge accounting
At 31 March 2022, the Group’s hedging instruments documented in hedge 
accounting relationships were indexed to US dollar LIBOR. During the year 
these instruments were updated to reference SOFR. The impact of the 
reform was immaterial on these instruments.

Further information in respect of the Group’s net finance costs for the 
year and an indication of the sensitivity to interest rate risk is given in note 
16.

8. Financial risk management continued
Credit risk
In the case of derivative financial instruments, deposits, contract assets 
and trade receivables, the Group is exposed to credit risk from the 
non-performance of contractual agreements by the contracted party.

Credit risk is managed by:

(b) Capital risk management
The Group’s definition and management of capital focuses on capital 
employed:

 a The Group’s capital employed is reported in the net assets summary 
table set out in the Financial review and analysed by segment in note 
10(a)(iii). 

 a only entering into contracts for derivative financial instruments and 

 a As part of its internal reporting processes, the Group monitors capital 

deposits with banks and financial institutions with strong credit ratings, 
within limits set for each organisation; and

employed by operating segment.

The Group’s objectives in managing capital are to:

 a safeguard its ability to continue as a going concern, in order to provide 
returns for shareholders and benefits for other stakeholders; and 

 a maintain an optimal capital structure and cost of capital.

The Group’s policy is to have:

 a a prudent but efficient balance sheet; and

 a a target leverage ratio of 2.0 to 2.5 times Benchmark EBITDA, 

consistent with the intention to retain strong investment-grade credit 
ratings.

To maintain or adjust its capital structure, the Group may:

 a adjust the amount of dividends paid to shareholders;

 a return capital to shareholders;

 a issue or purchase our own shares; or

 a sell assets to reduce Net debt.

Dividend policy
The Group has a progressive dividend policy which aims to increase the 
dividend over time broadly in line with the underlying growth in 
Benchmark EPS. This aligns shareholder returns with the underlying 
profitability of the Group. In determining the level of dividend in any one 
year, in accordance with the policy, the Board also considers a number of 
other factors, including the outlook for the Group, the opportunities for 
organic investment, the opportunities to make acquisitions and disposals, 
the cash flow generated by the Group, and the level of dividend cover. 
Further detail on the distributable reserves of the Company can be found 
in note L to the Company financial statements. 

 a closely controlling dealing activity and regularly monitoring 

counterparty positions.

The credit risk on derivative financial instruments utilised and deposits 
held by the Group is therefore not considered to be significant. The Group 
does not anticipate that any losses will arise from non-performance by its 
chosen counterparties. Further information on the Group’s derivative 
financial instruments at the balance sheet dates is given in note 31 and 
that in respect of amounts recognised in the Group income statement is 
given in note 16. Further information on the Group’s cash and cash 
equivalents at the balance sheet dates is given in note 26.

To minimise credit risk for trade receivables, the Group has implemented 
policies that require appropriate credit checks on potential clients before 
granting credit. The maximum credit risk in respect of such financial 
assets is their carrying value. Further information in respect of the 
Group’s trade receivables is given in note 25.

Debt investments
All of the Group’s debt investments at amortised cost and FVOCI are 
considered to have low credit risk; the loss allowance is therefore limited 
to 12 months’ expected losses. Management considers ‘low credit risk’ for 
listed bonds to be an investment-grade credit rating with at least one 
major rating agency. Other instruments are considered to be low credit 
risk when they have a low risk of default and the issuer has a high 
capacity to meet its contractual cash flow obligations in the near term.

Financial assets at FVPL
The Group is also exposed to credit risk in relation to debt investments 
that are measured at FVPL. The maximum exposure at the balance sheet 
date is the carrying amount of these investments.

Liquidity risk
The Group manages liquidity risk by:

 a issuing long-maturity bonds and notes;

 a entering into long-term committed bank borrowing facilities, to ensure 
the Group has sufficient funds available for operations and planned 
growth; 

 a spreading the maturity dates of its debt; and

 a monitoring rolling cash flow forecasts, to ensure the Group has 

adequate, unutilised committed bank borrowing facilities.

Details of such facilities are given in note 28. A maturity analysis of 
contractual undiscounted future cash flows for financial liabilities is 
provided in note 33.

1  Revenue for the year ended 31 March 2022 of US$51m has been re-presented for the reclassification to exited business activities of certain B2B businesses.

Total revenue comprises revenue from ongoing activities as well as revenue from exited business activities and is reconciled in note 10. Revenue in 
respect of exited business activities of US$32m (2022: US$72m) comprised EMEA/Asia Pacific Data and Decisioning revenue of US$7m (2022: US$18m) 
and US$25m (2022: US$54m) respectively.

Data is predominantly transactional revenue with a portion from licence fees.

Decisioning revenue is derived from:

 a software and system sales, and includes recurring licence fees, consultancy and implementation fees, and transactional charges;

 a credit score fees which are primarily transactional; and

 a analytics income comprising a mix of consultancy and professional fees as well as transactional revenue. 

Consumer Services revenue primarily comprises monthly subscription and one-off fees, and referral fees for credit products and white-label 
partnerships.

The timing of recognition of these revenue streams is discussed in note 5(r).

(b) Significant changes in contract balances
Contract assets predominantly relate to software licence services, where revenue recognition for on-premise arrangements occurs as the solution is 
transferred to the customer, whereas the invoicing pattern is often annually over the contract period. Contract assets recognised during the year totalled 
US$87m (2022: US$70m). The contract asset balance for work completed but not invoiced on satisfaction of a performance obligation unwinds over 
the contract term. Contract assets are transferred to receivables when the right to consideration becomes unconditional, or conditional only on the 
passage of time. Contract assets of US$60m (2022: US$77m) were reclassified to receivables during the year. An impairment charge of US$10m 
(2022: US$5m) was recognised against contract assets during the year. The decrease in contract assets resulting from disposals during the year was 
US$nil (2022: US$5m).

The majority of software licences are invoiced annually in advance. Where these licences relate to Experian-hosted solutions, revenue is recognised over 
the period that the service is available to the customer, creating a contract liability. Delivery services are generally invoiced during the delivery period, 
creating a contract liability for the consideration received in advance, until the delivery is complete. Where the delivery relates to Experian-hosted 
solutions, revenue is recognised over the period that the service is available to the customer, reducing the contract liability over time. Where the delivery 
relates to an on-premise solution, the contract liability is released on delivery completion. Support and maintenance agreements are often invoiced 
annually in advance, creating a contract liability, which is released over the term of the maintenance period as revenue is recognised.

Revenue recognised in the year of US$401m (2022: US$370m) was included in the opening contract liability. Cash received in advance not recognised 
as revenue in the year was US$376m (2022: US$461m). The decrease in contract liabilities resulting from disposals during the year was US$nil 
(2022: US$4m). The increase in contract liabilities from acquisitions during the year was US$3m (2022: US$1m).

Foreign exchange accounts for US$4m and US$16m of the decrease in contract asset and contract liability balances in the year respectively (2022: US$3m 
and US$5m).

9. Revenue continued

(c) Contract costs
The carrying amount of assets recognised from costs to obtain, and costs to fulfil, contracts with customers at 31 March 2023 was US$27m and 
US$66m respectively (2022: US$22m and US$66m).

Amortisation of contract costs in the year was US$46m (2022: US$59m); there were no recognised impairment losses in the current or prior year. The 
decrease in contract costs resulting from acquisitions and disposals during the year was US$nil (2022: US$2m).

Contract costs are amortised on a systematic basis consistent with the pattern of transfer of the related goods or services. A portfolio approach has been 
applied to calculate contract costs for contracts with similar characteristics, where the Group reasonably expects that the effects of applying a portfolio 
approach does not differ materially from calculating the amounts at an individual contract level.

(d) Transaction price allocated to remaining performance obligations
The aggregate amount of the transaction price from non-cancellable contracts with customers with expected durations of 12 months or more, allocated 
to the performance obligations that are unsatisfied, or partially satisfied, at 31 March 2023 was US$4.9bn (2022: US$5.3bn). We expect to recognise 
approximately 49% (2022: 45%) of this value within one year, 30% (2022: 30%) within one to two years, 14% (2022: 15%) within two to three years and 7% 
(2022: 10%) thereafter. 

The aggregate amount of the transaction price allocated to unsatisfied, or partially satisfied, performance obligations which are transactional in nature 
includes estimates of variable consideration. These estimates are based on forecast transactional volumes and do not take into account all external 
market factors which may have an impact on the future revenue recognised from such contracts.

A portfolio approach has been applied to calculate the aggregate amount of the transaction price allocated to the unsatisfied, or partially satisfied, 
performance obligations for contracts with similar characteristics, where the Group reasonably expects that the effects of applying a portfolio approach 
does not differ materially from calculating the amounts at an individual contract level.

We apply the practical expedient in paragraph 121(a) of IFRS 15 and do not disclose information about remaining performance obligations that have 
original expected durations of one year or less. This excludes contracts across a number of business units which have revenue due to be recognised in 
the financial year ending 31 March 2024; it also excludes the majority of our direct-to-consumer arrangements.

(b) Foreign exchange risk
(i) Brazilian real intra-Group funding
A Group company whose functional currency is not the Brazilian real provides Brazilian real intra-Group funding to Serasa S.A.. Foreign exchange gains 
or losses on this funding are recognised in the Group income statement.

As a result of the weakening of 6% in the Brazilian real against the US dollar in the year ended 31 March 2023, a charge of US$16m has been recognised 
within financing fair value remeasurements (2022: US$43m gain due to 17% strengthening) (note 16(c)).

The Group is similarly exposed to the impact of the Brazilian real strengthening or weakening against the US dollar in the future. A movement of 14% 
would result in a US$30m impact on profit before tax. There is no effect on total equity as a result of this exposure, since it arises on intra-Group funding 
and there would be a related equal but opposite foreign exchange movement recognised in the translation reserve within equity.

(ii) Other exposures
On the basis of the profile of foreign exchange exposures, and an assessment of reasonably possible changes in such exposures, there are no other 
material sensitivities to foreign exchange risk at the balance sheet dates. In making these assessments, actual data on movements in the principal 
currencies over the most recent three-year period has been considered together with exposures at the balance sheet dates. This methodology has been 
applied consistently.

2  Acquisition and disposal expenses represent professional fees and expenses associated with completed, ongoing and terminated acquisition and disposal processes, as well as the integration and separation costs 

associated with completed deals. Of the total, US$7m (2022: US$9m) is recorded within labour costs in the Group income statement, and US$39m (2022: US$38m) is included within other operating charges.

Includes impairment of investment in associate. 

(b) Net loss on disposal of operations
The net loss on disposal of operations comprises costs incurred following the cessation of our activities in Russia in the year ended 31 March 2022 of 
US$3m (2022: US$43m) and a gain of US$2m (2022: US$nil) on the disposal of interests in two small subsidiaries in EMEA/Asia Pacific. 

(c) Net profit on disposal of associates
On 18 November 2020, the Group disposed of its 18.6% interest in Finicity Corporation. During the year further consideration of US$1m (2022: US$12m) 
was received in respect of earnout arrangements, the payout of which was not anticipated at 31 March 2021.

On 4 February 2022, Vector CM Holdings (Cayman) L.P., an associate undertaking, completed a merger with the CM Group involving its Cheetah Digital 
business. As a result of the merger, the Group no longer has significant influence over Vector and accordingly our interest in this company was 
recognised as a trade investment from that date. We recorded a fair value gain on the disposal in FY22 of US$95m, and the promissory note and 
associated interest due to Experian of US$110m were also repaid.

In the year ended 31 March 2022, we recognised a disposal of our Russian associate, United Credit Bureau, and wrote off the investment, recording a 
loss of US$17m.

(d) Restructuring costs
Costs of US$53m (2022: US$20m) were recognised in the year associated with a strategic review and restructuring, primarily in EMEA/Asia Pacific. We 
continue to execute on our strategy to concentrate on strategic markets where we can drive scale while also enhancing operating efficiency.

The charge includes a loss on disposal and asset write-downs and impairments of US$23m (2022: US$nil), and US$21m (2022: US$2m) is labour 
related. The associated cash outflow was US$20m (2022: US$14m). 

(e) Onerous global support costs
The charge in the year comprises costs that are directly attributable to exited businesses or incurred solely to support sub-scale, multi-country markets, 
and will be removed as we complete restructuring activity in EMEA/Asia Pacific.

(f) Legal provisions movements
Movements have occurred in provisions held for a number of historical legal claims, some of which are in the process of being settled. The credit in the 
year ended 31 March 2023 reflects legal costs in North America of US$26m, offset by insurance recoveries of US$29m.

(d) Interest rate risk
The following table shows the sensitivity to interest rate risk, on the basis of the profile of Net debt at the balance sheet dates and an assessment of 
reasonably possible changes in the principal interest rates, with all other variables held constant. In making this assessment, actual movements in 
relevant interest rates over the most recent three-year period have been considered and a consistent methodology applied. An indication of the primary 
cause of the reported sensitivity is included.

(b) Tax reconciliations
(i) Reconciliation of the tax charge
As the Group is subject to the tax rates of more than one country, it has chosen to present its reconciliation of the tax charge using the main rate of 
corporation tax in the UK. The effective rate of tax for each year based on profit before tax is higher (2022: higher) than the main rate of corporation tax 
in the UK, with the differences explained in note 17(c). 

Profit before tax

Profit before tax multiplied by the main rate of UK corporation tax of 19% (2022: 19%)

17. Tax charge continued

(c) Factors that affect the tax charge
Adjustments in respect of earlier periods reflect the net movement on uncertain tax positions, including adjustments for matters that have been 
substantively agreed with local tax authorities, and adjustments to deferred tax assets based on latest estimates and assumptions. 

Expenses not deductible include the impairment of associate investments, acquisition and disposal expenses and financing fair value remeasurements 
which are not allowable for tax purposes.

The Group’s tax rate reflects its internal financing arrangements in place to fund non-UK businesses.

In addition, in the normal course of business, the Group has a number of open tax returns with various tax authorities with whom it is in active dialogue. 
At 31 March 2023, the Group held current and deferred tax liabilities of US$102m (2022: US$293m) in respect of uncertain tax positions.

During the current and prior year, Experian was in discussions with the US Internal Revenue Service and His Majesty’s Revenue and Customs in the UK 
to seek clarity on transfer pricing and financing related issues. The net decrease in recognised provisions during the year was driven by the agreement 
of the Group’s most significant uncertain tax position. In the year ended 31 March 2022, the net decrease in recognised provisions followed the 
agreement of open tax issues in North America, and adjustments made to provisions on the utilisation of historical UK tax losses. 

Liabilities relating to these open and judgmental matters are based on an assessment as to whether additional taxes will be due, after taking into 
account external advice where appropriate. While the timing of developments in resolving these matters is inherently uncertain, the Group does not 
expect to materially increase its uncertain tax provisions in the next 12 months. However if an opportunity arose to resolve the matters for less than the 
amounts provided, a settlement may be made with a corresponding reduction in the provision.

(d) Other factors that affect the future tax charge
The Group’s tax charge will continue to be influenced by the profile of profits earned in different countries in which the Group’s subsidiaries operate, in 
particular our material markets, being North America, Brazil and the UK. Tax reform continues in 2023 and is expected in future years driven by the 
Organisation for Economic Co-operation and Development’s (OECD) project to address the tax challenges arising from the digitalisation of the economy 
including the proposed global minimum tax legislation. Experian continues to analyse the implications for the Group from these model rules and will 
determine the outcome once the final relevant legislation is available. This may result in significant changes to established tax principles and an increase 
in tax authority disputes. In turn, this could adversely affect Experian’s effective tax rate or could result in higher cash tax liabilities.

The main rate of UK corporation tax for the year ended 31 March 2023 was 19% and increased to 25% from 1 April 2023. This will have a consequential 
effect on the Group’s future tax charge.

18. Discontinued operations
There have been no material divestments of subsidiaries during the year ended 31 March 2023. The profit from discontinued operations in the year 
ended 31 March 2022 of US$16m comprised the release of historical tax provisions relating to the disposal of the Group’s comparison shopping and lead 
generation businesses in FY13, and our email/cross-channel marketing business (CCM) in FY18.

The cash inflow from operating activities of US$nil (2022: US$1m) relates to the disposal of CCM.

As indicated in note 6(a), value-in-use calculations are underpinned by financial forecasts looking forward up to five years, which continue to reflect our 
current assessment of the impact of climate change and associated commitments the Group has made. Management’s key assumptions in setting the 
financial budgets for the initial five-year period were as follows:

 a forecast revenue growth rates were based on past experience, adjusted for the strategic opportunities within each CGU; the forecasts used average 

nominal growth rates of up to 14%, with high-single-digit average nominal growth rates in EMEA and Asia Pacific;

 a Benchmark EBIT was forecast based on historical margins. These were expected to improve modestly throughout the period in the mature CGUs and 

improve annually by a mid-single-digit amount in EMEA and Asia Pacific; and

 a forecast Benchmark operating cash flow conversion rates were based on historical experience and performance expectations with rates of up to 93% 

unless a Benchmark EBIT loss was forecast. In these circumstances, cash outflows were forecast to exceed the Benchmark EBIT loss.

Further details of the principles used in determining the basis of allocation by CGU and annual impairment testing are given in note 6(a).

21. Goodwill continued

(d) Results of annual impairment review as at 31 March 2023
As a result of increased discount rate assumptions used in the value-in-use calculation, driven by increases in underlying risk-free interest rates, 
combined with ongoing challenging market conditions, the carrying value of the EMEA CGU has been reduced to its recoverable amount through 
recognition of an impairment charge of US$179m. This charge is recognised within total operating expenses in the Group income statement. 
Any additional adverse movement in the key assumptions at the balance sheet date would lead to a further impairment of goodwill. The sensitivities 
can be summarised as follows:

 a an absolute increase of 1.0 percentage points in the discount rate would lead to a further impairment of US$80m; or

 a an absolute reduction in the long-term growth rate of 1.0 percentage points would lead to a further impairment of US$60m; or

 a an absolute reduction of 2.0 or 4.0 percentage points in the forecast FY28 profit margin of 22.2% would lead to an additional impairment of US$53m 

or US$106m respectively; or

 a a 10% or 20% reduction in the forecast FY28 profit would lead to an additional impairment of US$58m or US$117m respectively. 

The review for the Asia Pacific CGU indicated that the recoverable amount exceeded the carrying value by US$120m and that any decline in the 
estimated value-in-use in excess of that amount would result in the recognition of an impairment charge. The sensitivities, which result in the 
recoverable amount being equal to the carrying value, can be summarised as follows:

 a an absolute increase of 3.9 percentage points in the discount rate, from 11.2% to 15.1%; or

 a an absolute reduction of 5.4 percentage points in the long-term growth rate, from growth of 5.3% to a decline of 0.1%; or

 a a reduction of 5.4 percentage points in the forecast FY28 profit margin, from 14.4% to 9.0%. A reduction in the annual margin improvement of 

approximately 1.1 percentage points per year over the five-year forecast period would also reduce the recoverable amount to the carrying value; or

 a an absolute reduction of 38% in the forecast FY28 profit.

The recoverable amount of all other CGUs exceeded their carrying value, on the basis of the assumptions set out in the table in note 21(c) and any 
reasonably possible changes thereof.

The impairment review considered the potential impact of climate change by considering the results of the scenario analysis performed consistent 
with the recommendations of the TCFD. There was no impact on the reported amounts of goodwill as a result of this review.

 a North America Healthcare customer relationships have a net book value of US$132m and a remaining amortisation period of five years.

 a North America Tapad, Inc. customer relationships with a net book value of US$133m and a remaining amortisation period of 15 years.

 a Experian DACH customer relationships with a net book value of US$84m and a remaining amortisation period of ten years.

In addition to the development capitalised above we charged US$387m (2022: US$281m) of research and development costs in the Group income 
statement.

A loss of US$7m (2022: US$nil) on the disposal of internally generated software assets is reported within non-benchmark items in the Group income 
statement, as it relates to assets developed for markets in which we no longer operate as a result of restructuring activity (note 15(d)). The impairment 
charge in the year includes US$5m in relation to restructuring activity, and US$3m arising from the write-down of the fair value of acquired intangibles.

There were no indicators of material impairment as a result of climate-related matters in the current or prior year.

There were no indicators of material impairment as a result of climate-related matters in the current or prior year. The disposal of right-of-use assets for 
both years presented is largely as a result of the early termination and restructuring of leases.

In the prior year we reclassified a UK associate as held-for-sale, and wrote down the carrying amount by US$25m. It is not now anticipated that the sale 
will be completed within 12 months and accordingly the investment has been recorded as an associate at 31 March 2023; an additional write-down of 
the carrying amount of US$18m was recorded upon its reclassification as an associate.

On 4 February 2022, Vector CM Holdings (Cayman) L.P., an associate undertaking, completed a merger with the CM Group involving its Cheetah Digital 
business. As a result of the merger, the Group no longer has significant influence over Vector and accordingly our interest in this company was 
recognised as a trade investment from that date. In the year ended 31 March 2022, we recorded a fair value gain on the associate disposal of US$95m 
and the promissory note and associated interest due to Experian of US$110m were also repaid.

In the year ended 31 March 2022, we recognised a disposal of our Russian associate United Credit Bureau, and wrote off our investment, recording a loss 
of US$17m.

The impairment charge and the gain or loss on disposal are reported within non-benchmark items in the Group income statement.

These facilities are at variable interest rates and are in place for general corporate purposes, including the financing of acquisitions and the refinancing 
of other borrowings.

(e) Covenants and leverage ratio
There is one financial covenant in connection with the borrowing facilities. Benchmark EBIT must exceed three times net interest expense before 
financing fair value remeasurements. The calculation of the financial covenant excludes the effects of IFRS 16. The Group monitors this, and the Net debt 
to Benchmark EBITDA leverage ratio, and has complied with this covenant throughout the year.

30. Leases
The Group’s lease portfolio consists of 43 (2022: 42) significant property leases across the countries in which we operate. In addition, we lease approximately 
72 (2022: 104) smaller properties, 759 (2022: 757) motor vehicles, and a small number of hardware assets. The average remaining lease term is 3.6 years 
(2022: 4.1 years) for significant property leases, 1.3 years (2022: 1.5 years) for other minor property leases and 1.9 years (2022: 1.9 years) for motor vehicles 
and plant and equipment. Extension and termination options are included within a number of property and equipment leases across the Group. These are 
used to maximise operational flexibility in terms of managing assets and lease exposures. The majority of extension and termination options are exercisable 
only by the Group and not by the respective lessor.

Sublease receivables at 31 March 2023 were US$9m (2022: US$11m), of which US$7m (2022: US$9m) falls due after more than one year.

Lease payments are discounted using the interest rate implicit in the lease. If that rate cannot be readily determined, which is generally the case for leases in the 
Group, the incremental borrowing rate is used. The incremental borrowing rate is unique to each country and class of assets therein and is based on the Group’s 
cost of debt, adjusted for factors specific to individual lessees and their borrowing capacity.

The Group is exposed to potential future increases in variable lease payments based on an index or a rate, which are not included in the lease obligation until they 
take effect.

1  Derivatives used for hedging are in documented hedge accounting relationships.

2  Derivative financial liabilities are valued at fair value through profit or loss (FVPL).

Amounts recognised in the Group income statement in connection with the Group’s hedging instruments are disclosed in note 16. There is no material 
difference between the fair values and the book values stated above.

Financial assets held at amortised cost principally comprise amounts due following the disposal of businesses and include accrued interest. Other 
financial assets at fair value through profit or loss comprise convertible loan notes purchased when acquiring interests in associates or minority 
investments.

There are no amounts offset within the assets and liabilities reported in the Group balance sheet.

(c) Hedge accounting
(i) Fair value and cash flow hedges
We use interest rate swaps to hedge the interest rate risk arising on fixed rate borrowings, and cross-currency swaps to hedge the currency and interest 
rate risk arising on foreign currency fixed rate borrowings. Our risk management strategy for interest rate risk and currency risk is outlined in note 8. 

We determine the existence of an economic relationship between the hedging instruments and hedged items by comparing the currency, reference 
interest rates, duration, repricing and maturity dates and the notional amounts of the hedging instruments to those of the hedged items.

We have established a hedge ratio of 1:1 for the hedging relationships, as the underlying risk of interest rate swaps and cross-currency swaps is 
identical to the hedged risk components.

The main sources of ineffectiveness in the hedge accounting relationships are:

 a The application of different interest rate curves to discount the cash flows of the hedged item and those of the hedging instrument.

 a Differences in timing of cash flows of the hedged item and hedging instrument.

 a The different impact of the counterparty’s credit risk on the fair value movements of the hedging instrument compared to the hedged item.

The analysis by level is a requirement of IFRS 13 and the definitions are summarised here for completeness:

 a assets and liabilities whose valuations are based on unadjusted quoted prices in active markets for identical assets and liabilities are classified as 

Level 1;

 a assets and liabilities which are not traded in an active market, and whose valuations are derived from available market data that is observable for the 

asset or liability, are classified as Level 2; and 

 a assets and liabilities whose valuations are derived from inputs not based on observable market data are classified as Level 3.

Level 3 items principally comprise minority shareholdings in unlisted businesses, trade investments, contingent consideration and put options 
associated with corporate transactions.

Unlisted equity investments, initially measured at cost, are revalued where sufficient indicators are identified that a change in the fair value has occurred. 
The inputs to any subsequent valuations are based on a combination of observable evidence from external transactions in the investee’s equity and 
estimated discounted cash flows that will arise from the investment. Valuations of material contingent consideration, and put options associated with 
corporate transactions, are based on Monte Carlo simulations using the most recent management expectations of relevant business performance, 
reflecting the different contractual arrangements in place.

There would be no material effect on the amounts stated from any reasonably possible change in such inputs at 31 March 2023. There were no transfers 
between levels during the year. In the year ended 31 March 2022 a Level 3 investment was reclassified to Level 1. Further details are provided in note 
31(h).

1  Additions to put options in the year ended 31 March 2023 comprised US$11m in respect of the acquisition of APC Buró, and in the year ended 31 March 2022 included US$13m in respect of the acquisition of 

Servicios de Información Avanzada Comercial Y Financiera S.A. (Sinacofi Buró).

2  Additions to contingent consideration comprised US$35m (2022: US$46m) in respect of acquisitions. Contingent consideration in relation to the acquisition of Tax Credit Co, LLC (TCC) in FY22 increased by US$49m 

following fair value adjustments recognised in the year, which are determined by revenue and profit performance up to and including FY25. This was offset by a reduction in the fair value of contingent consideration 
on other acquisitions of US$4m. There are limits in place for contingent consideration payments, including up to US$80m in respect of TCC. Contingent liabilities are revalued at each reporting date based on current 
projections of their associated targets, with any fair value remeasurements recognised as a non-benchmark item in the Group income statement (note 15(a)).

3  Our investment in Grab Holdings Limited was reclassified as a Level 1 investment following Nasdaq listing in the year ended 31 March 2022.

4  During the year ended 31 March 2023, we disposed of a trade investment valued at US$6m, US$3m of the consideration is deferred.

5  The cash payment on exercise of put options in the year ended 31 March 2023, relates to the purchase of the remaining 40% stake in the Arvato Financial Solutions Risk Management Division.

6  Movements in the present value of expected future payments for put options are unrealised and are recognised in financing fair value remeasurements in the Group income statement.

32. Fair value methodology
Information in respect of the carrying amounts and the fair value of borrowings is included in note 28(a). There are no material differences between the 
carrying value of the Group’s other financial assets and liabilities not measured at fair value and their estimated fair values. The following assumptions 
and methods are used to estimate the fair values:

 a the fair values of receivables, payables and cash and cash equivalents are considered to approximate to the carrying amounts;

 a the fair values of short-term borrowings, other than bonds, are considered to approximate to the carrying amounts due to the short maturity terms of 

such instruments;

 a the fair value of that portion of bonds carried at amortised cost is based on quoted market prices, employing a valuation methodology falling within 

Level 1 of the IFRS 13 fair value hierarchy;

 a the fair value of listed investments is based on quoted market prices, employing a valuation methodology falling within Level 1 of the IFRS 13 fair 

value hierarchy;

 a the fair values of long-term variable rate bank loans and lease obligations are considered to approximate to the carrying amount; and

 a the fair values of other financial assets and liabilities are calculated based on a discounted cash flow analysis, using a valuation methodology falling 
within Level 2 of the IFRS 13 fair value hierarchy, apart from the fair values of trade investments and contingent consideration which use a valuation 
methodology falling within Level 3 of the IFRS 13 fair value hierarchy.

The Group considers the impact of climate-related matters, including legislation, on the fair value measurement of assets and liabilities. At present, the 
impact of climate-related matters is not material to the Group’s financial statements.

The Group has a number of equity-settled, share-based employee incentive plans. Further information on share award arrangements is given in note 
34(b). As the numbers of share options granted or outstanding and the related charge to the Group income statement are not significant, no further 
disclosures are included in these financial statements.

(b) Share awards
(i) Summary of arrangements and performance conditions
There are three plans under which share awards are currently granted – the two Experian Co-investment Plans (the CIP) and the Experian Performance 
Share Plan (the PSP). Awards typically take the form of a grant of free shares which vest over a service period of three years, with a maximum term 
generally of the same length, and are settled by share distribution. The assumption at grant date for employee departures prior to vesting is 20% for 
certain unconditional awards, which are only made under the PSP. Other details in respect of conditional awards are given below. 

During the year ended 31 March 2021, a one-off award was made under the PSP to employees who are not eligible to participate in existing share award 
schemes. These awards had no service or performance conditions attached and vested immediately. Participants who hold the shares received for three 
years will be entitled to receive two matching shares for each share they originally received. The grant date assumption is that 30% of these matching 
awards will not vest.

CIP
For the purposes of IFRS 2, the grant date for these plans is the start of the financial year in which performance is assessed. This is before the number 
of shares to be awarded is determined but the underlying value of the award is known, subject to the outcome of the performance condition. The value 
of awarded shares reflects the performance outcome assumed at the date of their issue to participants and is recognised over a four-year period. 

The range of performance conditions for awards under these plans is set out below. The Profit performance condition requires adjusted Benchmark 
EPS growth at the stated percentages over a three-year period. The cumulative Benchmark operating cash flow performance condition (the Cash flow 
condition) is based on cumulative Benchmark operating cash flow over a three-year period. The period of assessment commences at the beginning 
of the financial year of grant. These are not market-based performance conditions as defined by IFRS 2.

PSP
The range of Profit performance conditions for conditional awards under this plan is the same as those for the CIP described above. The Return on 
Capital Employed condition (ROCE condition) requires average ROCE over the period at the percentages stated below. Both these conditions are not 
market-based performance conditions as defined by IFRS 2 and are also measured over a three-year period commencing at the beginning of the 
financial year of grant.

The TSR performance condition is considered a market-based performance condition as defined by IFRS 2. In valuing the awarded shares, TSR is 
evaluated using a Monte Carlo simulation, with historical volatilities and correlations for comparator companies measured over the three-year period 
preceding valuation and an implied volatility for Experian plc ordinary shares.

(ii) Information on share grant valuations
Share grants are valued by reference to the market price on the day of award, with no modification for dividend distributions or other factors, as 
participants are entitled to dividend distributions on awarded shares. Market-based performance conditions are included in the fair value measurement 
on the grant date and are not revised for actual performance. Awards granted in the year ended 31 March 2023 had a weighted average fair value per 
share of £24.65 (2022: £27.25).

35. Post-employment beneﬁt plans and related risks
An overview of the Group’s post-employment benefit plans and the related risks is given below. The additional information required by IAS 19, which 
relates only to the Group’s defined benefit pension plans and post-employment medical benefits obligations, is set out in note 36.

(a) Funded pension plans
The Group’s principal defined benefit plan is the Experian Pension Scheme in the UK. The plan was closed to new entrants in 2009 and to the future 
accrual of new benefits from 1 April 2022. Active member benefits were crystallised as deferred pensions from that date. No material impact on the 
Group’s net post-employment benefit assets resulted from this change. All UK employees were offered membership of the Group’s UK defined 
contribution plan from April 2022.

The Experian Pension Scheme has rules which specify the benefits to be paid, with the level of pension benefit payable on retirement dependent on age, 
length of service and salary. As at 31 March 2023, there were no (2022: 86) active members of this plan, 1,224 (2022: 1,239) deferred members and 
2,424 (2022: 2,462) pensioner members. 

A full actuarial funding valuation of the Experian Pension Scheme is carried out every three years, with interim reviews in the intervening years. 
The latest full valuation was carried out as at 31 March 2022 by independent qualified actuaries Mercer Limited, using the projected unit credit method. 
The 2022 actuarial valuation has been agreed and there was a moderate funding surplus. The next full valuation will be carried out as at 31 March 2025.

The Experian Pension Scheme is governed by a trust deed, which ensures that its finances and governance are independent from those of the Group. 
Trustees are responsible for overseeing the investments and funding of the plans and plan administration. The UK pensions environment is regulated by 
The Pensions Regulator whose statutory objectives and regulatory powers are described on its website at www.thepensionsregulator.gov.uk.

The defined contribution plan for UK employees was formerly the Experian Retirement Savings Plan, however during the year ended 31 March 2022 the 
assets of this plan were transferred to a new plan, the Experian Pensions Savings Plan, which is part of a mastertrust managed by Legal and General 
Group plc. Under the new plan, as before, employee and employer contributions are paid by the Group into an independently administered fund, which is 
used to fund member pensions at retirement. As at 31 March 2023, there were 3,484 active members of this plan (2022: 3,195).

Employees in the USA, Brazil and South Africa have the option to join local defined contribution plans and, as at 31 March 2023, there were 5,480 (2022: 
4,666) active members in the USA, 1,273 (2022: 1,151) in Brazil and 426 (2022: 513) in South Africa. There are no other material funded pension 
arrangements.

(b) Unfunded pension arrangements
The Group’s unfunded pension arrangements are designed to ensure that certain senior managers who are affected by the earnings cap, which was 
introduced by the UK government some years ago to set a ceiling on the amount of benefits that could be paid by defined benefit pension plans, are 
placed in broadly the same position as those who are not. There are also unfunded arrangements for certain former directors and employees of 
Experian Finance plc and Experian Limited. Certain of these unfunded arrangements in the UK have been secured by the grant to an independent trustee 
of charges over an independently managed portfolio of marketable securities owned by the Group and reported as financial assets revalued through OCI 
(note 31(a)). Benefit accrual under the unfunded arrangements ceased from 1 April 2022.

(c) Post-employment medical benefits
The Group operates a plan which provides post-employment medical benefits to certain retired employees and their dependant relatives. This plan 
relates to former employees in the UK and, under it, the Group has undertaken to meet the cost of post-employment medical benefits for all eligible 
former employees who retired prior to 1 April 1994, and their dependants.

(d) Related risks
Through its defined benefit pension plans and post-employment medical benefits plan, the Group is exposed to a number of risks that are inherent in 
such plans and arrangements, which can be summarised as follows: 

 a asset value volatility, with the associated impact on the assets held in connection with the funding of pension obligations and the related cash flows;

 a changes in bond yields, with any reduction resulting in an increase in the present value of pension obligations, mitigated by an increase in the value of 

plan assets;

 a inflation, as pension obligations are generally linked to inflation and the prevailing rate of inflation experienced for medical benefits is typically higher 

than other inflation measures in the UK; and

 a life expectancy, as pension and medical benefits are generally provided for the life of beneficiaries and their dependants.

There are no unusual, entity-specific or plan-specific risks, and no significant concentrations of risk.

(c) Actuarial assumptions and sensitivities
The accounting valuations at 31 March 2023 have been based on the most recent actuarial valuations, updated to take account of the requirements of 
IAS 19. The assumptions for the real discount rate, pension increases and mortality, used to calculate the present value of the defined benefit obligations, 
all have a significant effect on the accounting valuation.

The mortality and early retirement assumptions have been updated to reflect the latest analysis that has been undertaken as part of the full actuarial 
funding valuation at 31 March 2022. 

The assumed margin between RPI and CPI has been reduced to 45 basis points (50 basis points in the year ended 31 March 2022), consistent with a 100 
basis point margin assumed to 2030, with a ten basis point margin assumed thereafter. The single equivalent differential is expected to reduce over time 
towards 2030. This results in an increase in retirement benefit obligations at 31 March 2023 of approximately US$2m or 0.25%.

The other methods and assumptions used are consistent with those used in the prior year. Changes to these assumptions in the light of prevailing 
conditions may have a significant impact on future valuations. Indications of the sensitivity of the amounts reported at 31 March 2023 to changes in the 
real discount rate, pension increases, life expectancy and medical costs are included below.

The absolute sensitivity numbers are stated on a basis consistent with the methodology used in determining the accounting valuation as at 31 March 
2023. The methodology evaluates the effect of a change in each assumption on the relevant obligations, while holding all other assumptions constant.

(i) Financial actuarial assumptions

Discount rate
Inflation rate – based on the UK Retail Prices Index (the RPI)
Inflation rate – based on the UK Consumer Prices Index (the CPI)
Increase for pensions in payment – element based on the RPI (where cap is 5%)
Increase for pensions in payment – element based on the CPI (where cap is 2.5%)
Increase for pensions in payment – element based on the CPI (where cap is 3%)
Increase for pensions in deferment
Inflation in medical costs

The principal financial assumption is the real discount rate, which is the excess of the discount rate over the rate of inflation. The discount rate is based 
on the market yields on high-quality corporate bonds of a currency and term appropriate to the defined benefit obligations. The criteria used to set the 
discount rate are unchanged from the year ended 31 March 2022. The increase in the discount rate at the balance sheet date reflects the significant 
increase in UK bond yields during the year. The Experian Pension Scheme obligations are in pounds sterling and have a maturity on average of 13 years. 

If the real discount rate increased/decreased by 0.25%, the defined benefit obligations at 31 March 2023 would decrease/increase by approximately 
US$22m and the fair value of plan assets would decrease/increase by approximately US$27m.

Notes to the Group financial statements continuedExperian plc Financial statements215

36. Post-employment beneﬁts – IAS 19 information continued
(i) Financial actuarial assumptions continued
The discount rate sensitivity has been updated to 0.25% from 0.1% to reflect an increase in both the range of reasonably possible rates and the 
estimation uncertainty for discount rates, given the increase in UK discount rates and their volatility observed during the year.

The rates of increase for pensions in payment reflect the separate arrangements applying to different groups of Experian’s pensioners. If the inflation 
rate underlying the pension increases (both in payment and in deferment) increased/decreased by 0.1%, the defined benefit obligations at 31 March 
2023 would increase/decrease by approximately US$5m.

(ii) Mortality assumptions – average life expectancy on retirement at age 65 in normal health

The accounting valuation assumes that mortality will be in line with standard tables adjusted to reflect the expected experience of the Experian Pension 
Scheme membership, based on analysis carried out for the 2022 actuarial valuation. A specific allowance for anticipated future improvements in life 
expectancy is also incorporated. The perpetuation of excess deaths during 2022 is expected to be reflected in the standard UK model for projected 
improvements in life expectancy, due to be published later this calendar year. The Group has therefore applied a 4% scaling factor to its mortality 
assumptions to allow for this impact on member mortality. This reduced retirement benefit obligations at 31 March 2023 by approximately US$8m. 

The Group has also considered the potential impact of climate change and, at the present time, we do not believe that there is sufficient evidence to 
require a change in the long-term mortality assumptions. We will continue to monitor any potential future impact on the mortality assumptions used. 

An increase in assumed life expectancy of 0.1 years would increase the defined benefit obligations at 31 March 2023 by approximately US$2m.

(iii) Post-employment medical benefits
The accounting valuation in respect of post-employment medical benefits assumes a rate of increase for medical costs. If this rate increased/decreased 
by 1.0% per annum, the obligations at 31 March 2023 and the finance expense would remain unchanged.

The funded defined benefit pension plans hold a range of assets including equities, index-linked gilts, global corporate bonds, secured credit, senior 
private debt and a Liability Driven Investment strategy which is used to hedge against interest fluctuations and inflation. Collateral levels within the 
Liability Driven Investment strategy were closely monitored during the market disruptions of Autumn 2022 and remained robust throughout.

The primary drivers of the reductions in the fair value of the plans’ funded assets and obligations are an increase in pound sterling interest rates and the 
retranslation of assets and obligations into US dollars.

The Experian Pension Scheme investment strategy aims to reduce investment risk and funding volatility. With the exception of the allocation to senior 
private debt, all other assets are regarded as being marketable and regularly traded. Over time, the Scheme is expected to increase its allocation to 
liability matching assets, to provide cash flows to match expected benefit payments.

Other assets listed above mainly relate to cash in transit between investment managers and cash held for benefit payments, together with a small 
with-profits investment.

The Trustee believes that Environmental, Social and Governance (ESG) factors may have a material impact on investment risk and return outcomes. 
ESG factors, including climate change and stewardship, are increasingly integrated within investment processes both in appointing new investment 
managers and in monitoring existing investment managers. Monitoring is undertaken and documented on a regular basis, making use of the investment 
consultant’s ESG rating framework.

The Group’s defined benefit plans have no holdings of ordinary shares or debt of the Company.

(e) Future payments
Payments of US$3m are currently expected to be made during the year ending 31 March 2024 in respect of unfunded post-employment benefits.

1  Deferred tax assets and liabilities have been re-analysed during the year to better reflect the net position, and provide further detail. Amounts previously recorded as ‘other’ are now analysed within retirement 

benefit assets/(obligations), accounting provisions and accruals and deferred interest. In addition, amounts previously recorded as ‘intangibles’ are now analysed between goodwill and other intangible assets. The 
comparative figures for the year ended 31 March 2022 have been re-presented to reflect this change.

Notes to the Group financial statements continuedExperian plc Financial statements217

37. Deferred and current tax continued
(iii) Other information on deferred tax assets and liabilities
Judgment is required when assessing the recognition of deferred tax assets. The Group has not recognised deferred tax on losses of US$543m 
(2022: US$641m) that could be utilised against future taxable income or on US$224m (2022: US$265m) of capital losses that could be utilised against 
future taxable gains. While these losses are available indefinitely, they have arisen in undertakings in which it is not currently anticipated that future 
benefit will be available from their use. The capital losses arising on investments are available for use within five years, and future taxable gains against 
which the capital losses could be utilised are not currently anticipated.

There are retained earnings of US$9,224m (2022: US$9,699m) in subsidiary undertakings which could be subject to tax if remitted to Experian plc. 
No deferred tax liability has been recognised on these earnings because the Group is in a position to control the timing of the reversal of the temporary 
difference and it is probable that such differences will not reverse in the foreseeable future. Given the mix of countries and tax rates, it is not practicable 
to determine the impact of such remittance.

During the current year the main rate of UK corporation tax was 19% (2022: 19%), and rose to 25% from 1 April 2023. Deferred tax is recognised at the 
rate prevailing when temporary differences are expected to reverse.

A charge for legal costs of US$26m has been recognised in respect of a number of historical legal claims in North America, offset by insurance 
recoveries of US$29m.

In September 2015, Experian North America suffered an unauthorised intrusion to its Decision Analytics computing environment that allowed 
unauthorised acquisition of certain data belonging to a client, T-Mobile USA, Inc. We notified the individuals who may have been affected and offered free 
credit monitoring and identity theft resolution services. In addition, government agencies were notified as required by law. The one remaining claim in 
respect of the incident was settled during the year for US$14m. 

A charge of US$15m was incurred in the year in connection with restructuring, primarily in the EMEA and Asia Pacific regions (note 15(d)).

Other liabilities principally comprise liabilities of Serasa S.A., in connection with local legal and tax issues, which were primarily recognised on its 
acquisition in 2007.

39. Called-up share capital and share premium account
At 31 March 2023, there were 971.4m shares in issue (2022: 970.6m). During the year ended 31 March 2023, 0.8m (2022: 1.0m) shares were issued and 
none (2022: none) were cancelled. Further information on share capital is contained in note Q to the Company financial statements.

The difference between the amounts shown in the Group and Company financial statements in respect of called-up share capital and the share premium 
account arose due to translation of pound sterling amounts into the US dollar at various exchange rates on various translation dates.

(ii) Nature of reserves
The merger reserve arose on the demerger from GUS plc in 2006 and is the difference between the share capital and share premium of GUS plc and the 
nominal value of the share capital of the Company before a share offer at that date.

Movements on the hedging reserve and the position at the balance sheet date reflect hedging transactions, originating from the management of foreign 
exchange risk, which are not charged or credited to the Group income statement, net of related tax. 

Movements on the translation reserve and the position at the balance sheet date reflect foreign currency translations since 1 April 2004 which are not 
charged or credited to the Group income statement, net of related tax. The movement in the year ended 31 March 2023 comprises currency translation 
losses of US$197m (2022: gains of US$35m) recognised directly in Other comprehensive income.

The balance on the own shares reserve is the cost of ordinary shares in the Company and further details are given in note 40(b)(iii). The difference 
between the amounts shown in the Group and Company financial statements in respect of this reserve arose due to translation of pound sterling 
amounts into US dollars at different exchange rates on different translation dates.

42. Acquisitions

(a) Acquisitions in the year
The Group made six acquisitions during the year ended 31 March 2023, including the acquisition on 4 April 2022 of the entire share capital of CIC Plus, 
LLC and its affiliate Tayvah, LLC (together CIC Plus), a leading provider of employer compliance management solutions, for a cash consideration of 
US$188m. Goodwill of US$108m was recognised based on the fair value of the net assets acquired of US$80m. This investment supplements our 
employer services offering in the USA.

We also purchased the remaining 40% interest in the Arvato Financial Solutions Risk Management Division, acquired in FY21, for US$133m (note 41(d)).

These fair values are determined by using established estimation techniques including discounted cash flow and option valuation models, such as the 
multi-period excess earnings method for customer and other relationships and the relief-from-royalty method for software development. The most 
significant assumption is related to the proportion of earnings attributable to customer and other relationships and software development. For 
significant acquisitions, we engage with third-party valuation experts to assist with this process.

Fair values on the acquisition of CIC Plus have been finalised, other amounts are provisional and will be finalised no later than one year after the date of 
acquisition. Provisional amounts; predominantly for intangible assets, have been included at 31 March 2023, as a consequence of the timing and 
complexity of the acquisitions.

Goodwill represents the synergies, assembled workforces and future growth potential of the acquired businesses. The goodwill in relation to CIC Plus 
and one other acquisition is currently deductible for tax purposes, and consequently no deferred tax liability has been recognised for these acquisitions.

There have been no other material gains, losses, corrections or other adjustments recognised in the year ended 31 March 2023 that relate to acquisitions 
in the current or earlier years.

(b) Additional information
(i) Current year acquisitions

Increase/(decrease) in book value of net assets from provisional fair value adjustments:
Intangible assets
Trade and other payables
Deferred tax liabilities
Increase in book value of net assets from provisional fair value adjustments

Gross contractual amounts receivable in respect of trade and other receivables
Pro-forma revenue from 1 April 2022 to date of acquisition
Revenue from date of acquisition to 31 March 2023
Profit before tax from date of acquisition to 31 March 2023

At the dates of acquisition, the gross contractual amounts receivable in respect of trade and other receivables of US$13m were expected to be collected 
in full.

If the transactions had occurred on the first day of the financial year, the estimated additional contribution to profit before tax would have been US$1m.

(ii) Prior years’ acquisitions
US$39m of contingent consideration was settled in the year in respect of acquisitions made in FY22. These cash flows principally relate to the 
acquisitions of Tax Credit Co, LLC (TCC) and Gabi Personal Insurance Agency, Inc. (Gabi). In addition, deferred consideration of US$4m was settled in 
the year in respect of the FY22 acquisition of Employment Tax Servicing, LLC. In the year ended 31 March 2022, US$43m was settled in respect of 
acquisitions made in earlier years, principally in relation to the FY21 and FY20 acquisitions of Axesor businesses and Look Who’s Charging Pty Ltd.

The Group made six acquisitions in the year ended 31 March 2022, which included Gabi and TCC, both in the USA. A cash outflow of US$689m was 
reported in the Group cash flow statement for that year, after deduction of US$17m in respect of net cash acquired.

(iii) Post balance sheet acquisitions
On 20 April 2023, we agreed to acquire Flexpag Tecnologia e Instituição de Pagamento S.A. (Flexpag) for R$250m (c.US$49m), and contingent 
consideration based on Flexpag’s profits in calendar year 2025, the fair value of which is yet to be determined. Completion is expected in the year ending 
31 March 2024. Flexpag is a Brazilian FinTech specialising in digital payment solutions, connecting payment systems to utilities to offer consumers a 
broad range of payment methods.

The fair values of goodwill, software development, customer relationships and other assets and liabilities in respect of these acquisitions will be reported 
in the 2024 Experian Annual Report & Accounts, following completion of the initial accounting.

43. Assets and liabilities classiﬁed as held-for-sale
During the year we classified two small subsidiaries in the EMEA region, and one subsidiary in the Asia Pacific region as held-for-sale. In the year ended 
31 March 2022 the Group recorded a UK associate as held-for-sale. It is not now anticipated that the UK transaction will complete within 12 months and 
accordingly the investment has been reclassified as an associate at 31 March 2023. 

The Group continues to market part of its UK property portfolio and it is anticipated that this transaction will be completed in the year ending 31 March 
2024. Any gain or loss on disposal will be recognised in that year.

Assets classified as held-for-sale:
Investment in associate (note 24)
Property, plant and equipment
Trade and other receivables

US$56m not then expected to be incurred before 31 March 2023.

46. Contingencies

(a) Latin America tax
As previously indicated, Serasa S.A. has been advised that the Brazilian tax authorities are challenging the deduction for tax purposes of goodwill 
amortisation arising from its acquisition by Experian in 2007. The Brazilian courts have ultimately upheld Experian’s position in respect of the tax years 
from 2007 to 2012 with no further right of appeal. The Brazilian tax authorities have raised similar assessments in respect of the 2013 to 2018 tax years, 
in which approximately US$198m was claimed by Experian, and may raise similar claims in respect of other years. The possibility of this resulting in a 
liability to the Group is considered to be remote, based on the advice of external legal counsel, success in cases to date and other factors in respect of the 
claim.

A similar challenge has been raised in Colombia in respect of the 2014 and 2016 tax years, in which approximately US$4m was claimed, and similar 
claims in respect of other years may be raised. We are contesting these on the basis of external legal advice.

(b) UK marketing services regulation
We successfully appealed to the First Tier Tribunal a final enforcement notice from the UK Information Commissioner’s Office (ICO) with respect to a 
2018 audit of several companies on the use of data for marketing purposes under the EU General Data Protection Regulation (GDPR), which relates to 
our marketing services activities in the UK. The ICO has subsequently applied for permission to appeal to the Upper Tier Tribunal, during which time all 
requirements will be stayed. At this stage we do not know what the final outcome will be, but if the First Tier Tribunal judgment is overturned, it may 
require significant changes to business processes in our UK marketing services business. This business represents approximately 1% of our global 
revenues and we do not expect this to result in a materially adverse financial outcome for the Group.

(c) Other litigation and claims
There continue to be an increasing number of pending and threatened claims and regulatory actions involving the Group across all its major geographies 
which are in various stages of investigation or enforcement, and which are being vigorously defended, including from the CFPB and FTC in the USA. The 
directors do not believe that the outcome of any individual enforcement notice will have a materially adverse effect on the Group’s financial position. 
However, as is inherent in legal, regulatory and administrative proceedings, there is a risk of outcomes that may be unfavourable to the Group. In the 
case of unfavourable outcomes, the Group may benefit from applicable insurance recoveries.

47. Related party transactions

(a) Related undertakings
A full list of the Company’s related undertakings, including subsidiary and associate undertakings, is given in note T to the Company financial statements. 
There are no significant non-controlling interests.

(b) Transactions with associates
Following the divestment of CCM in the year ended 31 March 2018, the Group owns 23.0% of the issued share capital of Vector CM Holdings (Cayman), 
L.P. (Vector). Vector completed a merger with the CM Group involving its Cheetah Digital business on 4 February 2022. The Group no longer has 
significant influence over Vector and accordingly our interest in this company was recognised as a trade investment from that date. In the year ended 
31 March 2022, a promissory note and associated interest due to Experian of US$110m were repaid in full as a result of the merger. Interest income of 
US$8m was recognised on the promissory note in that year.

Transactions with associates are made on normal market terms and in the year ended 31 March 2023 comprised the provision and receipt of services to 
other associates of US$nil (2022: US$10m) and US$7m (2022: US$7m) respectively. At 31 March 2023 and 31 March 2022, no amounts were owed from 
or to associates.

(c) Transactions with other related undertakings
The Group transacts with a number of related undertakings in connection with the operation of its share incentive plans, pension arrangements in the 
UK, the USA, Brazil, South Africa, Germany and Ireland, and the provision of medical cover in the UK. These undertakings are listed in note T(v) to the 
Company financial statements. Transactional relationships can be summarised as follows:

 a The assets, liabilities and expenses of the Experian UK Approved All-Employee Share Plan and The Experian plc Employee Share Trust are included in 

these financial statements.

 a During the year ended 31 March 2023, US$33m (2022: US$56m) was paid by the Group to related undertakings, in connection with the provision of 

post-employment pensions benefits. US$3m (2022: US$3m) was paid to Experian Medical Plan Limited, in connection with the provision of healthcare 
benefits.

 a There were no other material transactions or balances with these related undertakings during the current or prior year.

Experian plc Financial statementsNotes to the Company financial statements
for the year ended 31 March 2023

A. Corporate information
Corporate information for Experian plc (the Company) is set out in note 1 
to the Group financial statements, with further information given in the 
Strategic report and the Corporate governance report.

B. Basis of preparation
The separate financial statements of the Company are:

 a prepared on the going concern basis, under the historical cost 
convention, and in accordance with UK accounting standards;

 a presented in US dollars, the Company’s functional currency; and

 a designed to include disclosures in line with those required by those 

parts of the UK Companies Act 2006 applicable to companies reporting 
under UK accounting standards even though the Company is 
incorporated and registered in Jersey.

The directors opted to prepare the financial statements for the year ended 
31 March 2023 in accordance with FRS 101 ‘Reduced Disclosure 
Framework’. The Company intends to continue to use this accounting 
framework until further notice.

Going concern
The directors continue to adopt the going concern basis of accounting 
in preparing the financial statements. Details of the going concern 
assessment for the Group and the Company are provided in note 2 to the 
Group financial statements.

C. FRS 101 exemptions
FRS 101 allows certain exemptions from the requirements of IFRS to 
avoid the duplication of information provided in the Group financial 
statements and to provide more concise financial reporting in entity 
financial statements. The following exemptions have therefore been 
applied in the preparation of these financial statements:

 a Paragraphs 45(b) and 46 to 52 of IFRS 2 ‘Share-based Payment’, 

exempting the Company from providing details of share options and 
of how the fair value of services received was determined.

 a IFRS 7 ‘Financial Instruments: Disclosures’.

 a Paragraphs 91 to 99 of IFRS 13 ‘Fair Value Measurement’, exempting 

the Company from disclosing valuation techniques and inputs used for 
the measurement of assets and liabilities.

 a Paragraph 38 of IAS 1 ‘Presentation of Financial Statements’, 

exempting the Company from disclosing comparative information 
required by:

 – paragraph 79(a)(iv) of IAS 1 – shares outstanding at the beginning 

and at the end of the period; and

 – paragraph 73(e) of IAS 16 ‘Property, Plant and Equipment’ – 

reconciliations between the carrying amount at the beginning 
and end of the period.

229

 a The following paragraphs of IAS 1:

 – paragraphs 10(d) and 111, exempting the Company from providing 

a cash flow statement and information;

 – paragraph 16, exempting the Company from providing a statement 

of compliance with all IFRS;

 – paragraph 38A, exempting the Company from the requirement for 
a minimum of two of each primary statement and the related notes;

 – paragraphs 38B to D, exempting the Company from the requirement 

to provide additional comparative information; and

 – paragraphs 134 to 136, exempting the Company from presenting 

capital management disclosures.

 a IAS 7 ‘Statement of Cash Flows’.

 a Paragraphs 30 and 31 of IAS 8 ‘Accounting Policies, Changes in 
Accounting Estimates and Errors’, exempting the Company from 
disclosing information where it has not applied a new IFRS which has 
been issued but is not yet effective.

 a Paragraph 17 of IAS 24 ‘Related Party Disclosures’, exempting the 

Company from disclosing details of key management compensation. 

 a The requirements in IAS 24 to disclose related party transactions with 

wholly-owned members of the Group.

The use of critical accounting estimates and management judgment is 
required in applying the accounting policies. Areas involving a higher 
degree of judgment or complexity, or where assumptions and estimates 
are significant to the Company financial statements, are highlighted in 
note E.

D. Signiﬁcant accounting policies
The significant accounting policies applied are summarised below. They 
have been consistently applied to both years presented. The explanations 
of these policies focus on areas where judgment is applied or which are 
particularly important in the financial statements. 

There are no new standards, amendments to existing standards or 
interpretations that are effective for the year ended 31 March 2023 that 
have had a material impact on the Company’s financial statements. 
Content from accounting standards, amendments and interpretations is 
excluded where there is simply no policy choice under UK accounting 
standards.

(i) Foreign currency
Transactions in foreign currencies are recorded at the exchange rate 
prevailing at the transaction date. Monetary assets and liabilities 
denominated in foreign currencies are retranslated at the exchange rate 
prevailing at the balance sheet date. All differences are taken to the profit 
and loss account in the year in which they arise.

(ii) Investments – shares in Group undertakings
Investments in Group undertakings are stated at cost less any provisions 
for impairment. The fair value of share incentives issued by the Company 
to employees of Group undertakings is accounted for as a capital 
contribution and recognised as an increase in the Company’s investment 
in Group undertakings, with a corresponding increase in equity.

Experian plc  Annual Report 2023Financial statements230

D. Signiﬁcant accounting policies continued

(iii) Debtors and creditors
Debtors are initially recognised at fair value and subsequently measured 
at this value. Where the time value of money is material, they are then 
carried at amortised cost using the effective interest method. Creditors 
are initially recognised at fair value. Where the time value of money is 
material, they are then carried at amortised cost using the effective 
interest method.

(iv) Cash at bank and in hand
Cash at bank includes deposits held at call with banks and other 
short-term highly liquid investments.

(v) Accounting for derivative financial instruments
The Company uses forward foreign exchange contracts to manage its 
exposures to fluctuations in foreign exchange rates. The interest 
differential reflected in forward foreign exchange contracts is taken to 
interest receivable and similar income or interest payable and similar 
expenses. Forward foreign exchange contracts are recognised at fair 
value, based on forward foreign exchange market rates at the balance 
sheet date. Gains or losses on forward foreign exchange contracts are 
taken to the profit and loss account in the year in which they arise.

(vi) Leases
The Company undertakes an assessment of whether a contract is or 
contains a lease at its inception. The assessment establishes whether the 
Company obtains substantially all the economic benefits from the use of 
an asset and whether it has the right to direct its use.

Low-value lease payments are recognised as an expense, on a 
straight-line basis over the lease term. For other leases the Company 
recognises both a right-of-use asset and a lease liability at the 
commencement date of a lease contract.

The right-of-use asset is initially measured at cost, comprising the initial 
amount of the lease liability adjusted for payments made at or before the 
commencement date, plus initial direct costs and an estimate of the cost 
of any obligation to refurbish the asset or site, less lease incentives.

Subsequently, right-of-use assets are measured at cost less accumulated 
depreciation and impairment losses and are adjusted for any 
remeasurement of the lease liability. Depreciation is calculated on a 
straight-line basis over the shorter of the estimated useful life of the 
right-of-use asset and the period of the lease. 

The lease term comprises the non-cancellable period of a lease, plus 
periods covered by an extension option, if it is reasonably certain to be 
exercised, and periods covered by a termination option if it is reasonably 
certain not to be exercised.

The lease liability is initially measured at the present value of lease 
payments that are outstanding at the commencement date, discounted at 
the interest rate implicit in the lease or if that rate cannot be easily 
determined the Company’s incremental borrowing rate. Lease payments 
comprise payments of fixed principal less any lease incentives.

The lease liability is remeasured when there is a change in future lease 
payments arising from a change in an index or rate, or if the Company 
changes its assessment of whether it will exercise an extension or 
termination option.

When a lease liability is remeasured, a corresponding adjustment is made 
to the carrying amount of the right-of-use asset or is recognised in the 
Company profit and loss account if the asset is fully depreciated.

(vii) Tax
Current tax is calculated on the basis of the tax laws enacted or 
substantively enacted at the balance sheet date in Ireland, where the 
Company is resident.

Deferred tax is provided in respect of temporary differences that have 
originated but not reversed at the balance sheet date and is determined 
using the tax rates that are expected to apply when the temporary 
differences reverse. Deferred tax assets are recognised only to the extent 
that they are expected to be recoverable.

(viii) Own shares
The Group has a number of equity-settled, share-based employee 
incentive plans. In connection with these, shares in the Company are held 
by The Experian plc Employee Share Trust and the Experian UK Approved 
All-Employee Share Plan. The assets, liabilities and expenses of these 
separately administered trusts are included in the financial statements as 
if they were the Company’s own. The trusts’ assets mainly comprise 
Experian shares, which are shown as a deduction from total shareholders’ 
funds at cost.

Experian shares purchased and held as treasury shares, in connection 
with the above plans and any share purchase programme, are also shown 
as a deduction from total shareholders’ funds at cost. The par value of 
shares that are purchased and cancelled, in connection with any share 
purchase programme, is accounted for as a reduction in called-up share 
capital with any cost in excess of that amount being deducted from the 
profit and loss account. The Company is not required to recognise the par 
value of cancelled shares in a capital redemption reserve.

Contractual obligations to purchase own shares are recognised at the net 
present value of expected future payments. Gains and losses in 
connection with such obligations are recognised in the profit and loss 
account. Gains and losses which arise on financial instruments created by 
advance instructions to trade in own shares are recognised directly in 
equity.

(ix) Profit and loss account format
Income and expenses, which are recognised on an accruals basis, are 
reported by nature in the profit and loss account, as this reflects the 
composition of the Company’s income and cost base.

(x) Dividend income
Dividend income is recognised in the Company profit and loss account on 
the date on which the Company’s right to receive payment is established. 
Liquidation dividends are treated as a return of capital to the extent they 
are used to recover the carrying value of the investment in the liquidated 
entity. Any amount received in excess of the investment value is treated as 
income in the Company profit and loss account.

Notes to the Company financial statements continuedExperian plc Financial statements231

E. Critical accounting estimates, assumptions and judgments

(i) Critical accounting estimates and assumptions
In preparing the financial statements, management is required to make estimates and assumptions that affect the reported amount of income, costs 
and charges, assets and liabilities and the disclosure of contingent liabilities. The resulting accounting estimates, which are based on management’s best 
judgment at the date of the financial statements will, by definition, seldom equal the related actual results. 

There are no estimates and assumptions that have a significant risk of causing a material adjustment to the carrying amounts of assets and liabilities 
within the next financial year.

(ii) Critical judgments
In applying the Company’s accounting policies, management may make judgments that have a significant effect on the amounts recognised in the 
Company financial statements. These judgments may include the classification of transactions between the Company profit and loss account and the 
Company balance sheet.

The most significant of these judgments for the Company is in respect of contingencies where, in the case of pending and threatened litigation claims, 
management has formed a judgment as to the likelihood of ultimate liability. No liability has been recognised where the likelihood of any loss arising is 
possible rather than probable. 

F. Other operating income and charges
Other operating income and expenses principally comprise charges to and from other Group undertakings in respect of Group management services 
and guarantees provided during the year. The increase in other operating income and charges in the year ended 31 March 2023 compared to the prior 
year is due to underlying growth of the business and an increase in the overall cost of providing management services. Other operating charges include 
a fee of US$0.1m (2022: US$0.1m) payable to the Company’s auditor and its associates for the audit of the Company financial statements.

During the year ended 31 March 2023 Experian plc undertook a number of transactions as a result of group restructuring, including the subscription for 
additional shares in existing subsidiary undertakings of US$581.5m (2022: US$1,910.0m).

Following a return of capital in the year via a dividend payment by Experian Ireland Investments Limited and the consequent reduction in its net assets, 
the Company performed an impairment review. As Experian Ireland Investments Limited no longer has any underlying activity to generate future cash 
flows an impairment charge of US$79.0m (2022: US$nil) was recognised in respect of the Company’s investment in that entity.

A list of the Company’s subsidiary undertakings is given in note T(i). The Company directly holds interests in the whole of the issued share capital of the 
following undertakings:

Income Access Share arrangements
As its ordinary shares are listed on the London Stock Exchange, the 
Company has a large number of UK resident shareholders. In order that 
shareholders may receive Experian dividends from a UK source, should 
they wish, the Income Access Share (IAS) arrangements have been put 
in place. The purpose of the IAS arrangements is to preserve the tax 
treatment of dividends paid to Experian shareholders in the UK, in respect 
of dividends paid by the Company. Shareholders who elect, or are deemed 
to elect, to receive their dividends via the IAS arrangements will receive 
their dividends from a UK source (rather than directly from the Company) 
for UK tax purposes.

Shareholders who hold 50,000 or fewer Experian plc shares on the first 
dividend record date after they become shareholders, unless they elect 
otherwise, will be deemed to have elected to receive their dividends under 
the IAS arrangements.

Shareholders who hold more than 50,000 shares and who wish to receive 
their dividends from a UK source must make an election to receive 
dividends via the IAS arrangements. All elections remain in force 
indefinitely unless revoked.

Unless shareholders have made an election to receive dividends via 
the IAS arrangements, or are deemed to have made such an election, 
dividends will be received from an Irish source and will be taxed 
accordingly. The final date for submission of elections to receive 
UK sourced dividends via the IAS arrangements is 23 June 2023.

Dividend Reinvestment Plan (DRIP) 
The DRIP enables those shareholders who receive their dividends under 
the Income Access Share arrangements to use their cash dividends to 
buy more shares in the Company. Eligible shareholders, who wish to 
participate in the DRIP in respect of the second interim dividend for the 
year ended 31 March 2023, to be paid on 21 July 2023, should return 
a completed and signed DRIP application form, to be received by the 
registrars by no later than 23 June 2023. Shareholders should contact 
the registrars for further details.

Experian plc Shareholder and corporate informationShareholder security
Shareholders are advised to be wary of any unsolicited advice, offers 
to buy shares at a discount or offers of free reports about the 
Company. More detailed information on such matters can be found 
at www.moneyhelper.org.uk. Details of any share dealing facilities 
that the Company endorses will be included on the Company’s website 
or in Company mailings.

Experian has a sponsored Level 1 ADR programme, for which J.P. Morgan 
Chase Bank, N.A. acts as Depositary. This ADR programme is not listed 
on a stock exchange in the USA and trades on the highest tier of the US 
over-the-counter market, OTCQX, under the symbol EXPGY. Each ADR 
represents one Experian plc ordinary share. Further information can be
