Chair’s statement

Board succession
As announced on 1 June 2023, the Board has 
approved the appointment of Matt Davies 
as Chair Designate with effect from 1 July 2023, 
to succeed me as Chair at the conclusion of 
the 2023 Annual General Meeting, prior to 
me becoming non-independent and in line 
with good corporate governance. Therefore, 
I will not be standing for re-election at our 
September 2023 AGM and expect a smooth 
transition to the new Chair. 

As a result of the Company becoming  
public in 2015 we put in place a new Board;  
as such over the next two years, three further 
Non-Executive Directors will be deemed  
to have become non-independent under  
the nine-year rule. We have plans in place  
to recruit new Non-Executives, staggering 
renewal dates to mitigate against large 
changes in the Board and to preserve and 
build on diversity and experience which will 
best serve the business moving forward. 

This is covered in more detail in the 
Nomination Committee report.

Dividend and capital return strategy 
We are recommending to shareholders a  
final dividend of 5.6p, bringing the total 
dividend for the year to 8.4p. The value of 
dividends paid in respect of the 2023 financial 
year totals c.£77.7m, with a further £147.3m 
returned through share buybacks at an 
average share price of 582.1p.

Annual General Meeting
Our Annual General Meeting (‘AGM’) will be 
held at our Manchester office on 14 September 
2023 at 10am. 

A big thank you
As this is my last statement as Chair, it remains 
for me to say a big thank you to everyone 
involved with Auto Trader over the last eight 
years, including car buyers and sellers,  
our business customers, past and present 
employees, the current and previous 
executive teams, our Board of Directors  
and our shareholders, many of whom have 
held our shares continuously since the 
Company went public in 2015. 

In particular, I would like to thank those  
with whom I have worked closely, including  
a large number of executives outside the 
Board. From the start of my involvement  
with Auto Trader one thing was obvious:  
an enormous commitment and enthusiasm 
to simply “get stuff done”. I am sure the new 
Board members, who will replace those of  
us reaching the end of our Board service,  
will value this as much as we have. It has 
allowed us to focus a huge proportion of our 
time and attention on opportunities and not 
problems, making it critical to our success 
and such a pleasure to be part of.

Ed Williams
Chair 
1 June 2023

This is my ninth and final statement 
as Chair of Auto Trader Group plc. 
As such, rather than focus on the 
year just gone, I would like to offer 
a longer perspective regarding 
Auto Trader’s history and future.  
It has been my privilege to  
serve as the Auto Trader Chair 
throughout our eight years  
as a public company.

A reflection on my tenure as Chair 
I first got to know Auto Trader around 15 
years ago when I was chief executive of 
Rightmove Plc. I first attended an Auto Trader 
Board meeting as a guest. That meeting 
decided to sell Auto Trader’s last remaining 
print plant, though Auto Trader would 
continue to publish weekly magazines for  
a few years after that. Auto Trader had a 
successful website but it contributed a small 
amount to our overall revenues. Our online 
product offering was simple and focused  
on tools to help car retailers get their adverts 
online and monitor their success. We had  
a number of small wholly owned or partly 
owned businesses in other countries.  
We operated out of a number of physical 
offices spread around the UK.

Today, we operate a sophisticated online 
automotive marketplace, with our car 
retailers able to select from a range of 
advertising options and data products  
that not only help them sell vehicles but 
manage the effectiveness of their operations 
including the stock they hold. We operate  
in a single country with the considerable 
majority of our office-based staff in a single 
office in Manchester. 

During the previous year we took a number 
of steps to complete the simplification of  
our business, including the sale of Webzone 
Limited (trading as ‘Carzone’), our Irish 
business, reducing and simplifying our 
property holdings and starting the process 

to exit our legacy defined benefit pension 
scheme. I would particularly like to thank 
Warren Cray and his team at Carzone in 
Ireland for their contribution to the Group 
over many years.

2023 saw the completion of one of the 
largest product development projects in  
the Company’s history, enabling our car 
retailer customers to provide a complete 
transactional service to car buyers on the 
Auto Trader platform. This includes the 
ability to reserve a car online with a deposit, 
arrange finance, obtain a trade-in valuation 
on an existing car and delivery to a buyer’s 
home or other convenient location.

2023 also saw the purchase of Autorama, 
which offers new vehicles on leases to  
the public. This gives us a substantial 
potential position in the online transactional  
market for new cars. A current priority is the 
integration of the Autorama offering into  
our existing new car proposition and further 
developments to that combined offering.

So not only have we successfully transitioned 
from a print to digital, advertising-only to 
data business, but we have also embarked 
on the journey from a used car advertising 
service to a platform for advertising and 
transacting in both used and new cars. It will 
take time for all these businesses to realise 
their potential and if the past is any guide, 
we will be both pleasantly surprised in the 
long term and sometimes disappointed at 
the speed of adoption and the path to full 
commercial value being realised. 

It is unhelpful for outgoing Chairs to seek  
to tie the hands of their successors. It is the 
job of future Auto Trader Board members  
to exercise their judgement in pursuing the 
course that makes most sense to them at the 
time in the knowledge of the marketplace as 
they then see it. I hope, though, that they will 
come to the view that the current Board has 
left the business stronger, simpler and with  
a wider range of opportunities open to them 
than when they first became involved.

Auto Trader Group plc  Annual Report and Financial Statements 2023

CEO’s statement

I’m pleased to report that our 
business is in as strong a position  
as it has ever been, and we are 
embarking on a journey where  
used and new car buyers can not 
only complete their research on 
Auto Trader, but complete more  
of the transaction too.

Summary of Group financial performance
Revenue in the core Auto Trader business 
increased by 9% to £473.0 million as 
customers are increasingly using our  
data, platform and advertising products  
to support their businesses. At a Group  
level revenue grew 16% to £500.2 million 
(2022: £432.7 million), the difference being 
the inclusion of the Autorama business, 
acquired in June 2022, with revenue of  
£27.2 million. Auto Trader growth was ahead 
of expectations and has been achieved 
despite both the new and used car markets 
experiencing low transaction volumes, 
although this headwind has been somewhat 
offset by robust levels of retailer profitability. 
The brilliant work of our people continues  
to strengthen our position with car buyers, 
build true partnerships with our customers 
and support an industry-leading data and 
technology platform.

Operating profit in the core Auto Trader 
business was £332.9 million, up 10% on last 
year, with a continued margin of 70% as  
a result of careful management of costs 
despite inflationary pressures. Group 
operating profit declined by 9% to £277.6 million 
(2022: £303.6 million), due to an operating 
loss of £11.2 million from Autorama, and  
£44.1 million of Group central costs relating 
to the acquisition of Autorama, which were 
£38.8 million of deferred consideration and 
amortisation of acquired intangibles of  
£5.3 million. Group operating profit margin 
was 55% (2022: 70%).

Strategy and purpose
Our purpose continues to be “Driving Change 
Together. Responsibly” which guides strategy 
and decisions across the organisation. At our 
2022 Investor Day, we outlined our strategy 
using three concentric circles to illustrate 
that they are all elements of Auto Trader’s 
central business strategy, rather than three 
distinct opportunities. Our technology and 
data platform and digital retailing build  
on the strengths of our core marketplace 
business. As an example, our platform 
strategy embeds our technology and data 
into retailers’ businesses enabling them to 
make quicker decisions, which ultimately 
improves the value they get from advertising 
on Auto Trader. Digital retailing provides a 
deeper buying experience on Auto Trader 
that is more efficient for retailers and harder 
for others to replicate.

The UK car market 
New car registrations at 1.7 million were 3% 
above financial year 2022 (2022: 1.6 million) 
but 19% lower than financial year 2020 with 
supply chain challenges continuing to impact 
the volume of new cars available for sale  
in the UK. New light commercial vehicle 
(‘LCV’) registrations were down 11% year on 
year. Used car transactions at 6.9 million 
were 8% below financial year 2022 levels 
(2022: 7.5 million) due to the knock-on impact 
of low volumes of new car supply, which has 
reduced the availability of younger cars.

Despite the weakness seen in supply 
throughout the period, demand has been 
resilient and used car prices have remained 
strong. Our used car Retail Price Index saw  
a 12% like for like, year on year increase in 
prices over the past 12 months, which has 
contributed to favourable trading conditions 
for our customers. 

Being a responsible business
We hold ourselves to the highest standards 
when it comes to acting responsibly. We 
have a Corporate Responsibility Committee 
with oversight of Auto Trader’s focus on the 
environmental, social and governance (‘ESG’) 
aspects of our business. We have identified 
focus areas and created a range of initiatives 
which are monitored regularly, and reported 
on externally with our cultural KPIs. While 
recognising that many of these changes 
take time, we remain committed to making 
meaningful progress across all measures. 

We continue to focus on our people, ensuring 
that those from all backgrounds can fully 
realise their potential. We have carefully 
constructed learning and development 
programmes focusing on supporting early 
careers, mid-management and a continuous 
leadership programme for senior leaders.  
All of these programmes are specifically 
designed to recruit, support and develop 
diverse talent in our business. 

There are two strands to our commitment 
around the environment: achieving net zero 
carbon emissions by 2040, and supporting 
consumers in making more environmentally 
friendly vehicle choices. 

Outlook 
The new financial year has started well and 
the Board is therefore confident of meeting 
its growth expectations for the year.

We expect another good year of retailer 
revenue growth, by far the largest part of 
our Auto Trader business. This will come from 
a similar ARPR growth rate to that achieved 
in financial year 2023. We expect the product 
lever to be consistent with the £137 achieved 
last year and the price lever to be slightly 
higher than last year’s £90. The stock lever  
is likely to remain flat. We anticipate a slight 
decline in retailer numbers, mostly due  
to the full year impact of the disposal of 
Webzone Limited. 

Over time we aim to grow share in the  
new car leasing market through our new 
Autorama segment. Our short-term focus  
is on significantly reducing the current 
annualised operating losses of £15 million 
through deeper integration with Auto Trader 
and being disciplined on costs. Group 
central costs, which are non-cash and  
relate to the acquisition of Autorama,  
will be c.£18 million for the year. 

Auto Trader operating profit margins  
should be consistent year on year at 70%, 
despite continued investment in product 
development and inflationary pressures. 
Group margins are expected to increase 
year on year.

Reflecting on and recognising  
the notable achievements of  
our Chair, Ed Williams

As the tenure of our current Chair, Ed Williams, comes to an end,  
we wanted to recognise the unique impact he has had on Auto Trader  
during his involvement since 2010.

2010
Appointed to the Board  
of Trader Media Group 
(co-owned by funds 
advised by Apax Partners 
and Guardian Media 
Group) to support its 
digital transformation 
with huge credibility 
coming from his time  
as founder and CEO  
of Rightmove from  
2000 to 2013. 

2013
Ed was instrumental in supporting 
the business’s transition from  
print to digital, culminating in the 
closure of the magazines in 2013. 
This included the appointment of 
Trevor Mather as CEO, who oversaw 
the strategy to simplify the business 
and transition to a purpose-led, 
values driven culture. 

2015
The business had a successful 
IPO on the London Stock Exchange, 
supported by Ed’s credibility  
and significant experience  
with public market investors. 
This included establishing  
a new independent Board,  
most of whom remain with  
the business to this day.

2012
Ed was instrumental in  
the business adopting  
a strategy to simplify its 
focus and operations on 
Auto Trader.

2014
Ed was appointed Chair  
of Auto Trader, leading the 
business through to its 
next phase of becoming  
a public company.

Ed has worked diligently in the 
background for years to create a great 
business with outstanding governance, 
while holding himself to the very 
highest standards as a Chair.

Auto Trader Group plc  Annual Report and Financial Statements 2023

On behalf of myself, the Board and everyone at Auto Trader we want  
to say thank you for years of dedicated service, over which time the 
business has completely transformed to the benefit of our people, 
customers, car buyers, shareholders and other stakeholders.

As we say at Auto Trader, you have every reason to feel #proud.

2019
•  January: Auto Trader market 

capitalisation reached £4.2bn as  
we became a FTSE 100 business. 

•  November: Following the 

appointment of Sigga Sigurdardottir, 
Auto Trader’s Board became 50:50 
male to female, one of only seven 
FTSE 100 businesses at the time, 
exceeding the Hampton-Alexander 
recommendations for gender 
diversity on boards.

2020
Along with the rest of the  
world, Auto Trader was hit  
by the COVID-19 pandemic,  
with retailers closing their 
forecourts in late March 2020. 
The business acted swiftly to 
protect its people, support  
its customers and reduce risk 
given the significant unknowns 
at the time. This included 
pausing charging retailers  
for over four months, pausing 

dividends and share buybacks, 
raising capital, reducing debt 
and waiving Board fees, salaries 
and bonuses. Ed’s leadership  
of the Board at this time was 
more important than at any 
time in our history given the 
magnitude of decisions made. 
The impact of these actions  
still benefit us today – with our 
people, retailers, car buyers 
and our shareholders.

2020
As Chair, Ed oversaw the 
planning and execution  
of a comprehensive 
succession plan from the 
then CEO, Trevor Mather, 
to current CEO, Nathan Coe.

2022
•  January: Following the 

appointment of Jasvinder Gakhal, 
the Board met the Parker review 
recommendation for ethnic 
diversity on boards.

•  September: The business 

announces an evolved strategy at 
its Investor Day, outlining future 
growth in its core marketplace 

and the opportunity to grow 
further through digital retailing  
– bringing more of the car buying 
journey onto Auto Trader – and  
our platform strategy to enable  
the industry to benefit from the 
data and technology we use  
to run Auto Trader.

A changing new  
and used car market

Continually adapting our onsite experience to meet the changing 
needs of both our consumers and customers is core to remaining 
the UK’s largest automotive marketplace for new and used cars.

Retail Price Index

The Auto Trader Retail Price Index tracks the average  
retail price of used cars based on c.900,000 daily pricing 
observations across the automotive retail market. 

Used car prices have remained strong, increasing 12%  
during financial year 2023 on a year-on-year, like-for-like  
basis, with average prices reaching £17,712 in March 2023,  
the 36th month of consecutive year-on-year growth. 

Prices have remained strong due to a constrained supply side, 
twinned with robust levels of demand in the market. We expect  
that these supply and demand dynamics will continue and that 
average retail prices will remain stable for the foreseeable future.

+3% year on year (2022: 1.6m)

used car transactions in the 12 months to March 2023 
-8% year on year (2022: 7.5m)

New car registration volumes remain impacted by 
supply chain challenges. New car registrations for 
financial year 2023 were 1.7 million, +3% on financial 
year 2022 but still -19% behind pre-pandemic levels 
(financial year 2020).

While levels of supply do remain heavily constrained, 
the availability of stock has very gradually improved 
over the second half of the financial year and new 
car registrations in Q4 of our financial year saw 18% 
growth year on year. 

With manufacturers continuing to bring more electric 
cars to market, much of the new car growth has been 
driven by alternatively fuelled vehicles. Over the full 
year, EVs accounted for 279k registrations, a 25% 
year-on-year increase. 

Used car transactions were 8% below 
financial year 2022 levels at 6.9 million 
for financial year 2023, as transactions 
continued to feel the knock-on impact 
of low volumes of new car supply.

This was a story of two halves. In H1, 
we saw demand on Auto Trader  
down compared with H1 2022 and 
saw used car transactions -15%  
year on year. This was lapping a very 
strong comparative period in H1 2022.

By contrast, in H2 2023, we saw our 
demand metrics improve year on 
year and in the second half used  
car transactions were actually up 
marginally year on year.

Despite potential headwinds,  
we expect demand for used cars  
to remain robust, not least because 
cars are for most motorists a 
fundamental need. What’s more, 
there remains a huge backlog of 
people waiting for a driving test,  
and there has been a combined five 
million lost new and used car sales 
over the past three years.

Auto Trader Group plc  Annual Report and Financial Statements 2023

The key drivers shaping the future of our industry

1

Structural changes in the new car market

Key trend
There are significant structural 
changes taking effect in new 
vehicles, including electrification, 
the growth of leasing, new 
manufacturers entering the UK 
market and a shift towards new 
digital distribution models. 

Future opportunities
There is a significant opportunity  
for us to help consumers, retailers, 
funders and manufacturers 
navigate these changes. 

For consumers, we can help them 
choose their next new vehicle  
and for retailers, funders and 
manufacturers we can be a highly 
efficient digital sales channel. 

2

Consumers’ desire to move online

Key trend
Consumer appetite to do more of the  
car buying journey online remains strong 
following the pandemic. Today, almost 
two thirds of consumers and more than 
80% of younger car buyers are open to the 
concept of digital retailing. 

Whether it’s checking availability, 
sourcing a valuation, booking a test 
drive, paying a deposit, or organising 
finance, 60% of car buyers would like  
to do these key jobs online.

Future opportunities
While most people still want to do  
some of the purchase journey in person, 
many are comfortable doing more of 
their car buying jobs online. 

There is a significant opportunity for us  
in digitising key parts of the transaction, 
providing a better experience for 
consumers and creating significant 
efficiencies for our retailers. 

3

The increasing importance of data 

Key trend
Levels of supply and demand for 
different makes and models continue  
to change at speed, and with the added 
complexity of increasing fuel types,  
it is more difficult than ever for retailers 
to base stocking and pricing decisions 
on experience alone. 

Future opportunities
We’re surfacing our award-winning 
valuations into retailers’ businesses 
through Auto Trader Connect. 

We’ve also launched Vehicle Insight,  
a new performance tool that enables 
retailers to access our market data in one 
simplified view through our Retailer Portal. 
We’re constantly evolving and investing 
in our platforms to help our retailer 
partners respond quickly to market 
changes and improve performance 
across their digital forecourts. 

4

The EV market continues to evolve

Key trend
Across the whole year we have continued  
to see the demand and supply for electric 
vehicles (‘EVs’) increase across both new 
and used cars. 

Future opportunities
The EV market is immature and nuanced, 
which means accurate and timely data is 
critical for retailers to inform their sourcing 
and pricing strategies. 

However, the picture has varied significantly 
throughout the year. By the end of the year 
we were seeing supply rise faster than 
demand in used EVs causing pressure on 
used EV pricing.

Auto Trader has a unique opportunity to 
guide and support consumers in making the 
switch to electric and is providing more 
detail on its platforms including total cost of 
ownership information and battery ranges.

Classified marketplace
Our core marketplace 
benefits from network 
effects where the largest 
audience of in-market  
car buyers attracts the 
widest array of stock,  
which then appeals to  
more car buyers. We create 
the best experience for 
consumers, and the most 
efficient sales channel for  
our retailer customers. 

Platform
Through a combination of  
our unique data set, scaleable 
technology and wide-ranging 
partnerships, we are uniquely 
placed to be the data and 
technology platform for UK 
automotive. We create value 
by combining data sets  
and exposing them to our 
customers, helping them make 
better and faster decisions.

Digital retailing
We are building products and 
services to enable consumers 
to do more of the vehicle buying 
journey online. For new vehicles 
this can be an entirely online 
sale, whereas for used cars 
this is the completion of a 
deal. This will ensure a better 
experience for consumers, 
and increased efficiency  
for retailers.

2023 progress

In our core advertising marketplace,  
we successfully executed our annual price 
increase in April 2022, which included the launch 
of Retail Essentials, the first module of our Auto 
Trader Connect platform. This product was well 
received by customers given the quality of the 
data and the operational efficiencies it delivers.

Our customer numbers in the UK are at record 
levels, with continued low levels of cancellation 
in part due to the strength of our standing  
with customers. We continue to make progress 
deepening our partnerships with our customers, 
particularly through providing our market-
leading insight. Our sales teams have data 
driven, goal focused conversations with our 
customers. Levels of new customer acquisition 
were largely consistent with the prior year. 

Penetration of our higher yielding packages 
increased, with 33% of retailer stock now above 
Standard as at March 2023 (March 2022: 31%).  
We also saw an increase in the uptake of our 

As part of our annual pricing event in April 2022, 
we included our first Auto Trader Connect 
module – ‘Retail Essentials’. Retail Essentials 
gives customers access to our most fundamental 
and powerful data, including our taxonomy, 
which improves advert quality, and enables 
stock to be updated on Auto Trader in real time.

At the end of March 2023, we had integrations 
with over 90 third-party software providers with 
Auto Trader Connect. 

For our April 2023 pricing event we have 
launched the second module of Auto Trader 
Connect – ‘Valuations’. This gives our customers 
access to our retail, part exchange and trade 
valuations to help inform retailers’ sourcing and 
pricing strategies with the most accurate view 
of the market.

Building on both our platform and marketplace, 
we are bringing more of the car buying journey 
online. Our approach to digital retailing is to be 
‘car first’ and to enable any retailer (including 
manufacturers and leasing companies) to sell 
their cars online. With this goal in mind, we will 
initially offer two digital retailing consumer 
journeys: a used car Deal Builder journey on  
Auto Trader and a fully online retailing journey  
for new vehicles.

For our used car Deal Builder journey, we are 
pleased with the initial trial and by the end of the 
financial year had over 50 retailers live. We have 
continued to develop the product with the ability 
to complete the deal in multiple sessions across 
devices, a revision to the reservations and part 
exchange flow and the launch of the product for 
multi-site customers using our Retailer Portal.  
We have also launched a new product page for 
cars with Deal Builder.

Market Extension product (allowing customers 
to sell vehicles outside their local area) and our 
Pay-Per-Click product which allows stock items 
to appear at the top of the search listings.

With the sale of new and used electric vehicles 
increasing, we continue to invest in our electric 
vehicle content to ensure we are the number 
one destination for car buyers interested  
in purchasing an EV. We continue to inform 
consumers about electric vehicles on our social 
media channels and raise the awareness of  
EVs through our EV giveaway which achieved 
over 3.5 million entries this year. By rethinking 
our make-model product pages, we have 
significantly improved our EV SEO ranking, 
bringing more consumers to the site. When on 
Auto Trader, we have focused on improving  
the level of information to help make consumers 
more informed about owning an EV.

These modules are an important part of how  
we are increasingly using our platform to power  
our retailers’ businesses, which strengthens our 
core and is a key enabler for digital retailing.

We have also made good progress in continuing 
to build lender integrations, strengthening both 
the breadth and depth of our finance platform. 
This is a critical asset that underpins the finance 
component of our Digital Retailing journey.  
We now have 19 lenders integrated, which we 
estimate represents 42% of retailers on our 
Retailer Finance product (based on first string 
lender). We also enabled the entire end to end 
finance transaction journey with one lender 
including e-sign. FCA Consumer Duty is central 
to our digital journeys, both for consumers  
and retailers.

We saw an increase in the number of software 
releases on the Auto Trader platform to 51,000 
(2022: 46,000).

In new vehicles there are significant structural 
changes taking effect, including the growth  
of electric cars, the growth of leasing, new 
manufacturers entering the UK market and  
a shift towards new digital distribution models. 

To enhance our new vehicle proposition,  
and to ensure we are well placed as these 
structural changes take effect, on 22 June 2022, 
we completed the acquisition of Autorama UK 
Limited (‘Autorama’). 

By combining Autorama’s capabilities with 
Auto Trader’s platform and scale, we believe  
we have a compelling proposition for 
manufacturers, retailers and leasing companies, 
with a significant opportunity to reduce existing 
customer acquisition costs and grow the 
business’s profitability.

Future opportunities

How we measure progress

Associated risks

We continue to consider ways in which  
we can build consumer trust in our core 
marketplace. We also see an opportunity  
to improve our search experience, 
particularly in the ways we use data to 
create a more personalised search 
experience for consumers. 

Given the changing landscape in new cars, 
we will continue to evolve our new car 
product. For example, with an increasing 
number of manufacturers selling direct to 
consumers, or operating under an agency 
model, we will look to enable manufacturers 
to advertise new cars directly on Auto Trader 
with national reach.

We have launched a new Vehicle Insight  
tool in our Retailer Portal which has  
already seen high levels of engagement. 

We will also continue to deepen 
relationships with third-party software 
providers, OEMs and lenders to further 
develop our proposition.

We will continue to scale the number of 
retailers on Deal Builder, and iterate the 
product in financial year 2024 – with an aim 
to monetise the product with some retailers 
by the end of financial year 2024.

By bringing our scale to bear, combined  
with continued product improvements in 
financial year 2024, we are confident that 
our new car leasing order take will grow year 
on year and expect to see efficiencies in 
customer acquisition cost.

Considering our stakeholders

The Directors of the Company have acted in the way that they consider,  
in good faith, would be most likely to promote the success of the Company  
for the benefit of its members as a whole, having due regard in doing so  
for the matters set out in section 172 (1) (a) to (f) of the Companies Act 2006.

Section 172 matters

Our purpose is Driving Change Together. Responsibly.

We are driving change in an industry 
that needs to evolve to adapt to 
changing consumer needs, and the 
impact of electric vehicles. 

Our business model results in bringing 
together a diverse set of stakeholders 
– consumers, customers (including 
retailers, manufacturers and other 
customers), suppliers and partners 
– underpinned by our collaborative, 
people-led culture.

We are committed to act responsibly 
through our focus on diversity and 
inclusion, environmental sustainability 
and maintaining high levels of ethical 
conduct, trust and transparency.

In order to achieve our purpose,  
we need to understand who our 
stakeholders are and what is 
important to them; we need to 
understand the long-term impact 
of our business on the industry  
and the environment; and we need 
to maintain our high standards  
of business conduct. 

All of these matters are taken into 
consideration by the Board in its 
discussions and decision-making.  
In order to formalise this process,  
a stakeholder framework has been 
established which is applied to  
all Board papers and discussions,  
to enable the Board to consider  
the balance of interests of 
affected stakeholders. 

The Board acknowledges that  
not every decision it makes will 
necessarily result in a positive 
outcome for all of our stakeholders. 
But by understanding our 
stakeholders, and by considering 
their diverse needs, the Board 
factors into boardroom discussions 
the potential impact of our 
decisions on each stakeholder 
group, and of the other matters 
required by S172(1).

needs of our stakeholders in each.

THE COST OF LIVING CRISIS 

Relevant strategic priorities:

CONTEXT 
As inflation began to rise and the cost of living 
crisis began to impact daily life, the Board 
considered the impact on stakeholders in 
response to growing financial concerns.

BOARD CONSIDERATIONS
Given the significant shift in the macro-economic 
backdrop at the start of our financial year, with 
rising inflation and weaker consumer confidence, 
the Board devoted significant time to reviewing 
the impact on the business and each stakeholder 
group. This included our product and pricing 
strategy; the management of our own cost 
base; the impact on employees (particularly 
lower paid employees); the implications for 
customers, consumers and suppliers; as well  
as considering any impacts on the wider 
community and the environment.

OUTCOME 
The Board noted that the increase in the cost  
of living and inflation pressure would impact  
all employees, in particular those on lower 
salaries. Allowance was made for this  
in the annual pay review, which weighted 
increases towards employees on lower 
incomes. In addition, a one-off payment  
of £700 per employee was made (excluding  
the OLT and the Board) in December 2022.

The Board considered the impact of rising costs  
on our customers, and decided to continue to 
prioritise developing and launching products  
that would help our customers to inform their  
own pricing and improve their profitability,  
such as the Auto Trader Connect: ‘Valuations’ 
module and AT Moves, which many customers  
have made significant cost savings through. 

Recognising an increase in our own cost base,  
and the expectations of investors to grow revenue  
in line with inflation, the Board considered a number 
of options in relation to annual price rises, including 
consideration of a one-off inflationary rise. However, 
balancing the need to support our customers in a 
sustainable way, this approach was ruled out, and we 
maintained the existing policy of a single annual rise. 

The Board reviewed consumer behaviour during 
previous recessions or economic slowdowns,  
and noted that consumer behaviour has generally 
remained resilient to economic shocks. However,  
it was also noted that there was a risk that cost 
pressures could result in a slowing down in  
the adoption of electric vehicles, which are on 
average 37% more expensive than an internal 
combustion engine (‘ICE’) vehicle. It was agreed 
that we need to enhance the content around 
affordability, including finance options, but to 
balance this with a continued focus of being the 
best buying destination for EVs.

The Board noted it was important to continue  
to work in a partnership approach with suppliers, 
particularly smaller suppliers. Material supplier 
contracts were reviewed for inflation linked 
cost increases and we enhanced our supplier 
risk review processes over their financial stability.

Noting that the charity sector was likely to  
be impacted adversely, the Board agreed that  
it was important to maintain existing levels  
of corporate charitable donations and to 
continue to support employees with their 
fundraising efforts.

Overall, the Board agreed that the actions  
taken in response to the cost of living crisis  
are in line with our purpose and the long-term 
interests of the business.

DISPOSAL OF WEBZONE LIMITED

Relevant strategic priorities:

CONTEXT 
Webzone Limited, which trades in the Republic 
of Ireland under the Carzone brand, was sold  
to Mediahuis Ireland for consideration of  
€30 million.

BOARD CONSIDERATIONS
Webzone Limited is the second largest 
automotive marketplace for retailers and 
consumers in Ireland and is headquartered  
in Dublin. For the year ended 31 March 2022, 
Webzone Limited contributed total revenue  
of £4.9m (which included £4.1 million of retailer 
revenue) and operating profit of £1.3 million to 
Auto Trader’s Group results. It represented 4%  
of the Company’s average retailer forecourts 
and 4% of its full-time equivalent employees. 

In making its decision about whether to proceed 
with the disposal of Webzone Limited, the Board 
considered various factors, including the  
valuation of the business in comparison to current 
profitability; the impact of the disposal on the  
Auto Trader UK business; the impact on Webzone 
Limited’s management team and employees;  
and the impact on Webzone Limited’s customers 
and suppliers, which were taken into account  
when negotiating the final terms of the disposal. 

OUTCOME
Webzone Limited had been part of the Auto Trader 
Group for almost 20 years, and whilst this would 
represent a significant change for employees and 
customers, the Board agreed that the disposal  
was likely to promote the success of the Company 
for the benefit of its members, and would enable 
Auto Trader to focus fully on the opportunities in  
the UK automotive market.

  Our governance & compliance

Being a responsible business P26

The Board ensures it is kept informed of stakeholder views and concerns throughout the year and 
where engagement doesn’t take place directly with the Board, the output of this engagement 
is fed back to the Board and/or a Board Committee, which informs their decisions. A deeper 
understanding of our stakeholders and their diverse areas of interest enables us to factor  
into boardroom discussions the potential impact of our decisions on each stakeholder group.

Our materiality assessment P27

Partners  
& suppliers

WHY ARE THEY IMPORTANT TO US? 
We rely on our suppliers and partners to provide 
technology infrastructure, supply of data about 
vehicles and their financing, and in the fulfilment 
of some of our revenue generating products. 
Building trusted partnerships helps us to work 
better together and continue to provide the 
highest quality products and services.

SIGNIFICANT AREAS OF INTEREST 
•  Working collaboratively on innovations.
•  Increasing revenue from shared opportunities.
•  Fair trading and terms and conditions.
•  Building long-term relationships. 

The community  
& the environment

WHY ARE THEY IMPORTANT TO US? 
We aim to give back more to the planet than  
we take out and protect our business from  
the impact of climate change. We also strive  
to create stronger communities and have  
a positive social and environmental impact.

SIGNIFICANT AREAS OF INTEREST 
•  Energy usage and carbon emissions. 
•  The transition to electric vehicles. 
•  Supporting and working with, and in,  

the local communities in which we operate.

•  Environmental, Social and Governance  

(‘ESG’) factors.

HOW DO WE ENGAGE WITH THEM?

Definition
The Group generates revenue from Auto Trader 
and Autorama. There are three streams within 
Auto Trader: Trade, Consumer Services and 
Manufacturer and Agency. Trade revenue is 
broken down into three categories: Retailer, 
Home Trader and Other, with Consumer 
Services similarly split into Private, Motoring 
Services and Instant Offer. Autorama revenue 
is split into Vehicle and Accessory Sales, and 
Commission and Ancillary. 

Linked to remuneration?  Yes

Progress
Revenue increased 16% year on year, with the main 
driver of growth being Retailer revenue, supported  
by all other revenue lines. There was also a £27.2m 
incremental contribution to Group revenue from 
Autorama following the acquisition on 22 June 2022.

Progress
ARPR grew £227 in the year. Growth was driven by  
our product lever as retailers continued to purchase 
prominence largely through higher level packages. 
Market Extension and our Auto Trader Connect: 
Retailer Essentials products also contributed to growth 
of the product lever. Growth was further supported  
by a price increase, with the stock lever being flat.

of our emissions are predominantly due to the emissions 
associated with the vehicles sold by Autorama which 
temporarily pass through their balance sheet. This was 
the main driver for the year-on-year decline with fewer 
vehicles sold having passed through their balance sheet.

Strategic reportGovernanceFinancial statementsOperational review

I am pleased with the progress we’ve 
made this year, in particular the 
development of our digital retailing 
proposition. The early feedback 
from our Deal Builder offering is 
encouraging and we are excited  
to scale this in the coming year.

Summary of Group operating performance
Consumer engagement remained strong;  
we have maintained our position as the  
UK’s largest and most engaged automotive 
marketplace for new and used cars. Over 75% 
of all minutes spent on automotive classified 
sites were spent on Auto Trader (2022: over  
75%) and we were 7x larger than our nearest 
competitor (2022: 8x). Our average monthly 
cross platform visits increased by 1% to  
69.6 million per month (2022: 68.9 million) and 
were 24% above pre-pandemic levels recorded 
in 2020 (56.3 million). Engagement, measured 
by total minutes spent onsite, decreased by  
8% to an average of 514 million minutes per 
month (2022: 556 million minutes), although  
was 16% ahead of pre-pandemic levels  
(2020: 443 million minutes). For both visits and 
minutes, we have changed the data source 
from Google Analytics to Snowplow to give  
us a deeper understanding of our user events.

The average number of retailer forecourts 
advertising on our platform was broadly flat  
at 13,913 (2022: 13,964). However, excluding the 
Webzone Limited disposal (a negative impact 
of 245 retailers over the period), like-for-like 
retailer numbers grew by 1% year on year, 
representing the highest level of UK retailers 
we have ever had using our platform.  
Though there continues to be some merger  
and acquisition activity among car retailers,  
we see no evidence of meaningful industry 
consolidation, nor any increase in barriers  
for those wishing to enter the industry. 

Total live stock on site increased by 2% to  
an average of 437,000 cars (2022: 430,000). 
New car stock declined to an average of 
25,000 (2022: 29,000) due to constrained  
new car supply. Used car live stock increased 
3% on average across the year although was 
35,000 cars lower than pre-pandemic levels. 
Autorama delivered 6,895 vehicles across  
the period, which comprised 4,295 cars, 2,253 

22

At the end of March 2023, we had over 1,900 
retailers (March 2022: over 1,800) paying to 
advertise new cars on our site which is a robust 
performance given the challenges of sourcing 
new car stock due to supply shortages. 

Platform
We continue to invest in our technology,  
data and product platform which supports  
our core marketplace. As mentioned above,  
we launched Retail Essentials which enables 
real-time stock management and makes  
our vehicle taxonomy available to retailers 
through our own Retailer Portal or our platform 
via APIs. At the end of March 2023, we had 
integrations with over 90 third-party software 
providers with Auto Trader Connect. 

As part of our April 2023 pricing event,  
we launched our second module of Auto 
Trader Connect, Valuations. This makes 
specification adjusted valuations available 
within Retailer Portal, where many of  
our retailers manage their inventory.  
Our valuations benefit from machine 
learning technology which continuously 
improves and optimises results based  
on c.500,000 observations that we see  
each day. This enables customers to drive  
pricing performance as the market moves.  
This data can also be accessed through  
an API via our platform, enabling third 
parties and retailers to directly integrate 
valuations into the systems used to manage 
their businesses. These modules are an 
important part of how we are using our 
platform to power retailers’ businesses, 
which strengthens our marketplace and  
is a key enabler for digital retailing.

We continued to see an increase in the number 
of software releases to 51,000 over the year 
(2022: 46,000).

Digital retailing
Last year, we launched a new product, 
Market Extension, which allows customers 
to sell vehicles outside their local area, 
beyond the physical constraints of their 
forecourt. This product is a key part of our 
longer-term aspiration to enable digital 
retailing for all customers. We had over 7%  
of retailer stock on this product at the end  
of March 2023 (March 2022: 6%), with the 
product being most relevant for those 
customers with either delivery capability  
or multiple forecourt locations. 

Building on both our strong classified 
marketplace and platform capability,  
we continue to bring more of the car buying 
journey online. Our approach to digital 
retailing is to be “car first” and to enable any 
retailer (including manufacturers and leasing 
companies) to sell their cars online. With this goal 
in mind, we will initially offer two digital retailing 
consumer journeys on Auto Trader: a used car 
Deal Builder journey and an online retailing 
journey for consumers to lease a new car. 

The used car Deal Builder journey
During the year, we launched Deal Builder 
which uses Auto Trader technology to 
enable car buyers to do more of their  
car buying online, including valuing their 

vans and 347 pickups. Both vans and pickups 
were particularly impacted by supply challenges 
in the year. Average commission and ancillary 
revenue per vehicle delivered was £1,624.

Our marketplace
Our core Auto Trader marketplace saw strong 
revenue and operating profit growth despite 
ongoing supply challenges, which shows the 
resilience of our business through economic 
cycles. We successfully executed our annual 
pricing event in April 2022, which included the 
launch of Retail Essentials, the first module of 
our Auto Trader Connect platform. This product 
uses our proprietary taxonomy data to ensure 
that vehicles are well described and that their 
specification is accurate, helping retailers  
to optimise margins. It also enables real-time 
stock management to ensure that all stock 
records are up to date on Auto Trader and  
all other digital channels, improving sales 
conversion and the experience of car buyers.

Our UK customer numbers are at record levels 
due to good market conditions, our strong 
position with car buyers and the partnerships 
formed with our customers. We have further 
embedded our partnership approach by 
ensuring that we capture our customers’  
own business goals, be that stock turn, sales 
volumes or target margins, and then use  
this as a basis to recommend products and 
performance improvements. Penetration  
of our higher yielding packages increased 
during the year, with 33% of retailer stock now 
above our Standard package as at the end  
of March 2023 (March 2022: 31%). We also saw 
an increase in the uptake of our Pay-Per-Click 
product which allows stock items to appear 
at the top of our search listings.

With the sale of new and used electric 
vehicles increasing, we continue to invest  
in electric vehicle (‘EV’) content to ensure  
we are the number one destination for car 
buyers interested in purchasing an EV.  
We inform consumers about electric vehicles 
through social media channels and raise 
awareness through our monthly EV giveaway 
which achieved over 3.5 million entries this 
year. We have also focused on improving  
the EV charging information to help give 
consumers simpler, more consistent data  
to make informed decisions.

A seamless omni-channel experience for consumers

The car market is changing. While there is still a significant role for physical locations to play, it’s clear that consumers are keen  
to complete more of the buying journey online, where possible. With our leading platform and data, we are perfectly positioned  
to drive and help deliver this change in the best possible way for consumers and retailers, alike.

part exchange, applying for finance and 
reserving the car. Importantly, all of these 
interactions can be easily carried out either 
online, over the phone or on the forecourt. 
Currently these tools are available in Retailer 
Portal, but over time they will be made 
available via APIs as part of our platform 
strategy, enabling these transactions to be 
picked up in retailers’ existing sales systems 
and processes. Our focus is on enabling  
the car buyer to complete as much of the 
journey as they are comfortable with on 
Auto Trader, completing the rest of the 
transaction on the forecourt, over the  
phone or a combination of these channels.

In summer 2022, we began running a Deal 
Builder trial with a handful of retailers and 
have been encouraged by how the trial has 
performed to date. Towards the end of  
the year we started to scale the number  
of customers on the product and by the  
end of the financial year there were over  
50 retailers live. We saw over 200 deals 
submitted in the year. We are encouraged by 
the percentage of deals that converted into 
a sale and the positive feedback from both 
consumers and retailers. We are seeing 
strong buyer engagement out of retail hours, 
seven days a week, which supports the case 
that this should build sales capacity for  
our retailers.

We will continue to scale the number of 
retailers on Deal Builder, and iterate the 
product during this financial year, with the 
goal to monetise some retailers by the end 
of financial year 2024.

Online retailing journey for consumers  
to lease a new car
There are significant structural changes 
impacting the new vehicle market in the UK. 
These include the growth of electric cars, 
new manufacturers entering the UK market 
and a shift towards new digital distribution 
models. These changes present an 
opportunity for Auto Trader to play a more 
significant role in the new vehicle market, 

and were part of the strategic rationale 
behind the acquisition of Autorama,  
which completed during the financial year. 
Autorama’s capabilities combined with  
Auto Trader’s platform and scale will provide 
a compelling proposition for manufacturers, 
retailers and funders, with an opportunity to 
drive direct sales, reduce customer acquisition 
costs and grow their businesses’ profitability.

Following the acquisition, Autorama has 
been heavily impacted by the supply 
challenges particularly in the pickup and  
van markets. The business has largely been 
run standalone throughout 2023, delivering 
6,895 vehicles, which comprised 4,295 cars, 
2,253 vans and 347 pickups, with average 
commission and ancillary revenue per 
vehicle of £1,624. During the latter part of 
2023, we successfully tested driving traffic 
into the Autorama journey and have recently 
completed the work to enable the full check 
out of a leasing deal on Auto Trader.

Being a responsible business
We are pleased the proportion of employees 
that are proud to work at Auto Trader 
remained high at 91% (March 2022: 95%)  
and our gender and ethnicity make up has 
improved year-over-year. At year end, 
women represented 43% of our organisation 
(March 2022: 40%) and 40% (March 2022: 38%) 
of leadership roles as defined by the FTSE 
Women Leaders Review. We are committed 
to increasing the percentage of ethnically 
diverse employees, who currently represent 
15% of the organisation (March 2022: 14%), 
with 14% of employees not disclosing their 
ethnicity. The percentage of ethnically 
diverse employees in leadership increased 
to 8% (March 2022: 6%) again using the FTSE 
Women Leaders definition, which highlights 
the work still to be done in this area.

Our employee-driven networks (representing 
women, ethnicity, LGBT+, early careers, 
disability & neurodiversity, social mobility, 
families and age) have continued their 
impressive work with high engagement and 

are key to creating an Auto Trader where 
people feel they belong and can achieve 
their full potential. Each network sets its  
own commitments aligned to our broader 
strategy which is reviewed by the leadership 
team bi-annually. 

We have committed to reducing absolute 
Scope 1 and 2 emissions by 50% and absolute 
Scope 3 emissions by 46% before the end  
of financial year 2031 and continue to  
include these reduction plans as part of  
our remuneration targets. Alongside the 
reduction in emissions, we are working on  
a carbon removal plan to help us achieve  
our long-term net zero goal by 2040.  
These targets were validated by the Science 
Based Targets initiative in January 2023. 
Absolute emission levels have increased 
from last year as we have updated our 
calculations to include the impact of 
Autorama. Initial calculations of our  
GHG emissions during the year total  
79.5k tonnes of CO2 across Scopes 1, 2 and 3 
(2022 restated: 129.4k). The majority of our 
emissions are Scope 3, predominantly 
attributable to our suppliers and emissions 
relating to the small number of vehicles  
sold by Autorama that pass through their 
balance sheet. The year-on-year reduction 
is predominantly due to lower volumes of 
these vehicles passing through the balance 
sheet, which we expect to reduce further 
over time. Initiatives include using our  
data and voice within the industry and 
government to help inform public policy  
and better decision-making. We have 
improved our SEO ranking for electric 
vehicles, continued our EV giveaway  
(with over 3.5 million entries this year) and 
have significantly improved the EV charging 
and battery range information on our 
product pages.

an average of 25,000 (2022: 29,000) due  
to the well documented shortage of new  
car supply. Underlying used car live stock 
increased by 3% on average across the year, 
although much of this increase came from  
a higher volume of private listings. The stock 
lever is not impacted by private listings,  
but by the number of retailer paid stock  
units which were broadly flat for the year 
(2022: increase £52). 

•  Product: Our product lever contributed 
growth of £137 (2022: £121) to total ARPR. 
Broadly half of this product growth  
was due to more retailers purchasing 
prominence products, including our  
higher yielding Enhanced, Super and Ultra 
packages where penetration increased to 
33% (March 2022: 31%). Our Market Extension 
product, allowing retailers to sell outside  
of their local area, also contributed to  
the product lever with 7% (March 2022: 6%)  
of retailer stock on the product by the  
end of the year. Finally, there was also  
some contribution from our Pay-Per-Click 
product, where retailers can boost visibility 
of their stock in search through pay-per-click 
campaigns. The other half of the product 
lever was made up from our Auto Trader 
Connect: Retail Essentials product included 
in our annual pricing event in April 2022  
and also smaller contributions from 
AutoConvert finance and data products.

Home Trader revenue increased by 15% to 
£10.1m (2022: £8.8m). Other revenue increased 
by 15% to £10.5m (2022: £9.1m).

Consumer Services revenue increased  
by 4% in the year to £34.5m (2022: £33.3m). 
Private revenue, which is largely generated 
from individual sellers who pay to advertise 
their vehicle on the Auto Trader marketplace, 
increased by 11% to £22.4m (2022: £20.2m) 
which was partially offset by Motoring 
Services revenue, which decreased 8% to 
£12.1m (2022: £13.1m). Instant Offer contributed 
£0.8m to Consumer Services (2022: £0.9m), 
which is included in Private revenue.

Revenue from Manufacturer and Agency 
customers was flat at £11.1m (2022: £11.1m). 
New car advertising in 2023 continued to  
be impacted by new car supply shortages. 

Total costs increased 8% to £142.6m  
(2022: £132.0m).

2022 Change

Adjusted earnings before interest, taxation, 
depreciation and amortisation, share of 
profit from joint ventures and Autorama 
deferred consideration increased by 7%  
to £328.0m (2022: £307.9m).

Group profit before tax decreased by 2% to 
£293.6m (2022: £301.0m), which included a 
£19.1m profit on disposal of Webzone Limited 
(trading as ‘Carzone’), which was sold  
on 24 October 2022. Cash generated from 
operations was £327.4m (2022: £328.1m).

Auto Trader results
Revenue increased to £473.0m (2022: £432.7m), 
up 9% when compared to the prior year. 
Trade revenue, which comprises revenue 
from Retailers, Home Traders and other 
smaller revenue streams, increased  
by 10% to £427.4m (2022: £388.3m).

Retailer revenue increased by 10% to £406.8m 
(2022: £370.4m). The average number of retailer 
forecourts advertising on our platform was 
broadly flat at 13,913 (2022: 13,964). However, 
after accounting for the disposal of Webzone 
Limited (an impact of 245 fewer retailers over 
the period), like-for-like retailer numbers 
increased by 1% on average across the year. 

Average Revenue Per Retailer (‘ARPR’) per 
month increased by 10% to £2,437 (2022: £2,210). 
This was driven by both the product and price 
levers, with the stock lever being flat.

•  Price: Our price lever contributed growth  

of £90 (2022: £74) to total ARPR as we 
delivered our annual pricing event for all 
customers on 1 April 2022, which included 
additional products but also a like-for-like 
price increase.

•  Stock: The number of live cars advertised  
on Auto Trader increased by 2% to 437,000 
(2022: 430,000). New car stock declined to

costs was partly driven by an increase in  
the average number of full-time equivalent

People costs of £10.5m related to the 209  
FTEs employed on average through the year.  
As a result of the acquisition being on  
22 June 2022, the contribution to the Group’s 
average number of FTEs in the year was 164. 
Marketing in the year was £4.7m. Other costs 
include IT services, property, other overheads 
and some depreciation and amortisation  
of developed software. The Autorama 
operating segment made an operating loss 
of £11.2m.

Adjusted earnings per share, before Autorama 
deferred consideration, profit on the sale of 
subsidiary, and net of the tax effect in respect 
of these items, increased by 6% to 27.12 pence 
(2022: 25.61 pence).

Group net finance costs
Group net finance costs increased to £3.1m 
(2022: £2.6m). Interest costs on the Group’s 
Syndicated Revolving Credit Facility 
(‘Syndicated RCF’) totalled £2.6m (2022: £1.4m) 
with the year-on-year increase due to higher 
utilisation of the facility across the year.  
At 31 March 2023 the Group had drawn £60.0m 
of its available facility (31 March 2022: £nil). 
Other finance costs comprised amortisation 
of debt issue costs of £0.5m (2022: £0.1m). 
Interest costs relating to leases totalled  
£0.2m (2022: £0.2m), which was offset by 
interest receivable on cash and cash 
equivalents of £0.2m (2022: £0.1m).

Amendment of Syndicated RCF 
commitments
On 1 February 2023, the Group amended and 
extended its Syndicated RCF, reducing the 
commitment from £250.0m to £200.0m. The 
facility was due to terminate in two tranches: 
£52.2m maturing in June 2023 and £197.8m 
maturing in June 2025. The facility has now 
been extended to February 2028 plus 
additional extension options with no tranche 
terminations. There is no requirement to 
settle all or part of the debt earlier than the 
termination dates stated. 

Taxation
Profit before taxation decreased by 2% to 
£293.6m (2022: £301.0m), with the decrease 
being lower than operating profit predominantly 
due to a £19.1m profit on disposal from the 
sale of Webzone Limited. The Group tax 
charge of £59.7m (2022: £56.3m) represents 
an effective tax rate of 20% (2022: 19%). This is 
higher than the average standard UK rate 
principally due to the Autorama deferred 
consideration charge being non-deductible. 
With revenue exceeding £500.0m for the first 
time, the Group is potentially within scope of 
the UK’s digital services tax (‘DST’), however 
certain revenue streams, such as vehicle and 
accessory sales, would be exempt, meaning 
we do not meet the threshold in financial year 
2023. It is HMRC’s intention that the current 
UK DST will be repealed during financial year 
2024 and replaced with an OECD model for 
which the Group would not be in scope.

Earnings per share 
Basic earnings per share decreased by 2%  
to 25.01 pence (2022: 25.61 pence) based on  
a weighted average number of ordinary shares 
in issue of 935,138,578 (2022: 955,532,888).  
Diluted earnings per share of 24.77 pence 
(2022: 25.56 pence) also decreased by 3%, 
based on 944,144,242 shares (2022: 957,534,145) 
which takes into account the dilutive impact 
of outstanding share awards.

Cash flow and net debt
Cash generated from operations decreased 
to £327.4m (2022: £328.1m). Corporation tax 
payments increased to £60.5m (2022: £56.2m). 
Cash generated from operating activities 
was £266.9m (2022: £271.9m).

As at 31 March 2023 the Group had net bank 
debt of £43.4m (31 March 2022: net cash 
£51.3m), an increase of £94.7m due to the 
acquisition of Autorama. At the year end, the 
Group had drawn £60.0m of its Syndicated 
RCF (31 March 2022: £nil) and held cash and 
cash equivalents of £16.6m (31 March 2022: 
£51.3m). 

Leverage, defined as the ratio of Net bank 
debt to EBITDA (adjusted for the Autorama 
deferred consideration), was 0.1 times (2022: 
zero) and interest paid was £3.4m (2022: £1.5m).

Capital structure and dividends 
During the year, a total of 25.3m shares (2022: 
24.9m) were purchased for a consideration  
of £147.3m (2022: £163.5m) before transaction 
costs of £0.7m (2022: £0.8m). A further £77.7m 
(2022: £73.6m) was paid in dividends, giving a 
total of £225.0m (2022: £237.1m) in cash 
returned to shareholders. The Directors are 
recommending a final dividend of 5.6 pence 
per share. Subject to shareholders’ approval 
at the Annual General Meeting (‘AGM’) on  
14 September 2023, the final dividend will be 
paid on 22 September 2023 to shareholders 
on the register of members at the close of 
business on 25 August 2023. The total dividend 
for the year is therefore 8.4 pence per share 
(2022: 8.2 pence per share). 

The Group’s long-term capital allocation 
policy remains unchanged: continuing to 
invest in the business enabling it to grow while 
returning around one third of net income  
to shareholders in the form of dividends. 
Following these activities any surplus cash 
will be used to continue our share buyback 
programme and steadily reduce gross 
indebtedness. It is the Board’s long-term 
intention that the Group will return to a net 
cash position.

Going concern
The Group generated significant cash from 
operations during the year. At 31 March 2023 
the Group had drawn £60.0m of its £200.0m 
unsecured Syndicated RCF and had cash 
balances of £16.6m. The Group has a strong 
balance sheet and flexibility in terms of 
uses of cash to manage increased economic 
uncertainty and higher interest rates.  
The £200.0m Syndicated RCF is committed 
until February 2028. Based on the facilities 
available and current financial projections 
for the next 12 months the Directors have 
concluded that it is appropriate to prepare 
the financial statements on a going 
concern basis.

purpose is driven by our resolve to do the right thing, measure and 
report transparently, and always act ethically and with integrity. 

As the UK’s largest automotive marketplace, we believe we have an 
obligation to do business responsibly and to create a more accessible, 
equitable and sustainable future. 

This involves changing how the UK shops for vehicles by providing 
the best online buying experience and supporting all our retailers  
to sell online. 

In a rapidly changing world, we recognise the importance of making 
sustainability a business priority. We know that we will only succeed 
as a business if we use our technology, expertise and data to help 
solve the challenges our customers, our consumers and our industry 
face. Our trusted brand has been built over more than 40 years and 
we remain committed to being the best place to find, buy and sell 
vehicles in the UK on a platform that enables data-driven digital 
retailing for our customers.  

Our ESG strategy focuses on the material issues that have the 
greatest impact on our business whilst considering the expectations 
of our stakeholders. In 2021 we introduced our cultural KPIs (see page 20) 
to help us measure progress against our strategy. In 2022, we undertook 
our first materiality assessment to consider what ESG issues matter 
most to our stakeholders and the impact of these on our business. 
The findings continue to inform our ESG strategy and focus areas.

Our ESG strategy is underpinned by our purpose, 
Driving Change Together. Responsibly.

We can play a positive role in making a difference to our people,  
our communities, our industries and the wider environment to create  
a more accessible, equitable and sustainable future.

In order to remain successful in the long 
term, an understanding of what ESG 
topics matter most to our key stakeholders 
is essential. In 2022, we conducted a 
materiality assessment to help inform our 
ESG strategy. This included an analysis of 
the issues impacting our business and a 
survey of opinion amongst our stakeholders 
as to the relative importance to them of 
those issues. The stakeholders included 
our employees, consumers, retailers, 
suppliers, commercial partners and 
investors. The materiality assessment 
helped us to capture our impacts in a 
non-financial manner and the findings 
continue to guide the focus areas of our 
ESG strategy.

Alongside our aim to have high standards 
of governance, we have focused most of 
our activities and initiatives on: diversity 
and inclusion; employee wellbeing; 
engagement and safety; product 
innovation; and customer satisfaction,  
all of which our stakeholders placed in  
the higher priority category. We have  
also chosen to actively focus on climate. 
Although climate did not place in the 
highest category, we believe we should  
be doing what we can to positively impact 
the world in which we live. 

Product innovation and customer 
satisfaction are key to our business 
strategy. Our focus on digital retailing  
is to bring more of the buying journey 
online, realising both an improved 
consumer experience and efficiencies  
for our customers (read more on pages  
12 and 13). We actively seek retailer 
feedback on all aspects of product  
and service development to ensure that 
we continue to provide market-leading 
solutions and also actively monitor 
consumer sentiment across our various 
products and channels.

Governance of our ESG strategy

We recognise that our activities, and the 
way in which we carry them out, impact 
well beyond our financial performance. 
There is increasing evidence that 
sustainable businesses drive greater 
long-term profit and value for stakeholders. 
With this in mind, in 2021 we established 
our Corporate Responsibility Committee 
to sit alongside our Audit, Remuneration 

and Nomination Committees. Whilst ESG 
related topics are covered in all Committees, 
this is a formal Committee of the Board  
with the overarching goal of monitoring  
our corporate responsibility initiatives  
and sustainability targets. The Committee, 
chaired by Jeni Mundy, plays a crucial role  
in overseeing the progress towards fulfilling 
our ESG strategy and ensuring that our 

targets and goals are ambitious and 
realistic. Responsibility for putting our  
ESG strategy into action spans across the 
business through specific functions within 
the business and through our individual 
guilds and networks, which are empowered 
to drive change within the organisation. 

Driving Change Together. 
Responsibly.

Our environment

Minimise our impact on the environment, 
thereby protecting our business from the 
impact of climate change.

Drive change across our own operations 
and supply chain, but also use our 
capabilities and voice to influence the 
automotive industry to support urgent 
action to tackle climate change. 

Task Force on Climate-related 
Financial Disclosures (‘TCFD’) 
compliance statement
The Group has prepared its TCFD 
disclosures in line with guidance from  
the 2021 updates to the TCFD Final Report 
and Annex, including the supplementary 
guidance for all sectors. At the time of 
publication, the Group has made climate 
related financial disclosures consistent 
with the TCFD recommendations set out  
on pages 30 to 34. We have built on our 
progress from previous years to develop  
a net zero strategy and we continue to 
identify the risks and opportunities to  
our business as a result of climate change  
and their potential financial impact. 

TCFD: Governance
We have integrated climate governance 
into our existing governance processes  
and sought to embed responsibility for  
the risks associated with climate change 
throughout our business, adopting a 
climate change focused mindset. There is a 
clear commitment from the Board to deliver 
on our environmental commitments and 
ensure relevant accountability across the 
business. Our environmental strategy was 
initiated to ensure a joined up approach 
across the business considering the risks 
and opportunities climate issues pose and 
how we are responding to them. 

TCFD: Strategy 
As the world transitions to a low carbon 
economy, regulatory change and changes  
in consumer behaviour will have an impact 
on the automotive market, meaning we  
need to develop and adapt our business 
strategy accordingly. Reducing the impact 
our business has on the environment is 
embedded into our wider business strategy 
of acting responsibly and we are committed 
to being a net zero business by 2040. As well 
as reducing our own emissions, we are also 
raising environmental awareness with both 
our customers and consumers, encouraging 
them to reduce their own environmental impact. 

We use our breadth of expertise, data and 
market insight to accelerate the transition  
to low carbon transport, working with the 
automotive industry.

1. BOARD RESPONSIBILITY

The Corporate Responsibility Committee is responsible for holding the 
Executive Directors to account with respect to climate risks and their  
impacts on the business. Our environmental strategy is a standing agenda 
item for all Committee meetings. 

3. RISK FORUM

Our Risk Forum undertakes a review of climate related risks with our 
Operational Leadership Team (‘OLT’). 

4. REMUNERATION COMMITTEE

The Committee introduced ESG related targets into the Performance Share 
Plan (‘PSP’) for the first time in 2021. In 2022, the PSP included a performance 
target linked to a reduction of our GHG emissions and it will also be included 
in the 2023 PSP. 

5. THIRD-PARTY ASSURANCE

Our GHG emissions have been independently assured by EcoAct using ISO 
14064-3 for all scopes of our carbon footprint.  

6.  ENVIRONMENTAL WORKING GROUPS

Our environmental strategy not only focuses on our own environmental 
impact, but also aims to support our customers, consumers and the industry 
in which we operate and, as a result, various parts of the business play a part 
in delivering our ambitions. Different parts of the business are brought 
together through our various working groups, which are supported by members 
of our OLT. Key activities and milestones are set for each financial year and 
these are shared with the Corporate Responsibility Committee. The working 
groups meet individually as required but meet collectively on a quarterly basis: 

•   Net Zero working group (sponsored by Jamie Warner, CFO): 

responsible for our commitment to net zero in line with our SBTi targets.

•   Environmental strategy working group (sponsored by Ian Plummer, 

Commercial Director): responsible for helping consumers make more 
environmentally friendly vehicle choices.

2. EXECUTIVE RESPONSIBILITY

7. EMPLOYEE GUILDS & NETWORKS

The responsibility for assessing and managing climate related risks sits at 
both executive and Board level. Executive responsibility for climate change 
impact is held by all our Executive Directors, who have responsibility for 
overseeing our climate change agenda and are responsible for ensuring that 
climate related risks are integrated into our existing business strategy. 
Responsibility for the consideration of climate related risks on the financial 
performance of the Group and compliance with environmental reporting 
rests with our CFO, Jamie Warner.

Our employees play a fundamental role in the success of our environmental 
strategy. Our Sustainability Network comprises passionate individuals 
from across the business who are focused on making life at Auto Trader 
more sustainable through increasing employee awareness and driving 
impactful changes for both individuals and our business, supporting our 
overall goal of reducing our carbon emissions.

Climate related risks and opportunities
To build climate resilience into our  
business strategy we identify climate 
related risks and opportunities. As an  
online marketplace, we have a relatively 
small carbon footprint and our business 
model is sustainable in a low carbon 
environment. However, with the acquisition 
of Autorama, our emissions have increased 
due to the vehicles sold by Autorama that 
temporarily pass through their balance sheet. 
The nature of the risks and opportunities that 
we face depends not just on the physical 
aspects of climate change, but also on 
transition risks. These are driven by the 
trajectory of our customers and consumers 
in responding to climate change and the 
regulations applied to the market we 
operate in. 

During the year we refined our assessment 
of the risks and opportunities posed by 
climate change and how they might impact 
our business. We considered the transitional 
and physical climate risks and opportunities 
presented by rising temperatures, climate 
related policy and emerging technologies. 
We agreed the methodology for assessing 
and quantifying financial impacts. For the 
purposes of our assessment, the time 
horizons we used were as follows:

•  Short term: 0–5 years
•  Medium to long term: 5 years + 

In each case, the likely impact on costs or 
revenues was assessed. We have assessed 
how the risks can be better managed, 
reduced or mitigated in line with the Group’s 
risk management framework and business 
strategy. The risks identified during our 
analysis are more likely to present 
themselves in the medium or long term. 

Having assessed and modelled the risks, we 
believe that there is no immediate material 
financial risk or threat to our business model. 
Even though there is uncertainty around the 
time horizon over which climate risks will 
materialise, stakeholder expectations and 
regulatory attention could develop at pace, 
impacting the rate at which the business 
may need to cut carbon emissions. 

We recognise that we will need to keep 
abreast of future climate change legislation 
as well as consumer preferences and 
retailers’ ability to adapt. However, we have 
a strong track record of quickly evolving.

The results of our scenario analysis inform 
our long-term strategic business planning 
and are overseen by the Corporate 
Responsibility Committee.

Climate related scenario analysis
To further understand and explore how potential climate risks and opportunities could evolve and impact our business over the medium 
to longer term, the TCFD recommends undertaking climate scenario analysis, which includes a ‘2°C or lower scenario’ in line with the  
2015 Paris Agreement. 

We examined three climate scenarios against two timeframes for the purposes of our analysis. The three scenarios we considered were 
as follows: 

Scenario

Description

Disorderly transition

Rapid change in policy and legislation to encourage businesses to rapidly achieve reductions and avoid 
climate change – UK takes immediate and substantial action – governments make dramatic policy 
interventions to make up for a late start.

Orderly transition

Hot house world

Additional policy and legislation introduced to limit climate change – UK does not take immediate and 
substantial action – gradual and deliberate shift towards a low carbon economy.

Business as usual – no change in climate policy and legislation – UK takes limited or no action – continuation 
of current projection of carbon emissions without any significant abatement or mitigation.

Impact

Mitigation/response

Financial impact

Inherent likelihood

Physical risk: Increased frequency/severity of extreme weather and climate related natural disasters

•  Offices closed.
•  Data centre disruption.
•  Customers cannot open their showrooms. 

•  Weather has the potential to disrupt the 
supply chain and limit vehicles entering 
the UK car parc.

•  Costs – increased operational costs such 
as heating/aircon, insurance, cloud costs.

All technology infrastructure is cloud based.  
Disaster recovery/business continuity planning  
in place, including tools and guidance to support our 
people in emergency situations. COVID-19 proved the 
sales process can be completed without physical 
showrooms, plus development of digital retailing will 
enable all retailers to compete on our digital marketplace.

We have experienced the impact of disrupted supply 
chains as a result of recent external catastrophic  
and geo-political events. These significant supply  
side challenges have constrained new and used car 
transactions for much of the past three years. However, 
our business has remained healthy as market dynamics 
have adjusted and OEMs and retailers learnt to adapt 
their business models. We would anticipate weather 
related disruption to be more intermittent and 
comparatively less severe than the disruption caused  
by recent events.

In order to have a significant impact on our business, 
costs would need to increase significantly. We are 
continually reviewing our cost base such that any 
increases can be managed and profit margins retained.

Transition risk: Increased regulation relating to climate change

•  Regulation banning the sale of new internal 
combustion engine (‘ICE’) vehicles from 2030 
is existing UK regulation that the industry is 
already working towards.

•  Increased regulatory scrutiny and 

introduction of new legislation could  
result in increased reputational risk  
but also increased compliance costs. 
Failure to deliver against our 
environmental commitments would 
undermine our reputation as a responsible 
business and may result in loss of revenue, 
legal exposure or regulatory sanctions.

We already closely monitor the implementation of policies 
relating to our core business. We will continue to monitor 
policies with a view to identifying potential risks and 
opportunities and related financial impacts. We are already 
evolving our product offering and provision of information 
to support the effectiveness of EVs on our marketplace and 
will continue to meet changing preferences of car buyers.

We have formed a Corporate Responsibility Committee 
to oversee our environmental commitments. We will 
report in line with the TCFD recommendations and report 
progress towards our net zero ambitions against our 
science based targets.

Inherent likelihood

Transition risk: Regulation ramping up of internal combustion engine (‘ICE’) vehicle taxation

•  Cost of ownership increases, making ICE 

vehicles less appealing.

•  Consumers stop buying petrol or diesel 

vehicles, demand switches over to electric. 

•  If EVs remain expensive some consumers 

We will continue with our strategy to adapt our 
marketplace to meet changing preferences of all car 
buyers. It is likely that used car prices will continue to 
move in line with supply and demand dynamics such that 
lower demand will make vehicles more affordable. 

Low/Medium

could be priced out of the market 
presenting a risk to demand. 

Transition risk: Demand for sustainable products & services

•  Risk: Consumers’ preferences shift  

away from ICE vehicles; steep decline  
in purchase of petrol or diesel vehicles  
in favour of EVs.

•  Opportunity: Help our audience to find the 

sustainable options they are seeking.

We will continue with our strategy to adapt our marketplace 
to meet changing preferences of all car buyers and 
continue to be the largest marketplace for EVs.

Low/Medium

Transition risk: Increased reputational risk associated with the automotive industry and misrepresenting environmental claims

•  As consumer consciousness around climate 
change rises, there is increased scrutiny  
on our industry’s role on the environment. 

•  Failure to appropriately demonstrate  

that as a business we are committed and 
moving towards net zero carbon emissions 
could negatively impact our brand and also 
impact our ability to operate and/or remain 
relevant to our customers and consumers. 

As part of our goal to be net zero by 2040 we will focus  
not only on our own operational footprint but also on  
how we can positively support our industry. We have  
set clear reduction targets for our own operations and 
report progress to stakeholders. We work with customers, 
suppliers and the industry on education and policy.

Low

Transition risk: Achieving resource efficiency through cutting our carbon footprint and improving energy efficiency

•  Reduced costs associated with energy  

use and avoid increased costs associated 
with carbon taxation.

Reduction initiatives to reduce our absolute carbon 
usage, including moving our technology infrastructure  
to the cloud.

Medium

Transition risk: Increase in towns and cities introducing pedestrian zones/Ultra Low Emission Zones (‘ULEZs’) supported  
by government scrappage schemes and/or improvements in public transport

•  Risk: Consumers stop buying ICE vehicles 

as they no longer require a vehicle.

•  Opportunity: Consumers’ desire/need  

to switch to EV.

Likely the risk and opportunity would be taken together, 
and stock/demand would be maintained as the desire  
for personal transportation/vehicle ownership remains 
strong. We will continue with our strategy to adapt our 
marketplace to meet changing preferences for all car 
buyers and continue to be the largest marketplace for EVs.

 Minor 

  Moderate 

  Major

Low/Medium

We intend to periodically review the scenarios and timeframes we choose to apply in our analysis and refine them as needed.  
The risk management recommendations arising from our climate change scenario analysis were:

•  Policy/regulation: it is likely that increased policy and regulation will have the most significant financial impact on Auto Trader over 

the longer term. The most significant action we can take is to reduce our exposure to this risk and continue with our strategy to adapt 
our marketplace to meet the changing preferences of all car buyers. We also need to make sure we continue to remain abreast of 
regulatory requirements to ensure we are compliant with all relevant reporting obligations.

•  Market: climate change is expected to impact the supply and demand for ICE vehicles and EVs. Auto Trader can mitigate this risk by 

continuing to develop its strategy to be the destination of choice for consumers searching for a more environmentally friendly vehicle.

TCFD: Metrics and targets
Methodology
The Group is required to measure and  
report its direct and indirect greenhouse  
gas (‘GHG’) emissions by the Companies 
(Directors’ Report) and Limited Liability 
Partnerships (Energy and Carbon Report) 
Regulations 2018. The GHG reporting period 
is aligned to the financial reporting year.  
The methodology used to calculate emissions 
is based on the financial consolidation 
approach, as defined in the Greenhouse  
Gas Protocol, A Corporate Accounting  
and Reporting Standard (Revised Edition). 
Emission factors used are from the UK 
Government’s Department for Business, 
Energy and Industrial Strategy (‘BEIS’) 
conversion guidance for the year reported. 

We have calculated our footprint using the 
official UK Government conversion factors. 
For general procurement categories,  
an Environmentally Extended Input Output 
database methodology was used to 
calculate the GHG footprint across total 
spend in the year. For vehicle purchases,  
a bottom-up, life cycle assessment-based 
approach has been used.

We have approximated and rounded up 
where necessary, reflecting this is a ‘scoping 
exercise’ to indicate the broad quantum of 
emissions rather than a precise calculation. 
The accuracy of our footprint will get better 
each year as we revisit and refine the 
methodology and underlying dataset.  
We have reported our Scope 2 emissions 
using both a location based and market 
based approach, with the latter taking into 
account renewable energy consumed.

Independent verification  
of our GHG emissions 
EcoAct has independently assessed  
and verified Auto Trader’s GHG emissions 
following verification standard ISO 14064-
3:2019. Based on the data and information 
provided by Auto Trader and the processes 
and procedures followed, nothing has come to 
EcoAct’s attention to indicate that the GHG 
emissions totals for all years reported are not 
fairly stated and free from material error.

Rebasing of our calculations
During the year we acquired Autorama  
and we have therefore undertaken work to 
calculate their emissions and include them 
within our base year (2019/20) and every year 
thereafter. We have also undertaken work  
to identify more accurate data in relation  
to our suppliers and include this in our 
calculations. The data resulted in a change 
of more than 5% in our emissions and so we 
have recalculated our base year and every 
year thereafter using the updated data. 

We have disclosed our rebased base  
year, prior year and current year to take  
into account these changes and will be 
updating our climate targets accordingly.

TCFD: Risk management
The Board is collectively responsible for 
determining the nature and extent of the 
principal risks which may impact the business 
as it seeks to achieve its strategic objectives. 
We recognise climate change as a principal 
risk (see page 51) as it poses a threat to our 
business and supply chain, mainly through 
regulatory changes. We have updated our 
risk management process to enhance our 
assessment of the potential implications  
of climate change on our business and its 
operations. Our risk management framework, 
including the processes for identifying, 
assessing and managing risk, is described  
on pages 48 and 49.

Our pathway to net zero

Overview

We want to minimise our impact on the environment, thereby protecting 
our business from the impact of climate change. Our strategy is to put 
the brakes on carbon, not only across our own operations and supply 

chain, but also using our capabilities and voice to influence the 
automotive industry to support others in the transition to a low  
carbon economy and take urgent action to tackle climate change. 

1. Our net zero commitment
In June 2021, we signed up to the Science Based 
Targets initiative (‘SBTi’) Business Ambition for 
1.5°C. By doing so, we are committed to achieving 
net zero before 2050 and to reducing emissions  
in line with the Paris Agreement goals. Net zero 
refers to the balance between the amount of 
greenhouse gas produced and the amount 
removed from the atmosphere. We reach net zero 
when the amount we add is no more than the 
amount taken away. Our near and long-term net 
zero targets have both been approved by the SBTi.

We have committed to reach net zero greenhouse 
gas emissions across our value chain by 2040, 
committing to:
•  Reduce absolute Scope 1 and 2 GHG emissions 
by 50% before 2030 from a 2020 base year. 
•  Reduce absolute Scope 3 GHG emissions  

by 46.2% over the same timeframe.

•  Reduce absolute Scope 1, 2 and 3 GHG emissions 

90% by 2040 from a 2020 base year.

How we’re taking action
To meet the SBTi’s definition of net zero, we need  
to reduce our emissions by at least 90% and then 
use carbon removal initiatives to neutralise any 
limited emissions that cannot yet be eliminated.  
It is therefore essential that we fully understand 
the source of our emissions and undertake 

targeted actions. The make up of our carbon 
emissions is heavily weighted towards Scope 3, 
and within that, purchased goods and services and 
use of sold goods are the biggest contributors. 
During the year, our GHG emissions totalled 
79.5ktCO2. Whilst this represents a significant 
reduction from our restated 2020 baseline year 
(2020: 356.5k CO2e), it was principally due to a 
reduction and mix of vehicles passing through 
Autorama’s balance sheet. Further work is 
required to understand the emissions associated 
with these vehicles. In respect of our other 
emissions, we have a committed climate action 
plan and our targets and progress are set  
out below:

Developing the first ever 
industry-specific Carbon 
Literacy Toolkit

Developed in partnership with the Carbon 
Literacy Trust, the toolkit is the first of its 
kind, being carefully designed in close 
collaboration with leading retailers and 
manufacturers, including: Nissan, Marshall 
Motor Group, Lookers, Motorpoint, 
AvailableCar and SYNETIQ.

Available for any organisation, of any size, 
working within the automotive industry,  
it has been developed with the purpose  
of supporting individuals and businesses  
in their journey towards reducing their 
carbon footprint.

114

organisations have engaged with the 
Carbon Literacy Automotive Toolkit training 
during the year

Our wealth of data and insight gives us a unique 
view of consumer car buying intentions, and 
particularly consumer EV buying intentions.  
This data forms the basis of our ‘Road to 2030’ 
Reports, which are extremely valuable to not  
only the government, but also to media and  
the industries involved in the transition to EVs.  
The Report is widely reported in national press  
and is regularly presented at key industry events. 

2. Supporting the automotive industry
Our aim is to support the industry in the transition 
to the mass adoption of electric vehicles (‘EVs’).

The automotive industry is under enormous 
pressure to reduce its carbon emissions and whilst 
many manufacturers and retailers have bold 
commitments to reduce emissions, many are still 
very early on in their sustainability journeys and are 
actively seeking support to help them develop a 
carbon reduction plan. Therefore, our partnership 
with the Carbon Literacy Trust, and the resulting 
Automotive Carbon Literacy Toolkit we created,  
has been well received. 114 organisations have now 
completed the training (as at 31 March 2023) which 
many see as an important step in their sustainability 
strategy, as well as a key initiative to engage their 
workforces. Once an individual in a business has 
been accredited as ‘carbon literate’, the business  
is then provided with training content and trainer 
manuals that enable them to run their own one-day 
Carbon Literacy training. Over 1,000 people in these 
businesses have now completed the training.

In addition to the training, we launched a new 
sustainability themed series of events where  
we invite businesses to share their sustainability 
journeys, ask questions and share ideas with the 
aim of inspiring action and motivating businesses 
to be more sustainable. We’ve hosted two in the 
year and are planning our third in the autumn.

The production and distribution of electric vehicles 
is also a key part of many businesses’ sustainability 
strategies, so in order for retailers to feel equipped 
to sell these vehicles, we launched a ‘Retailer 
Performance Module’ focusing on EVs.  

We also support the National Franchise Dealership 
Association’s ‘Electric Vehicle Accreditation’ 
scheme; once retailers become accredited, we 
add their badge to their Auto Trader profile and 
adverts on our marketplace, enabling them to 
promote their knowledge to consumers. 

As manufacturers and retailers become more 
focused on their own environmental impacts,  
we felt it was important to start recognising those 
who are leading the way as another way to inspire 
others to do more. We therefore introduced 
sustainability-focused awards at both our Retailer 
Awards and New Car Awards. The categories are 
self-nominated and attracted a high level of entries.

The government’s mandate to ban the sale of new 
petrol and diesel cars by 2030 has created huge 
levels of change in the industry, and a lot needs  
to happen in the coming years to ensure the mass 
adoption of electric vehicles. We regularly meet with 
various government departments to share our data 
and insights to help guide policy required to support 
the mass adoption of EVs. 

CELEBRATING SUSTAINABILITY  
IN THE AUTOMOTIVE INDUSTRY

To celebrate and support the industry’s efforts  
to do business more sustainably, we have 
introduced new sustainability awards at both  
our New Car Awards and Retailer Awards.

Evolving our  
dedicated EV hub

The dedicated EV hub on our marketplace 
makes it easy for consumers to access 
articles and videos on electric vehicles, 
reviews and advice. We also present the 
facts regarding cost of ownership ensuring 
they have all the info they need to make  
the correct purchase decision, for them. 
Cutting through the jargon, we cover all  
of the pertinent topics, including: 

•  Charging at home
•  Charging on the go
•  Range
•  Understanding the jargon
•  Battery life

autotrader.co.uk/cars/electric

23,000

EV adverts appeared on our  
site on average across 2023

3.Supporting consumers
Our aim is to support consumers in making the switch 
to more environmentally friendly vehicles and be the 
number one electric car destination in the UK.

We have increased the coverage and exposure we 
give EVs across all our platforms. On our marketplace, 
we have taken steps to make it easier for car buyers 
to search for EVs, so the filters now reflect the key 
attributes of an EV. Our EV adverts now include 
more information about battery range and charge 
time, which are key to helping consumers to make 
the switch. The number of EV models listed on  
Auto Trader has grown from 84 to 129 in the year 
and over 23,000 adverts appeared on our site  
on average across the last year.

We launched an EV hub on site which has new 
content and tools added to it all the time, so 
consumers can get the information they need to 
decide whether an EV is right for them, right now. 

The team have published more than 110 
electric-themed editorial reviews, news, help  
and advice articles on site (2022: 91). Across our 
tracked electric keyword set as a whole, including 
consumer FAQs, our share of voice grew from 27% 
to 33%. As part of this we grew our electric make 
model terms share of voice by 11% over the year, 
giving us the third highest market share in this area.

EVs have been a key marketing focus in the year, 
with new partnerships formed and campaigns 
launched. The EV monthly giveaway continued 
and achieved over 3.5 million entries,and we 
achieved a Guinness World Record which saw the 
team host the largest online quiz to promote EVs. 
We developed ‘Electric Sceptics’, our first original 
social content series with full marketing mix 
support, and signed a three-year partnership with 
Green TV to build association with EVs, both with 
consumers through their World EV Day and EV Live 
events and with the industry at the EV Summit. 

SUPPORTING WOMEN AND NEW AUDIENCES  
IN MAKING THE SWITCH TO EVS

Our research shows that women are more likely to 
say they don’t like the car buying process and they 
don’t feel confident in buying a car. They are also 
less likely to consider buying an electric vehicle.  
So we are actively trying to change this by 
engaging the media that influence women and 
changing the conversation so that women feel 
more empowered about buying their next car,  
be that electric or otherwise.

1. BOARD RESPONSIBILITY

Material ESG topics discussed by the Board include diversity and  
inclusion, employee engagement and talent development. The Corporate 
Responsibility Committee is responsible for holding the Executive Directors 
to account and on a quarterly basis our people scorecard is reviewed  
and progress against our cultural KPIs is monitored. The Board plays an 
important role in ensuring our culture is aligned with our long-term strategy.

2. EXECUTIVE RESPONSIBILITY

The responsibility for assessing and managing our people and culture 
sits at both Executive and Board level. Our Executive Directors have 
responsibility for oversight of our diversity and inclusion agenda and 
are responsible for ensuring that our values are embedded into all parts 
of our business. 

3. OPERATIONAL LEADERSHIP TEAM

Our Operational Leadership Team (‘OLT’) is responsible for driving  
our culture that is values-led, customer-centric and data driven, 
underpinned by a diverse and inclusive team. Having a progressive  
culture and environment, ensuring the attraction, development and 
retention of a talented, engaged and diverse workforce.

4. REMUNERATION COMMITTEE

The Committee introduced diversity related metrics into the Performance 
Share Plan (‘PSP’) for the 2021 PSP award, and introduced an underpin for 
the 2022 PSP award. For the 2023 PSP award performance will again be 
measured against our diversity ambitions as part of an underpin rather 
than as a standalone measure.

5. EMPLOYEE GUILDS & NETWORKS

Our employees play a fundamental role in the success of our ESG strategy. 
Through our thriving networks and guilds, our ESG priorities and ambitions 
are championed and driven forward by our employees. See page 42 for 
more information about our networks. These networks feed into a wider 
Diversity and Inclusion Guild which oversees the various networks to ensure 
they drive real change across our organisation. 

Our Board Engagement Guild is the primary mechanism for our Board  
to engage with our employees and meetings are not attended by the 
Executive Directors. Employees are able to share their experiences and 
views, as well as providing the opportunity for them to ask questions 
directly of Non-Executive Directors. The Board Engagement Guild has 
representatives from across different parts of the business and canvasses 
views and opinions from their colleagues to share with the Board.  

6. THIRD-PARTY CHARTERS & ACCREDITATIONS

We have signed up to various third-party charters and have received a 
number of accreditations, most notably: 

•   Race at Work Charter.
•   Change the Race Ratio.
•   Disability Confident Leader.
•   Social Mobility Top 75. 
•   Inclusive Companies.

Engaging our employees
We welcome open and honest feedback 
from our employees and surveys are 
conducted on a regular basis. We aim  
to understand job satisfaction, measure 
opinion and find where changes may be 
necessary. Summary results are made 
available and feedback acted upon by 
management, which is then presented  
to the Board. In our most recent survey  
we were pleased that 91% (2022: 95%)  
of our employees agreed or strongly 
agreed with the statement “I am proud  
to work for Auto Trader”, a measure which 
we view as a proxy for engagement.1 

Wellbeing and safety  
of our employees
We are committed to supporting our 
employees in all aspects of their health  
and wellbeing. We provide a comprehensive 
range of healthcare benefits as well as 
access to tools and education, mental 
health support and supportive pathways  
to empower our employees to have more 
good days. We have tools to support 
employees with their financial wellbeing  
and all employees can join the Group’s  
Save As You Earn Scheme, with 68% (2022: 
66%) of eligible employees participating in 
one of the current schemes. A Group personal 
pension plan is offered to all employees, 
under which they can contribute between  
3% and 5% (or higher) of their salary and  
Auto Trader contributes between 5% and 7%.

We are committed to creating a safe space 
for our colleagues in the office environment. 

Our principal objective is to prevent or 
minimise accidents, injury and ill health to 
staff working at our premises or remotely. 
This includes contractors, and others,  
who work at, or visit our premises. We have  
a fully compliant Health and Safety Policy 
and appropriate insurance for all employees.  
We can report that we have had no fatalities 
or serious injuries during the year, and there 
was no impact to our operations due to 
work-related incidents or work-related 
occupational disease. 

Following the introduction of our Connected 
Working approach, which offers all 
employees greater flexibility in where and 
when they work, a programme of ergonomic 
assessments was carried out to review and 
ensure effective and safe homeworking 
environments. This approach allows people 
to stay connected with their team and the 
wider Auto Trader community and maintains 
our collaborative culture. 

1. 

 The employee engagement score excludes employees of Autorama. Autorama currently conduct their own survey with a different question set. In their March 2023 survey, 
Autorama employees were asked to rate the question “How likely is it you would recommend Vanarama as a place to work?” Answers were given on a 10-point scale,  
10 representing highly recommend. The survey had a 71% response rate and 62% responded 9 or above.

Investing in and supporting our talent 
Our ambition is to make sure that everyone’s 
career is supported by learning opportunities, 
including self-learning, mentoring, coaching 
and formal programmes. We pride 
ourselves on having a community focused 
on development where everyone can be 
successful. Despite challenging times we 
still retain a strong level of retention and 
employee engagement. Our attrition rate 
remains low at 11% (2022: 11%) when compared 
to industry and national averages.

Our learning academy platform provides  
a range of opportunities to support  
careers at Auto Trader and during the year 
100% of our employees (including part-time  
and contractors) were offered training.  
We also provide sponsorship for professional 
qualifications and access to continuing 
professional development for our people. 
Mandatory training covers our compliance 
essentials to ensure compliance with our 
legislative and regulatory requirements.  
Our non-mandatory training covers a broad 
range of learning and development, including 
awareness, technical skills and soft skills.  
Our mentoring and coaching programmes are 
available to all employees. We currently have 
five colleagues qualified as coaches, with 
two more working towards their qualification, 
to build internal coaching capability.

Gender and ethnicity pay gap
We released our third combined Gender 
and Ethnicity Pay Gap Report 2022 
(published in November 2022, reporting the 
pay gap as at 5 April 2022). This year we 
joined forces with other FTSE 100 companies 
to encourage more companies to report 
and to campaign to make ethnicity pay gap 
reporting mandatory in the same way that 
it is for gender. Please see our website,  
plc.autotrader.co.uk, for more information.

We continue to make progress in reducing 
our gender pay gap. Our mean gender pay 
gap decreased by 0.3% (2021: 2.7% decrease), 
however, our median pay gap increased  
by 0.4% (2021: 0.7% decrease). During the 
reporting period, we performed well in 
retaining women in our upper quartiles  
(25% women leavers compared to 57% for 
men), and of the 136 new hires included in 
the report, 43% were women (2021: 81 new 
starters, 42% women). We believe that hiring 
women early on in their careers and 
progressing them through the business, 
taking into consideration the fact that 
women are greatly underrepresented  
in both the technology and automotive 
sectors, is the most sustainable way to 
reduce the pay gaps in the long term. 
Between April 2021 and March 2022, we were 
pleased to see that women accounted for 
41% of all promotions, and we continue  
to strive to increase this further.

During the reporting period, the mean and 
median ethnicity pay gaps have decreased 
by 0.8% and 1.2% respectively (2021: increased 
by 2.7% and 0.7% respectively). The main 
drivers include the retention of ethnically 
diverse colleagues in the upper quartiles 
while also hiring new talent across the 

business. The highest representation for 
ethnically diverse colleagues is still in the 
lower quartile pay bands, mainly driven  
by our early careers intake. 33% (2021: 31%)  
of early career hires during the reporting 
period were ethnically diverse.

At a Board level, over half of our Board are women, exceeding the FTSE Women Leaders Review recommendation, which has a target  
of 40% women’s representation. We also satisfied the recommendation of the Parker Review that at least one Director should be from

Diversity and inclusion
We define diversity as any classification  
that can be used to differentiate groups  
or individuals from one another, including: 
gender; sex; age; sexual orientation; 
disability & neurodiversity; race and ethnic 
origin; religion & faith; marital status; and 
social/educational background and way  
of thinking. We define inclusion as a state  
of being valued, respected and supported  
for who you are. We, and our people, strongly 
believe in pursuing this aim authentically and 
systemically, expecting to see improvements 
in metrics, but not being driven by them.  
We are committed to driving long-term change 
in both the technology and automotive 
industries. Our focus is on developing diverse 
leaders as well as representative workforces 
in these industries. We invest heavily in our 
early careers programmes, as well as supporting 
several initiatives and partnerships, including 
DigitalHer with Manchester Digital, AUTO30% 
and our STEM Ambassador Programme. 

Driving our D&I strategy through our internal networks 

We have a number of internal networks that support and align 
with our diversity and inclusion strategy. These employee-
driven networks and their leaders are a core part of our culture, 
helping to welcome employees when they join our 

organisation, empowering team members to thrive and 
spearheading outreach programmes that support our local 
communities. Everyone at Auto Trader is encouraged to join 
one of our employee-driven networks. 

Our Ethnicity Network is a well-established group 
of Black, Asian and minority ethnic colleagues,  
and allies, that works to tackle inequalities and 
celebrate inclusivity.

Our LGBT+ Network representation is currently 9.1%1 
(2022: 8.3%) and the network has continued to support 
our colleagues and connect with local LGBT+ charities, 
including The Proud Trust and the George House Trust.

Our Women’s Network is focused on improving and 
evolving representation of women at all levels in  
Auto Trader, the automotive industry and the digital 
communities within which we operate, by recruiting, 
retaining and developing female talent. 

Our Disability & Neurodiversity Network continues to 
create a more accessible and inclusive environment  
for our colleagues. 13.5%1 (2022: 12.8%) of our colleagues 
have disclosed a disability or neurodiverse condition. 
The network partners with various charities including 
Leonard Cheshire, the Royal National Institute for  
Deaf People and the Business Disability Forum to 
educate colleagues and raise awareness.

The Career Kickstart Network brings together 
colleagues from across the business to learn  
and grow together through shared experiences, 
resources and discussion.

Our Age Network was launched last year and 
focuses on creating an inclusive environment for 
the multigenerational workforce of Auto Trader.

Supporting parents and carers across our business, 
our Family Network works closely with our other 
networks, our People team and with charities such  
as Carers UK.

Our Social Mobility Network is focused on 
understanding how socio-economic background  
can influence individuals in the workplace and working 
to remove barriers and open opportunities. Auto Trader 
has signed the Social Mobility Pledge, committing to 
putting social mobility at the heart of what we do.

Promoting diversity in the workplace

We want to build a diverse and 
inclusive workplace where every one 
of us can be our best and true selves; 
only with a mix of different ideas  
and perspectives can we come  
up with the most exciting new ideas 
and create the best experience for 
our customers and consumers.

We have a number of internal 
networks that support and align with 
our diversity and inclusion strategy.  

Everyone at Auto Trader is 
encouraged to join one of our 
employee-driven networks.  
These networks and their leaders 
are a core part of our culture,  
helping to welcome employees 
when they join our organisation, 
empowering team members to 
thrive and spearheading outreach 
programmes that support our  
local communities. 

Forever Manchester

The Auto Trader Community Fund, 
powered by the charity Forever 
Manchester, considers applications 
and awards up to £1,000 aimed  
at supporting grassroots projects 
across Greater Manchester,  
and in London.

During the year we celebrated the 
sixth anniversary of the Auto Trader 
Community Fund at Forever 
Manchester that provides support 
for a wide range of volunteer-led 
community projects across 
Greater Manchester. 

Our representation of women at a total 
company level increased from 40% to 43%. 
During the year, the percentage of women 
on our Operational Leadership Team  
(‘OLT’) increased from 44% to 56%. We also 
increased the percentage of women in 
leadership roles to 40% as at 31 March 2023 
(March 2022: 38%), as defined by the FTSE 
Women Leaders Review (formerly the 
Hampton-Alexander review). 

To increase our representation across all 
levels of the organisation, we aim to stimulate 
the flow of diverse talent from early careers 
through to senior leadership by both targeted 
development programmes and equipping 
our leaders to get the very best out of 
everyone on their team and support their 
development through the organisation.  
Our Continuous Leadership Development 
programme, made up of a range of training 
interventions, supports our senior leaders 
and people managers. We have also 
continued with our Diverse Talent Accelerator 
programme designed to support the 
progression of mid-career colleagues.

Making a difference to our 
communities and the industries 
we operate in
Community-minded is one of the values that 
shapes our culture and we are committed  
to making a difference and having a positive 
impact on the communities we operate in. 
Our Make a Difference Guild is committed  
to empowering our employees to support  
our local communities and national charities. 
During the year we continued our partnership 
with Forever Manchester to operate the  
Auto Trader Community Fund that provides 
support for community projects across 
Greater Manchester. We also launched  
a new ‘Your Community Fund’ available  
to all employees to nominate charities  
close to their hearts and local communities.  
We continue to work closely with our charity 
partner in London and support and promote 
all Disasters Emergency Committee (‘DEC’)
appeals. We operate in both the automotive 
and technology industries. BEN is a key 
charity supporting the automotive industry 
with the aim to offer life changing support 
which empowers people to take control of 
their mental and physical health. As with all 
charities, BEN was heavily impacted by the 
pandemic, making it even more important 
that we continue to support them.

Our governance  
& compliance

Uphold the values of good corporate 
governance and risk management and 
consider the needs of all our stakeholders 
in our strategic decision-making.

Comply with our legal and regulatory 
obligations and behave ethically and  
with integrity at all times.

Maintain a trusted marketplace for  
our customers and consumers to find,  
buy and sell vehicles.

Overview
To ensure that high standards are 
embedded across the business and form 
part of our culture, we have a compliance 
framework in place, consisting of policies, 
processes, guidance and training focused 
on a number of core compliance topics. 
Details of our Board governance framework 
and policies can be found in the Governance 
section (page 58 onwards).

As an online marketplace, cyber security and 
protecting customer and consumer data are 
primary areas of focus. They are fundamental 
to our future success and to build trust with 
our customers and consumers. As we shift to 
an accelerated adoption of digital retailing  
it is paramount that our cyber and data 
security and infrastructure evolve with our 
business priorities. 

Cyber security
Attempts to breach our systems to access 
our data and the threat of an unauthorised 
malicious attack on our systems pose a 
significant and perpetual threat. The nature 
of cyber-attacks has continued to evolve  
and changes in ways of working have 
created more opportunities for cyber 
criminals, increasing in both frequency  
and sophistication. A successful breach 
could lead to significant impairment of our 
reputation with customers and regulators 
and could be costly in terms of fraud losses, 
regulatory sanction or remediation activity – 
one of our viability scenarios reflects the risk 
of a data breach (see page 57). 

Whilst cyber security risks cannot be fully 
mitigated, having an effective cyber security 
risk and governance framework can help  
to significantly reduce the impact of such 
events. We have a security programme in 
place that covers both our corporate systems 
and the Auto Trader platform which includes 
a defined security governance framework, 
overseen by our Chief Technology Officer. 

NIST Cybersecurity Framework
We have adopted the NIST Cybersecurity 
Framework (‘NIST CSF’) to help us understand 
and define our existing policies, processes 
and technical measures in place with the aim 
to better govern our cyber security position.  
It enables us to identify areas of improvement 
and focus our efforts by agreeing and setting 
a target state, with the understanding that 
the NIST CSF is designed to complement  
and enhance existing business and cyber 
security operations. 

Internal Audit function
We operate a rolling internal audit programme 
(outsourced to a third party) which includes 
annual reviews of cyber security. As part  
of this programme, a review of our NIST 
Framework has been carried out to validate 
the status and perform an operating 
effectiveness review, the purpose of which 
is to provide confidence that the framework 
is robust, appropriate and effective.

responding to a cyber incident are robust 
and fit for purpose.

•  All aspects of our applications are designed 

and deployed with security in mind so  
that Auto Trader can deliver a secure and 
trusted platform for our customers.

Protecting our customer  
and consumer data 
Data is at the heart of everything we do and 
data compliance and protection is therefore 
of critical importance to Auto Trader.  
We operate a structured framework which 
supports us in meeting our compliance 
obligations, the expectations of customers 
and clients, fulfil privacy rights and mitigate 
the risks of a data breach. We comply with the 
Data Protection Act 2018 (‘DPA 2018’), and the 
UK General Data Protection Regulation (‘UK 
GDPR’) as our benchmark for data protection. 

When it comes to collecting and storing 
personal data, be that for consumers, 
customers or our employees, we have  
a comprehensive set of policies which 
reflect the applicable privacy legislation 
and abide by a clear set of principles.  
We act as data processor for our customers 
and a data controller for the personal  
data of our people.  

We are committed to ensuring that the 
personal information we collect is used for 
the appropriate purpose, which does not 
constitute an invasion of privacy and is held 
securely, responsibly and transparently in 
accordance with our privacy notices which 
govern all our platforms and subsidiaries.

To ensure we are meeting our compliance 
obligations we have a dedicated team  
that is responsible for data privacy, data 
breach prevention and reporting, policy 
compliance, record keeping and data 
subject rights. We have an assurance 
framework in place to monitor compliance 
with data privacy laws and to ensure any 
breaches are dealt with in a robust manner. 

We hold GDPR Steering meetings bimonthly, 
attended by data owners from all business 
areas. The meeting is a central point of 
communication and coordination and 
provides guidance on the governance  
of our data strategy and ongoing 
compliance with relevant data security  
and privacy regulations.

Being a responsible business continued

All Auto Trader employees, including 
part-time employees, contractors and all 
Board members, are required to complete 
annual data privacy and security training and 
we have established processes to cover all 
aspects of the GDPR: Data Protection Impact 
Assessments (‘DPIAs’). These are conducted 
to help identify and minimise any data 
protection risks for new or changed products 
or services; and all processes are recorded 
and records of processing activity (‘ROPAs’) 
are reviewed quarterly by data owners. These 
include the lawful basis for processing and 
data retention periods; our privacy notices 
are reviewed and updated regularly. We have 
separate notices for consumers, employees 
and retailers; and we have processes in place 
to respond to Subject Access Requests (‘SAR’) 
and Erasure requests. 

Where required, Auto Trader obtains consent 
from consumers to gather personal data to 
service their enquiries for products, services 
or vehicles advertised on the site. Explicit 
consent (gathered separately) is also obtained 
to contact consumers for marketing purposes. 
Where we pass personal data to third-party 
service providers contracted to Auto Trader  
in the course of dealing with customers or 
employees, we carefully vet any third parties 
that we share data with, and they are obliged 
to keep it securely, and use it only to fulfil the 
service they provide on our behalf. 

We record all instances of data loss and 
have a rigorous incident management 
process in the unlikely event a breach 
occurs. This includes reporting notifiable 
breaches to the relevant regulatory 
authorities without undue delay and within 
stipulated deadlines. Where required we 
take remedial action as soon as possible.

Maintaining a trusted marketplace 
As a leading online marketplace, we strive to provide a  
marketplace that is relevant, reliable and fair. It is important  
to our customers and our consumer audience that adverts 
displayed on Auto Trader are accurate and genuine. Our goal  
is also to provide a valuable service for our customers and 
consumers and provide an engaging user experience.

Retailer feedback
We actively seek retailer feedback  
in all aspects of product and service 
development to ensure that we continue  
to provide market-leading solutions and 
support to our retailer partners. We also 
actively monitor consumer sentiment 
across our various products and channels, 
and our teams review thousands of items 
of feedback a week.

Product research and testing
When we bring a product to market, we go 
through a rigorous process of discovery 
to ensure solutions meet the varied  
needs of both our retailer partners and 
consumers. Retailers are involved at all 
stages of product development, including 
beta testing prior to scaling solutions. 

Sentiment tracking
We survey retailers on a monthly basis 
through marketing channels to capture 
structured feedback on our relationship 
with retailers to ensure we’re meeting their 
needs and gauge sentiment towards our 
brand. This ensures we can keep an eye on 
overall satisfaction, value for money and 
the partnership we aim to foster.

Voice of the customer
We actively monitor feedback which our 
Retailer Development and Support teams 
capture from retailers during the course of 
the thousands of inbound and outbound 
calls we field per week, ensuring we keep  
a good gauge on retailer sentiment and 
can react to market challenges facing our 
retailers quickly.

Consumer sentiment
We’ve maintained extremely positive 
feedback scores across external review 
platforms including Trustpilot (4.7/5 based 
on 80,453 reviews), iOS App Store (4.8/5 
based on 165,159 reviews) and Android Play 
Store (4.7/5 based on 67,967 reviews).

TAG verification
We have achieved verification by TAG 
(‘Trustworthy Accountability Group’), 
achieving the Brand Safety Recognition 
seal. TAG is the world’s leading 
programme to fight criminal activity  
and protect brand safety in digital 
advertising. They have established best 
in class global standards that protect 
the industry from potentially harmful 
threats around fraud, malware and 
brand safety. Obtaining our TAG status  
is recognition that we meet the high 
standards required by TAG and our 
contribution towards fighting criminal 
activity and increasing trust and 
transparency in digital advertising.

VSTAG forum
We continue to actively participate in  
the Vehicle Safe Trading Advisory Group 
(‘VSTAG’), an industry forum we founded 
over 15 years ago. The forum brings 
together the UK’s leading online 
automotive advertising companies, 
advisors from the Metropolitan Police, 
Get Safe Online and Action Fraud to work 
together to reduce online vehicle crime 
and help protect buyers and sellers of 
pre-owned vehicles from fraud.

FCA compliance
Auto Trader Limited, the main trading subsidiary 
of the Group, is authorised by the FCA for 
consumer credit and insurance intermediary 
activities. Our activities primarily relate to 
providing finance and insurance introductions 
to consumers for third parties, be it retailers 
or commercial partners. We are developing 
and trialling consumer journeys for some  
of our regulated activities as part of the 
business’s wider digital retailing proposition 
using the technology of Blue Owl Limited 
(trading as ‘AutoConvert’), a wholly owned 
subsidiary. AutoConvert became an Authorised 
Representative of Auto Trader Limited in 
2022 in respect of consumer credit activities. 

Autorama UK Limited (trading as ‘Vanarama’), 
acquired in 2022, is authorised by the FCA  
for consumer credit and insurance activities.  
The activities relate to brokering vehicle 
leasing to retail and trade customers and  
we also arrange General Insurance Services 
under the trading name Vanarama Insurance 
Services. We are developing and trialling 
consumer journeys where consumers start 
their journey on Auto Trader and complete an 
onward journey with Vanarama.

We have specialist internal resource within  
our Governance, Risk and Compliance  
team with significant experience of working 
in FCA regulated businesses, and we have 
developed a detailed governance framework 
to ensure that we comply with the principles, 
rules and guidance applicable to our 
activities. We have implemented the Senior 
Managers & Certification Regime, which 
came into effect in December 2019. Senior 
Managers at Auto Trader are Nathan Coe, 
Catherine Faiers, Jamie Warner and Claire 
Baty. Certain members of the Operational 
Leadership Team hold Certified Functions. 
Senior Managers at Vanarama are members 
of the company’s board and other members 
of the Vanarama senior leadership team.  
All of these individuals have been assessed 
and certified as Fit and Proper. All employees 
are subject to the Conduct Rules and have 
received appropriate training and guidance. 
We have a comprehensive suite of policies, 
training and monitoring procedures to ensure 
awareness of and compliance with the 
requirements, including financial promotions, 
product change management, complaint 
handling, vulnerable customers and 
transparency. Our Customer Charter outlines 
our commitment to Treating Customers Fairly. 

We also have in place a comprehensive 
implementation plan in respect of ensuring 
our compliance with the FCA’s forthcoming 
Consumer Duty.

Auto Trader Group plc  Annual Report and Financial Statements 2023

Business ethics and compliance
We have a zero tolerance approach to bribery, 
corruption and other financial crime within  
our business and/or in any dealings with our 
customers, suppliers and other third parties 
who we deal with in the course of our business. 
We require regular compliance training for  
all Auto Trader employees and contractors, 
including all Board members. We have a well 
established online training and awareness 
programme which includes compliance 
modules for information security, GDPR, 
anti-bribery and corruption, the corporate 
criminal offence of facilitating tax evasion, 
anti-money laundering, modern slavery  
and whistleblowing to ensure all employees 
uphold our ethical standards in their  
day-to-day decision-making and actions, 
remain up to date and are alert to unethical 
practices and potential risks to our consumers 
or customers. We do not conduct business 
with any service provider, customer or supplier 
which does not meet the principles of our 
policies with respect to these areas. 

Human rights
We are opposed to all forms of discrimination 
with respect to employment and occupation, 
modern slavery, human trafficking, forced 
or compulsory labour and child labour,  
in our business and our supply chain. We are 
committed to supporting human rights 
through our compliance with national laws 
and through our internal policies which 
adhere to internationally recognised human 
rights principles. In line with our commitment 
to creating a diverse and inclusive culture, 
our internal policies require respect and 
equal and fair treatment of all persons  
we come into contact with. All employees  
are paid in excess of the Real Living Wage, 
ensuring that all employees and contractors 
working in our offices receive at least the 
Living Wage. We are an accredited Living 
Wage Employer. We safeguard our 
employees through a framework of policies 
and statements including Modern Slavery, 
Gender Pay, Flexible Working, Equal 
Opportunities and Inclusion Policies.

Modern slavery 
We are committed to preventing slavery 
and human trafficking in our business  
and supply chains. We require the highest 
standards of honesty and integrity in all our 
business dealings and relationships. We will 
not tolerate the mistreatment of people in 
our employment and, wherever possible, 
employed in our supply chain. During 2023, 
no incidents of modern slavery or human 
rights abuse have been identified in our 
business or supply chain.

Tax transparency
Auto Trader is committed to being a 
responsible taxpayer acting in a transparent 
manner at all times. Our detailed tax policy 
includes further transparency on our approach 
to risk management and governance. In 2023, 
our total tax contribution was £175.4m  
(2022: £143.5m). Taxes borne by the Group 
totalled £69.4m (2022: £63.8m) and consist 
of corporation tax, employer’s NICs and 
stamp duty. Taxes collected by the Group 
totalled £106.0m (2022: £79.7m) and consist 
of PAYE deductions, employees’ NICs and 
net VAT collected.

Supplier ESG engagement 
We hold ourselves and our suppliers to the 
highest standards of behaviour. We want to 
engage suppliers that share our values and 
collaborate with them to build a stronger, 
more responsible supply chain. We have an 
established supplier engagement strategy 
and the information we collect through our 
supplier engagement/onboarding process 
provides us with greater insight into numerous 
aspects of our suppliers’ performance, 
including Environmental, Social and 
Governance practices such as: how they 
are engaging the communities they are 
based in; what charitable activities they 
are undertaking; how they identify and 
improve diversity and inclusion; what 
governance they have in place to ensure 
good practice and limit instances of 
modern slavery, bribery or breaches of 
other relevant legislation; and sustainability. 
As part of our environmental strategy,  
we have expanded our discussions on 
sustainability with our highest spending 
suppliers to deep dive into understanding 
where our suppliers are on their own 
sustainability journey. We have published  
a supplier code of conduct which outlines 
Auto Trader’s stance on important matters 
and our expectations of our suppliers. 

Grievance reporting  
or escalation procedures
We aim to create a working environment  
in which all individuals enjoy coming to  
work, where they can perform at their best, 
and where they are free from discrimination 
or harassment. 

We foster a culture of open and healthy 
conversations, mutual appreciation and 
respect. We treat any behaviour that 
undermines this aim as totally unacceptable 
and it will not be tolerated. We are committed 
to a culture where staff can freely report  
any issue that needs attention and access 
support via the escalation procedures we 
have in place. Our grievance policy sets out 
both informal and formal avenues for 
addressing concerns.

Whistleblowing 
We are committed to carrying out all 
business activities in an honest and open 
manner and strive to apply high ethical 
standards in all our business dealings.  
We actively cultivate a transparent and 
open culture, encouraging our employees

Strategic reportGovernanceFinancial statementsHow we manage risk

 Our risk management arrangements

The Board is collectively responsible for determining the nature and extent of  
the principal risks the Group is willing to take in achieving its strategic objectives.

Risk management and internal control
The Company does not have a separate Risk Committee; instead the 
Board as a whole is collectively accountable for determining the 
nature and extent of the principal risks Auto Trader is willing to take 
in achieving its strategic objectives.  

The Board is also accountable for establishing and maintaining  
the Group’s system of risk management and internal controls.  
It receives regular reports from management identifying and 
evaluating our response to key risks. Our risk management 
framework is described opposite.

Our risk management process
Effective risk management is critical if we are to achieve our strategic 
objectives, to achieve sustainable long-term growth, and ultimately 
to achieve our purpose of Driving Change Together. Responsibly. 

A four-step process is adopted to help us manage our principal  
risks. OLT members are responsible for identifying, assessing, 

mitigating and monitoring risks, and reporting against these risks. 
The Governance, Risk and Compliance function facilitates this process 
and supports the OLT in designing responses to risks, thereby ensuring 
that the response is aligned to the Group’s risk appetite. The risk 
management process can be summarised as follows:

1  Identify risks 

2  Assess and quantify risks 

A top-down and bottom-up approach is used to identify 
principal risks across the business. Whilst the Board has overall 
accountability for the effectiveness of internal control and risk 
management, the day-to-day management of risk is delegated 
to the OLT. Independent support is provided to the OLT by the 
Governance, Risk and Compliance function.

Risks are evaluated to establish the root causes, the impact  
and the likelihood of occurrence. Risks are categorised as:
•  Existential risks, being those which have the potential  

to lead to fundamental change within our organisation  
and wider industry.

•  Operational risks, being those arising out of the existing 

business activities.

•  Emerging risks, being those which relate to new initiatives, 

new products, and new laws and regulations.

RISK 
MANAGEMENT

4  Monitor and review 

3  Respond to, manage and mitigate risks

The OLT is responsible for monitoring the effectiveness of 
controls and mitigating actions, with continuous independent 
challenge provided by the Group’s Governance, Risk and 
Compliance function, and Internal Audit. The Board reviews the 
Group’s risk register and assesses the adequacy of mitigating 
actions to ensure that risks are being managed in a manner 
consistent with our risk appetite.

After identifying the root cause of a risk, owners must consider 
whether the existing mitigations reduce the risk to an acceptable 
level, with this assessment challenged independently by the 
Governance, Risk, and Compliance function. The level of acceptable 
risk is guided by our Group risk appetite. If the residual level of risk 
after mitigation remains above our risk appetite, then further 
mitigating actions are implemented. 

Risk appetite
The Board has considered the nature and extent of the principal risks Auto Trader currently faces, the potential risks we expose 
ourselves to as we proceed with our strategy, and the wider market, economy and business environment. The Board has set its risk 
appetite accordingly, which can be summarised as follows:

Flexible
Auto Trader acknowledges that, in some 
circumstances, fast-paced and innovative 
development of new products within the 
technology space presents significant 
opportunities and taking advantage of these 
opportunities may result in financial loss.  
We consider the opportunities can outweigh  
the downside risks, and therefore, in pursuit of 
our strategic objectives, we are flexible about 
taking risks which relate to product innovation, 
addressing competitive threats, and/or making 
the most of market opportunities.

Cautious
As we pursue our strategic objectives, we must 
remain cognisant of the potential for them to 
have conflicting impacts on our stakeholders, 
including employees, suppliers and third parties, 
and the environment. Owing to the potential for 
these risks to have significant knock-on impacts 
across a wide range of categories, we are cautious 
about taking risks in relation to such areas.

Averse
We are averse to taking risks which conflict with our 
values; risks which could damage our reputation; 
risks which threaten the security of our systems 
and technology; risks leading to a breach of laws, 
regulations or financial covenants; and/or risks 
which could compromise the organisation’s going 
concern status. Across these categories we  
take all reasonable steps to ensure our business 
activities do not give rise to significant risk of 
damage to our stakeholders, and in pursuing our 
strategic objectives we are averse to exposing 
ourselves to higher levels of risk knowingly.

Auto Trader Group plc  Annual Report and Financial Statements 2023

Our risk management framework 
The Group’s principal risks are recorded within a risk register which 
captures details of each risk and the root causes; likelihood of the 
risk occurring; the impact if it does occur; and details of the actions 
being taken to manage the risk. 

The Board considers whether, given the strategy and risk appetite of 
the Group, the mitigations are reducing the risk to an acceptable level.

Driving Change Together. 
Responsibly.

Our risk assessment matrix
The risk landscape has continued to evolve 
over the last 12 months, and we expect 
changes to continue in the coming year.  
Our view in 2023 is that the principal risks to 
Auto Trader are a) those which could result  
in fundamental changes to the automotive 
retail industry, and b) those which could 
prevent us achieving our strategic objectives. 
Accordingly, our strategy is linked intrinsically 
to our principal risks. We have taken great 
strides in the last year to manage these risks. 
Examples include the launch of Deal Builder 
and improvements to our core marketplace 
products. However, to execute our strategy,  
it is crucial we protect ourselves against the 
threats to achieving our strategic objectives.

The following pages provide detail on each  
of our 10 principal risks and how we are 
responding to each risk.

Principal risks and uncertainties

 How we mitigate our principal risks

Identifying, assessing, responding to and monitoring 
the Group’s principal risks.

The Board has carried out a robust assessment of the principal risks 
facing the Group, including those that would threaten its business 
model, future performance, solvency or liquidity. 

The principal risks and uncertainties are detailed in this section. 
Additional risks and uncertainties to the Group, including those that 
are not currently known or that the Group currently deems immaterial, 
may individually or cumulatively also have a material effect on the 
Group’s business, results of operations and/or financial condition.

1   Automotive economy, market and business environment

  Unchanged

Risk and potential impact

Key changes and outlook

How we manage the risk

An adverse change in supply  
and demand in the new/used  
car market could lead to reduced 
retailer profitability and reduced 
retailer wallets, resulting in  
reduced advertising spend.  
Adverse movements in supply  
and demand of vehicles could  
also lead to a contraction in the 
number of retailers. 

In addition, we continue to see  
the movement towards an agency 
model whereby retailers facilitate 
OEM sales directly to consumers. 
This could lead to a loss of revenue 
from our retailer customers.

•  The low level of supply of new vehicles since 2020 has 
continued for much of the last year. However, new car 
registrations in Q1 (January to March) 2023 increased by 18% 
compared to Q1 2022. Looking to the future, more reliable 
supply of new vehicles will be important to the success of 
Autorama’s integration into the Auto Trader Group.

•  The low level of new car supply since 2020 will likely affect 

the availability of used car stock in the coming years.  
In contrast, consumer demand remains high and retailer 
profitability, in the main, remains high. In March 2023,  
used car retail prices increased by 2% year on year,  
being the 36th consecutive month of price growth. 

•  In 2023 some OEMs begin operating an agency model.  

We are aware that each OEM encounters unique challenges  
if they switch to an agency model and we have been working 
with OEMs to develop bespoke solutions. 

•  Overall, the risks posed by changes to the automotive 
economy, market and business environment continue  
to evolve, however metrics and performance indicators 
suggest that we are managing these risks to an acceptable 
level through our strategic actions.

•  We monitor new and used car transactions 
closely, using data from SMMT and DVLA, 
observing behaviour on our marketplace,  
and from engaging closely with our customers 
and consumers.

•  Our agile culture enables us to respond quickly  
to new and emerging threats. We continuously 
develop new products and enhance existing 
products. We are making significant progress 
with our digital retailing strategy which aims  
to bring more of the car buying journey online. 
•  We use our own Auto Trader Retail Price Index  

and valuations data to monitor the pricing trends 
of used cars by trade sellers.

•  We are progressing well with integrating 
Autorama into our business and are now 
leveraging their leasing capabilities. Autorama 
will diversify our business by providing a leasing 
proposition to consumers, as well as helping us  
to achieve our strategy relating to digital retailing 
on new cars.

•  We have also maintained a strong balance sheet, 
and our low leverage should enable us to respond 
in the event of major threats crystallising.

2   Climate change

  Decreasing

Risk and potential impact

Key changes and outlook

How we manage the risk

The automotive industry is intrinsically 
linked to climate change and there  
is increasing pressure from consumers 
and government for the industry  
to reduce its impact on the climate. 
However, failure to deliver on our 
environmental commitments will 
negatively impact our brand as a 
responsible business and may result in 
legal exposure or regulatory sanctions.

Failure to overcome the uncertainty 
created by the shift from internal 
combustion engine (‘ICE’) to electric 
vehicles (‘EVs’) could inhibit their 
take-up, potentially leading to 
changes in buying behaviours. 
Factors include the high purchase 
price of most EVs, potential for 
improvement in public transport,  
new and expanded emissions  
zones, increasing EV running costs, 
and consumer uncertainty over  
the residual value of used EVs.

Changing and more stringent 
regulatory requirements could 
increase our cost base, and 
increased frequency and severity  
of extreme weather events  
could lead to heightened costs, 
including heating/air-conditioning, 
insurance, and cloud infrastructure. 
Extreme weather events could  
also lead to short-term closure  
of retailer forecourts (for example, 
due to flooding).

•  Updates to our website in the last year position us as 

•  We are evolving our product offering and 

front-runners in the switch to EVs and enable us to respond 
to potential changes in OEM and retailer business models.

•  There is still a relatively small amount of data informing  
the residual values of used EVs. We have positioned 
ourselves well by leveraging Autorama’s capabilities, 
providing those consumers switching to EVs for the first 
time a viable alternative to outright purchase. 

•  Despite ongoing uncertainty surrounding EVs, data from 
our website shows the electric share of ad-views has  
a gradual upwards trend. Supply in the used EV market 
increased this year as those EVs purchased on three-  
and four-year agreements enter the used EV market. 
•  Looking ahead, widespread take-up of EVs could be 

affected by: 

 – the availability of public charging for drivers unable  

to access private charging,

 – EV purchase costs, which are still around 37% more 

expensive than ICE equivalents on a like-for-like basis.
 – Increases in EV running costs owing to increased taxation 
and charging costs (especially those EV drivers without 
private charging).

•  Further regulation and legislation are likely, such as the 

introduction of new clean air zones and congestion charges. 

•  At Autorama, some vehicles are pre-registered and held 
temporarily on the balance sheet. Consequently, we 
capture the lifetime emissions of these vehicles when 
calculating the Group’s carbon emissions. This has led  
to a material increase in our reported carbon emissions. 

•  Overall, the risks associated with climate change have 

decreased in the last year owing to the actions we continue 
to take. Nevertheless, looking to the future, the impact  
of climate change means that managing these risks 
effectively remains a key strategic priority. More detail 
about the risks associated with climate change and the 
mitigations is contained on pages 32 and 33.

marketplace to provide consumers with more 
information about EVs. A cross-functional 
working group is focusing on helping consumers 
make more environmentally friendly vehicle 
choices. Our ongoing integration of Autorama 
adds digital retailing and leasing capabilities  
on new cars, including EVs. This places us in an 
optimal position to provide a viable alternative  
to consumers who are anxious about making 
outright purchases. 

•  Our Corporate Responsibility Committee 

oversees our environmental commitments and 
work is ongoing to reduce our carbon emissions 
across all scopes.

•  As part of our climate commitments, we are 

focusing not just on our own carbon footprint,  
but positively supporting the industry. Our 
partnership with the Carbon Literacy Trust,  
for example, provides training and insights  
to employees and external stakeholders.
•  We regularly meet with various government 
departments, including HM Treasury and  
the Department for Transport’s Office for  
Zero Emission Vehicles, to share our data and 
insights to help guide policy around the topic. 

•  The climate records and commitments of suppliers 

is a key factor in our procurement processes.

•  Development and evolution of our digital retailing 
products provides customers and consumers with 
purchasing options should extreme weather events 
lead to short-term retailer forecourt closures.

Risk and potential impact

Key changes and outlook

How we manage the risk

To enable us to achieve our  
strategic objectives it is important  
that we attract, retain and motivate  
a highly skilled workforce, including 
those with specialist skillsets in data 
and technology. 

Delivery of our strategy is also 
dependent on us building a diverse 
and inclusive workforce, and a 
supportive, collaborative culture, 
conducted in a safe environment,  
all of which will enable optimum 
performance from all our employees.

•  Our Glassdoor rating based on anonymous reviews is 4.4 out 
of 5 and in our latest Culture Amp survey, 91% of respondents 
said that they are proud to work at Auto Trader. This year 
our employee turnover has remained low.

•  We now operate a Connected Working model where 

employees are in the office for two ‘fixed’ days per week 
plus an additional ‘flex’ day per week on a day which suits 
them best. The aim of this working model is to increase 
efficiency, collaboration and innovation whilst also 
allowing flexibility and maximising inclusion. 

•  Connected Working also includes a ‘remote first’ policy.  

For periods in July, August, and December, employees can 
work fully remotely to increase flexibility at times when 
there are increased levels of annual leave.

•  The cost of living crisis and skills shortages in the market 
continue to affect workforce costs. We monitor the  
market proactively to ensure that our salaries are fair, 
proportionate and aligned to market rates. In 2022  
we made a cost-of-living payment to all employees  
(except for the OLT and the Board) and increased the  
size of our annual salary review.

•  A values-led culture which is embedded  
throughout the recruitment, induction,  
training and appraisal processes.

•  Long-term incentive plans for senior and key 
staff, including incentives with respect to 
diversity and inclusion and Auto Trader’s 
environmental impact.

•  Regular employee engagement surveys and 

monitoring of Glassdoor ratings. We have regular 
business updates, networks, guilds, and 
all-employee conferences.

•  We continue to monitor the impact Connected 
Working is having on engagement, inclusion, 
employee safety and productivity, with reference 
to both pandemic and pre-pandemic levels.  
Any overseas working during the Remote First 
periods must be reviewed and approved by 
People Operations to ensure the safety of our 
employees, security of our systems and compliance 
with all relevant laws and regulations.

4   Reliance on third parties and partners

  Decreasing

Risk and potential impact

Key changes and outlook

How we manage the risk

To achieve our strategic objectives, 
we are reliant on partners engaging 
with the changes we are introducing 
to the industry. Getting lenders 
on-board with our digital retailing 
aspirations, for example, is a  
key dependency. 

We also rely on third parties to 
support our technology infrastructure, 
supply of data about vehicles and 
their financing, and in the fulfilment 
of some of our revenue generating 
products. Consequently, it is important 
that we manage relationships with, 
and performance of, key suppliers 
and key strategic partners. 

•  We have implemented a refreshed onboarding and 

monitoring process for critical suppliers. Despite the 
threats posed to our suppliers in the external environment, 
we have not experienced any material disruptions in the 
last year. 

•  As we progress further into digital retailing, we are likely  
to see an increased reliance on third parties. Some of  
the products we intend to launch will rely on partners and 
lenders, and these could be barriers to growth should these 
partners not engage with us. Ensuring that we manage  
our relationships with these third parties will be crucial. 
•  Overall, our significant strategic initiatives in relation to 

platform and commercial data represent good progress  
in reducing the level of reliance we have on third parties. 
However, we remain aware of the importance of our 
partners in achieving our aspirations in digital retailing.

•  Where possible, we limit reliance on single 
suppliers to reduce single points of failure.
•  We have identified key suppliers and have  
plans in place to respond to disruption.

•  Contracts and service level agreements are in 

place with all key suppliers. New relationships go 
through a robust procurement and legal review 
process and are subject to regular review.

•  We carry out due diligence on our key suppliers 
and partners at the onset of the relationship  
and throughout the life of these relationships. 
This includes financial viability, resilience and 
alignment with our values and culture.
•  We seek to develop strong commercial 

relationships with our partners and regularly 
explore ways of working together even more 
effectively. We monitor the performance of 
partners and suppliers to ensure continued 
quality and uptime.

5   IT systems and cyber security

  Unchanged

Risk and potential impact

Key changes and outlook

How we manage the risk

As a digital business, we rely on  
our IT infrastructure to provide our 
services. A disruptive cyber security 
and/or business continuity event 
could lead to downtime of our 
systems and infrastructure. 

Execution of our strategy also  
relies on us making appropriate 
investments in secure systems  
and technologies. Failure to invest  
in appropriate technology and 
safeguards could lead to us failing  
to achieve our objectives. 

Delivery of our strategic objectives 
also relies on us using data to provide 
valuable insights to customers.  
A significant data breach, whether 
because of our own failures or a 
malicious cyber-attack, would lead 
to a loss in confidence by the public, 
retailers and advertisers.

•  We have completed a multi-year migration of our applications 
to the cloud. This increases the resilience of our systems and 
the security of our data. 

•  Development of new products carries the threat of cyber-attack 
and with digital retailing the impact of a potential data breach 
is likely to increase. We are therefore developing systems which 
provide not just the best customer and consumer experience, 
but all necessary security to ensure we remain resilient. 

•   Integration of Autorama’s leasing deals onto the Auto Trader 

platform is complex, and we are mindful of IT and cyber 
security threats during the integration. We are also committed 
to continuously reviewing, testing and updating Autorama’s 
IT disaster recovery and business continuity arrangements.

•  Whilst we have used artificial intelligence (‘AI’) for many  

years, the recent emergence of generative AI poses a great 
opportunity for us to enhance our products, customer and 
consumer experience, and to improve efficiency. However,  
it is important we use AI in a manner which does not expose 
us to excessive security, compliance and or reputational risks. 

•    AI could be used by criminals maliciously in future.  

Deepfake technology, for example, increases the risks  
of social engineering against stakeholders. 

•   The cyber security landscape is constantly evolving.  

We continue to make significant investments in safeguarding 
our systems and data, as well as implementing best-in-class 
systems to support the achievement of our strategic objectives.

•  We have a disaster recovery and business 
continuity plan which is regularly reviewed  
and tested.

•  We continuously monitor the availability and 

resilience of processing systems and services. 
The migration to the cloud has improved to the 
efficiency of our systems and improved our ability 
to respond to an incident in a timely manner.
•  We have dedicated security teams, including 

white hat hackers, and carry out regular penetration 
testing of key systems to identify vulnerabilities.
•  All employees are required to undergo IT security 
awareness training on at least an annual basis.
•  We use two-factor authentication for all our car 
retailers and employees to access our network.

•  We have now adopted the National Institute  

of Standards and Technology (‘NIST’) 
Cybersecurity Framework to manage and  
reduce cyber security risks.

•  Our digital retailing teams regularly review  
the IT systems and infrastructure required  
to deliver our strategy.

6    Failure to innovate: disruptive technologies  

and changing consumer behaviours

  Decreasing

Risk and potential impact

Key changes and outlook

How we manage the risk

The automotive industry is changing 
at unprecedented pace. Should we 
fail to innovate our business and 
product offerings, we could lose 
relevance with our key stakeholders, 
including consumers and customers. 
It is crucial that we develop and 
implement new products, services 
and technologies, and adapt to 
changing consumer behaviour 
towards car buying and ownership. 

Failure to provide both customers 
and consumers with the best 
possible products and online  
journey, including an online buying 
experience, could lead to reduced 
website traffic and loss of revenue. 

•  We continue to develop new products in our marketplace, 
platform and digital retailing. In the last year we have 
launched a trial of Deal Builder with a small number of 
retailers. This provides consumers with an omni-channel 
buying journey where they can find, reserve, finance,  
and part exchange online. 

•   Leveraging Autorama’s systems, we launched a leasing 
check-out journey on the Auto Trader website. Providing 
consumers with a leasing option positions us to meet their 
needs as buying behaviours change, particularly those 
consumers wary about buying an EV for the first time. 
•   We have continued to develop our AT Connect solution.  
This online tool leverages our platform and data to  
provide retailers with real-time connections to Auto Trader 
systems which can be used to inform vehicle valuations, 
maintain stock on our website in real-time and access our 
vehicle taxonomy. 

•   Our data has been recognised nationally through the provision 

of our market pricing data to the ONS. We also work with 
government to provide information about EV demand to 
inform potential locations for EV chargers. 

•   Overall, we have continued to manage the risks well over the 
last year and continue to provide new and updated solutions 
to both customers and consumers.

•  Continuous research into changing consumer 

behaviour, regular horizon scanning and 
monitoring of emerging trends, use of external 
resources where needed, and regular contact  
with similar businesses around the world to  
enable peer-to-peer sharing of good practice.

•   An inclusive and diverse workforce enables  
us to maximise creativity and performance, 
leading to innovation.

•   An agile and collaborative culture, as well  
as continuous investment in technology, 
maximises innovation.

•   Dedicated workstreams as part of all our  

strategic priorities. These workstreams are  
aimed at developing the best products to meet  
the needs of the consumer and customer.

Risk and potential impact

Key changes and outlook

How we manage the risk

The Group operates in a complex 
regulatory environment. As we 
progress in executing our strategy, 
we are likely to be exposed to 
increased legal and regulatory  
risks, particularly those relating  
to FCA and GDPR. 

There is a risk that the Group,  
or its subsidiaries, fail to comply with  
legal and regulatory requirements. 
This could lead to reputational 
damage, financial or criminal 
penalties and impact on our ability  
to do business.

•  Providing consumers with an online car buying journey  

•  We have dedicated internal expertise responsible 

will increase our exposure to regulatory risks, in particular 
the amount of personal information we collect and in the 
provision of the online finance application journey. 

for identifying, assessing and responding to 
upcoming changes in laws and regulations, and 
we utilise external specialists where necessary.

•  Integrating Autorama exposes us to increased FCA and 
GDPR risks. This relates to both the leasing journey itself,  
as well as the ancillary products offered as part of leasing, 
such as gap insurance. Our compliance teams have been 
working to ensure that Autorama’s policies and procedures 
are compliant. 

•  We have a mature governance framework  
to oversee our legal and regulatory risks. 
Governance forums receive regular internal 
reporting on our compliance with the principles, 
rules and guidance applicable to our regulated 
activities.

•  We are regularly ‘horizon scanning’ to prepare us for 
upcoming changes to regulations and legislation. 
Upcoming legislative and regulatory changes which may 
affect us, albeit to varying degrees, include the UK Online 
Safety Bill Digital Markets, Competition and Consumers Bill, 
Data Protection and Digital Information Bill, the UK Audit 
Reform Bill, FCA Consumer Duty regulations, and changes 
to the UK Corporate Governance Code. 

•  In the last year, in both response to, and in anticipation of, 

changes in regulatory risk, we have increased our resource 
in relation to risk and compliance monitoring, and increased 
headcount in our Governance, Risk and Compliance function. 
Overall, we consider the level of risk has increased.

•  A comprehensive suite of policies is reviewed 

regularly. Additionally, training and monitoring 
ensures awareness of, and compliance with, 
regulatory requirements, including information 
security, data protection, financial promotions, 
product change management, complaints

Risk and potential impact

Key changes and outlook

How we manage the risk

Our data continues to show that 
there is a low competitive threat  
in our classified marketplace. 
Nevertheless, we remain wary of the 
risk that competitors could develop  
a superior consumer experience or 
superior retailer products. This could 
lead to loss of market share. 

Further, as the automotive industry 
evolves, an agency model could 
change the way that vehicles are 
bought and sold. Under an agency 
model, cars are sold by OEMs directly 
to consumers via retailers. As we 
progress with our own objectives 
surrounding digital retailing, an 
agency model could mean that 
OEMs themselves emerge as a  
direct competitor in the vehicle  
retail industry. Failure to manage  
this emerging threat could inhibit  
our ability to achieve our objectives.

•  Large technology companies such as Facebook, eBay and 
Amazon continue to operate in the automotive marketplace. 
In the last year, however, we maintained our position as the 
UK’s largest and most engaged automotive marketplace 
for new and used cars, with over 75% of all minutes spent  
on automotive classified sites spent on Auto Trader. 

•  On Boxing Day 2022 we launched a new marketing 

campaign which focuses on helping consumers to find the 
right car for them. This was supported by social media and 
digital audio content. We estimated that our advertising 
reached 99% of the UK population between Boxing Day and 
31 March 2023. 

•  In 2023 we worked with certain OEMs to provide them  
with advertising solutions following their switch to an 
agency model. 

•  Continued investment in our brand helps us to 
protect and grow our audience, to ensure that  
we remain the most influential website for 
consumers when purchasing a vehicle. 

•  Working with OEMs to develop solutions to enable 
them to advertise their new car pipeline stock on 
our website.

•  We monitor competitor activity closely through 

monthly reporting and formal quarterly competitor 
reviews, and regularly review this at OLT and 
Board level.

•  We continue to invest in and develop our product 
offering to ensure we offer value to consumers, 
retailers and manufacturers.

•  We work in an agile way which enables us to 

•  Overall, we continue to see retailers and manufacturers

evolving their online offerings, and as we diversify our own 
product offering, we broaden our competitive landscape, 
potentially leading to exposure to increased competition.  
It therefore remains imperative that we are innovative 
across our classified marketplace, our platform and  
digital retailing.

How we manage the risk

Our brand is one of our biggest 
assets. Our research shows that  
we are the largest and most trusted 
automotive classified brand in the 
UK. Failure to maintain and protect 
our brand, and/or negative publicity 
affecting our reputation could 
diminish the confidence that 
retailers, consumers and advertisers 
have in our products and services. 
This could result in a reduction in 
audience and revenue.

•  Our research shows that Auto Trader has c.90% prompted 
brand awareness with consumers. We are also voted 
regularly as the most influential automotive website  
by consumers in the car buying process. 

•  We are supporting digital retailing product development 

with marketing to ensure that consumers see us as the most 
suitable place to transact online. 

•  Owing to measures and monitoring techniques used by  
our security team, we continue to see very low levels of 
fraudulent and misleading adverts on our website. We use  
a customer watch list which aims to manage our platforms 
proactively in line with our values and relevant regulations, 
to identify and stop customer behaviour that could harm 
consumers, retailers or the Auto Trader brand. 

•  To date, the trial of our Deal Builder product has been 

provided to only a select number of retailers. All retailers 
trialling this new product undergo enhanced checks  
before being granted access, including reviews on 
consumer feedback. 

•  Overall, we consider there to be a decreasing risk to our 

brand and reputation.

•  We have a clear and open culture with a focus  

on trust and transparency.

•  We have a dedicated customer security team, 
who closely monitor our site to identify and 
quickly remove fraudulent or misleading adverts. 
Customer security also work proactively with 
retailers and the wider industry to flag potential 
security concerns.

•  We invest in new and innovative marketing 
campaigns and new ways of engaging car  
buyers to continue to maintain brand awareness, 
and to change perceptions of Auto Trader to

•  To get access to Deal Builder, retailers are 

required to sign up to and adhere to a Seller

Risk and potential impact

Key changes and outlook

How we manage the risk

In a connected, global industry,  
we are increasingly prone to the 
impacts of external events around 
the globe, as are our customers and 
consumers. We consider there to be  
a threat to the short-to-mid-term 
performance of our business  
posed by external, unpreventable, 
catastrophic and geo-political 
events. Such events could result in 
our customers being unable to trade, 
leading to loss of revenue, stock, 
audience and market share.

•  In the last year, adverse market reaction to UK Government 
policy, the enduring impacts of COVID-19 and the conflict  
in Ukraine have all led to high inflation. Should the resultant 
rise in the cost of living be sustained for a lengthy period,  
it could have an impact on the ownership model of vehicles, 
potentially with a lower volume of vehicles per household. 
However, our exposure to high interest rates is minimal 
owing to our low levels of debt.

•  We monitor external events continuously and 
assess the ways in which our business could  
be impacted, both in the short term and in the 
longer term.

•  Our Crisis Response team includes senior leadership 
and internal experts. Where necessary we also 
have external advisors available to support us  
in our response.

•  Overall, we have performed well despite the uncertain

Strategic reportGovernanceFinancial statementsPrincipal risks and uncertainties continued

 Viability statement

In accordance with the UK Corporate Governance Code 2018  
(the ‘Code’), the Directors have assessed the prospects and 
viability of the Group over a period significantly longer than  
12 months from the approval of these financial statements.

Assessment of prospects
The Group’s overall strategy and business model, as set out on pages 
10 to 13, and pages 8 and 9, respectively, are central to assessing its 
future prospects. The Group’s aim is to grow both its car buying and 
selling audiences, thereby strengthening its core advertising business. 
It will change how the UK shops for cars by providing the best online 
car buying experience and enabling all retailers to sell online.

As such, key factors likely to affect the future development, 
performance and position of the Group are:

•  data and technology: continuous investment is made in 

developing platform technologies which lead to improvements 
for consumers, retailers and manufacturers;

•  market position: the Group is the UK’s largest digital automotive 
marketplace, with the largest volume of in-market car buyers  
and the most influential website a consumer visits when 
purchasing a vehicle; and

•  people: continued success and growth are dependent on the 

ability to attract, retain and motivate a highly skilled workforce, 
with a particular focus on specialist technological and data skills.

The Board has determined that a period of five years to March 2028 is 
the most appropriate period to provide its viability statement as:

•  it allows consideration of the longer-term viability of the Group;
•  it being more aligned with the Group’s strategic planning process; and
•  it reflects reasonable expectations in terms of the reliability  

and accuracy of operational forecasts.

The Group’s prospects are assessed primarily through its strategic 
planning process. This process includes an annual review of  
the ongoing plan, led by the Group CEO and CFO through the 
Operational Leadership Team and in conjunction with relevant 
functions. The Board participates fully in the annual process and 
has the task of considering whether the plan continues to take 
appropriate account of the external environment including 
technological, social and macro-economic changes.

The output of the annual review process is a set of objectives which 
collectively form our three strategic priorities and our Environmental, 
Social and Governance (‘ESG’) strategy, an analysis of the risks that 
could prevent the plan being delivered, and the annual financial 
budget. The latest updates to the plan were finalised in March 2023, 
which considered the Group’s current position and its prospects 
over the forthcoming years. Progress against these plans is reviewed 
monthly by both the Operational Leadership Team and the Board. 

The Group will be able to 
continue in operation and 
meet its liabilities as they  
fall due over the five-year 
period ending March 2028.

Detailed financial forecasts that consider customer numbers, stock 
levels, ARPR, revenue, profit, cash flow and key financial ratios have 
been prepared for the five-year period to March 2028. Funding 
requirements have also been considered, with particular focus on 
the ongoing compliance with the covenants attached to the Group’s 
Syndicated Revolving Credit Facility (‘Syndicated RCF’). The first 
year of the financial forecasts is based off the Group’s 2024 annual 
financial budget. The following years are prepared in detail and are 
flexed based on the actual results in year one.

The key assumptions in the financial forecasts, reflecting the overall 
strategy, include:

•  continued growth in our core marketplace, as we develop  
our advertising platform and we continue to invest in our  
search experience;

•  growth in digital retailing, as we continue to evolve both  
our products and consumer experience, bringing more  
of the car buying journey online;

•  growth in the use of our data, being the industry standard 

platform and further embedding our data into the industry, 
giving buyers and retailers up-to-date insight; and

•  increase in costs through salaries as the Group continues  

to grow, supporting and developing new products.

These key assumptions are reflected in the Group’s principal risks  
and uncertainties, which are set out on pages 50 to 55. The purpose  
of the principal risks is primarily to summarise those matters that could 
prevent the Group from delivering on its strategy. A number of other 
aspects of the principal risks – because of their nature or potential 
impact – could also threaten the Group’s ability to continue in business 
in its current form if they were to occur. This was considered as part  
of the assessment of the Group’s viability, as explained opposite.

Auto Trader Group plc  Annual Report and Financial Statements 2023

Assessment of viability
The output of the Group’s strategic and financial planning process detailed previously reflects the Board’s best estimate of the future 
prospects of the business. To make the assessment of viability, however, additional scenarios have been modelled over and above  
those in the ongoing plan, based upon a number of the Group’s principal risks and uncertainties which are documented on pages 50 to 55.  
These scenarios were overlaid into the plan to quantify the potential impact of one or more of these crystallising over the assessment period. 

While each of the Group’s principal risks has a potential impact and has therefore been considered as part of the assessment, only those 
that represent severe but plausible scenarios have been modelled through the plan. These were as follows: 

Scenario modelled

Scenario 1: Severe economic downturn
Given the increase in the cost of living and steep rise in interest rates, the impact of a severe economic downturn has been 
considered. This would likely suppress consumer confidence, pressuring the used and new car markets, with retailers 
impacted due to an increase in their cost of capital. In the longer term, this landscape could be a catalyst for structural 
changes in the ownership model of vehicles, potentially including a rise in subscription-based models.

Revenue assumptions: Approximately one third of retailers are lost, with underlying ARPR reducing through a loss of stock 
resulting in a 45% decrease in Trade revenue. A 40% decrease in all other revenue streams, including Autorama, was assumed 
due to reduced demand. Modest recovery was assumed for the financial year March 2026. 

Cost assumptions: Cost of sales and marketing decreased in line with revenue.

Scenario 2: Data breaches
The impact of any regulatory fines has been considered. The biggest of these is the General Data Protection Regulation 
(‘GDPR’) fine for data breaches, which was enacted in May 2018. This scenario assumes a data breach resulting in the 
maximum fine (4% of Group revenue), coupled with a significant level of reputational damage to the Group’s brand. 

Revenue assumptions: A severe reduction was modelled through Trade revenue, resulting in an initial 45% decrease in revenue 
driven by lost retailers. A 45% decrease in Consumer Services, Manufacturer and Agency and Autorama revenue was also 
assumed through the loss of consumer and partner confidence. Modest recovery was assumed for the financial year 
March 2025.

Cost assumptions: Cost of sales and marketing decreased in line with revenue.

Links to principal risks

Risk 1: 

 Automotive economy, 
market and business 
environment

Risk 10:   External catastrophic 

and geo-political 
events affecting 
customer and 
consumer behaviours

Risk 5: 

 IT systems and  
cyber security

Risk 7: 

 Legal and regulatory 
compliance

Risk 9:  Brand and reputation

Scenario 3: Banning the sale of diesel cars
The impact of climate change has been considered through the potential ban of diesel cars. The government has outlined 
plans to ban the sale of new conventional petrol and diesel cars from 2030. This scenario assumes the government brings 
forward the ban of diesel cars, and also applies it to used cars, in the financial year to March 2026. This would result in a 
significant impact on stock available as well as a loss of retailers who cannot operate viably without the sale of diesel cars. 

Revenue assumptions: Approximately one third of retailers are lost, with underlying ARPR reducing through a loss of stock, 
resulting in a 40% decrease in Trade revenue. A 16% decrease in Consumer Services revenue was assumed through lost 
private diesel car volumes. A modest impact to Manufacturer and Agency revenue was assumed with Manufacturers well 
progressed into the transition to selling electric vehicles. Autorama revenue decline of 30% due to reduction in volumes. 
Modest recovery was assumed through retailers for the financial year March 2027 and beyond.

Risk 1: 

 Automotive economy, 
market and business 
environment

Risk 2:  Climate change 

Risk 6: 

 Failure to innovate: 
disruptive technologies 
and changing 
consumer behaviours

Cost assumptions: Cost of sales and marketing decreased in line with revenue. 

Scenario 4: Combination of all three scenarios as above
This is seen as a worst-case scenario, and highly unlikely.

All of the above

The war in Ukraine
The war in Ukraine has the potential to materially impact the 
automotive value chain. As Russia is an exporter of key metals  
and other materials used in parts production, and Ukraine makes 
components used in production such as wiring harnesses, there is  
a direct disruption and rising price risk. The supply chain is already 
impacted by semi-conductor supply issues, and there could be a 
further impact to new car transactions. This scenario has not been 
modelled as the Group does not feel there is likely to be significant 
impact than that already seen, however it will continue to monitor 
the situation.

Syndicated Revolving Credit facility (‘Syndicated RCF’)
The above scenarios consider the bi-annual covenants attached  
to the Group’s Syndicated RCF, ensuring thresholds are met. The 
scenarios are hypothetical and severe for the purpose of creating 
outcomes that have the ability to threaten the viability of the Group. 

The results of the stress testing demonstrated that due to the Group’s 
significant free cash flow, access to the Syndicated RCF and the 
Board’s ability to adjust the discretionary share buyback programme, 
it would be able to withstand the impact of any of these scenarios, 
remain cash generative and meet the obligations of its debt facility. 

Viability statement
Based on their assessment of prospects and viability above, the 
Directors confirm that they have a reasonable expectation that  
the Group will be able to continue in operation and meet its liabilities 
as they fall due over the five-year period ending March 2028. 

Going concern 
The Directors also considered it appropriate to prepare the financial 
statements on the going concern basis, as explained in the Basis  
of preparation paragraph in note 1 to the financial statements.

Strategic reportGovernanceFinancial statementsCorporate governance statement

This Corporate governance statement explains key features 
of the Company’s governance framework. The Company has 
complied in full with all provisions of the 2018 UK Corporate 
Governance Code during the year.

This statement also includes items required 
by the Listing Rules and the Disclosure 
Guidance and Transparency Rules (‘DTRs’). 
The UK Corporate Governance Code  
(the ‘Code’) is available on the Financial 
Reporting Council website at frc.org.uk.

Culture 
Auto Trader has a distinctive culture that  
is values-oriented and underpinned by a 
diverse and inclusive workforce. The Board 
plays an important role in ensuring that this 
culture remains aligned with our long-term 
strategy, in setting values, demonstrating 
behaviours consistent with these values,  
and in monitoring the culture and behaviours 
of the organisation. 

The Board receives a quarterly Cultural 
Scorecard, designed to allow monitoring  
of various cultural indicators such as staff 
retention, diversity, investment in training, 
absences, employee engagement, customer 
feedback and complaints. 

Workforce engagement 
A Board Engagement Guild has been 
established as the core mechanism by  
which the Board engages with the 
workforce. The Board Engagement Guild 
comprises members from across different 
parts of the business, all of whom are 
members of the Company’s other existing 
guilds covering areas such as family  
& wellbeing, diversity & inclusion and 
sustainability. Each member canvasses 
views and opinions from their colleagues  
to share with the Board. 

The Board has decided that it is not 
appropriate to designate a specific 
Non-Executive Director to carry out this  
role and instead shares this role across all 
Non-Executive Directors, and so the Guild 
meets with the Chair and all Non-Executive 
Directors (without Executive Directors or any 
members of senior management present). 

Additionally there are a number of well 
established ways in which the Company 
engages with the workforce, for example, 
regular check-in surveys; an annual 
employee engagement survey; attendance 
by Non-Executive Directors at some of our 
Diversity and Inclusion Guild events; an 
annual conference and quarterly virtual 
conferences and updates; regular sharing  
of information from the CEO via emails and 
videos; and informal open forums. 

Whistleblowing
A whistleblowing policy has been adopted 
which includes access to a whistleblowing 
telephone service run by an independent 
organisation, allowing employees to raise 
concerns on an entirely confidential basis. 
Reports are directed to the Audit Committee 
Chair and the Company Secretary. The Audit 
Committee receives regular reports on the 
use of the service, any significant reports  
that have been received, the investigations 
carried out and any actions arising as a result.

Engagement with shareholders
The Board has a comprehensive investor 
relations programme to ensure that existing 
and potential investors understand the 
Company’s strategy and performance.  
As part of this programme, the Executive 
Directors give formal presentations to 
investors and analysts on the half-year  
and full-year results. These updates are 
webcast live and posted on the Group’s 
investor relations website.

The results presentations are followed by 
formal investor roadshows covering UK  
and overseas shareholders. 

In September 2022, an investor day was  
held, attended by institutional investors, 
buy-side and sell-side analysts, during which 
the Executive Directors and members  
of senior management outlined the evolution  
of our strategy. The investor day presentations 
are available on the Company’s website:  
plc.autotrader.co.uk/investors.

There is also an ongoing programme of 
attendance at conferences, one-to-one  
and group meetings with institutional 
investors, fund managers and analysts. 
These meetings cover a wide range of  
topics, but care is exercised to ensure that 
any price-sensitive information is released  
to all shareholders, institutional and private, 
at the same time. Meetings which relate  
to governance are attended by the Chair  
or another Non-Executive Director and  
the Company Secretary as appropriate.  
Private shareholders are encouraged  
to give feedback and communicate with  
the Board through ir@autotrader.co.uk.

The Board receives regular reports on  
issues relating to share price, trading activity 
and movements in institutional investor 
shareholdings. The Board is also provided 
with current analyst opinions, forecasts and 
feedback from its joint corporate brokers, 
Bank of America and Numis, on the views of 
institutional investors on a non-attributed 
and attributed basis, and on the views of 
analysts from its financial PR agency, 
Powerscourt. Any major shareholders’ 
concerns are communicated to the Board  
by the Executive Directors.

The Chair, the Senior Independent Director 
and other Non-Executive Directors are 
available to meet with shareholders and 
arrangements can be made through the 
Company Secretary.

Annual General Meeting
At the 2022 AGM, all resolutions were passed 
with votes in support ranging from 92.26%  
to 100%. The 2023 AGM will take place at 
10:00am on Thursday 14 September 2023 at 
the Company’s registered office: 4th Floor,  
1 Tony Wilson Place, Manchester, M15 4FN. 
Myself and the other Directors will join  
the meeting. 

All proxy votes received in respect of each 
resolution at the AGM are counted and the 
balance for and against, and any votes 
withheld, are indicated. At the meeting  
itself, voting on all the proposed resolutions  
is conducted on a poll rather than a show  
of hands, in line with recommended best 
practice. We encourage shareholders to 
cast their votes by proxy, and to send any 
questions in respect of AGM business to  
ir@autotrader.co.uk. Following the meeting, 
responses to questions will be published on 
the website at plc.autotrader.co.uk/investors.

The Notice of the AGM can be found in a 
booklet which is being mailed out at the same 
time as this Annual Report. The Notice of the 
AGM sets out the business of the meeting  
and an explanatory note on all resolutions. 
Separate resolutions are proposed in respect 
of each substantive issue.

Results of resolutions proposed at the AGM 
will be published on the Company’s website: 
plc.autotrader.co.uk/investors following  
the AGM.

the positions of Chair and Chief Executive Officer are separate and not

approved by the Board. David Keens is the Senior Independent Director.

At the date of this report, the Board consists of the Non-Executive Chair,  
five Independent Non-Executive Directors and three Executive Directors.

Ed Williams was considered to be independent on appointment. All of

which could materially influence their judgement. The Chair’s fees and the 
Non-Executive Directors’ fees are disclosed on page 87, and they received  
no additional remuneration from the Company during the year. Therefore,

1.  Where Directors were unable to attend a meeting date, this was either due to unavoidable personal circumstances or work commitments. Directors all received  

the meeting papers and had an opportunity to feed comments in to the Board and Committee Chairs prior to the meetings. 

In addition to the scheduled Board meetings detailed above, ad hoc calls took place throughout the year relating to various financial and 
transactional decisions.

Board and Committee meetings attendance
Board meetings are planned around the  
key events in the corporate calendar, 
including the half-yearly and final results, 
and the Annual General Meeting (‘AGM’),  
and a strategy meeting is held each year.

A monthly financial update call is also held  
at which the Board discusses results with 
operational management. Once a year the 
Directors spend a day visiting customers.

During the year, the Chair and Non-Executive 
Directors have met without Executive 
Directors present. In addition, the Non-
Executive Directors have met without the 
Chair and the Executive Directors present, 
and the Senior Independent Director has  
met with the Executive Directors.

Board and Committee activities in 2023
The Board makes decisions in order to ensure 
the long-term success of the Group whilst 
taking into consideration the interests of wider 
stakeholders, such as employees, consumers, 
customers and suppliers, and other factors  
as required of it under s172 of the Companies 
Act 2006. Board meetings are one of the 
mechanisms through which the Board 
discharges this duty, and in order to formalise 
this process, a stakeholder framework has 
been established which is applied to all Board 
papers and discussions. Further information 
about engagement with the Group’s 
stakeholders is included on pages 14 to 17.

The Board’s activities are structured through 
the year to develop and monitor the delivery  
of the Group’s strategy and financial results;  
to receive feedback from and engage with 
stakeholder groups such as employees, 
customers and suppliers; and to maintain  
a robust governance and risk management 
framework. Some of the key activities during 
the year are shown in the diagram on page 65.

Induction and development
All newly appointed Directors receive  
an induction briefing on their duties and 
responsibilities as Directors of a publicly 
quoted company. There is a formal induction 
programme to ensure that newly appointed 
Directors familiarise themselves with  
the Group and its activities, either through 
reading, meetings with the relevant member 

of senior management or through sessions  
in the Board meetings. 

Specific focus areas in the induction schedule 
include: statutory and regulatory information, 
Board and Committee specific information, 
business overview and deep dives into people 
and culture, technology and digital retailing. 

The majority of Board meetings contain a 
presentation from senior management on 
one of the strategic priorities for the year. 
Specific business-related presentations are 
given to the Board by senior management 
and external advisors when appropriate. 

All Directors are offered the opportunity to 
meet with customers and take part in sales 
calls to understand the business from a 
customer’s perspective, or to take part or 
observe focus groups with consumers who 
use our website. Directors receive regular 
feedback from our sales and service team  
to ensure they are kept informed of the latest 
customer dialogue and sentiment.

The Board as a whole is updated,  
as necessary, in light of any governance 
developments as and when they occur,  
and there is an annual legal and regulatory 
update provided as part of the Board 
meeting. All Directors are required to 
complete our annual compliance training 
modules covering anti-bribery, anti-money 
laundering, data protection, information 
security and other relevant subjects.  
As part of the Board evaluation, the Chair 
meets with each Director to discuss any 
individual training and development needs.

Information and support  
available to Directors
Full and timely access to all relevant 
information is given to the Board. For Board 
meetings, this consists of a formal agenda, 
minutes of previous meetings and a 
comprehensive set of papers including 
regular operational and financial reports, 
provided to Directors in a timely manner in 
advance of meetings.

All Directors have access to the advice and 
services of the Company Secretary, Claire Baty. 
The appointment or removal of the Company 
Secretary is a matter for the whole Board. 

Concerns over operation of the Board
All of the Directors have the right to have 
their opposition to, or concerns over,  
any Board decision noted in the minutes. 
Directors are entitled to take independent 
professional advice at the Company’s 
expense in the furtherance of their duties, 
where considered necessary.

Letters of appointment
The Chair and the Non-Executive Directors 
have letters of appointment which are 
available for inspection at the registered 
office of the Company during normal 
business hours and at the place of the  
AGM from at least 15 minutes before and 
until the end of the meeting; or on request 
from ir@autotrader.co.uk. These letters set 
out the expected time commitment from 
each Director. Non-Executive appointments 
to the Board are for an initial term of up to 
three years. Non-Executive Directors are 
typically expected to serve two three-year 
terms, although the Board may invite the 
Director to serve for an additional period. 

Conflicts of interest
In accordance with the Company’s Articles 
of Association, the Board has a formal 
system in place for Directors to declare 
conflicts of interest and for such conflicts  
to be considered for authorisation. 

Any external appointments or other significant 
commitments of the Directors require the 
prior approval of the Board.  We  recognise 
that our Executive Directors may be invited  
to become non-executive directors of other 
companies. Such non-executive duties  
can broaden a Director’s experience and 
knowledge which can benefit Auto Trader. 
Following the year end, Catherine Faiers has 
been appointed as a Non-Executive Director 
of Allegro.eu Group. The Board approved the 
directorship in advance to ensure that there 
was no conflict of interest. None of the  
other Executive Directors has any external 
directorships as at the date of this report. 
The Board is comfortable that external 
appointments of the Chair and the Non-
Executive Directors do not create any 
conflict of interest. 

64

Auto Trader Group plc  Annual Report and Financial Statements 2023

Time commitment
Any external appointments or other 
significant commitments of the Directors 
require the prior approval of the Board.  
The Chief Operating Officer holds one 
external directorship as at the date of  
this report. The Board is comfortable  
that external appointments of the Chair,  
the Non-Executive Directors and the Chief 
Operating Officer do not impact on the time 
that any Director devotes to the Company.

Election of Directors
The Board can appoint any person to be  
a Director, either to fill a vacancy or as an 
addition to the existing Board. Any Director 
so appointed by the Board shall hold office 
only until the next AGM and shall then be 
eligible for election by the shareholders.  
The AGM Notice sets out the specific reasons 
for reappointing each Director.

Risk management and internal control
The Board acknowledges its responsibility 
for establishing and maintaining the Group’s 
system of risk management and internal 
controls and it receives regular reports from 
management identifying, evaluating and 
managing the risks within the business.  
The system of internal controls is designed  
to manage, rather than eliminate, the risk  
of failure to achieve business objectives  
and can provide only reasonable, and not 
absolute, assurance against material 
misstatement or loss. 

The processes in place for assessment, 
management and monitoring of risks are 
described in Principal risks and uncertainties 
on pages 48 to 55.

The Board, assisted by the Audit Committee, 
has carried out a review of the effectiveness 
of the system of risk management and internal 
controls during the year ended 31 March 2023 
and for the period up to the date of approval 
of the Consolidated financial statements 
contained in the Annual Report. The review 
covered all material controls, including 
financial, operational and compliance 
controls and risk management systems.  
The Board considered the weaknesses 
identified and reviewed the developing 
actions, plans and programmes that it 
considered necessary. The Board confirms 
that no significant weaknesses or failings 
were identified as a result of the review  
of effectiveness.

Financial and business reporting
Assisted by the Audit Committee, the Board 
has carried out a review of the 2023 Annual 
Report and considers that, in its opinion, the 
report is fair, balanced and understandable 
and provides the information necessary  
for shareholders to assess the Company’s 
position and performance, business model 
and strategy. Refer to the Report of the Audit 
Committee on pages 70 to 75 for details of 
the review process.

See pages 56 to 57 for the Board’s statement 
on going concern and the viability statement.

Terms of Reference: plc.autotrader.co.uk/investors

Dear shareholders,
I am pleased to present the Report of the 
Nomination Committee for 2023.

Role of the Committee
The Committee’s main role is to keep under 
constant review the size and composition of 
the Board and its Committees including its 
gender and ethnic diversity, its independence, 
and the skills, knowledge and experience 
required for the effective oversight of the 
Group. The Committee is also responsible 
for ensuring that there are formal and 
orderly succession plans in place for the 
members of the Board. 

How the Committee operates
All members of the Committee are 
Independent Non-Executive Directors.  
The Chair of the Board chairs all meetings  
of the Committee unless they relate to the 
appointment of his successor or such other 
matters in which he may have a potential 
conflict of interest. For those meetings, the 
Senior Independent Director (‘SID’) takes the 
Chair unless the SID is in contention for the 
role or also has a potential conflict of interest.

The Committee meets at least once a  
year, and on an ad hoc basis as required. 
Only members of the Committee have  
the right to attend meetings; however,  
the Chief Executive Officer attends for all  
or part of meetings so that the Committee 
can understand his views, particularly on  
key talent within the business.

Board evaluation
We carried out an internal Board evaluation 
during the year. No significant issues were 
identified. The results are included in the 
table opposite. 

Appointments to the Board 
No new appointments were made during  
the year, however, since the year end the  
Board has appointed Matt Davies as a 
Non-Executive Director and Chair Designate. 

The Senior Independent Director led the 
process for finding the next Chair, working 
closely with the CEO. A detailed role 
specification was drawn up, identifying the 
skills and experience required. A wide search 
was conducted, taking into consideration 
the requirements of the role, and with due 
regard to the benefits of diversity including 
gender and ethnicity. Erevena, a recruitment 
consultancy who has no other connection  
with the Company, were used to identify 
candidates. Extensive interviews were 
conducted, including with all Executive  
and Non-Executive Directors. Following this 
process, the Committee identified Matt Davies 
as the successful candidate, and therefore 
Matt will be appointed as Chair Designate 
with effect from 1 July 2023, and will assume 
the role of Chair from the 2023 AGM.

66

Auto Trader Group plc  Annual Report and Financial Statements 2023

Policy on appointments to the Board
Appointments are made on merit, against 
objective criteria and with due regard  
to the benefits of diversity on the Board.  
The Committee takes account of a  
variety of factors before recommending  
any new appointments to the Board, 
including relevant skills to perform the  
role, experience, knowledge and diversity, 
including gender and ethnic diversity.

As set out in the table on page 41, 56% of  
our Board Directors are women, exceeding 
the targets set by the Listing Rules. We do 
not currently have a woman in one of the 
roles of Chair, SID, CEO or CFO. However,  
we do have a female Executive Director, 
Catherine Faiers, in the role of COO, which 
we believe to be of equal status to those 
roles. One of our Board Directors is from  
a minority ethnic background.

At a leadership level, 56% of the Operational 
Leadership Team (‘OLT’) and 38% of the OLT’s 
direct reports were women, a combined 
total of 40%.

Succession planning 
The focus of the Committee’s work during 
the year was on developing and implementing 
a plan to renew the Non-Executive Directors, 
including the Chair. A detailed description  
of the approach we are adopting is set  
out overleaf.

We also conducted a long-term review  
of executive succession with two areas of 
focus. The first was to confirm the identity  
of our preferred internal candidate as the 
eventual successor to our CEO, Nathan Coe. 
The second area of focus was in regard to the 
composition and potential of the next level  
of executives outside the Executive Director 
group. The intention is to both enlarge the 
OLT and to communicate clearly to those with 
the potential to join the OLT in the relatively 
near term. We believe we have the talent 
within the business to fill potentially all of  
our future needs and we believe that offering 
greater clarity to people in this group will 
contribute to their retention.

Election and re-election of Directors 
In accordance with the UK Corporate 
Governance Code, all Directors will retire 
and offer themselves for election or 
re-election to the Board. Since the last 
report, Sigga Sigurdardottir has entered  
into her second three-year term. Following 
the appointment of Matt Davies as  
Chair Designate, I will not be standing  
for re-election. Matt will be standing for 
election and will assume the role of Chair  
at the conclusion of the 2023 AGM. Following 
confirmation by the Committee and Board 
that they are satisfied that all Directors 
continue to be effective in, and demonstrate 
commitment to, their respective roles on  
the Board and that each makes a valuable 
contribution to the leadership of the Company, 

Board evaluation and effectiveness

An internal evaluation was conducted in 2022/23. The internal review included the 
completion of a detailed questionnaire by each of the Board Directors, covering the 
following areas:

•  Board meetings and information flows;
•  the Board’s role, knowledge and skills;
•  Board composition and succession planning;
•  business strategy, performance and culture;
•  risk management;
•  engagement with shareholders and other stakeholders;
•  the operation of each of the Board’s Committees; and 
•  a follow up on the recommendations raised in the previous review.

The results were reviewed by the Chair and then discussed with the Board in March 2023. 

In addition, an assessment of the Chair’s performance was carried out, led by  
the Senior Independent Director, and feedback was provided to him individually. 
Overall, the results showed that the Board and its Committees continue to operate 
both effectively and efficiently, and that each individual Director continues to make 
an effective contribution.

The next external evaluation is due in 2023/24.

Results of the 2023 internal review
Areas of strength

Areas for improvement 

The Board is a very inclusive environment, 
open to discussion, feedback and 
alternative views. Key relationships  
are excellent and there is a high level  
of transparency between Executives 
and Non-Executives. 

Although Board papers generally are of high 
quality and clarity, more work could be done 
to reduce jargon, focus on salient points  
and to provide background and context. 
This will become even more important as 
new members join the Board in future.

The wider consequences of decisions 
and the impact on different stakeholder 
groups is well considered and 
articulated in Board papers and Board 
discussions, and is further enhanced 
by the Employee Engagement Guild.

The induction process for newly 
appointed Board Directors was noted 
to be very good, and training/upskilling 
sessions for the Board are excellent. 
This will be of considerable importance 
in the coming year as new members 
join the Board. 

Whilst it was noted that it is unusual for 
Non-Executive Directors to attend investor 
meetings (unless in their capacity as a 
Committee Chair), it was agreed it would  
be useful for Non-Executive Directors  
to attend investor days/analyst 
presentations from time to time.

It was noted that, taking into account  
the need to renew the Board, we need to 
ensure that we continue to have strong 
finance experience, and that the Board 
should evolve in line with changes in 
business and strategy.

the Board recommends that shareholders 
approve the resolutions to be proposed at 
the 2023 AGM relating to the election and 
re-election of the Directors.

I welcome any questions in respect of  
the work of the Committee, which can  
be submitted to ir@autotrader.co.uk,  
or in person at our Annual General Meeting.

Board succession plan
Much of the time of the Nomination Committee 
over the last year has been taken up with 
planning for and implementing the plan  
for the renewal of Non-Executive Directors.

The need for a plan arises from the Code’s 
requirement for independent directors and the 
deemed loss of independence after nine years’ 
service. Auto Trader became a public company 
in March 2015. Part of that process was the 
replacement of a private equity board with  
a public company board. The Committee 
believes that it made sound choices of the initial 
set of public company Non-Executive Directors.

As a consequence, the Company faced  
a need to replenish the majority of its 
Non-Executive Directors over the next two 
years, including the Chair. It is in part a result 
of the belief that a smaller Board has been 
very beneficial for the business and is likely 
to remain so into the future. The Committee 
will look to stagger as much as possible 
through this next round of appointments.

The panel opposite lists the Non-Executive 
Board members by length of service,  
their roles, the experience they bring and 
identifies when they will be deemed to  
lose their independence under the Code.

Following the appointment of Matt Davies  
as Chair Designate, the Committee will now  
be able to refine the criteria to be applied in  
the search for other Non-Executive Directors 
knowing the experience and skills the new  
Chair brings to the business. It also allows  
for the new Chair to play a role in making  
the other appointments.

At the time of the IPO, it was felt important 
to have a Chair with both public company 
experience and a depth of knowledge in 
online classifieds. These were complementary 
to the then CEO who had a strong technology 
background and experience of building a global, 
though at the time private, entrepreneurial 
business. Online marketplace experience  
is no longer essential given the depth of 
experience among the executive leadership, 
and so the focus was on candidates with 
public company experience, and a belief that 
the person understands, values and will seek to 
preserve and build on the Auto Trader culture 
including the desire for inclusivity and diversity.

The panel opposite sets out the plan in some 
detail and highlights the areas that are seen 
as potentially the most challenging in its 
successful execution.

PLANNED APPOINTMENT TIMINGS

EXECUTIVE BOARD MEMBERS

The composition of your Board in the future

1   Chair of the Board 
The Senior Independent Director led the 
process of finding the next Chair, working 
closely with the CEO. Matt Davies has been 
appointed as Chair Designate from 1 July 2023 
and will assume the role of Chair after the 
2023 AGM.

2   Audit Committee Chair
Now the next Chair has been identified,  
the Committee will focus on the role of  
Audit Committee Chair. There are a number 
of candidates in mind, though this will  
be influenced by wanting complementary 
experience to that of the new Chair. It will  
not be a requirement that the successful 
appointee also perform the role of SID, 
though the experience required to perform 
both roles is often found together. 

3   Senior Independent Director
If the Audit Committee Chair is not also 
appointed as SID, we will seek an additional 
appointment to take on the role of SID, and 
David Keens will remain in the role until such 
time as a new SID has been announced.

4   Remuneration Committee Chair
The Committee expects to be able to appoint 
one of the existing Remuneration Committee 
members as Remuneration Committee Chair 
in succession to Jill Easterbrook, meeting  
the recommendation to have served on  
a Remuneration Committee for at least 12 
months on appointment. Therefore, Jill may 
not be directly replaced when she steps 
down from the Board in 2024.

5   Non-Executive Director
The Committee expects to make at least one 
further appointment during 2025 (the end of Jill 
Easterbrook’s nine years falls in July 2024 and 
the end of Jeni Mundy’s nine years falls in March 
2025). Jeni Mundy’s replacement as Chair of  
the Corporate Responsibility Committee may 
either be an existing Board member or be a new 
Director, appointed during 2025.

We reviewed the  
Annual Report including: 
recognition of revenue, 
acquisition accounting, 
impairment of assets, 
and the assumptions 
and scenarios in the 
viability statement.

Dear shareholders,
I am pleased to present the Report of the  
Audit Committee for 2023. 

The Committee is comprised entirely of 
Independent Non-Executive Directors.  
I fulfil the requirement for a Committee 
member to have recent and relevant financial 
experience. All members (and therefore the 
Committee as a whole) have competence  
in consumer and digital businesses. 

The Board approves the Terms of Reference 
and duties of the Committee, which include: 
monitoring the integrity of the Group’s financial 
reporting, effectiveness of the internal control 
and risk management framework, internal 
audit, and the quality, independence and 
effectiveness of external audit. 

Our Internal Audit function has been 
co-sourced with Deloitte LLP for the eight 
years since we became a listed plc in 2015. 
They have provided an excellent, independent, 
professional service for which we thank 
them. Jointly, we determined that it was 
appropriate to make a change in view of  
the longevity of their tenure. We conducted 
a competitive process and have appointed 
BDO LLP as our new co-sourced Internal 
Audit provider. 

Our external auditor, KPMG LLP, and internal 
auditor regularly attend Audit Committee 
meetings. The Chair of the Board, Chief 
Executive Officer, Chief Operating Officer, 
Chief Financial Officer and other members 
of management attend by invitation.

Auto Trader Group plc  Annual Report and Financial Statements 2023

The Committee has reviewed the content  
of the Annual Report, including the acquisition 
accounting for Autorama; the presentation 
of segmental reporting and profit measures; 
and the Group’s policies over revenue 
recognition, impairment of assets, and  
the assumptions and scenarios in the 
viability statement. 

The Annual Report explains our strategy, 
financial performance and position in  
a way which we believe is fair, balanced  
and understandable.

Whilst this Report of the Audit Committee 
contains some of the matters addressed 
during the year, it should be read in conjunction 
with the external auditor’s report starting  
on page 98 and the Auto Trader Group plc 
financial statements in general.

At the 2022 AGM, shareholders approved 
the re-appointment of KPMG as our external 
auditor. The Committee has carried out a 
review of the effectiveness and independence 
of KPMG and has recommended to the Board 
that they are re-appointed at the 2023 AGM.

David Keens
Chair of the Audit Committee 
1 June 2023

Financial reporting 
The primary role of the Committee in relation to financial reporting is to review and monitor the integrity of the financial statements, including 
annual and half-year reports, results announcements, dividend proposals and any other formal announcement relating to the Group’s 
financial performance.

The Committee assessed the accounting principles and policies adopted, and whether management had made appropriate estimates  
and judgements. In doing so, the Committee considered management reports and the basis of judgements made. The Committee reviewed 
external audit reports on the 2023 half-year statement and 2023 Annual Report. 

The Committee, with assistance from management and KPMG, identified areas of financial statement risk and judgement as described below: 

Description of significant area

Audit Committee action

Acquisition accounting
Management’s assessment of the allocation and valuation of goodwill 
and intangible assets as part of the acquisition of Autorama.

Revenue recognition
Revenue recognition for the Group’s revenue streams is not complex. 
However this remained an area of focus due to the large volume of 
transactions, the new revenue streams from Autorama, and as revenue 
 is the largest figure in the income statement.

Going concern and viability statement
The Directors must satisfy themselves as to the Group’s viability and 
confirm that they have a reasonable expectation that it will continue  
to operate and meet its liabilities as they fall due. The period over which 
the Directors have determined it is appropriate to assess the prospects 
of the Group has been defined as five years. In addition, the Directors 
must consider if the going concern assumption is appropriate.

The Committee reviewed the assumptions made by 
management in respect of the identification and valuation  
of intangible assets, and the allocation of consideration,  
and was satisfied that these were appropriately accounted 
for and disclosed under IFRS 3.

The Committee was satisfied with the explanations provided 
and conclusions reached in relation to the Group’s revenue 
recognition, including management’s assessment of 
Autorama revenue streams.

The Committee reviewed management’s schedules supporting 
the going concern assessment and viability statements. 
These included the Group’s Medium Term Plan and cash flow 
forecasts for the period to March 2028. The Committee 
discussed with management the appropriateness of the 
five-year period, and discussed the correlation with the Group’s 
principal risks and uncertainties as disclosed on pages 50  
to 55. The feasibility of mitigating actions and the potential 
speed of implementation to achieve any flexibility required 
were discussed. Scenarios covering events that could adversely 
impact the Group were considered. The Committee evaluated 
the conclusions over going concern and viability and the 
proposed disclosures in the financial statements and satisfied 
itself that the financial statements appropriately reflect  
the conclusions.

Other areas of focus

Audit Committee action

Carrying value of goodwill
Following the acquisition of Autorama, the Group has two cash-generating 
units (‘CGUs’), being the Digital CGU and Autorama CGU, which require 
annual impairment testing. Management’s assessment of the recoverability 
of the goodwill is based on future cash flow forecasts.

The Committee reviewed the assumptions made by 
management, in particular the judgements around allocation 
of goodwill to CGUs and the estimates that underpin the  
value in use (Auto Trader CGU) and fair value (Autorama CGU) 
recoverable amounts. The Committee concluded that the 
judgements and estimates applied were appropriate.

Investment value in joint venture
The Group has a joint venture with Cox Automotive UK, Dealer Auction. 
Management’s assessment of the recoverability of the investment value, 
including goodwill, is based on future cash flow forecasts. 

The Committee reviewed the assumptions made by 
management, particularly in relation to cash flow forecasts  
to support the carrying value, and was satisfied that these 
were appropriately accounted for.

Fair, balanced and understandable
At the request of the Board, the Committee has reviewed the content of the 2023 Annual Report and considered whether, taken as a whole,  
in its opinion it is fair, balanced and understandable and provides the information necessary for shareholders to assess the Group’s position, 
performance, business model and strategy. The Committee was provided with a draft of the Annual Report and the opportunity to comment 
where further clarity or information should be added. The final draft was then recommended for approval by the Board. When forming  
its opinion, the Committee had regard to discussions held with management and reports received from internal and external auditors.  
In particular, the Committee considered:

Is the report fair?

•  Is a complete picture presented and has any sensitive material been omitted that should have been included?
•  Are key messages in the narrative aligned with the KPIs and are they reflected in the financial reporting?
•  Are the revenue streams described in the narrative consistent with those used for financial reporting in the 

financial statements?

Is the report 
balanced?

•  Is there a good level of consistency between the reports in the front and the reporting in the back of the Annual Report?
•  Do you get the same messages when reading the front end and the back end independently?
•  Is there an appropriate balance between statutory and adjusted measures and are any adjustments explained 

clearly with appropriate prominence?

•  Are the key judgements referred to in the narrative reporting and significant issues reported in the Report of the 
Audit Committee consistent with disclosures of key estimation uncertainties and critical judgements set out in 
the financial statements?

•  How do these compare with the risks that KPMG include in their report?

Is the report 
understandable?

•  Is there a clear and cohesive framework for the Annual Report?
•  Are the important messages highlighted and appropriately themed throughout the document?
•  Is the report written in accessible language and are the messages clearly drawn out?

Following the Committee’s review, the Directors confirm that, in their opinion, the 2023 Annual Report, taken as a whole, is fair, balanced and 
understandable and provides the information necessary for shareholders to assess the Group’s position and performance, business model 
and strategy.

Risk management and internal control
The Committee’s responsibilities include a review of Auto Trader’s risk management arrangements and internal controls to ensure that they 
remain effective and that any identified weaknesses are remediated fully and in a timely manner. The Committee:

•  reviews annually the effectiveness of the Group’s risk management systems;
•  reviews annually the effectiveness of the Group’s internal control framework;
•  monitors and oversees the response to any alleged instances of fraud, bribery and whistleblowing complaints;
•  commissions reports on the effectiveness of business processes and controls and ensures recommendations are implemented where appropriate;
•  receives reports from the Group’s outsourced Internal Audit function and ensures recommendations are implemented where 

appropriate; and

•  reviews reports from the external auditor on any issues identified in the course of their work, including any internal control reports 

highlighting control weaknesses, and ensures that there are appropriate responses from management.

The Group has internal controls and risk management arrangements in place in relation to its financial reporting processes and preparation 
of consolidated accounts. These systems include policies and procedures to ensure that adequate accounting records are maintained,  
and transactions are recorded accurately and fairly to permit the preparation of financial statements in accordance with IFRS. The internal 
control systems include the elements described below:

Element

Approach and basis for assurance

Risk management

Financial reporting

Budgeting and 
forecasting

Delegation of 
authority and 
approval limits

Segregation  
of duties

Details of our governance structure can be found in the Risk management section of this Annual Report.  
Risk management operates throughout all levels of our governance structure. The Board as a whole is accountable  
for risk management. The day-to-day responsibility for managing key risks resides with the Operational Leadership 
Team (‘OLT’). Assurance over the effectiveness of risk management activity is provided under the three lines of  
defence model as described below.

Reports on the effectiveness of risk management and internal controls are presented to executive management  
at monthly Risk Forum meetings, to the Audit Committee, and to the Board. 

The Risk Forum agenda includes risk-based ‘deep dives’ into key risk areas and in the last year these have included: 
crisis management; enterprise risk management; cyber security; audit and corporate governance reform;  
FCA Consumer Duty; IT controls over key financial applications; and financial controls at Autorama.

Key risks and controls are documented in a Group risk register with OLT members designated as risk owners. A review 
of the Group risk register is undertaken on a quarterly basis. The process for reviewing and updating the risk register 
is facilitated by the Governance, Risk and Compliance function and overseen by the Board.

A risk-based internal audit programme provides independent, third-line assurance over the effectiveness of the risk 
management arrangements and this year’s internal audit plan included reviews of the following areas: IT General 
Controls; FCA Consumer Duty readiness; and key financial controls at Autorama.

Group consolidation is performed on a monthly basis with a month-end pack produced that includes an income 
statement, balance sheet, cash flow and detailed analysis. The pack also includes KPIs and these are reviewed  
by the OLT and the Board. Results are compared against the Plan or re-forecast and narrative is provided by 
management to explain significant variances.

The effectiveness of the controls within the financial reporting and consolidation process is reviewed on a quarterly 
basis by the Governance, Risk and Compliance function. The Risk Forum reviews and oversees these reports.

An annual Plan is produced and monthly results are reported against this. The Plan is prepared using a bottom-up 
approach, informed by a high-level assessment of market and economic conditions. Reviews are performed by the 
OLT and the Board. The Plan is also compared to the top-down Medium Term Plan (‘MTP’) as a sense check. The Plan 
is approved by the OLT and the Board.

A detailed monthly rolling forecast is produced, with inputs provided from all business owners. The rolling forecast  
is then used to help identify potential risks and opportunities by comparison to the original budget plan. A business 
review then takes place with the relevant OLT member, COO and CFO to agree actions.

A documented structure of delegated authorities and approval for transactions is maintained within the Board’s 
Terms of Reference. This is reviewed regularly by management to ensure it remains appropriate for the business.

Procedures are defined to segregate duties over significant transactions, including: procurement, payments to suppliers, 
payroll, discounts and refunds. Regular reviews of IT system access take place to ensure that segregated duties 
remain enforced. Key reconciliations are prepared and reviewed on a monthly basis to ensure accurate reporting.

Internal audit
Deloitte were the Group’s outsourced Internal Audit function. The Internal Audit function is accountable to the Audit Committee and uses a 
risk-based approach to provide independent assurance over the adequacy and effectiveness of the control environment. The internal audit 
work plan for 2022/23 included internal audit assignments in relation to the following areas of risk:

•  Follow up into the timeliness and appropriateness of responses to previous internal audit recommendations.
•  IT General Controls over key financial applications.
•  Key financial controls at Autorama.
•  Readiness for the FCA Consumer Duty across Auto Trader Ltd and Autorama UK Limited.

In 2023, following a competitive tender exercise, the provision of co-source Internal Audit services was awarded to BDO LLP. Under the 
co-source arrangement, BDO will continue to report to the Audit Committee. The arrangements with BDO will enable the Group to leverage 
existing internal resource to provide assurance over core areas of risk, and also leverage BDO’s expertise and independence. 

The risk-based internal audit plan for FY24 was approved by the Audit Committee and covers a broad range of core financial and operational 
processes and controls, focusing on specific risk areas. Whilst the plan has been approved, the Audit Committee will continue to review  
it regularly to ensure that any new and emerging significant areas of risk are considered. 

Management actions that are recommended following the internal audits are tracked to completion and reviewed by the Risk Forum and 
then by the Audit Committee to ensure that identified risks are mitigated in a timely manner. 

Without management present, the Committee met with both Deloitte and the newly appointed BDO. The Committee has also met with 
management without the presence of Deloitte or BDO. There were no significant issues raised during these meetings.

A risk-based programme of key controls testing takes place on a quarterly basis. We continue to monitor the resource within our 
Governance, Risk and Compliance function to ensure that we are able to meet future requirements which may arise following the BEIS 
consultation into the future of audit and corporate governance.

External auditor
The Committee oversees the relationship with the external auditor, KPMG, and reviews their findings in respect of audit and review work. The 
Committee received and discussed KPMG’s review of the half-year report to 30 September 2022 and their audit of the financial statements 
for the year to 31 March 2023. The Committee met with KPMG without management present and with management without KPMG present,  
to ensure that there were no issues in the relationship between management and the external auditor to be addressed. There were none.

One of the Committee’s roles is to evaluate the quality and effectiveness of audit services provided, and the level of professional scepticism 
applied. The Committee has carried out a review based on discussion of audit scope and plans, materiality assessments, review of auditor’s 
reports and feedback from management on the effectiveness of the audit process. The review concluded that the external auditor 
remained effective and applied professional scepticism throughout. The review of the audit report and feedback from management also 
confirmed that the external auditor challenged management’s judgements and estimates where necessary.

The Committee is also responsible for ensuring the external auditor remains independent. The Committee has reviewed, and is satisfied 
with, the independence of KPMG as the external auditor. In particular, discussions have been held with KPMG’s senior management to verify 
the Group’s audit partner’s performance and standing within KPMG. There were no conflicts or matters of concern conveyed. The year 
ended 31 March 2023 was the third year the Group’s audit partner has been involved in the audit of the Group.

Auto Trader Group plc  Annual Report and Financial Statements 2023

Non-audit services provided by the external auditor
The external auditor is primarily engaged to carry out statutory audit work. There may be other services where the external auditor is 
considered to be the most suitable supplier by reference to their skills and experience. It is the Group’s practice that it will seek quotes from 
more than one firm, which may include KPMG, before engagements for non-audit projects are awarded. Contracts are awarded based on 
individual merits. A policy is in place for the provision of non-audit services by the external auditor, to ensure that the provision of such services 
does not impair the external auditor’s independence or objectivity, and will be assessed in line with FRC Ethical and Auditing Standards.

Non-audit service

Policy

Audit-related services directly related to the audit 
For example, the review of interim financial statements, 
compliance certificates and reports to regulators.

Prohibited services 
In line with the EU Audit Reform, services where the auditor’s 
objectivity and independence may be compromised. Prohibited 
services are detailed in the FRC Revised Ethical Standard 2019 and 
include tax services, accounting services, internal audit services, 
valuation services and financial systems consultancy.

Pre-approval by the Committee is required for all non-audit 
services. Permissible services may be approved to a maximum of 
£100,000 for each individual engagement, and to a maximum 
aggregate in any financial year of 70% of the average audit fees 
paid to the audit firm in the last three consecutive years. 

Prohibited, with the exception of certain services which are subject to 
derogation if certain conditions are met and will be assessed going 
forward in line with the new FRC Ethical and Auditing Standards.

Refer to plc.autotrader.co.uk/investors for full details of the policy. 

During the year, KPMG charged the Group £48,000 (2022: £43,841) for audit-related assurance services directly relating to the audit for the 
review of the Group’s interim report for the six months ended 30 September 2022.

The Statutory Audit Services for Large Companies Market Investigation (Mandatory Use of Competitive Tender Processes and Audit 
Committee Responsibilities) Order 2014 – statement of compliance
A competitive tender was carried out in 2016 and KPMG LLP were first appointed as statutory auditor for the year to March 2017. We have 
therefore complied with the requirement that the external audit contract is tendered within the 10 years prescribed by UK legislation and the 
Code’s recommendation. The Group confirms that it complied with the provisions of the Competition and Markets Authority’s Order for the 
financial year under review.

We continue to make 
good progress on  
setting our near-term  
and longer-term goals  
across all ESG matters, 
but we know there  
is still more to do.

Dear shareholders,
I am pleased to present the Report of the 
Corporate Responsibility Committee for  
March 2023.

The Committee was formed to oversee  
the progress towards fulfilling our 
Environmental, Social and Governance 
(‘ESG’) strategy. 

We recognise that our activities – and  
the way we carry them out – have impacts  
that reach well beyond our financial 
performance. Our business activities 
impact a wide range of stakeholders  
and we strive to make this impact  
a positive one.

Our progress in 2023
We continue to make good progress with  
our ESG strategy and our cultural KPIs:

Materiality assessment
In the prior year, the Group identified  
the ESG issues that mattered most to its 
stakeholders and where our ESG activities 
should focus. The Committee continues to 
support the areas identified by management 
as areas of focus: diversity and inclusion; 
employee wellbeing; engagement and 
safety; product innovation; customer 
satisfaction; and climate.

Auto Trader Group plc  Annual Report and Financial Statements 2023

Environmental strategy
The Committee has reviewed the Group’s 
environmental strategy and recognises the 
progress made during the year. Each of the 
pillars making up the environmental strategy 
has achieved key milestones and the 
Committee commends the positive progress 
made towards the Group’s ambitious targets.

Key achievements during the year include 
verification of our long-term (2040) net  
zero targets by the Science Based Targets 
initiative (‘SBTi’) and the achievement of the 
Platinum Award for Carbon Literacy (meaning 
80% of our employees are now certified).

We have continued to report consistently 
with the recommendations of the Task Force 
on Climate-related Financial Disclosures 
(‘TCFD’). As part of this, the Group has 
undertaken climate scenario analysis  
and refined its assessment of the risks  
and opportunities posed by climate change  
and how they might impact our business.  
The Committee has reviewed the analysis 
conducted and recognises that this analysis 
will need to continually evolve as the Group 
grows and changes and as we respond to  
the risks and opportunities identified.

In addition, the Group has undertaken work 
to understand the impact of the Autorama 
acquisition on the Group’s carbon footprint 
and has included them in the calculation  
of our GHG emissions for the year. Our GHG 
emissions have been audited by a third 
party, EcoAct, providing an assurance  
over our emissions reporting.

I am pleased to see the progress made in  
our aim to become the number one electric 
car destination and it is encouraging to see 
the Group meet significant milestones in  
this area. 

Looking ahead to next year, the Committee 
looks forward to seeing the Group’s progress 
with its carbon reduction plan – with the 
Group’s commitment to net zero and the 
increased volume of emissions as a result  
of the Autorama acquisition, a clear plan 
and focused action will be required if we  
are to achieve our ambitious target to be  
net zero by 2040. 

Non-financial reporting 
frameworks 
We continue to evolve our Environmental, 
Social and Governance (‘ESG’) 
reporting to meet the requirements  
of leading industry frameworks and  
our stakeholders’ expectations.  
Our reporting focuses on the Task  
Force on Climate-related Financial 
Disclosures (‘TCFD’) and the 
Sustainability Accounting Standards 
Board (‘SASB’) standards referencing 
the SASB’s reporting framework for the 
Internet and Media Services and Media 
& Entertainment industries. We have  
also identified the UN Sustainable 
Development Goals (‘SDGs’), which  
we believe Auto Trader can make  
a meaningful contribution to.

Measuring progress
We feel it is important to assess the  
progress being made across the Group’s 
commitments and goals. This is the third 
year that we have reported our cultural KPIs 
to sit alongside the existing financial and 
operational KPIs and I am pleased to see 
that there has been positive progress  
with all of our diversity and inclusion KPIs. 
Whilst they may seem like small changes 
year on year, we recognise meaningful 
change takes a number of years and the 
main focus has to be systemic change 
resulting in sustainable progress. 

It is encouraging to see that employee 
engagement scores remain high despite 
these challenging times.

Progress towards our net zero target will 
continue to be monitored throughout the 
year to ensure that the Group is on target  
to reach our goals.

Over the next year the Committee will continue 
to oversee and monitor the business’s 
commitments in relation to ESG and continue 
to push forward our ESG strategy. 

Jeni Mundy
Chair of the Corporate Responsibility 
Committee 
1 June 2023

Diversity and inclusion
There has been a growing emphasis on the 
‘Social’ pillar within ESG and I am pleased 
that the Group has continued to focus on 
and make progress to improve the diversity 
and inclusion within the organisation.  
The Group has targeted programmes for 
employees at different stages of their 
careers including early careers, mid-career 
and senior leaders. During the year, the 
Committee received an update on the 
Diverse Talent Accelerator programme and it 
is encouraging to see positive progress with 
a high proportion of participants benefiting 
from opportunities within the business.  
The Continuous Leadership Development 
programme launched during the year which 
is focused on supporting senior leaders 
within the business.

I am pleased that work has already begun  
to roll out our diversity and inclusion courses 
and initiatives within Autorama, including 
our ‘One Auto Trader’ workshops, and 
further work will continue in the coming year. 

As we face the additional challenges of  
a growing opportunity gap in the wake  
of COVID-19 and the cost of living crisis,  
Auto Trader is committed to ensuring 
everyone has the opportunity to succeed, 
regardless of their background, and this 
includes socio-economic diversity. This year 
we launched our Social Mobility Network. 
The Group has supported social mobility  
for a number of years and has made many 
changes to its outreach, recruitment, 
application and onboarding processes.  
The Social Mobility Network is committed  
to taking steps to boost opportunities at a 
time when social mobility is more challenging 
than ever. This commitment has been 
recognised by the Group being featured in 
the Top 75 Employers in the Social Mobility 
Index by the Social Mobility Foundation. 

Ongoing ESG training
During the year all Board members 
completed Carbon Literacy training  
– the course covers a broad range of  
climate change related topics and creates 
greater awareness of the carbon costs  
and impacts of everyday activities, as well 
as understanding how individuals and 
organisations can reduce their emissions. 

ESG continues to receive heightened 
stakeholder focus and disclosure 
requirements for companies continue to 
evolve, requiring companies to enhance and 
standardise their disclosures, particularly in 
relation to climate. In addition, as the Group 
continues to evolve its ESG strategy to 
incorporate risks and opportunities and their 
impact on the long-term business strategy,  
it is essential that the Committee remains 
abreast of ESG issues and regulation.  
To assist the Committee in successfully 
overseeing the Group’s ESG strategy,  
the Committee will continue to receive 
regular training and education as new ESG 
challenges and regulations emerge.

Annual statement by the Chair of the Remuneration Committee

Variable pay in 2024 
For 2024 we will continue with the approach 
we introduced for 2023 awards. The annual 
bonus for 2024 will continue to be based  
75% on Operating profit and 25% on strategic 
measures linked to the achievement  
of stretching strategic and operational 
milestones against our digital retailing 
objectives. PSP awards granted in 2023  
will again be based on 70% Operating  
profit growth, 20% Revenue growth, and 10% 
Carbon reduction targets, with an underpin 
linked to progress on our diversity ambitions. 
The PSP targets are disclosed in full on 
page 82 onwards.

I hope that you will support our Directors’ 
remuneration report at the AGM in 
September. I will be available at the AGM  
to answer any questions. Over the next year, 
we will be undertaking a review of our Directors’ 
Remuneration Policy, and will consult with our 
shareholders prior to proposing any changes. 
In the meantime, I welcome any feedback 
that you may have, which can be submitted  
to ir@autotrader.co.uk.

Jill Easterbrook
Chair of the Remuneration Committee 
1 June 2023

Dear shareholders,
I am pleased to present, on behalf of the 
Board, the Report of the Remuneration 
Committee (the ‘Committee’) for the year 
ended 31 March 2023.

Performance and reward in 2023
Annual bonus 
As detailed in last year’s Directors’ 
remuneration report, the FY23 annual  
bonus was based 75% on Operating profit 
and 25% on progress made against our 
digital retailing strategy. Performance  
was measured excluding the impact of the 
acquisition of Autorama and the disposal  
of Webzone Limited (trading as ‘Carzone’)  
to allow for a like-for-like comparison with 
the original targets set. 

However, in order to recognise that the 
performance of Autorama has disappointed 
compared to initial expectations, the 
Committee has reduced the bonus outcome 
by 7.9%. The Committee determined this 
reduction taking into account the level of 
performance versus initial expectations. 
Following these adjustments, the Operating 
profit element of the award will vest at 54.9% 
out of a maximum of 75%. The Committee 
assessed that the stretching digital retailing 
strategic and operational milestones were 
met at a level that justified a payout of  
17.5% out of a maximum of 25%.The overall 
bonus payout is therefore 72.4%, which the 
Committee believes is a fair reflection of  
the performance during the year.

Performance Share Plan (‘PSP’)
PSP awards granted in 2020 will vest in 
August 2023 based on performance over  
the three years to 31 March 2023. The awards 
were based 100% on relative total shareholder 
return (‘TSR’) compared to the FTSE 350 
(excluding investment trusts). These awards 
were granted during the COVID-19 pandemic, 
when, due to the uncertainty at the time  
it was considered very challenging to set 
robust and fair financial targets for the  
PSP and therefore the Committee took  
the approach to base the awards solely  
on TSR to ensure our focus on long-term 
recovery rather than short to medium-term 
performance. As detailed on page 88, 
relative TSR was below the threshold 
requirement, and this resulted in 0% of  
the award vesting. 

When reviewing the PSP outcome the 
Committee recognised that management 
has performed extraordinarily well over the 
last three years. For much of the performance 
period this award was tracking to achieve 
some level of vesting. However, relative TSR 
performance is measured versus the general 
FTSE 350 market and Auto Trader has recently 
suffered with the cross-sector impact on share 
prices in the tech sector which meant TSR 
performance fell below median at the end  
of the performance period. The Committee 
reviewed performance relative to our TSR 
tech sector peers, which would have resulted 
in some vesting of the award. However, given 
shareholder sensitivity we have decided not 
to apply positive discretion in this case.

Performance and reward in 2024
Our 2024 salary review
During the year, the Board and Committee were 
mindful of the challenging circumstances in the 
macro-economic environment as inflation 
began to rise and the cost of living crisis 
began to impact daily life. The Board was 
conscious that these pressures were impacting 
all employees, in particular those on lower 
salaries. Allowance is being made for this  
in the annual pay review, which will weight 
increases towards employees on lower 
incomes, with the lowest paid employees 
planned to receive on average c.9% and  
with a planned average overall increase of 
c.6%, which is higher than in previous years.  
In addition, a one-off payment of £700 per 
employee (excluding the OLT and the Board) 
was made in December 2022.

Having taken into account the above, the 
Committee approved salary increases of  
5% for the Executive Directors and for the 
Chair, which is below the planned average 
Company-wide pay increase of c.6% for 
2024. The Board also approved increases  
of 5% to Non-Executive Director fees. 

As referenced in my 2022 statement,  
and detailed further in the Nomination 
Committee report, the Board is in the 
process of implementing the succession 
plan for the Chair and the Non-Executive 
Directors that were on the Board at IPO.  
The Committee has noted that the current 
Chair’s fee is significantly behind market 
practice, and therefore this will be increased 
on appointment of the incoming Chair. 
Similarly, the Board has reviewed the  
current Non-Executive Director fees and  
will also apply market-based increases to 
the Committee Chair fees within the coming 
year. Further details of the new fees are set 
out on page 86.

2.  Compound annual growth rate targets have been set as three-year growth targets with reference to performance for 31 March 2023 as the base year. Operating 
profit will be based on Group operating profit, but excluding the impact of the deferred consideration charges in relation to the acquisition of Autorama, which  
are being spread over 2023 and 2024. This approach provides a like-for-like comparison for assessing performance across the three-year performance period.

3.  Revenue will be based on Group revenue, but excluding Vehicle & Accessory Sales attributable to Autorama, as this revenue does not generate any profit.

shares, until the guideline 
level is met. 

Post-cessation: following 
stepping down from the  
Board, Executive Directors  
will normally be expected  
to maintain a minimum 
shareholding of 200% of  
salary (or actual shareholding 
if lower) for two years. The 
Committee retains discretion 
to waive this guideline if it is not 
considered to be appropriate 
in the specific circumstance.

The vesting under any of the performance conditions will  
be subject to a diversity underpin. 

The Committee will determine whether there has been 
acceptable progress made against the key gender and ethnic 
diversity objectives, including considering the proportion  
of our staff who are women and who are ethnically diverse as 
well as the proportion of leadership4 who are women and who 
are ethnically diverse. 

In assessing whether the underpin has been satisfied,  
the Committee will consider a range of quantitative and 
qualitative benchmarks to inform its decision, including ‘how’ 
performance has been achieved and ‘what’ performance  
has been achieved over the performance period. 

Should the Committee consider that the underpin has not been 
met, the Committee would consider whether a discretionary 
reduction in the number of shares vesting was required.

1.  Compound annual growth rate targets have been set as three-year growth targets with reference to performance for 31 March 2023 as the base year. Operating 

profit will be based on Group operating profit, but excluding the impact of the deferred consideration charges in relation to the acquisition of Autorama, which are 
being spread over 2023 and 2024. This approach provides a like-for-like comparison for assessing performance across the three-year performance period.

2.  Revenue will be based on Group revenue, but excluding Vehicle & Accessory Sales attributable to Autorama, as this revenue does not generate any profit. 
3.  Carbon emissions are calculated based on the financial consolidation approach as defined in the Greenhouse Gas Protocol, and include emissions from Scopes 1, 2 

and 3. Our total carbon emissions for the year to 31 March 2023 (the base year) have been independently verified. Refer to page 34 for further details.

4.  Leadership is defined as the Operational Leadership Team (‘OLT’) and their direct reports (‘OLT-1’).

The Committee set these targets taking into account internal and external expectations of performance and organic growth of the 
business. The Committee believes that these targets are appropriately stretching. For performance between the threshold and stretch 
targets, vesting will be calculated on a pro-rata basis. There is no vesting for performance below the threshold target.

As noted on page 34, our carbon emissions for 2023 were impacted by the acquisition of Autorama, as we are required to account for the 
projected life time carbon emissions of vehicles purchased and held temporarily on the balance sheet. To the extent that our approach to the 
purchase of vehicles changes during the performance period, which would impact our disclosed carbon emissions, the Committee would review 
the targets set to ensure that they remain stretching. The carbon reduction targets set are consistent with our original commitment set in 2022  
to reduce our carbon emissions by 90% by 2040.

Each element will be assessed independently of the other at the end of the performance period. In line with best practice and shareholder 
expectations the Committee will then consider the wider context and retains the discretion to adjust the payout from the PSP if it is not 
considered to be reflective of underlying financial or non-financial performance of the business or the performance of the individual over the 
performance period or where the outcome is not considered appropriate in the context of the experience of shareholders or other stakeholders.

UK Corporate Governance Code
The Directors’ Remuneration Policy has been developed taking into account the following principles as recommended in the revised 2018 UK 
Corporate Governance Code:

•  Clarity: The Policy is designed to allow our remuneration arrangements to be structured such that they clearly support, in a sustainable 

way, the financial and strategic objectives of the Company. The Committee remains committed to reporting on its remuneration 
practices in a transparent, balanced and understandable way.

•  Simplicity: The Policy consists of three main elements: fixed pay (salary, benefits and pension), an annual bonus and a long-term incentive 
award. The metrics used in our incentive plans directly link back to our key strategic ambitions and values and provide a clear link to the 
shareholder experience. The Committee may change measures for future years to ensure they continue to be aligned with our strategy. 
•  Risk: The Policy is in line with our risk appetite. A robust malus and clawback policy is in place, and the Committee has the discretion  
to reduce pay outcomes where these are not considered to represent overall Company performance or the shareholder experience. 
Furthermore, our bonus deferral, post-cessation shareholding requirement and PSP holding period ensure that Executive Directors  
are motivated to deliver sustainable performance. 

•  Predictability: The Committee considers the impact of various performance outcomes on incentive levels when determining quantum. 

These can be seen as part of the Directors’ Remuneration Policy in the 2021 Annual Report and Financial Statements. 

•  Proportionality: A substantial portion of the package comprises performance-based reward, which is linked to our strategic priorities 
and underpinned by a robust target-setting process. We are mindful of the alignment with our workforce, the shareholder experience 
and our values and culture when considering the right and proportional approach to pay. 

•  Alignment to culture: When developing our Policy, the Committee reviewed our approach to remuneration throughout the organisation 

to ensure that arrangements are appropriate in the context of the wider workforce. The themes considered include workforce 
demographics, engagement levels and diversity to ensure that executive remuneration is appropriate from a cultural perspective.  
Our 2024 PSP award includes carbon reduction objectives with the vesting of the award subject to a diversity underpin.

Recovery and withholding provisions
Recovery and withholding provisions apply to variable pay, to enable the Company to recover amounts paid under the annual bonus and 
PSP in the event of the following negative events occurring within three years of the payment of a cash bonus, the grant date of an award 
under the DABP or the vesting date of PSP awards: 

•  a material misstatement of, or restatement to, the audited financial statements or other data; 
•  an error in calculation leading to over-payment of bonus; 
•  individual gross misconduct;
•  serious reputational damage;
•  corporate failure; or
•  any other circumstance which the Committee considers is similar in nature or effect.

Should such an event be suspected, there will be a further two years in which the Committee may investigate the event. The amount to be 
recovered would generally be the excess payment over the amount which would otherwise be paid, and recovery may be satisfied in a variety of 
ways, including through the reduction of outstanding deferred awards, reduction of the net bonus or PSP vesting and seeking a cash repayment.

Service contracts and policy for payments on loss of office
The service contracts for the Executive Directors are terminable by either the Company or the Executive Director on 12 months’ notice and 
make provision for early termination by way of payment of a cash sum equal to 12 months’ salary and pension. The Company may continue  
to provide benefits until the end of the notice period or may make a payment to the value of 12 months’ contractual benefits. 

Payment in lieu of notice can be paid either as a lump sum or in equal monthly instalments over the notice period and will normally be subject 
to mitigation. The Committee will consider the particular circumstances of each leaver and retains flexibility as to at what point, and the 
extent to which, payments are reduced.

The Executive Directors are subject to annual re-election at the AGM. Service contracts are available for inspection at the Company’s 
registered office or on request from ir@autotrader.co.uk. The CEO’s service contract date is 1 April 2017, the CFO’s service contract date  
is 1 March 2020, and the COO’s service contract date is 1 May 2019.

The Non-Executive Directors receive a basic Board fee, 
with additional fees payable for chairing the Audit, 
Remuneration and Corporate Responsibility Committees 
and for performing the Senior Independent Director role.

Fees were reviewed and will be increased by 5% with 
effect from 1 July 2023 as follows:

for the additional fees have been reviewed and will  
be increased as the succession plan is implemented.

All Non-Executive Directors have letters of appointment with the Company for an initial period of three years, subject to annual re-appointment 
at the AGM. Appointment is terminable on six months’ written notice. The appointment letters for the Non-Executive Directors provide that

1.  Performance against annual bonus targets resulted in an overall outcome of 72.4% of maximum. 
2.  0% of PSP awards granted in 2020 will vest in 2023 for performance over the three-year period to 31 March 2023. The award was based 100% on Relative Total 

Shareholder Return (‘TSR’) compared to the FTSE 350 (excluding investment trusts). These awards were granted during the COVID-19 pandemic and due to the 
uncertainty at the time it was considered very challenging to set robust and fair financial targets for the PSP and therefore the awards were based solely on  
TSR to ensure our focus on long-term recovery rather than short to medium-term performance.
3.  Catherine Faiers works a 4.5 day working week and her salary has been pro-rated accordingly.

1.  Catherine Faiers works a 4.5 day working week and her salary has been pro-rated accordingly. 
2.  50.1% of PSP awards granted in 2019 vested in 2022 for performance over the three-year period to 31 March 2022. In last year’s report, for the purpose of the single 
figure the vested shares were valued based on the three-month average share price to 31 March 2022 of 663.06p, giving a value of £457k for Nathan Coe, £318k for 
Catherine Faiers, and £109k for Jamie Warner including dividend equivalents. The amounts in the table above have been revalued based on the share price on the 
date of vesting of 584.24p. 4% of the vested value is due to share price appreciation since the date of award. 

3.  Jamie Warner was granted 1,009 shares under the Company’s Save As You Earn scheme, at a discount of 20% to the market price. The total value of the discount  

was £1,484 and has been included in the ‘Other’ column above.

4.  Jamie Warner’s long-term incentive vesting in the year was granted before he joined the plc Board.
5.  Jasvinder Gakhal was appointed to the Board on 1 January 2022.

1.  To allow for comparison with the original targets set the Committee excluded the impact of the acquisition of Autorama during the year and therefore has used the 

Auto Trader segmental Operating profit. 

2.  The Committee has added back an element to reflect the expected performance of Webzone Limited, as included in the target, had the disposal not occurred.
3.  Whilst the performance of Autorama has been excluded from the performance calculation to ensure like-for-like performance with the targets set, in order to 

recognise the performance of Autorama, an operating loss of £11.2m compared to initial expectations (at the bottom of the range) of a loss of £7m, the Committee 
has reduced the bonus outcome by 7.9%.

Operating profit is a key performance indicator of the business and the Board believes continuing to deliver Operating profit performance 
will generate long-term value for shareholders. Adjustments were made by the Committee to allow like-for-like comparison with the targets 
set, as set out in the table above. The Committee also exercised its discretion to reflect Autorama’s performance.

In 2022, the Committee decided that 25% of the annual bonus would be determined based on progress relating to our digital retailing 
strategy which would involve consideration of a range of quantitative and qualitative indicators, the achievement of stretching strategic 
and operational milestones against our digital retailing pillar and measures relating to engagement of car buyers and retailer customers. 
These milestones have been assessed based on the Committee’s holistic assessment of progress made. In reviewing performance in  
FY23, the Committee considered that during the year, the business successfully executed the completion of Deal Builder, one of the largest 
and most complex product development projects in the Company’s history, enabling our car retailer customers to provide a complete 
transactional service to car buyers on the Auto Trader platform. The product was launched in summer 2022 as a trial with selected retailers. 
This has now started to scale, and so by the end of the financial year there were over 50 retailers live and over 200 deals submitted in the year, 
with encouraging conversion rates and positive feedback from both consumers and retailers. Overall, the Committee concluded that the 
operational development and delivery of the software build had been exceptional, and satisfactory progress was being made towards 
commercialisation. Based on these achievements, the Committee assessed performance under the digital retailing strategy milestones  
to be at a level that results in an award of 17.5% out of the possible 25% of the overall maximum bonus. 

The overall bonus payout is therefore 72.4%. 

Performance Share Plan vesting for year ended 31 March 2023 (audited)
The PSP award granted in 2020 was based on performance to 31 March 2023. The performance conditions this award was based on and the 
targets and performance delivered are set out in the table below:

When reviewing the PSP outcome the Committee recognised that management has performed extraordinarily well over the last three years, 
and for much of the performance period this award was tracking to achieve some level of vesting. However, relative TSR performance is 
measured versus the general FTSE 350 market and Auto Trader has recently suffered with the cross-sector impact on share prices in the  
tech sector which meant TSR performance fell below median at the end of the performance period. The Committee reviewed performance 
relative to our TSR tech sector peers, which would have resulted in some vesting of the award. However, given shareholder sensitivity we 
have decided not to apply positive discretion in this case. 

Overall, the Committee considers that the Remuneration Policy has operated as it was intended during 2022/23. The performance-driven 
focus of our total remuneration directly supports the sustainable long-term success of the business.

1.  PSP awards will normally be eligible to vest three years from grant (23 June 2022) based on performance over the three years to 31 March 2025 and continued 

employment. The net value of the vested awards is subject to a two-year holding period.

2.  As disclosed last year, face value was calculated based on the three-month average share price to the day before grant date (23 June 2022) of 594.8p. This approach 
has been used to smooth out share price volatility and ensure that the number of shares awarded is not overly impacted by short-term changes in the share price.

The vesting under any of the performance conditions  
will be subject to a diversity underpin.

The Committee will determine whether there has been 
acceptable progress made against the key gender and ethnic 
diversity objectives, including considering the proportion  
of our staff who are women and who are ethnically diverse  
as well as the proportion of leadership who are women and 
who are ethnically diverse.

In assessing whether the underpin has been satisfied, the 
Committee will consider a range of quantitative and 
qualitative benchmarks to inform its decision, including ‘how’ 
performance has been achieved and ‘what’ performance has 
been achieved over the performance period.

Should the Committee consider that the underpin has not been 
met, it would consider whether a discretionary reduction in the 
number of shares vesting was required.

1. 

 Operating profit and Revenue growth measures will be assessed excluding Autorama, Group central costs and with Webzone Limited removed from the base year, 
being the year ended 31 March 2022. This approach provides a like-for-like comparison for assessing performance across the three-year performance period.

When determining vesting the Committee will consider the overall experience of shareholders and wider stakeholders over the 
performance period.

Directors’ shareholding and share interests (audited)
Executive Directors are required to maintain a shareholding in the Company equivalent in value to 200% of salary. If an Executive Director 
does not meet the guideline, they will be expected to retain at least half of the net shares vesting under the Company’s discretionary 
share-based employee incentive schemes until the guideline is met. Non-Executive Directors do not have shareholding guidelines.

The table below sets out the number of shares held or potentially held by Directors (including their connected persons where relevant)  
as at 31 March 2023. There have been no changes in these interests up until 1 June 2023.

CEO pay ratio
The table below shows the ratio between the CEO’s total single figure (as calculated on the previous page) and the median, lower and upper 
quartile total remuneration for our UK-based workforce. Our median all-employee to CEO pay ratio is 26.9.

A significant proportion of the CEO’s pay is in the form of variable pay through the annual bonus and the PSP. CEO pay will therefore vary 
year on year based on Company and share price performance. The CEO to all-employee pay ratio will therefore also fluctuate taking this 
into account. 

It should be noted that the pay ratio when comparing 2022 to 2023 has reduced, due to the fact the CEO’s single figure of remuneration in 
2022 included an annual bonus and a PSP award vesting. However, in 2023, only the annual bonus paid out, as the PSP award vested at 0%.  
In 2023 our figures also included Autorama UK Limited employees. As part of the integration into Auto Trader, we are working on the alignment  
of benefits to ensure a consistent offering. 

The Board has confirmed that the ratio is consistent with the Company’s wider policies on employee pay, reward and progression, and is 
appropriate for the Company’s size and structure.

–  Method A has been used to determine the relevant employees on the basis that this approach is in line with the approach used to calculate the single total figure  

for the CEO and therefore is the most robust.

–  For 2023, Autorama UK Limited employees have been included in the figures.
–  For 2023, the salary for the P25 employee was £29,736 and total remuneration was £34,995. The salary for the P50 employee was £42,250 and total remuneration  

was £47,649. The salary for the P75 employee was £61,625 and total remuneration was £70,227.

–  The P25, P50 and P75 employees were determined as at 31 March 2023 based on full-time equivalent remuneration. Only employees who were employed as at  

the end of the financial year were included; salaries were annualised, taking account of mid-year increases. The total remuneration includes salary, allowances, 
taxable benefits, pension contributions, bonus, commission and share-based payments. Taxable benefits are based on the previous tax year (2021–2022) for 
company cars and the latest tax year (2022–2023) for healthcare benefits. Options under the SAYE scheme are included as at the date of grant, based on the 
difference between the market value at grant date and the exercise price. Options under discretionary plans (PSP and Single Incentive Plan Award) are based  
on the date that the performance conditions were achieved, and valued using the three-month average share price to 31 March 2023 of 588.34p.

–  For 2020, the CEO single figure reflects amounts to Trevor Mather (stepped down 29 February 2020) and Nathan Coe (appointed CEO 1 March 2020) for their 

respective time in service.

–  The 2022 CEO pay ratio figures have been updated to reflect the change to the CEO total single figure of remuneration for the year ended 31 March 2022,  

following the revalued PSP award based on share price on date of vesting.

Year-on-year change in pay for Directors compared to the average employee

1.  Ed Williams and David Keens voluntarily waived their entire fees from 1 April 2020 to 30 June 2020. The remaining Board members voluntarily waived 50% of their 

salaries and fees from 1 April 2020 to 30 June 2020.

2.  Nathan Coe was appointed as CEO on 1 March 2020 and his base salary increased on that date from £377,000 to £568,000. 
3.  Catherine Faiers was appointed to the Board on 1 May 2020 and therefore her reported salary for 2020 represents only 11 months. Further, Catherine became  

part-time from 1 September 2020 and therefore her salary was pro-rated from that date to reflect her 4.5 day working week.

4.  Jamie Warner was appointed to the Board on 1 March 2020 and therefore his reported salary for 2020 represents only one month. 
5.  Jeni Mundy was appointed Chair of the Corporate Responsibility Committee from 1 January 2021 and received an additional fee of £9,742 per annum from that date.
6.  Sigga Sigurdardottir was appointed to the Board on 1 November 2019 and therefore her reported fee for 2020 represents only five months.
7.  Jasvinder Gakhal was appointed to the Board on 1 January 2022.
8.  100% value shown as no bonus was paid for 2021.
9.  For the purpose of the annual bonus this relates to performance related schemes only and therefore figures exclude any cost of living payments made to all 

employees during the year.

10. The decrease in benefits relates to a reduction in our private medical insurance premiums.

Fees for the Chair and Non-Executive Directors
Fees for the Chair and Non-Executive Directors were reviewed in early 2023 and will be increased by 5% with effect from 1 July 2023. 

As set out in the Nomination Committee report, the Board is in the process of implementing the succession plan for the Chair and the NEDs 
that were on the Board at IPO. The fee for the Chair role was set at IPO reflecting the size and complexity of the business at that time and the 
Chair’s equity stake in the business; it has not been increased significantly during his tenure. Since IPO the Company has grown significantly 
and the complexity of its operations has increased, such that the current Chair’s fee is significantly behind market practice. Therefore the 
Remuneration Committee has reviewed the fee and has approved that the fee for the incoming Chair will be set at £325,000. Furthermore, 
the Board has reviewed the current NED fees, and has concluded that whilst the base fees are deemed to be appropriate, the additional SID 
and Committee Chair fees are similarly positioned towards the lower end of market practice. Therefore the Board has decided that when 
the next new Non-Executive Director is appointed, the Committee Chair fees will be increased to £18,500, and the SID fee will be increased  
to £12,500 at the same time. 

The following table sets out the new fees in financial year 2024 compared to those which applied in financial year 2023, and the new fees  
to be applied to new appointees during the year:

Funding of equity awards
Share awards may be funded by a combination of newly issued shares, treasury shares and shares purchased in the market. Where shares 
are newly issued or from treasury, the Company complies with Investment Association dilution guidelines on their issue. The current dilution 
usage of all share plans is c. 1.14% of shares in issue. 

Where shares are purchased in the market, these will be held by a trust, in which case the voting rights relating to the shares are exercisable  
by the Trustees in accordance with their fiduciary duties. At 31 March 2023, the trust held 340,196 shares in respect of the Share Incentive Plan.

External directorships
Auto Trader recognises that its Executive Directors may be invited to become non-executive directors of other companies. Such non-executive 
duties can broaden a Director’s experience and knowledge which can benefit Auto Trader. Following the year end, Catherine Faiers has  
been appointed as a Non-Executive Director of Allegro.eu Group. The Board approved the directorship in advance to ensure that there was  
no conflict of interest, and the Remuneration Committee approved that Catherine will retain the remuneration from the appointment. 

Membership of the Committee
Jill Easterbrook is the Committee Chair, and its other members are David Keens, Jeni Mundy, Sigga Sigurdardottir and Jasvinder Gakhal. Refer to 
pages 64 and 80 for further details of the membership of the Committee, the Terms of Reference, the meetings held and activities during the year.

External advisors
During the year the Committee received advice from Deloitte who were appointed in October 2017 following a competitive tender process. 
Deloitte are founding members of the Remuneration Consultants Code of Conduct and adhere to this Code in their dealings with the 
Committee. The Committee is satisfied that the advice provided by Deloitte is objective and independent. The Committee is comfortable 
that the members of the Deloitte team that provide remuneration advice to the Committee do not have connections with the Company  
or its Directors that may impair their independence. The Committee reviewed the potential for conflicts of interest and judged that there 
were appropriate safeguards against such conflicts.

Fees are charged on a time and materials basis. During the year Deloitte was paid £37,600 excluding VAT for advice provided to the 
Committee. Deloitte provided additional services to the Company in relation to internal audit, debt advisory and tax services.

All other Directors will stand for election  
or re-election at the 2023 AGM in line with

Appointment and replacement of Directors
At each AGM each Director then in office

conclusion of the meeting. When a Director 
retires at an AGM in accordance with the 
Articles of Association of the Company,  
the Company may, by ordinary resolution  
at the meeting, fill the office being vacated  
by re-electing the retiring Director. In the 
absence of such a resolution, the retiring 
Director shall nevertheless be deemed to 
have been re-elected, except in the cases 
identified by the Articles.

Results and dividends
The Group’s and Company’s audited 
financial statements for the year are set out 
on pages 98 to 162.

The Company declared an interim dividend 
on 10 November 2022 of 2.8 pence per share 
which was paid on 27 January 2023.

The Directors recommend payment of a final 
dividend of 5.6 pence per share ( 2022: 5.5 
pence) to be paid on 22 September 2023  
to shareholders on the register of members 
at the close of business on 25 August 2023, 
subject to approval at the 2023 AGM.

Share capital and control
The Company’s issued share capital 
comprises ordinary shares of £0.01 each 
which are listed on the London Stock 
Exchange (LSE: AUTO.L). The ISIN of the 
shares is GB00BVYVFW23.

During the year, 12,893 additional shares 
were allotted for a consideration of £3.49 
per share in relation to the exercise of share 
options under the Company’s SAYE scheme. 

The issued share capital of the Company  
as at 31 March 2023 comprised 923,074,657 
shares of £0.01 each, and 4,371,505 shares 
were held in treasury. As at 1 June 2023,  
the issued share capital of the Company 
comprises 919,118,475 shares of £0.01 each, 
and 4,306,497 shares held in treasury.

Further information regarding the Company’s 
issued share capital and details of the 
movements in issued share capital during the 
year are provided in note 26 to the Group’s 
financial statements. All the information 
detailed in note 26 forms part of this Directors’ 
report and is incorporated into it by reference.

Details of employee share schemes  
are provided in note 30 to the Group 
financial statements.

Authority to allot shares
Under the 2006 Act, the Directors may  
only allot shares if authorised to do so by 
shareholders in a general meeting. At the 
2022 AGM, special resolution 16 conferred 
upon Directors the authority to allot ordinary 
shares up to a maximum nominal amount  
of £471,574 (47,157,400 shares), for cash,  
on a non-pre-emptive basis. 

In the Notice of the 2023 AGM (the ‘AGM Notice’), 
ordinary resolution 15 seeks a new authority 
to allow the Directors to allot ordinary shares 
representing approximately two thirds  
of the Company’s existing share capital  
as at the date of the AGM Notice, of which 
approximately one third of the Company’s 
issued ordinary share capital can only  
be allotted pursuant to a rights issue.  
In accordance with the revised Statement  
of Principles from the Pre-emption Group, 
special resolutions 16 and 17 seek a new 
authority to allow the Directors to allot 
ordinary shares on a non-pre-emptive  
basis up to a maximum of approximately  
10% of the Company’s existing share capital  
and special resolutions 16 and 17 seek a  
new authority to allow the Directors to allot 
ordinary shares on a non-pre-emptive basis 
in connection with an acquisition or specified 
capital investment, up to a further maximum 
of approximately 10% of the Company’s 
existing share capital at the date of the  
AGM Notice. 

Authority to purchase own shares
As described on page 25, the Company 
intends to continue its share buyback 
programme, under the authority passed  
at the 2022 AGM under which the Company 
is authorised to make market purchases of 
up to a maximum of 10% ( 94,314,767 shares)  
of its own ordinary shares (excluding shares 
held in treasury), subject to minimum and 
maximum price restrictions, either to be 
cancelled or retained as treasury shares. 
The Directors will seek to renew this 
authority at the forthcoming AGM.

Rights attaching to shares
All shares have the same rights (including 
voting and dividend rights and rights on  
a return of capital) and restrictions as  
set out in the Articles, described below. 
Except in relation to dividends which have 
been declared and rights on a liquidation  
of the Company, the shareholders have no 
rights to share in the profits of the Company. 
The Company’s shares are not redeemable. 
However, following any grant of authority 
from shareholders, the Company may 
purchase or contract to purchase any of  
the shares on or off market, subject to the 
Companies Act 2006 and the requirements 
of the Listing Rules.

No shareholder holds shares in the Company 
which carry special rights with regard to 
control of the Company. There are no shares 
relating to an employee share scheme which 
have rights with regard to control of the 
Company that are not exercisable directly 
and solely by the employees, other than in 
the case of the Auto Trader Group Share 
Incentive Plan, where share interests of a 
participant in such scheme can be exercised 
by the personal representatives of a 
deceased participant in accordance with 
the Scheme rules.

Voting rights
Each ordinary share entitles the holder to 
vote at general meetings of the Company.  
A resolution put to the vote of the meeting 
shall be decided on a show of hands, unless 
the Directors decide in advance that a  
poll will be conducted, or unless a poll is 
demanded at the meeting. On a show of 
hands, every member who is present in 
person or by proxy at a general meeting of 
the Company shall have one vote. On a poll, 
every member who is present in person or by 
proxy shall have one vote for every share of 
which they are a holder. The Articles provide 
a deadline for submission of proxy forms  
of not less than 48 hours before the time 
appointed for the holding of the meeting  
or adjourned meeting. No member shall  
be entitled to vote at any general meeting 
either in person or by proxy, in respect of  
any share held by the member, unless all 
amounts presently payable by the member 
in respect of that share have been paid. 
Save as noted, there are no restrictions on 
voting rights nor any agreement that may 
result in such restrictions.

Restrictions on transfer of securities
The Articles do not contain any restrictions 
on the transfer of ordinary shares in the 
Company other than the usual restrictions 
applicable where any amount is unpaid on a 
share. Certain restrictions are also imposed 
by laws and regulations (such as insider 
trading and marketing requirements relating 
to close periods) and requirements of the 
Company’s share dealing code whereby 
Directors and certain employees of the 
Company require approval to deal in the 
Company’s securities.

Strategic reportGovernanceFinancial statementsDirectors’ report continued

Change of control
Save in respect of a provision of the 
Company’s share schemes which may cause 
options and awards granted to employees 
under such schemes to vest on takeover, 
there are no agreements between the 
Company and its Directors or employees 
providing for compensation for loss of  
office or employment (whether through 
resignation, purported redundancy or 
otherwise) because of a takeover bid.

Significant contracts
The only significant agreement to which the 
Company is a party that takes effect, alters 
or terminates upon a change of control of the 
Company following a takeover bid, and the 
effect thereof, is the revolving credit facility 
agreement, which contains customary 
prepayment, cancellation and default 
provisions including, if required by a lender, 
mandatory prepayment of all utilisations 
provided by that lender upon the sale of all  
or substantially all of the business and assets 
of the Group or a change of control.

Transactions with related parties
Compensation paid to Directors and Key 
Management is as disclosed in note 8  
to the Group financial statements.

Research and development
Innovation, specifically in software, is a 
critical element of Auto Trader’s strategy 
and therefore of the future success of  
the Group. Accordingly, the majority of  
the Group’s research and development 
expenditure is predominantly related to this 
area. Since 30 September 2013, the Group 
has changed its approach to technology 
development such that the Group now 
develops its core infrastructure through 
small-scale, maintenance-like incremental 
improvements, and as a result the amount  
of capitalised development costs has 
decreased as less expenditure meets the 
requirements of IAS 38, Intangible Assets.

Indemnities and insurance
The Company maintains appropriate 
insurance to cover Directors’ and officers’ 
liability for itself and its subsidiaries and 
such insurance was in force for the whole  
of the financial year ending 31 March 2023. 
The Company also indemnifies the Directors 
under a qualifying indemnity for the purposes 
of Section 236 of the Companies Act 2006:  
in the case of the Non-Executive Directors in 
their respective letters of appointment and 
in the case of the Executive Directors in a 
separate deed of indemnity. Such indemnities 
contain provisions that are permitted by  
the Director Liability provisions of the 
Companies Act and the Company’s Articles.

Environmental
Information on the Group’s greenhouse  
gas emissions is set out in the Being a 
responsible business section on page 34  
and forms part of this report by reference.

Political donations
There were no political donations made 
during the year or the previous year.

Autorama UK Limited
As set out in note 31, on 22 June 2022,  
the Group acquired the entire share capital 
of Autorama UK Limited (‘Autorama’) for 
initial consideration of £150.0m, with an 
additional £50.0m which will be deferred 
until 22 June 2023 and settled in shares to  
the value of £50.0m, subject to employment 
and customary performance conditions.

External branches
The Group had no active registered external 
branches during the reporting period.

Financial instruments
Details of the financial risk management 
objectives and policies of the Group, 
including hedging policies and exposure  
of the entity to price risk, credit risk, liquidity 
risk and cash flow risk, are given in note 32  
to the Consolidated financial statements.

Disclosure of information to auditor
Each of the Directors has confirmed that:

•  so far as the Director is aware, there is  
no relevant audit information of which  
the Company’s auditor is unaware; and

•  the Director has taken all the steps  

that he/she ought to have taken as a 
Director to make him/herself aware of  
any relevant audit information and to 
establish that the Company’s auditor  
is aware of that information.

This confirmation is given and should  
be interpreted in accordance with the 
provisions of Section 418 of the Companies 
Act 2006.

Statement of Directors’ responsibilities  
in respect of the Annual Report and 
Financial Statements
The Directors are responsible for preparing 
the Annual Report and Financial Statements 
and the Group and parent company financial 
statements in accordance with applicable 
law and regulations.

Company law requires the Directors to 
prepare Group and parent company financial 
statements for each financial year. Under 
that law they are required to prepare the 
Group financial statements in accordance 
with UK-adopted international accounting 
standards and applicable law and have 
elected to prepare the parent company 
financial statements in accordance with 
United Kingdom Accounting Standards and 
applicable law, including Financial Reporting 
Standard 101 ‘Reduced Disclosure Framework’.

Approval of the Annual Report
The Strategic report and the Corporate 
governance report were approved by  
the Board on 1 June 2023.

Approved by the Board and signed  
on its behalf:

Claire Baty 
Company Secretary  
1 June 2023

In accordance with Disclosure Guidance  
and Transparency Rule 4.1.14R, the financial 
statements will form part of the annual 
financial report prepared using the single 
electronic reporting format under the TD 
ESEF Regulation and EU ESEF Regulation.  
The auditor’s report on these financial 
statements provides no assurance over  
the ESEF format.

Under company law the Directors must not 
approve the financial statements unless 
they are satisfied that they give a true and 
fair view of the state of affairs of the Group 
and parent company and of their profit or 
loss for that period. In preparing each of  
the Group and parent company financial 
statements, the Directors are required to:

•  select suitable accounting policies  
and then apply them consistently;
•  make judgements and accounting 

estimates that are reasonable, relevant, 
reliable and prudent;

•  for the Group financial statements,  

state whether they have been prepared  
in accordance with UK-adopted 
international accounting standards;

•  for the parent company financial 

statements, state whether applicable  
UK accounting standards have been 
followed, subject to any material 
departures disclosed and explained in 
the parent company financial statements; 

•  assess the Group and parent company’s 
ability to continue as a going concern, 
disclosing, as applicable, matters related 
to going concern; and

•  use the going concern basis of 

accounting unless they either intend  
to liquidate the Group or the parent company 
or to cease operations, or have no realistic 
alternative but to do so.

The Directors are responsible for keeping 
adequate accounting records that are 
sufficient to show and explain the parent 
company’s transactions and disclose with 
reasonable accuracy at any time the 
financial position of the parent company 
and enable them to ensure that its financial 
statements comply with the Companies Act 
2006. They are responsible for such internal 
control as they determine is necessary  
to enable the preparation of financial 
statements that are free from material 
misstatement, whether due to fraud or  
error, and have general responsibility for 
taking such steps as are reasonably open  
to them to safeguard the assets of the 
Group and to prevent and detect fraud  
and other irregularities.

Under applicable law and regulations,  
the Directors are also responsible for 
preparing a Strategic report, Directors’ 
report, Directors’ remuneration report  
and Corporate governance statement that 
complies with that law and those regulations.

The Directors are responsible for the 
maintenance and integrity of the corporate 
and financial information included on the 
Company’s website. Legislation in the UK 
governing the preparation and dissemination 
of financial statements may differ from 
legislation in other jurisdictions.

Responsibility statement of the Directors  
in respect of the annual financial report
We confirm, to the best of our knowledge:

•  the financial statements, prepared in 
accordance with the applicable set of 
accounting standards, give a true and  
fair view of the assets, liabilities, financial 
position and profit or loss of the Company 
and the undertakings included in the 
consolidation taken as a whole; 

•  the Strategic report/Directors’ report 

includes a fair review of the development 
and performance of the business and the 
position of the issuer and the undertakings 
included in the consolidation taken as a 
whole, together with a description of the 
principal risks and uncertainties that they 
face; and

•  we consider that the Annual Report  

and Accounts, taken as a whole, is fair, 
balanced and understandable and 
provides the information necessary  
for shareholders to assess the Group’s 
position and performance, business 
model and strategy.

Auto Trader Group plc  Annual Report and Financial Statements 2023

2. Overview of our audit

Factors driving our view of risks
On 22 June 2022 the Company acquired Autorama UK Limited. The identification and valuation of acquired intangible assets is a new 
significant audit risk of error and a key audit matter. This is due to the material values associated with the acquisition and the nature  
of the judgements and estimates which the Group is required to make to identify and fair value the intangible assets acquired.

We have identified a key audit matter relating to revenue recognition over Trade revenue. This is the main driver of the Group’s results  
and its size is reflected in the allocation of our resources in planning and executing the audit. Consistent with the prior year, we do not 
consider this to be a significant audit risk of material misstatement, as based on our cumulative audit experience, we have concluded 
that there is not a material judgement or estimation in Trade revenue recognition and no significant opportunity for fraudulent material 
misstatement, given the low value and high volume of individual transactions. 

We have identified a key audit matter over the recoverability of the parent company’s two investments in subsidiaries (2022: one investment). 
The recoverability of the investments is not at a high risk of significant misstatement or subject to significant judgement. However, due to its 
materiality in the context of the Parent Company financial statements, this is the area that had the greatest effect on our overall Parent 
Company audit.

Audit Committee interaction
During the year, the Audit Committee met 4 times. KPMG are invited to attend all Audit Committee meetings and are provided with an 
opportunity to meet with the Audit Committee in private sessions without the Executive Directors being present. For each key audit matter, 
we have set out communications with the Audit Committee in section 4, including matters that required particular judgement for each. 

The matters included in the Audit Committee Chair’s report on page 70 are materially consistent with our observations of those meetings. 

Our independence
We have fulfilled our ethical responsibilities under, and we remain independent of the Group in accordance with UK ethical requirements 
including the FRC Ethical Standard as applied to listed public interest entities.

We have not performed any non-audit services during FY23 or subsequently which are prohibited by the FRC Ethical Standard. 

We were first appointed as auditor by the shareholders for the year ended 31 March 2017. The period of total uninterrupted engagement is for 
the seven financial years ended 31 March 2023.

The Group engagement partner is required to rotate every five years. As these are the third set of the Group’s financial statements signed by 
David Derbyshire, he will be required to rotate off after the FY25 audit.

The Group engagement partner is also responsible for component audits as set out in section 7 and has had a tenure of three years.

Materiality 
(Item 6)
The scope of our work is influenced by our view  
of materiality and our assessed risk of material 
misstatement. 

We have determined overall materiality for the  
Group financial statements as a whole at £14.0m 
(FY22: £15.0m). 

Consistent with FY22, we determined that profit 
before tax remains the benchmark for the Group.  
As such, we based our Group materiality on profit 
before tax of which it represents 4.8% (FY22: 5.0%). 

Materiality for the parent company financial 
statements as a whole was set at £13.0m (2022: 
£6.1m), determined with reference to a benchmark  
of total assets, limited to be less than materiality  
for group materiality as a whole. It represents 0.75% 
(2022: 0.5%) of the stated benchmark.

Group scope 
(Item 7)
We have performed risk assessment and planning procedures to determine which of the Group’s components are likely to include  
risks of material misstatement to the Group financial statements and the type of procedures to be performed at these components.

Of the Group’s 6 (FY22: 5) reporting components, we subjected 1 (FY22: 3) to a full scope audit for Group purposes. The audit of this 
component and the audit of the parent company was performed by the Group team.

In addition, we have performed Group level analysis on the remaining components to determine whether further risks of material 
misstatement exist in those components. 

We consider the scope of our audit, as communicated to the Audit Committee, to be an appropriate basis for our audit opinion.

The impact of climate change on our audit
In planning our audit, we have considered the potential impact of risks arising from climate change on the Group’s business and its Financial 
Statements. The Group has set out its commitments under the Paris Agreement to achieve net zero carbon emissions by 2040. Further information 
is provided in the Group’s Task Force on Climate-related Financial Disclosures (‘TCFD’) recommended disclosures on pages 30 to 37. 

As a part of our audit we have performed a risk assessment, including making enquiries of management, reading board meeting minutes 
and applying our knowledge of the Group and sector in which it operates to understand the extent of the potential impact of climate change 
risk on the Group’s Financial Statements. Taking into account the nature of the business and the limited impact of climate change on the 
assumptions in impairment testing, we have not assessed climate related risk to be significant to our audit this year. There was no impact  
on our key audit matters. 

We have read the Group’s TCFD in the front half of the annual report and considered consistency with the Financial Statements and our audit 
knowledge. We have not been engaged to provide assurance over the accuracy of the climate risk disclosures set out on pages 30 to 37  
in the Annual Report.

3. Going concern, viability and principal risks and uncertainties

The Directors have prepared the financial statements on the going concern basis as they do not intend to liquidate the Group or the Parent 
Company or to cease their operations, and as they have concluded that, the Group’s and the Parent Company’s financial position means 
that this is realistic. They have also concluded that there are no material uncertainties that could have cast significant doubt over their 
ability to continue as a going concern for at least a year from the date of approval of the financial statements (‘the going concern period’). 

Going concern
We used our knowledge of the Group, its industry, and the general economic environment to identify the inherent risks to its business 
model and analysed how those risks might affect the Group’s and Company’s financial resources or ability to continue operations over 
the going concern period. The risks that we considered most likely to adversely affect the Group’s and Company’s available financial 
resources over this period were lower than forecast revenues arising from reduced customer demand in the automotive market. We also 
considered less predictable but realistic second order impacts, such as the erosion of customer confidence, which could result in a rapid 
reduction of available financial resources.

We considered whether these risks could plausibly affect the Group’s liquidity or covenant compliance in the going concern period by 
assessing the degree of downside assumptions that, individually and collectively, could result in a liquidity shortfall, taking into account 
the Group’s current and projected cash and borrowing facilities (a reverse stress test). We also assessed the completeness of the going 
concern disclosure.

Accordingly, based on those procedures, we found the directors’ use of the going concern basis of preparation without any material 
uncertainty for the Group and Parent Company to be acceptable. However, as we cannot predict all future events or conditions and  
as subsequent events may result in outcomes that are inconsistent with judgements that were reasonable at the time they were made, 
the above conclusions are not a guarantee that the Group or the Parent Company will continue in operation.

Our conclusions
•  We consider that the directors’ use of the going concern basis of accounting in the preparation of the financial statements is appropriate;
•  We have not identified, and concur with the directors’ assessment that there is not, a material uncertainty related to events or conditions 
that, individually or collectively, may cast significant doubt on the Group’s or Company’s ability to continue as a going concern for the 
going concern period; 

•  We have nothing material to add or draw attention to in relation to the directors’ statement in note 1 to the financial statements on the use 
of the going concern basis of accounting with no material uncertainties that may cast significant doubt over the Group and Company’s 
use of that basis for the going concern period, and we found the going concern disclosure in note 1 to be acceptable; and

•  The related statement under the Listing Rules set out on page 57 is materially consistent with the financial statements and our  

audit knowledge.

Disclosures of emerging and principal risks and longer-term viability 
Our responsibility 
We are required to perform procedures to identify whether there is a material inconsistency between the directors’ disclosures in respect 
of emerging and principal risks and the viability statement, and the financial statements and our audit knowledge. 

Based on those procedures, we have nothing material to add or draw attention to in relation to: 

•  The Directors’ confirmation within the viability statement on page 57 that they have carried out a robust assessment of the emerging  

and principal risks facing the Group, including those that would threaten its business model, future performance, solvency and liquidity; 

•  The principal risks and uncertainties disclosures describing these risks and how emerging risks are identified and explaining how they  

are being managed and mitigated; and 

•  The Directors’ explanation in the viability statement of how they have assessed the prospects of the Group, over what period they have 
done so and why they considered that period to be appropriate, and their statement as to whether they have a reasonable expectation 
that the Group will be able to continue in operation and meet its liabilities as they fall due over the period of their assessment, including any 
related disclosures drawing attention to any necessary qualifications or assumptions. 

We are also required to review the viability statement set out on page 57 under the Listing Rules.

Our work is limited to assessing these matters in the context of only the knowledge acquired during our financial statements audit.  
As we cannot predict all future events or conditions and as subsequent events may result in outcomes that are inconsistent with judgements 
that were reasonable at the time they were made, the absence of anything to report on these statements is not a guarantee as to the 
Group’s and Parent Company’s longer-term viability.

Our reporting
We have nothing material to add or draw attention to in relation to these disclosures.

We have concluded that these disclosures are materially consistent with the financial statements and our audit knowledge.

4. Key audit matters

What we mean
Key audit matters are those matters that, in our professional judgment, were of most significance in the audit of the financial statements 
and include the most significant assessed risks of material misstatement (whether or not due to fraud) identified by us, including those 
which had the greatest effect on: 

•  The overall audit strategy; 
•  The allocation of resources in the audit; and
•  Directing the efforts of the engagement team. 

We include below the key audit matters in decreasing order of audit significance together with our key audit procedures to address  
those matters and our results from those procedures. These matters were addressed, and our results are based on procedures 
undertaken, for the purpose of our audit of the financial statements as a whole. We do not provide a separate opinion on these matters.

4.1 Identification and valuation of acquired intangible assets (Group)

Financial statement elements

Our assessment of risk

Acquired intangibles £66.5m

 This is a new risk in FY23 as a result of the Group’s 
acquisition of Autorama UK Limited on 22 June 2022.

Our results

FY23: Acceptable

Description of the key audit matter

Our response to the risk

Subjective estimate
On 22 June 2022 Auto Trader Group plc acquired Autorama UK Limited. 

The complete identification and valuation of acquired intangible 
assets is a new significant audit risk of error and a key audit matter. 
This is due to the material values associated with the business 
combination: the judgements relating to the complete identification 
of intangible assets acquired separate from goodwill; and the 
estimates which the Group is required to make to assess the fair 
value of those intangible assets which are separately identified.

Estimation is required in making assumptions relating to the fair value 
of each intangible asset, including: useful economic life; the discount 
rate, and, for the brand intangible asset, the rate of obsolescence 
and the transaction volumes used in forecasting future revenue.

The effect of these matters is that, as part of our risk assessment 
for audit planning purposes, we determined that the fair value of 
separate intangible assets acquired of £66.5m had a high degree 
of judgement and estimation uncertainty, with a potential range of 
reasonable outcomes greater than our materiality for the financial 
statements as a whole. 

In conducting our final audit work, we concluded that reasonably 
possible changes to the fair value of the brand intangible asset  
only had a potential range of reasonable outcomes greater than 
our materiality for the financial statements as a whole.

The financial statements (note 31) disclose sensitivity factors 
estimated by the Group.

Due to the nature of the balance, we expect to obtain audit evidence 
primarily through the procedures described below, rather than 
seeking to rely on any of the Group’s controls. 

Our procedures to address the risk included:

•  Our sector experience: with the assistance of our valuation 

specialists, assessing the completeness of intangible assets 
identified, based on our experience of similar acquisitions, 
including whether separate intangible assets arose from supplier 
relationships (original equipment manufacturers and funders).
•  Methodology choice: with the assistance of our valuation specialists, 
assessing that the valuation methodologies used were in accordance 
with relevant accounting standards and acceptable valuation practice.
•  Benchmarking assumptions: with the assistance of our valuation 
specialists, challenging the key valuation assumptions, such as 
the brand useful economic life, the brand obsolescence rate and 
the discount rate, by comparing them to externally derived data 
and comparable transactions.

•  Benchmarking assumptions: comparing the transaction volumes 

used in the brand valuation revenue assumption to market 
forecasts relating to growth in motor vehicle leasing and electric 
vehicle adoption. 

•  Test of detail: We compared the cost data used in the technology 

asset valuation to the related historic accounting records. 
•  Sensitivity analysis: performing sensitivity analysis on the key 

assumptions noted above.

•  Assessing transparency: assessing the sufficiency of the Group’s 
disclosures in respect of the critical accounting judgment over 
identification of intangible assets acquired and the critical 
accounting estimates relating to the valuation of separately 
identifiable intangible assets and the residual goodwill.

Communications with Auto Trader Group plc’s Audit Committee
Our discussions with and reporting to the Audit Committee included:

•  Whether supplier relationships (original equipment manufacturers and funders) represent a separately identifiable intangible asset.
•  Our approach and conclusion on the appropriateness of valuation methodology; the key assumptions used in the valuation; and the 

adequacy of financial statement disclosures.

Areas of particular auditor judgement
We identified the following as the areas of particular auditor judgement:

•  Determination of whether supplier relationships (OEMs, funders and insurers) represent a separately identifiable intangible asset. 
•  Evaluation of reasonably possible changes to the fair value of the brand intangible asset which had a potential range of reasonable 

outcomes greater than our materiality for the financial statements as a whole.

Our results
We found the Group’s complete identification and fair valuation of intangible assets acquired in Autorama UK Limited to be acceptable.

Further information in the Annual Report and Accounts: See the Report of the Audit Committee on page 70 for details on how the Audit Committee 
considered acquisition accounting as an area of significant attention, page 120 for the accounting policy on Business Combinations, and note 31

Trade revenue

£427.4m £388.3m

   Our assessment is that the risk is similar to FY22,  
reflecting how the majority of the Group’s revenue 
processing is performed and recognised on a  
consistent basis in both years. 

Our results

FY23: Acceptable
FY22: Acceptable

Description of the key audit matter

Our response to the risk

Data processing error 
Trade revenue primarily consists of fees for advertising on the 
Group’s website and related data and access services. There are  
a high volume of transactions, no significant concentration of 
customers and a variety of set packages. Retailers have the ability  
to select the combination of products they receive.

Based on our cumulative audit experience, we have concluded  
that there is not a material judgement or estimation in Trade 
revenue recognition and no significant opportunity for fraudulent 
material misstatement, given the low value and high volume of 
individual transactions. 

We continue to consider Trade revenue recognition to be a key  
audit matter as it is the main driver of the Group’s results and its  
size is reflected in the allocation of our resources in planning and 
executing the audit.

We performed the tests below rather than seeking to rely 
significantly on the Group’s controls, other than bank reconciliations, 
because the nature of the Group’s Trade revenue is such that we 
were able to obtain sufficient audit evidence through substantive 
audit procedures.

Our procedures to address the risk included:

•  Control design and operation: testing the design,  

implementation and operating effectiveness of bank 
reconciliation controls, to provide evidence over reliability  
of cash data used in our tests of detail.

•  Accounting analysis: inspecting contractual terms, including 
modifications agreed in the year, to identify performance 
obligations and determine the timing of revenue recognition.
•  Data comparisons: using computer assisted audit techniques  

to match sales information from the billing system to the 
accounting records.

•  Tests of detail: using computer assisted audit techniques  
to match the entire population of Trade sales transactions 
recorded in the accounts to the billing system and from  
the billing system to cash received and Trade receivables 
(including accrued income) outstanding at the year end.
•  Tests of detail: inspecting the level of credit notes raised  

during the year and after the year end to assess the adequacy  
of the credit note provision and to confirm that Trade revenue 
recognised in the year is not reversed subsequent to year end.

•  Tests of detail: using sampling techniques and substantive 

analytical procedures to test that Trade revenue accrued income 
(being uninvoiced Trade receivables) has been earned in the year 
and is accurately and completely recorded.

Communications with Auto Trader Group plc’s Audit Committee
Our discussions with and reporting to the Audit Committee included:

•  Reporting of the findings from our computer assisted audit techniques, which matched sales transactions between the accounts,  

the billing system, and cash received and trade receivables outstanding at year end.

Areas of particular auditor judgement
We identified no areas of particular auditor judgement.

Our results
We considered the amount of Trade revenue recognised in the year to be acceptable (2022: acceptable).

Further information in the Annual Report and Accounts: See the Report of the Audit Committee on page 70 for details on how the Audit Committee 
considered revenue recognition as an area of significant attention, pages 115 to 117 for the accounting policy on Revenue, and note 5 for 
the financial disclosures on page 124.

Low risk, high value
The carrying amount of the Parent Company’s investments in 
subsidiaries represents 81% (FY22: 71%) of the Parent Company’s  
total assets. The increase in the balance since 31 March 2022 reflects 
a new investment of £198.8m in Autorama UK Limited which has 
been made in the current financial year. The balance of £1,228.4m 
relates to the core Auto Trader Holding Limited subsidiary. 

The recoverability of the investments is not at a high risk of significant 
misstatement or subject to significant judgement. However, due to its 
materiality in the context of the Parent Company financial statements, 
this is considered to be the area that had the greatest effect on our 
overall Parent Company audit.

We performed the tests below rather than seeking to rely on any  
of the company’s controls because the nature of the balance is 
such that we would expect to obtain audit evidence primarily 
through the detailed procedures described.

Our procedures to address the risk included:

•  Assessing methodology: Assessing the Group’s identification  

of whether there are any qualitative or quantitative impairment 
indicators in respect of the investments held. 

•  Compare valuations: Comparing the aggregate carrying amount 

of the investments to the market capitalisation of the Group,  
as a test for an indication of impairment. 

•  Tests of detail: Comparing the carrying amount of each investment 

with the net assets of the relevant subsidiary included within  
the Group consolidation, to identify whether the net asset value, 
being an approximation of its minimum recoverable amount,  
was in excess of its carrying amount and assessing whether the 
subsidiary has historically been profit-making

•  Our sector experience: Evaluating the current level of trading, 
including identifying any indications of a change in expected 
activity, by examining the post year end management accounts 
and considering our knowledge of the Group and the market.

•  Benchmarking assumptions: For the investments where the 

carrying amount exceeded the net asset value, comparing the 
assumptions used in the investment’s budgeted cash flows with 
our knowledge of the subsidiary and the markets in which the 
subsidiaries operate.

Communications with Auto Trader Group plc’s Audit Committee
Our discussions with and reporting to the Audit Committee included:

•  Discussion of growth assumptions within the forecast cash flows relating to Autorama UK Limited. 

Areas of particular auditor judgement
We identified the following as the areas of particular auditor judgement:

•  We identified no areas of particular auditor judgement.

Our results
We found the carrying amount of the investment in subsidiaries to be acceptable (2022: acceptable).

5. Our ability to detect irregularities, and our response 

Fraud: identifying and responding to risks of material misstatement due to fraud

Fraud risk 
assessment 

To identify risks of material misstatement due to fraud (‘fraud risks’) we assessed events or conditions that could 
indicate an incentive or pressure to commit fraud or provide an opportunity to commit fraud. Our risk assessment 
procedures included:

•  Enquiring of directors, the Audit Committee, internal audit and the company secretary and inspection of policy 
documentation as to the Group’s high-level policies and procedures to prevent and detect fraud, including the 
outsourced internal audit function, and the Group’s channel for ‘whistleblowing’, as well as whether they have 
knowledge of any actual, suspected or alleged fraud;
•  Reading Board and other committee meeting minutes;
•  Considering remuneration incentive schemes and performance targets for management and directors, 

including the Group’s share based incentive schemes; 

•  Using analytical procedures to identify any unusual or unexpected relationships; and
•  Consultation with our own forensic professional regarding our fraud risk assessment and the identified fraud risk.

We communicated identified fraud risks throughout the audit team and remained alert to any indications of fraud 
throughout the audit. 

As required by auditing standards and our overall knowledge of the control environment, we perform procedures  
to address the risk of management override of controls, in particular the risk that Group management may be in  
a position to make inappropriate accounting entries. On this audit we do not believe there is a fraud risk related to 
revenue recognition because there is no material judgement or estimation in revenue recognition and no significant 
opportunity for fraudulent material misstatement, given the low value and high volume of individual transactions. 

Risk 
communications

Fraud risks

Procedures to 
address fraud risks

We did not identify any additional fraud risks.

We performed procedures including: 

•  Identifying journal entries to test for all full scope components based on risk criteria and comparing the 

identified entries to supporting documentation. These included those posted to unexpected accounts and 
those posted with unusual descriptions. 

•  Assessing whether the judgements made in making accounting estimates are indicative of a potential bias.

Laws and regulations: identifying and responding to risks of material misstatement relating to compliance with laws and regulations

Laws and 
regulations risk 
assessment 

We identified areas of laws and regulations that could reasonably be expected to have a material effect on  
the financial statements from our general commercial and sector experience and through discussion with the 
directors and other management (as required by auditing standards), and discussed with the directors and other 
management the policies and procedures regarding compliance with laws and regulations. 

As the Group is regulated, our assessment of risks involved gaining an understanding of the control environment 
including the entity’s procedures for complying with regulatory requirements. 

Risk 
communications

We communicated identified laws and regulations throughout our team and remained alert to any indications  
of non-compliance throughout the audit.

Direct laws context  
and link to audit

Most significant 
indirect law/
regulation areas

The potential effect of these laws and regulations on the financial statements varies considerably.

Firstly, the Group is subject to laws and regulations that directly affect the financial statements including 
financial reporting legislation (including related companies legislation), distributable profits legislation, taxation 
legislation, and pensions legislation in respect of defined benefit pension schemes and we assessed the extent  
of compliance with these laws and regulations as part of our procedures on the related financial statement items. 

Secondly, the Group is subject to many other laws and regulations where the consequences of non-compliance 
could have a material effect on amounts or disclosures in the financial statements, for instance through the imposition 
of fines or litigation. We identified the following areas as those most likely to have such an effect: General Data 
Protection Regulation, FCA compliance, competition law, employment law, anti-bribery and anti-corruption, 
money laundering legislation and certain aspects of company legislation recognising the regulated nature  
of the Group’s activities and its legal form.

Auditing standards limit the required audit procedures to identify non-compliance with these laws and regulations 
to enquiry of the directors and other management and inspection of regulatory and legal correspondence, if any. 
Therefore if a breach of operational regulations is not disclosed to us or evident from relevant correspondence, 
an audit will not detect that breach.

Context

Context of the 
ability of the audit  
to detect fraud or 
breaches of law  
or regulation

Owing to the inherent limitations of an audit, there is an unavoidable risk that we may not have detected some 
material misstatements in the financial statements, even though we have properly planned and performed our 
audit in accordance with auditing standards. For example, the further removed non-compliance with laws and 
regulations is from the events and transactions reflected in the financial statements, the less likely the inherently 
limited procedures required by auditing standards would identify it. 

In addition, as with any audit, there remained a higher risk of non-detection of fraud, as these may involve collusion, 
forgery, intentional omissions, misrepresentations, or the override of internal controls. Our audit procedures are 
designed to detect material misstatement. We are not responsible for preventing non-compliance or fraud and 
cannot be expected to detect non-compliance with all laws and regulations.

6. Our determination of materiality

The scope of our audit was influenced by our application of materiality. We set quantitative thresholds and overlay qualitative 
considerations to help us determine the scope of our audit and the nature, timing and extent of our procedures, and in evaluating  
the effect of misstatements, both individually and in the aggregate, on the financial statements as a whole. 

Materiality for the Group financial statements as a whole: £14.0m (FY22: £15.0m)
What we mean
A quantitative reference for the purpose of planning and performing our audit.

Basis for determining materiality and judgements applied
Materiality for the Group financial statements as a whole was set at £14.0m (FY22: £15.0m). This was determined with reference  
to a benchmark of profit before tax. 

Consistent with FY22, we determined that profit before tax remains the main benchmark for the Group as it is the metric in the primary 
statements which best reflects the focus of the financial statements’ users.

Our Group materiality of £14.0m was determined by applying a percentage to profit before tax. When using a benchmark of profit before 
tax to determine overall materiality, KPMG’s approach for listed entities considers a guideline range of 3% – 5% of the measure. In setting 
overall Group materiality, we applied a percentage of 4.8% (FY22: 5.0%) to the benchmark. 

Materiality for the Parent Company financial statements as a whole was set at £13.0m (FY22: £6.1m), determined with reference to a 
benchmark of Parent Company total assets, of which it represents 0.75% (FY22: 0.5%). We increased Parent Company materiality during 
our final audit from £7.0m set at planning to £13.0m to better reflect the risk profile of this entity, whilst still limiting materiality to be less 
than that for Group materiality as a whole.

Performance materiality: £10.5m (FY22: £11.3m)
What we mean
Our procedures on individual account balances and disclosures were performed to a lower threshold, performance materiality, so as  
to reduce to an acceptable level the risk that individually immaterial misstatements in individual account balances add up to a material 
amount across the financial statements as a whole.

Basis for determining performance materiality and judgements applied
We have considered performance materiality at a level of 75% (FY22: 75%) of materiality for Auto Trader Group plc’s financial statements 
as a whole to be appropriate. 

The Parent Company performance materiality was set at £9.8m (FY22: £4.6m), which equates to 75% (FY22: 75%) of materiality for the 
Parent Company financial statements as a whole. 

We applied this percentage in our determination of performance materiality because we did not identify any factors indicating an 
elevated level of risk.

Audit misstatement posting threshold: £0.7m (FY22: £0.8m)
What we mean
This is the amount below which identified misstatements are considered to be clearly trivial from a quantitative point of view. We may 
become aware of misstatements below this threshold which could alter the nature, timing and scope of our audit procedures, for example  
if we identify smaller misstatements which are indicators of fraud. 

This is also the amount above which all misstatements identified are communicated to Auto Trader Group plc’s Audit Committee.

Basis for determining the audit misstatement posting threshold and judgements applied
We set our audit misstatement posting threshold at 5% (FY22: 5%) of our materiality for the Group financial statements. We also report  
to the Audit Committee any other identified misstatements that warrant reporting on qualitative grounds.

The overall materiality for the Group financial statements of £14.0m (FY22: £15.0m) compares as follows to the main financial statement

7. The scope of our audit

Group scope
What we mean
How the Group audit team determined the procedures to be performed across the Group.

Of the Group’s 6 (FY22: 5) reporting components, we subjected 1 (FY22: 3) to a full scope audit for Group purposes. The audit of this component 
and the audit of the parent company was performed by the Group team.

Scope

Full scope audit

Number of components

1

Materiality applied

£13.3m

In addition, we have performed Group level analysis on the remaining components to determine whether further risks of material 
misstatement exist in those components.

The scope of the audit work performed was fully substantive as we did not rely upon the Group’s internal control over financial reporting.

8. Other information in the Annual Report

The Directors are responsible for the other information presented in the Annual Report together with the financial statements. Our opinion 
on the financial statements does not cover the other information and, accordingly, we do not express an audit opinion or, except as explicitly 
stated below, any form of assurance conclusion thereon. 

All other information 
Our responsibility 
Our responsibility is to read the other information and, in doing so, consider whether, based on our financial statements audit work, the information 
therein is materially misstated or inconsistent with the financial statements or our audit knowledge. 

Our reporting
Based solely on that work we have not identified material misstatements or inconsistencies in the other information. 

Strategic report and Directors’ report 
Our responsibility and reporting
Based solely on our work on the other information described above we report to you as follows: 

•  We have not identified material misstatements in the strategic report and the directors’ report;
•  In our opinion the information given in those reports for the financial year is consistent with the financial statements; and 
•  In our opinion those reports have been prepared in accordance with the Companies Act 2006.

Directors’ remuneration report 
Our responsibility 
We are required to form an opinion as to whether the part of the Directors’ Remuneration Report to be audited has been properly 
prepared in accordance with the Companies Act 2006. 

Our reporting
In our opinion the part of the Directors’ Remuneration Report to be audited has been properly prepared in accordance with the 
Companies Act 2006. 

Corporate governance disclosures
Our responsibility 
We are required to perform procedures to identify whether there is a material inconsistency between the financial statements and  
our audit knowledge, and:

•  The directors’ statement that they consider that the annual report and financial statements taken as a whole is fair, balanced  

and understandable, and provides the information necessary for shareholders to assess the Group’s position and performance,  
business model and strategy; 

•  The section of the annual report describing the work of the Audit Committee, including the significant issues that the Audit Committee 

considered in relation to the financial statements, and how these issues were addressed; and

•  The section of the annual report that describes the review of the effectiveness of the Group’s risk management and internal  

control systems.

Our reporting
Based on those procedures, we have concluded that each of these disclosures is materially consistent with the financial statements  
and our audit knowledge. 

We are also required to review the part of the Corporate Governance Statement relating to the Group’s compliance with the provisions  
of the UK Corporate Governance Code specified by the Listing Rules for our review.

We have nothing to report in this respect.

8. Other information in the Annual Report continued

Other matters on which we are required to report by exception 
Our responsibility 
Under the Companies Act 2006, we are required to report to you if, in our opinion: 

•  Adequate accounting records have not been kept by the Parent Company, or returns adequate for our audit have not been received 

from branches not visited by us; or 

•  The Parent Company financial statements and the part of the Directors’ Remuneration Report to be audited are not in agreement with 

the accounting records and returns; or 

•  Certain disclosures of directors’ remuneration specified by law are not made; or
•  We have not received all the information and explanations we require for our audit. 

Our reporting
We have nothing to report in these respects.

9. Respective responsibilities 

Directors’ responsibilities
As explained more fully in their statement set out on page 94, the Directors are responsible for: the preparation of the financial statements 
including being satisfied that they give a true and fair view; such internal control as they determine is necessary to enable the preparation  
of financial statements that are free from material misstatement, whether due to fraud or error; assessing the Group and Parent Company’s 
ability to continue as a going concern, disclosing, as applicable, matters related to going concern; and using the going concern basis of 
accounting unless they either intend to liquidate the Group or the Parent Company or to cease operations, or have no realistic alternative 
but to do so. 

Auditor’s responsibilities 
Our objectives are to obtain reasonable assurance about whether the financial statements as a whole are free from material 
misstatement, whether due to fraud or error, and to issue our opinion in an auditor’s report. Reasonable assurance is a high level of 
assurance, but does not guarantee that an audit conducted in accordance with ISAs (UK) will always detect a material misstatement 
when it exists. Misstatements can arise from fraud or error and are considered material if, individually or in aggregate, they could 
reasonably be expected to influence the economic decisions of users taken on the basis of the financial statements. 

A fuller description of our responsibilities is provided on the FRC’s website at frc.org.uk/auditorsresponsibilities. 

The Company is required to include these financial statements in an annual financial report prepared using the single electronic 
reporting format specified in the TD ESEF Regulation. This auditor’s report provides no assurance over whether the annual financial 
report has been prepared in accordance with that format.

10. The purpose of our audit work and to whom we owe our responsibilities 

This report is made solely to the Company’s members, as a body, in accordance with Chapter 3 of Part 16 of the Companies Act 2006.  
Our audit work has been undertaken so that we might state to the Company’s members those matters we are required to state to them in 
an auditor’s report and for no other purpose. To the fullest extent permitted by law, we do not accept or assume responsibility to anyone 
other than the Company and the Company’s members, as a body, for our audit work, for this report, or for the opinions we have formed.

Strategic reportGovernanceFinancial statementsNotes to the consolidated financial statements

1. General information

Auto Trader Group plc is a public limited company which is listed on the London Stock Exchange and is domiciled and incorporated in  
the United Kingdom under the Companies Act 2006. The Consolidated financial statements of the Company as at and for the year ended  
31 March 2023 comprise the Company and its interest in subsidiaries (together referred to as ‘the Group’). The Group’s principal business 
is the operation of the Auto Trader platforms which form the UK’s largest automotive marketplace.

The Consolidated financial statements of the Group as at and for the year ended 31 March 2023 are available upon request to the 
Company Secretary from the Company’s registered office at 4th Floor, 1 Tony Wilson Place, Manchester, M15 4FN or are available on  
the corporate website at plc.autotrader.co.uk.

Basis of preparation
The Consolidated financial statements have been prepared in accordance with the requirements of the Companies Act 2006 and  
in accordance with UK-adopted international accounting standards.

The Consolidated financial statements have been prepared on the going concern basis and under the historical cost convention,  
except for equity investments which are carried at fair value. 

Functional and presentation currency
The Consolidated financial statements are presented in sterling (£), which is the Group’s presentation currency, and rounded to the 
nearest hundred thousand (£0.1m) except when otherwise indicated.

Basis of consolidation
Subsidiaries are all entities over which the Group has control. Control exists when the Group has existing rights that give it the ability to 
direct the relevant activities of an entity and has the ability to affect the returns the Group will receive as a result of its involvement with 
the entity. In assessing control, potential voting rights that are currently exercisable or convertible are taken into account. The financial 
statements of subsidiaries are included in the Consolidated financial statements from the date that control commences until the date 
that control ceases. 

The acquisition method of accounting is used to account for the acquisition of subsidiaries by the Group. The cost of an acquisition is 
measured as the fair value of the assets given, equity instruments issued, and liabilities incurred or assumed at the date of exchange. 
Costs directly attributable to the acquisition are expensed. Identifiable assets acquired and liabilities and contingent liabilities assumed 
in a business combination are measured initially at their fair values at the acquisition date, irrespective of the extent of any non-controlling 
interest. The excess of the consideration transferred, the amount of any non-controlling interest in the acquiree and the acquisition-date fair 
value of any previous equity interest in the acquiree over the fair value of the identifiable net assets acquired is recorded as goodwill. If the total 
of consideration transferred, non-controlling interest recognised and previously held interest measured is less than the fair value of the 
net assets of the subsidiary acquired in the case of a bargain purchase, the difference is recognised directly in the income statement. 

When the Group disposes of a subsidiary, it derecognises the assets and liabilities of the subsidiary. Any resulting gain or loss is recognised  
in the income statement.

Intercompany transactions and balances between Group companies are eliminated on consolidation.

A joint arrangement is an arrangement over which the Group and one or more third parties have joint control. These joint arrangements 
are in turn classified as: joint ventures whereby the Group has rights to the net assets of the arrangement, rather than rights to its assets 
and obligations for its liabilities; and joint operations whereby the Group has rights to the assets and obligations for the liabilities relating 
to the arrangement.

Associates are all entities over which the Group has significant influence but not control, generally accompanying a shareholding of 
between 20% and 50% of the voting rights. Where significant influence is not demonstrated but the shareholding is between 20% and  
50%, the Group would account for its interest as an investment. All investments are initially recognised at cost and the carrying value  
is reviewed for impairment.

Going concern
During the year ended 31 March 2023 the Group has continued to generate significant cash from operations. The Group has an overall 
positive net asset position and had cash balances of £16.6m at 31 March 2023 (2022: £51.3m). During the year £225.0m was returned to 
shareholders through share buybacks and dividends (2022: £237.1m).

The Group has access to a Syndicated revolving credit facility (the ‘Syndicated RCF’). At 31 March 2023 the Group had £60.0m (2022: nil) 
drawn of its £200.0m Syndicated RCF. The £200.0m Syndicated RCF is committed through to maturity in February 2028.

Cash flow projections for a period of not less than 12 months from the date of this report have been prepared. Stress case scenarios  
have been modelled to make the assessment of going concern, taking into account severe but plausible potential impacts of a severe 
economic downturn and a data breach within the next 12 months. The results of the stress testing demonstrated that due to the Group’s 
significant free cash flow, access to the Syndicated RCF and the Board’s ability to adjust the discretionary share buyback programme, 
the Group would be able to withstand the impact and remain cash generative. Subsequent to the year end, the Group has generated 
cash flows in line with its forecast and there are no events that have adversely impacted the Group’s liquidity.

The Directors, after making enquiries and on the basis of current financial projections and facilities available, believe that the Group  
has adequate financial resources to continue in operation for a period not less than 12 months from the date of this report. For this 
reason, they continue to adopt the going concern basis in preparing the financial statements.

Auto Trader Group plc  Annual Report and Financial Statements 2023

Accounting estimates and judgements
The preparation of financial statements in conformity with UK-adopted international accounting standards requires the use of certain 
accounting estimates and assumptions. It also requires management to exercise its judgement in the process of applying the Group’s 
accounting policies. Estimates and judgements are continually evaluated and are based on historical experience and other factors, 
including expectations of future events that are believed to be reasonable under the circumstances.

Management believe that the estimates and assumptions listed below were significant in the preparation of the Consolidated balance 
sheet at the financial year end. 

Acquisition accounting (judgement and estimate)
The Group acquired Autorama UK Limited (‘Autorama’) in the year. Business combination accounting has been adopted in line with the 
accounting policy in note 2. Judgement was required to determine the acquired intangible assets to be separately identified, as described  
in note 31. In particular, it was concluded that supplier relationships with funders and car manufacturers did not meet the criteria for 
recognition as separate intangible assets and their value would form part of the goodwill arising on acquisition. For those acquired 
intangible assets which are separately identified, principally the Vanarama brand, estimation was then required to determine the 
appropriate methodology, assumptions and data to measure their fair value at the acquisition date.

As also disclosed in note 31, the purchase of Autorama gave rise to a deferred payment in shares of £50.0m, with payment contingent  
on post-acquisition employment and service conditions. This element of consideration payable has been determined to be a post-acquisition 
income statement expense over the period of service, in accordance with IFRS 3. There is no significant estimate relating to the contingency, 
which expires in June 2023.

There are no accounting estimates or judgements at the financial year end which have a significant risk of resulting in a material adjustment 
to the carrying amounts of assets and liabilities within the next financial year. Other accounting estimates and judgements include:

Carrying values of goodwill (judgement and estimate)
The Group tests annually whether goodwill, held by the Group or its joint venture, has suffered any impairment in accordance with the 
accounting policy stated within note 2. Judgement is required in the identification and allocation of goodwill to cash-generating units 
and the recoverable amounts of cash-generating units require the use of estimates (note 13).

2. Significant accounting policies

Changes in significant accounting policies
New and amended standards adopted by the Group
The following amendments to standards have been adopted by the Group for the first time for the financial year beginning on 1 April 2022:

•  Onerous Contracts – Cost of Fulfilling a Contract (Amendments to IAS 37)
•  Annual Improvements to IFRS Standards 2018–2020
•  Property, Plant and Equipment: Proceeds before Intended Use (Amendments to IAS 16)
•  Reference to the Conceptual Framework (Amendments to IFRS 3)

The adoption of these amendments has had no material effect on the Group’s Consolidated financial statements.

Standards, amendments and interpretations to existing standards that are not yet effective
There are a number of amendments to IFRS that have been issued by the IASB that, when endorsed in the UK, will become effective  
in a subsequent accounting period including:

•  IFRS 17 Insurance Contracts
•  Disclosure of Accounting Policies (Amendments to IAS 1 and IFRS Practice Statement 2)
•  Definition of Accounting Estimates (Amendments to IAS 8)
•  Deferred Tax Related to Assets and Liabilities Arising from a Single Transaction (Amendments to IAS 12 Income Taxes)
•  Classification of Liabilities as Current or Non-current (Amendments to IAS 1)
•  Sale or Contribution of Assets between an Investor and its Associate or Joint Venture (Amendments to IFRS 10 and IAS 28)

The Group has evaluated these changes and none are expected to have a material impact on the Consolidated financial statements. 

Existing significant accounting policies
The following accounting policies applied by the Group have been applied consistently to all periods presented in the Consolidated 
financial statements.

Revenue
Revenue is measured based on the consideration specified in a contract with a customer and is recognised when a customer obtains 
control of the services. Revenue is stated net of discounts, rebates, refunds and value-added tax.

Revenue principally represents the amounts receivable from customers for advertising on the Group’s platforms but also includes 
non-advertising services such as vehicle leasing transactions and data services. The different types of products and services offered  
to customers along with the nature and timing of satisfaction of performance obligations are set out as follows:

(i) Trade revenue
Trade revenue comprises fees from retailers, Home Traders and logistics customers for advertising on the Group’s platforms and utilising 
the Group’s services.

Retailer revenue
Retailer customers pay a monthly subscription fee to advertise their stock on the Group’s platforms. Control is obtained by customers 
across the life of the contract as their stock is continually listed. Contracts for these services are agreed at a retailer or retailer group 
level and are ongoing subject to a 30-day notice period. Revenue is invoiced monthly in arrears.

Retailers have the option to enhance their presence on the platform through additional products, each of which has a distinct 
performance obligation. For products that provide enhanced exposure across the life of the product, control is passed to the customer 
over time. Revenue is only recognised at a point in time for additional advertising products where the customer does not receive the 
benefit until they choose to apply the product. Additional advertising products are principally billed on a monthly subscription basis in 
line with their core advertising package, however certain products are billed on an individual charge basis. The Group also generates 
revenue from retailers for data and valuation services under a variety of contractual arrangements, with each service being a separate 
performance obligation. Control is obtained by customers either across the life of the contract where customers are licensed to use the 
Group’s services or at a point in time when a one-off data service is provided.

Contract modifications occur on a regular basis as customers change their stock levels or add or remove additional advertising products 
from their contracts. Following a contract modification, the customer is billed in line with the delivery of the remaining performance 
obligations. A receivable is recognised only when the Group’s right to consideration is only conditional on the passage of time.

Home Trader revenue
Home Trader customers pay a fee in advance to advertise a vehicle on the Group’s platform for a specified period of time. Revenue is 
deferred until the customer obtains control over the services. Control is obtained by customers across the life of the contract as their 
vehicle is continually listed. Contracts for these services are typically entered into for a period of between two and six weeks.

Logistics revenue
Logistics customers pay a monthly subscription fee for access to the Group’s Motor Trade Delivery platform. Control is obtained by 
customers across the life of the contract as their access is continuous. Contracts for these services are agreed at a customer level and 
are ongoing subject to a 30-day notice period. Logistics customers have the option to bid on vehicle moves advertised by retailers on the 
platform. The logistics customer pays a fee if they are successful in obtaining business from retailers through the Group’s marketplace. 
Revenue is recognised at the point in time when the vehicle move has been completed. A receivable is recognised only when the Group’s 
right to consideration is only conditional on the passage of time.

Data revenue
Data customers pay a subscription fee to access elements of Auto Trader’s vehicle database or to access the Fleetware software. Control 
is transferred to customers across the life of the contract where customers have continuous access to the database or the software.

AutoConvert revenue
AutoConvert customers pay a monthly subscription fee to access the AutoConvert platform. Control is transferred to customers across the life 
of the contract where customers have continuous access to the platform and revenue is recognised across this period. Ancillary AutoConvert 
revenues are charged on a per transaction basis and revenue is recognised at the point in time that these services are provided.

(ii) Consumer Services revenue
Consumer Services comprises fees from private sellers for vehicle advertisements on the Group’s websites, and third-party partners  
who provide services to consumers relating to their motoring needs, such as insurance and loan finance. Private customers pay a fee in 
advance to advertise a vehicle on the Group’s platform for a specified period of time. Control is obtained by customers across the life  
of the contract as their stock is continually listed. Contracts for these services are typically entered into for a period of between two and  
six weeks and revenue is recognised over this time. Revenue is also generated from third-party partners who utilise the Group’s platforms 
to advertise their products under a variety of contractual arrangements, with each service being a separate performance obligation. 
Control is obtained by customers at a point in time when the service is provided. Revenue is also generated through Instant Offer, 
providing consumers with a guaranteed price for their vehicle offered by a third-party buyer. The Group’s fee is recognised as revenue 
when the consumer’s vehicle is collected by the third-party buyer.

(iii) Manufacturer and Agency revenue
Revenue is generated from manufacturers and their advertising agencies for placing display advertising for their brand or vehicle on the 
Group’s websites under a variety of contractual arrangements, with each service being a separate performance obligation. Control is 
obtained by customers across the life of the contract as their advertising is displayed on the different platforms. Rebates are present in 
the contractual arrangements with customers and are awarded either in cash or value of services based upon annual spend; an estimate 
of the annualised spend is made at the reporting date to determine the amount of revenue to be recognised. A receivable is recognised 
only when the Group’s right to consideration is only conditional on the passage of time.

Auto Trader Group plc  Annual Report and Financial Statements 2023

Notes to the consolidated financial statements continued(iv) Autorama revenue
Autorama revenue comprises consideration received from the sale of new vehicles and accessories as well as commission received for 
facilitating the lease of new vehicles.

Vehicle & Accessory sales revenue
Vehicle & Accessory sales revenue is generated from new vehicles which are purchased from an original equipment manufacturer (‘OEM’) 
or retailer and then sold to a lease funder. Control is obtained by the funder at a point in time when the vehicle is delivered and revenue  
is only recognised at this point. Additional accessories can be added to vehicles at extra cost upon the request of the funder, and  
control is once again obtained by the funder at a point in time when the vehicle is delivered. Where the Group obtains control of vehicles 
or accessories in advance of selling those goods to a funder, including holding inventory risk, then the Group is acting as principal and 
revenue and cost of sales are reported on a gross basis. Where the Group does not obtain control of vehicles, revenue is recorded as the 
value of the related commission and recognised as described below.

Commission & Ancillary revenue
Commission & Ancillary revenue is generated from commission received from lease funders for facilitating the lease of new vehicles via 
advertisement on the Autorama online marketplace. Control is obtained by the funder at a point in time when the lease is live and revenue 
is only recognised at this point. Ancillary Autorama revenues are charged on a per transaction basis and revenue is recognised at the 
point in time that these services are provided. 

Rebates are present in the contractual arrangements with funders and are awarded in cash based upon the quarterly number of vehicles 
provided. Similarly, rebates are present in the contractual arrangements with OEMs and are awarded in cash based upon the quarterly 
number of vehicles purchased. Revenue is recognised as volume targets are met, when Autorama’s right to consideration is only 
conditional on the passage of time. 

Employee benefits
The Group operates several pension schemes and all except one are defined contribution schemes. Within the UK all pension schemes  
set up prior to 2001 have been closed to new members and only one defined contribution scheme is now open to new employees.

a) Defined contribution scheme
The assets of the defined contribution scheme are held separately from those of the Group in independently administered funds.  
The costs in respect of this Scheme are charged to the income statement as incurred.

b) Defined benefit scheme
The Group operates one defined benefit pension scheme that is closed to new members. The asset or liability recognised in the balance 
sheet in respect of the defined benefit scheme is the present value of the defined benefit obligation at the balance sheet date less the 
fair value of the Scheme’s assets. The defined benefit obligation is calculated annually by independent actuaries using the projected  
unit credit method. The present value of the defined benefit obligation is determined by discounting the estimated future cash outflows 
using interest rates of high-quality corporate bonds that are denominated in the currency in which the benefits will be paid, and that 
have terms to maturity approximating those of the related pension liability. Remeasurement gains and losses arising from experience 
adjustments and changes in actuarial assumptions are charged or credited to equity in other comprehensive income in the period in 
which they arise. Any Scheme surplus (to the extent it can be recovered) or deficit is recognised in full on the balance sheet. Contributions 
paid to the Scheme by the Group have been classified as financing activities in the Consolidated statement of cash flows as there are no 
remaining active members within the Scheme.

c) Share-based payments
Equity-settled awards are valued at the grant date, and the fair value is charged as an expense in the income statement spread over the 
vesting period. Fair value of the awards is measured using Black-Scholes and Monte Carlo pricing models. The credit side of the entry is 
recorded in equity. Cash-settled awards are revalued at each reporting date with the fair value of the award charged to the profit and 
loss account over the vesting period and the credit side of the entry recognised as a liability.

Research and development
Research and development expenditure is charged against profits in the year in which it is incurred, unless it is development that meets 
the criteria for capitalisation set out in IAS 38, Intangible Assets.

Operating profit
Operating profit is the profit of the Group (including the Group’s share of profit from joint ventures) before finance income, finance costs, 
profit on disposal of subsidiaries which do not meet the definition of a discontinued operation, and taxation.

Finance income and costs
Finance income is earned on bank deposits and finance costs are incurred on bank borrowings. Both are recognised in the income 
statement in the period in which they are incurred.

Taxation
The tax expense for the period comprises current and deferred taxation. Tax is recognised in the income statement, except to the extent 
that it relates to items recognised in ‘other comprehensive income’ or directly in equity. In this case the tax is also recognised in other 
comprehensive income or directly in equity, respectively. Management periodically evaluates positions taken in tax returns with respect 
to situations in which applicable tax regulation is subject to interpretation. It establishes provisions, where appropriate, on the basis of 
amounts expected to be paid to the tax authorities.

Current taxation is provided at amounts expected to be paid (or recovered) calculated using the rates of tax and laws that have been 
enacted or substantively enacted at the balance sheet date in the countries where the Group operates and generates taxable income.

Auto Trader Group plc  Annual Report and Financial Statements 2023

117

Strategic reportGovernanceFinancial statements2. Significant accounting policies continued 

Deferred taxation is provided in full, using the liability method, on temporary differences arising between the tax base of assets and 
liabilities and their carrying amounts are included in the Consolidated financial statements. Deferred taxation is determined using tax 
rates and laws that have been enacted or substantively enacted by the balance sheet date and are expected to apply when the related 
deferred tax asset is realised or the deferred tax liability is settled.

Deferred taxation assets are recognised only to the extent that it is probable that future taxable profit will be available against which the 
temporary differences can be utilised.

Deferred taxation is provided on temporary differences arising on investments in subsidiaries and interests in joint ventures, except 
where the timing of the reversal of the temporary difference is controlled by the Group and it is probable that the temporary difference 
will not reverse in the foreseeable future.

Deferred taxation assets and liabilities are offset when there is a legally enforceable right to offset current tax assets against current tax 
liabilities and when the deferred taxation assets and liabilities relate to taxes levied by the same taxation authority on either the taxable 
entity or different taxable entities where there is an intention to settle the balance on a net basis.

Leases
At inception of a contract, the Group assesses whether or not a contract is, or contains, a lease. A contract is, or contains, a lease if the contract 
conveys the right to control the use of an identified asset for a period of time in exchange for consideration. When a lease is recognised in 
a contract the Group recognises a right of use asset and a lease liability at the lease commencement date other than as noted below.

The right of use asset is initially measured at cost, which comprises the initial amount of the lease liability adjusted for any lease prepayments 
made at or before the commencement date, plus any initial direct costs incurred and an estimate of costs to dismantle and remove the 
underlying asset or to restore the underlying asset or the site on which it is located, less any lease incentives received. The right of use asset is 
subsequently depreciated using the straight-line method from the commencement date to the earlier of the end of the useful life of the 
right of use asset or the end of the lease term. The estimated useful lives of right of use assets are determined on the same basis as those 
of property, plant and equipment. In addition, the right of use asset is periodically reduced by impairment losses, if any, and adjusted for 
certain remeasurements of the lease liability.

The lease liability is initially measured at the present value of the lease payments that are not paid at the commencement date, discounted 
using the interest rate implicit in the lease or, if that rate cannot be readily determined, the Group’s incremental borrowing rate.

The lease liability is measured at amortised cost using the effective interest method. It is remeasured when there is a change in future 
lease payments arising from a change in an index or rate, or if the Group changes its assessment of whether it will exercise a purchase, 
extension or termination option.

The Group presents right of use assets in property, plant and equipment and leased liabilities in lease liabilities in the balance sheet.

The Group has applied the recognition exemption of low value leases. For these leases, the lease payments are charged to the income 
statement on a straight-line basis over the term of the lease.

Financial instruments
A financial asset (unless it is a trade receivable without a significant financing component) or financial liability is initially measured at  
fair value plus, for an item not at fair value through profit or loss, transaction costs that are directly attributable to its acquisition or issue. 
A trade receivable without a significant financing component is initially measured at the transaction price.

Under IFRS 9, trade receivables including accrued income, without a significant financing component, are classified and held at amortised 
cost, being initially measured at the transaction price and subsequently measured at amortised cost less any impairment loss.

The Group recognises lifetime expected credit losses (‘ECLs’) for trade receivables and accrued income. The expected credit losses  
are estimated using a provision matrix based on the Group’s historical credit loss experience, adjusted for any macro-economic factors.  
At 31 March 2022, ECLs were adjusted for the macro-economic uncertainty around retailer profitability driven by used car price volatility. 
A consistent level of ECLs has been recorded at 31 March 2023.

The Group assesses whether a financial asset is in default on a case by case basis when it becomes probable that the customer is unlikely 
to pay its credit obligations. The gross carrying amount of a financial asset is written off when the Group has no reasonable expectations 
of recovering a financial asset in its entirety or a portion thereof. For all customers, the Group individually makes an assessment with 
respect to the timing and amount of write-off based on whether there is a reasonable expectation of recovery. The Group expects no 
significant recovery from the amount written off. However, financial assets that are written off could still be subject to enforcement 
activities in order to comply with the Group’s procedures for recovery of amounts due.

At each reporting date, the Group assesses whether financial assets carried at amortised cost are credit-impaired. A financial asset  
is ‘credit-impaired’ when one or more events that have a detrimental impact on the estimated future cash flows of the financial asset 
have occurred.

Financial liabilities are classified as measured at amortised cost or fair value through profit and loss. A financial liability is classified as at fair 
value through profit and loss if it is classified as held-for-trading, it is a derivative, or it is designated as such on initial recognition and measured 
at fair value and net gains and losses, including any interest expense, are recognised in profit or loss. Other financial liabilities, including trade 
payables, are subsequently measured at amortised cost using the effective interest method. Interest expense and foreign exchange gains and 
losses are recognised in profit or loss. Any gain or loss on derecognition is also recognised in profit or loss.

Auto Trader Group plc  Annual Report and Financial Statements 2023

Notes to the consolidated financial statements continuedIntangible assets
a) Goodwill
Goodwill represents the excess cost of an acquisition over the fair value of the Group’s share of the net identifiable assets of the acquired 
subsidiary at the date of acquisition. Goodwill is tested annually for impairment and is carried at cost less accumulated impairment  
losses. Impairment losses are charged to the income statement and are not reversed. The gain or loss on the disposal of an entity includes  
the carrying amount of goodwill relating to the entity sold. Goodwill is allocated to cash-generating units for the purpose of impairment testing. 
The allocation is made to those cash-generating units that are expected to benefit from the business combination in which the goodwill arose.

b) Trademarks, trade names, technology, non-compete agreements, customer relationships, franchise buybacks, brands and databases
Separately acquired trademarks, trade names, technology and customer relationships are recognised at historical cost. They have  
a finite useful life and are carried at cost less accumulated amortisation. Amortisation is calculated using the straight-line method to 
allocate the cost over their estimated useful lives of between one and 15 years. Trademarks, trade names, technology, non-compete 
agreements, customer relationships, franchise buybacks, brands and databases acquired in a business combination are recognised  
at fair value at the acquisition date and subsequently amortised.

c) Software
Acquired computer software controlled by the Group is capitalised at cost, including any costs to bring it into use, and is carried at cost less 
accumulated amortisation. Amortisation is calculated using the straight-line method to allocate the cost over the estimated useful life  
of three to five years.

d) Software and website development costs and financial systems
Development costs that are directly attributable to the design and testing of identifiable and unique software products,  
websites and systems controlled by the Group are recognised as intangible assets when the following criteria are met:

•  it is technically feasible to complete the software product or website so that it will be available for use;
•  management intends to complete the software product or website and use or sell it;
•  there is an ability to use or sell the software product or website;
•  it can be demonstrated how the software product or website will generate probable future economic benefits;
•  adequate technical, financial and other resources to complete the development and to use or sell the software product or website  

are available; and

•  the expenditure attributable to the software product or website during its development can be reliably measured.

Directly attributable costs that are capitalised as part of the software product, website or system include employee and contractor 
costs. Other development expenditures that do not meet these criteria, as well as ongoing maintenance and costs associated with 
routine upgrades and enhancements, are recognised as an expense as incurred. Development costs for software, websites and systems 
are carried at cost less accumulated amortisation and are amortised over their useful lives (not exceeding 10 years) at the point at which 
they come into use.

Licence agreements to use cloud software provided as a service are treated as service contracts and expensed in the Group income 
statement, unless the Group has both a contractual right to take possession of the software at any time without significant penalty, and the 
ability to run the software independently of the host vendor. In such cases the licence agreement is capitalised as software within intangible 
assets. Implementation costs are expensed unless implementation is a distinct service and gives rise to a separate intangible asset.

Property, plant and equipment
All property, plant and equipment is stated at historical cost less accumulated depreciation and impairment losses. Historical cost 
comprises the purchase price of the asset and expenditure directly attributable to the acquisition of the item.

Freehold land is not depreciated. Depreciation on other assets is calculated using the straight-line method to allocate their cost less their 
estimated residual values over the estimated useful lives as follows:

Land, buildings and leasehold improvements:

•  Leasehold land and buildings 
•  Leasehold improvements 
•  Plant and equipment 

life of lease
life of lease
3–10 years

The assets’ residual values and useful lives are reviewed, and adjusted if appropriate, at each balance sheet date. The carrying value of 
assets is reviewed for impairment if events or changes in circumstances suggest that the carrying value may not be recoverable. Assets will 
be written down to their recoverable amount if lower than the carrying value, and any impairment is charged to the income statement.

Gains and losses on disposals are determined by comparing the proceeds with the carrying amount and are recognised in the income 
statement within administrative expenses.

Impairment of non-financial assets
Assets that have an indefinite useful life, for example goodwill, are not subject to amortisation and are tested annually for impairment. 
Assets that are subject to amortisation and depreciation are reviewed for impairment whenever events or changes in circumstances 
indicate that the carrying amount may not be recoverable. An impairment loss is recognised for the amount by which the asset’s carrying 
amount exceeds its recoverable amount. The recoverable amount is the higher of an asset’s fair value less costs to sell and value in use. 
For the purposes of assessing impairment, assets are grouped at the lowest levels for which there are separately identifiable cash flows 
(cash-generating units). Non-financial assets other than goodwill that have suffered an impairment are reviewed for possible reversal  
of the impairment at each reporting date.

Auto Trader Group plc  Annual Report and Financial Statements 2023

Strategic reportGovernanceFinancial statements 
 
2. Significant accounting policies continued

In assessing value in use, the estimated future cash flows are discounted to their present value using a pre-tax discount rate that reflects 
current market assessments of the time value of money and the risks specific to the asset. For an asset that does not generate largely 
independent cash flows, the recoverable amount is determined for the cash-generating unit to which the asset belongs.

Impairment losses recognised in respect of cash-generating units are allocated first to reduce the carrying amount of any goodwill allocated 
to the cash-generating unit (or group of units) and then to reduce the carrying amount of other assets in the unit (or group of units)  
on a pro-rata basis.

Business combinations
The Group accounts for business combinations using the acquisition method under IFRS 3. See note 1 for further details.

Interests in joint ventures
Under IFRS 11, investments in joint arrangements are classified as either joint operations or joint ventures depending on the contractual 
rights and obligations of each investor. Auto Trader Group plc has assessed the nature of its joint arrangements and determined them  
to be joint ventures. Joint ventures are accounted for using the equity method. Under the equity method of accounting, interests in joint 
ventures are initially recognised at cost and adjusted thereafter to recognise the Group’s share of the post-acquisition profits or losses, 
movements in other comprehensive income and dividends received.

Cash and cash equivalents
Cash and cash equivalents include cash in hand and short-term deposits held on call with banks.

Inventories
Inventory is measured at the lower of cost and net realisable value, being the estimated selling price less costs to complete and sell.  
Cost is based on the cost of purchase on a first in, first out basis. 

Borrowings
Borrowings are recognised initially at fair value, net of transaction costs incurred, and are subsequently carried at amortised cost,  
with any difference between the proceeds (net of transaction costs) and the redemption value being recognised in the income statement 
over the period of the borrowings using the effective interest method.

Finance and issue costs associated with the borrowings are charged to the income statement using the effective interest rate method 
from the date of issue over the estimated life of the borrowings to which the costs relate.

Borrowings are derecognised when the contractual obligation is discharged, cancelled or expires. Where an existing financial liability is 
replaced by another from the same lender on substantially different terms, or the terms of an existing liability are substantially modified, 
such an exchange or modification is treated as a derecognition of the original liability and the recognition of a new liability, such that the 
difference in respective carrying amounts together with any costs or fees incurred are recognised in the income statement.

Borrowings are classified as current liabilities unless the Group has an unconditional right to defer settlement of the liability for at least  
12 months after the balance sheet date.

Vehicle financing
A vehicle stocking loan is a financing arrangement which is used to purchase new and used vehicles prior to re-sale. This financing 
arrangement can only be used for this purpose, typically has a maturity of 180 days or less and is repayable on the earliest of the vehicle 
delivery date or the maturity date. Based on these factors, the Group recognises these arrangements as financial liabilities within trade 
and other payables.

Provisions
A provision is recognised when a present legal or constructive obligation exists at the balance sheet date as a result of a past event,  
it is probable that an outflow of resources will be required to settle the obligation and a reliable estimate of that obligation can be made. 
Where there are a number of similar obligations, the likelihood that an outflow will be required in settlement is determined by considering  
the class of obligations as a whole. If the effect is material, provisions are determined by discounting the expected future cash flows  
at a pre-tax rate that reflects current market assessments of the time value of money and, where appropriate, the risks specific to  
the obligation.

Contingent liabilities are not recognised but are disclosed unless an outflow of resources is remote. Contingent assets are not 
recognised but are disclosed where an inflow of economic benefits is probable.

Share capital
Ordinary shares are classified as equity. Incremental costs directly attributable to the issue of new shares are shown in equity as a 
deduction from the proceeds.

Where the Group purchases its own equity share capital, the consideration paid is deducted from equity attributable to the Group’s 
shareholders. Where such shares are subsequently cancelled, the nominal value of the shares repurchased is deducted from share 
capital and transferred to a capital redemption reserve. Where the Group purchases its own equity share capital to hold in treasury,  
the consideration paid for the shares is shown as own shares held within equity.

120

Auto Trader Group plc  Annual Report and Financial Statements 2023

Notes to the consolidated financial statements continuedShares held by Employee Share Option Trust
The Employee Share Option Trust (‘ESOT’) provides for the issue of shares to Group employees principally under share option schemes. 
The Group has control of the ESOT and therefore consolidates the ESOT in the Group financial statements. Accordingly, shares in the 
Company held by the ESOT are included in the balance sheet at cost as a deduction from equity.

Share premium
The amount subscribed for the ordinary shares in excess of the nominal value of these new shares is recorded in share premium.  
Costs that directly relate to the issue of ordinary shares are deducted from share premium net of corporation tax.

Capital reorganisation reserve
The capital reorganisation reserve arose on consolidation as a result of the share-for-share exchange on 24 March 2015. It represents the 
difference between the nominal value of shares issued by Auto Trader Group plc in this transaction and the share capital and reserves  
of Auto Trader Holding Limited.

Capital redemption reserve
The capital redemption reserve arises from the purchase and subsequent cancellation of the Group’s own equity share capital.

Other reserves
Other reserves include the currency translation reserve on the consolidation of entities whose functional currency is other than sterling, 
and other amounts which arose on the initial common control transaction that formed the Group.

Earnings per share
The Group presents basic and diluted earnings per share (‘EPS’) for its ordinary shares. Basic EPS is calculated by dividing the profit 
attributable to ordinary shareholders by the weighted average number of ordinary shares outstanding during the period. For diluted  
EPS, the weighted average number of ordinary shares is adjusted to assume conversion of all dilutive potential ordinary shares.

Dividend distribution
Dividend distribution to the Company’s shareholders is recognised as a liability in the Group’s financial statements in the period in which 
the dividend is approved by the Company’s shareholders in the case of final dividends, or the date at which they are paid in the case  
of interim dividends.

Segment reporting
Operating segments are reported in a manner consistent with the internal reporting provided to the chief operating decision-maker.  
The chief operating decision-maker, who is responsible for allocating resources and assessing performance of the operating segments, 
has been identified as the Operational Leadership Team that makes strategic decisions (note 4).

Foreign currency translation
a) Transactions and balances
Foreign currency transactions are translated into the functional currency using the exchange rates prevailing at the dates of the 
transactions. Foreign exchange gains and losses resulting from the settlement of such transactions and from the translation at the 
period end exchange rates of monetary assets and liabilities denominated in foreign currencies are recognised in the income statement 
within administrative expenses.

b) Foreign operations
The results and financial position of all Group entities (none of which has the currency of a hyper-inflationary economy) that have  
a functional currency other than sterling are translated into sterling as follows:

•  assets and liabilities for each balance sheet presented are translated at the closing rate at the date of that balance sheet; and
•  income and expenses for each income statement are translated at average exchange rates.

These foreign currency differences are recognised in other comprehensive income and the translation reserve within other reserves.

On the disposal of a foreign operation, the cumulative exchange differences that were recorded in equity are recognised in the income 
statement as part of the gain or loss on sale. Goodwill and fair value adjustments arising on the acquisition of a foreign entity are treated 
as assets and liabilities of the foreign entity and translated at the closing rate.

Fair value measurement
‘Fair value’ is the price that would be received to sell an asset or paid to transfer a liability in an orderly transaction between market 
participants at the measurement date in the principal or, in its absence, the most advantageous market to which the Group has access  
at that date. The fair value of a liability reflects its non-performance risk. A number of the Group’s accounting policies and disclosures 
require the measurement of fair values, for both financial and non-financial assets and liabilities. When one is available, the Group 
measures the fair value of an instrument using the quoted price in an active market for that instrument. If there is no quoted price in an 
active market, then the Group uses valuation techniques that maximise the use of relevant observable outputs and minimise the use of 
unobservable outputs. The chosen valuation technique incorporates all of the factors that market participants would take into account 
in pricing a transaction.

Strategic reportGovernanceFinancial statements3. Risk and capital management

Overview
In the course of its business the Group is exposed to market risk, credit risk and liquidity risk from its use of financial instruments.  
This note presents information about the Group’s exposure to each of the below risks, the Group’s objectives, policies and processes  
for measuring and managing risk and the Group’s management of capital. Further quantitative disclosures are included throughout 
these Consolidated financial statements.

The Group’s overall risk management strategy is to minimise potential adverse effects on the financial performance and net assets of 
the Group. These policies are set and reviewed by senior finance management and all significant financing transactions are authorised 
by the Board of Directors.

Market risk
i. Foreign exchange risk
The Group has no significant foreign exchange risk as 99% of the Group’s revenue and 99% of costs are sterling-denominated. As the 
amounts are not significant, no sensitivity analysis has been presented.

During the year the Group sold one of its subsidiaries, Webzone Limited, which traded in the Republic of Ireland under the Carzone brand. 
Following the sale of Webzone Limited, all of the Group’s revenue and costs are sterling-denominated.

ii. Interest rate risk
The Group’s interest rate risk arises from long-term borrowings under the Syndicated RCF with floating rates of interest linked to SONIA. 
The Group monitors interest rates on an ongoing basis but does not currently hedge interest rate risk. The variation of 100 basis points in 
the interest rate of floating rate financial liabilities (with all other variables held constant) will increase or decrease post-tax profit for the 
year by £0.4m (2022: £0.0m).

Credit risk
Credit risk is the risk of financial loss to the Group if a customer or banking institution fails to meet its contractual obligations.

i. Trade receivables
Credit risk relating to trade receivables is managed centrally and the credit risk for new Auto Trader customers is analysed before 
standard payment terms and conditions are offered. Policies and procedures exist to ensure that Auto Trader’s existing customers have 
an appropriate credit history and a significant number of balances are collected via direct debit. In March, more than 87.4% (2022: 87.4%) 
of Auto Trader’s retailer customers paid via monthly direct debit, minimising the risk of non-payment. Sales to private individuals using 
Auto Trader are primarily settled in advance using major debit or credit cards which removes the risk in this area.

Autorama’s main customers are funders who do not change regularly, so the risk in this area is also minimal.

The Group establishes an expected credit loss that represents its estimate of losses in respect of trade and other receivables.  
Further details of these are given in note 32.

Overall, the Group considers that it is not exposed to a significant amount of either customer credit or bad debt risk, due to the 
fragmented nature of the customer base and the robust nature of the used car market.

ii. Cash and cash equivalents
As at 31 March 2023, the Group held cash and cash equivalents of £16.6m (2022: £51.3m). The cash and cash equivalents are held with bank 
and financial institution counterparties, which are rated between P-1 and P-2 based on Moody’s ratings. The Group’s treasury policy is  
to monitor cash, and when applicable deposit balances, on a daily basis and to manage counterparty risk, whilst also ensuring efficient 
management of the Group’s Syndicated RCF.

Liquidity risk
Liquidity risk is the risk that the Group will encounter difficulties in meeting the obligations associated with its financial liabilities that are 
settled by delivering cash. The Group’s approach to managing liquidity is to ensure, as far as possible, that it will always have sufficient 
liquidity to meet its liabilities when due, under both normal and stressed conditions, without incurring unacceptable losses or risking 
damage to the Group’s reputation.

Cash flow forecasting is performed centrally by the Director of Group Finance. Rolling forecasts of the Group’s liquidity requirements  
are monitored to ensure it has sufficient cash to meet operational needs. The Group’s revenue model is largely subscription-based,  
which results in a regular level of cash conversion allowing it to service working capital requirements.

The Group has access to a Syndicated RCF which has total commitments of £200.0m. The £200.0m Syndicated RCF is committed through 
to maturity in February 2028. The facility allows the Group access to cash at one working day’s notice. At 31 March 2023, £60.0m was 
drawn under the Syndicated RCF (2022: £nil).

The Group has access to a vehicle stocking loan, with a limit of £12.0m. This financing arrangement can only be used to fund the purchase 
of new and used vehicles prior to re-sale and has a maturity of 180 days or less. The loan is repayable on the earliest of the vehicle delivery 
date or the maturity date. At 31 March 2023, £3.0m was recognised in the Consolidated balance sheet (2022: £nil).

The Group considers capital to be net debt plus total equity. Net debt is calculated as total bank debt, other loans, vehicle stocking loans 
and lease financing, less cash and cash equivalents as shown in note 20. Total equity is as shown in the Consolidated balance sheet.

The calculation of total capital is shown in the table below:

The objectives for managing capital are to safeguard the Group’s ability to continue as a going concern, in order to provide returns for 
shareholders and benefits for other stakeholders and to maintain an efficient cost of capital structure. To maintain or adjust the capital 
structure, the Group may pay dividends, return capital through share buybacks, issue new shares or take other steps to increase share 
capital and reduce or increase debt facilities.

As at 31 March 2023, the Group had borrowings of £60.0m (2022: £nil) through its Syndicated RCF. Interest is payable on this facility at a rate 
of SONIA plus a margin of between 1.2% and 2.1% depending on the consolidated leverage ratio of Auto Trader Group plc and its subsidiaries, 
which is calculated and reviewed on a biannual basis. The Group remains in compliance with its banking covenants.

4. Segmental information

IFRS 8 ‘Operating segments’ requires the Group to determine its operating segments based on information which is provided internally. 
Based on the internal reporting information and management structures within the Group, it has been determined that there are two 
operating segments (2022: one operating segment). The acquisition of Autorama in June 2022 has led to Autorama being reported as  
a separate segment during the period. The Group’s reportable operating segments have therefore been identified as follows:

•  Auto Trader: includes the results of Auto Trader, AutoConvert and Webzone in respect of online classified advertising of motor vehicles 
and other related products and services in the digital automotive marketplace including share of profit from the Dealer Auction joint 
venture.

•  Autorama: the results of Autorama in respect of a marketplace for leasing new vehicles and other related products and services.

Management has determined that there are two operating segments in line with the nature in which the Group is managed. The reports 
reviewed by the Operational Leadership Team (‘OLT’), which is the chief operating decision-maker (‘CODM’) for both segments, split out 
operating performance by segment. The OLT is made up of the Executive Directors and Key Management and is responsible for the strategic 
decision-making of the Group. Revenue and cost streams for each operating segment are largely independent in the reporting period.

The OLT primarily uses the measures of Revenue and Operating profit to assess the performance of each operating segment. The revenue 
from external parties reported to the OLT is measured in a manner consistent with that in the income statement. There are no inter-segment 
revenues in the current or comparative periods. 

Analysis of the Group’s revenue and results for both reportable segments, with a reconciliation to Group profit before tax, is shown below:

In the current year, the Group has classified expenditure by nature (2022: by function). The change, which is presented consistently for  
the current and prior year in this note, has been adopted to provide more meaningful information about the Group’s expenditure following 
the Autorama acquisition. In the prior year, all expenditure was classified by function as administrative expenses.

5. Revenue

The Group’s operations and main revenue streams are those described in these annual financial statements. The Group’s revenue is derived 
from contracts with customers.

Other than disclosed in note 10, all revenues were earned from activities and customers in the United Kingdom.

In the following table, the Group’s revenue is detailed by customer type. This level of detail is consistent with that used by management

Sale of Webzone Limited
On 24 October 2022, the Group announced the sale of one of its subsidiaries, Webzone Limited, which trades in the Republic of Ireland 
under the Carzone brand. The business was sold to Mediahuis Ireland for a consideration of €30.0m. 

Revenue generated from Webzone Limited in the period to 24 October 2022 was £2.9m (year ended 31 March 2022: £4.9m). The disposal  
of Webzone Limited does not represent a discontinued operation under IFRS 5 as the entity was neither a separate major line of business 
or a material geographical area of operation.

A profit on disposal has been recognised in the Group’s Consolidated income statement:

Expenses non-deductible for taxation purposes in the current year principally includes the share-based payment expense relating to the 
deferred consideration and amortisation of intangible assets arising on acquisition of Autorama (note 4). 

Taxation on items taken directly to equity was a credit of £0.4m (2022: £0.1m) relating to tax on share-based payments.

Taxation recorded in equity within the Consolidated statement of comprehensive income was a release of £0.4m (2022: charge of £0.2m) 
relating to post-employment benefit obligations.

The taxation charge for the year is based on the standard rate of UK corporation tax for the period of 19% (2022: 19%).

Deferred income taxes have been measured at the tax rate expected to be applicable at the date the deferred income tax assets and 
liabilities are realised.

On 10 June 2021, Royal Assent to the Finance Act was given to increase UK corporation tax from 19% to 25% from 1 April 2023. Management 
has performed an assessment, for all material deferred income tax assets and liabilities, to determine the period over which the deferred 
income tax assets and liabilities are forecast to be realised, which has resulted in an average deferred income tax rate of 25% being used 
to measure all deferred tax balances as at 31 March 2023 (2022: 20%).

With revenue exceeding £500.0m for the first time, the Group is potentially within scope of the UK’s digital services tax (‘DST’), however 
certain revenue streams, such as vehicle and accessory sales, would be exempt, meaning we do not meet the threshold in financial year 
2023. It is HMRC’s intention that the current UK DST will be repealed during financial year 2024 and replaced with an OECD model for 
which the Group would not be in scope.

For diluted earnings per share, the weighted average number of shares for basic EPS is adjusted to assume conversion of all potentially 
dilutive ordinary shares. The Group has potentially dilutive ordinary shares arising from share options granted to employees and shares 
issued as deferred consideration. Options are dilutive under the Sharesave scheme where the exercise price together with the future  
IFRS 2 charge is less than the average market price of the ordinary shares during the year. Options under the Performance Share Plan,  
the Single Incentive Plan Award, the Deferred Annual Bonus Plan and the Share Incentive Plan are contingently issuable shares and are 
therefore only included within the calculation of diluted EPS if the performance conditions are satisfied.

The average market value of the Group’s shares for the purposes of calculating the dilutive effect of share-based incentives was based 
on quoted market prices for the period during which the share-based incentives were outstanding.

Other intangibles include customer relationships, technology, trade names, trademarks and non-compete agreements. Intangible assets 
which have a finite useful life are carried at cost less accumulated amortisation. Amortisation of these intangible assets is calculated 
using the straight-line method to allocate the cost of the assets over their estimated useful lives (principally between 3 to 15 years).  
The longest estimated useful life remaining at 31 March 2023 is 12 years (31 March 2022: 13 years).

For the year to 31 March 2023, the amortisation charge of £9.2m (2022: £2.6m) has been charged to operating costs in the Consolidated 
income statement. At 31 March 2023, there were no software and website development costs representing assets under construction 
(2022: £nil).

In accordance with UK-adopted international accounting standards, goodwill is not amortised, but instead is tested annually for 
impairment, or more frequently if there are indicators of impairment. Goodwill is carried at cost less accumulated impairment losses.

Strategic reportGovernanceFinancial statements13. Intangible assets continued

Impairment test for goodwill
Goodwill is allocated to the appropriate cash-generating unit (‘CGU’) based on the smallest identifiable group of assets that generates 
cash inflows independently in relation to the specific goodwill. Following the acquisition of Autorama, there are now two CGUs that exist 
in the Group, being the Digital CGU and the Autorama CGU. 

The carrying value of the CGUs is principally the sum of goodwill, property, plant and equipment (including lease assets), intangibles and 
lease liabilities, as follows:

360.8

360.8

Digital 
The recoverable amount of the Digital CGU is determined from value-in-use calculations that use discounted cash flow projections from 
the latest business plan. The carrying value is forecast to be recovered based on less than two years of forecasted cash flows from this 
mature operating business. 

Income and costs within the budget are derived on a detailed ‘bottom up’ basis – all income streams and cost lines are considered and 
appropriate growth, or decline, rates are assumed. Income and cost growth forecasts are risk adjusted to reflect specific risks facing  
the CGU and take into account the market in which it operates. Assumptions, which are not sensitive to change, include revenue growth 
rates, associated levels of marketing support and directly associated overheads. All assumptions are based on past performance  
and management’s expectation of market development. Cash flows beyond the budgeted period of five years (2022: five years) are 
extrapolated using the estimated growth rate stated into perpetuity; a rate of 2.0% (2022: 2.0%) has been used. This is lower than the 
current rate of inflation in the UK but takes account of longer-term considerations. 

The pre-tax discount rate used within the recoverable amount calculation is based upon the weighted average cost of capital reflecting 
specific principal risks and uncertainties. The discount rate takes into account the risk-free rate of return, the market risk premium and beta 
factor reflecting the average beta for the Group and comparator companies which are used in deriving the cost of equity. Other than as 
included in the financial budget, it is assumed that there are no material adverse changes in legislation that would affect the forecast 
cash flows. 

The key assumptions used for the value-in-use calculation are as follows:

Terminal value growth rate

Discount rate (pre-tax)

2023

2.0%

12.8%

2022

2.0%

8.6%

The recoverable amount of goodwill shows significant headroom compared with its carrying value. The level of headroom may change  
if different growth rate assumptions or a different pre-tax discount rate were used in the cash flow projections. There are no changes to 
the key assumptions of growth rate or discount rate that are considered by the Directors to be reasonably possible, which give rise to an 
impairment of goodwill relating to the Digital CGU.

Having completed the 2023 impairment review, no impairment has been recognised in relation to the Digital CGU (2022: no impairment).

130

Auto Trader Group plc  Annual Report and Financial Statements 2023

Notes to the consolidated financial statements continuedAutorama
The Autorama impairment basis is assessed on a fair value basis due to the proximity of the transaction and the pre-integration phase  
of the business at 31 March 2023. 

Goodwill amounting to £92.5m in the Autorama CGU arose on the acquisition of Autorama UK Limited in June 2022. 

The acquisition will enable Auto Trader to establish itself as a leading marketplace for leasing new cars which is set to benefit from:  
the growth of electric cars ahead of the planned future UK ban on the sale of new petrol and diesel cars from 2030; new manufacturers 
entering the UK market; lower take up of company car schemes; and a shift towards new digital distribution models. Leasing provides 
consumers a cost-effective way to access a new car with a model that is consistent with any future move towards usership.

The consideration paid was to acquire the Autorama CGU in an arm’s length transaction. There have been no significant changes identified 
in the Directors’ assessment of fair value arising from factors since acquisition. On this basis, the Directors consider that, as at 31 March 2023, 
a fair value less cost to sell measurement provides the most appropriate and relevant evidence of the Autorama CGU’s recoverable 
amount.

Fair value is based on the price that would be received to sell an asset or paid to transfer a liability in an orderly transaction between market 
participants at the measurement date under current market conditions, less incremental costs directly attributable to the disposal of an 
asset or CGU, excluding finance costs and income tax expense. The valuation viewpoint is from that of a market participant and excludes 
synergies and matters, including taxation, specific to the current owner. An income based fair valuation approach has been used to 
determine fair value using discounted cash flows. The fair value measurement was categorised as Level 3 based on the valuation inputs used. 

The key assumptions used in the estimation of the CGU’s recoverable amount are as follows:

Forecast period

Annual revenue growth during the forecast period

Terminal value growth rate

Discount rate post tax

2023

2024 – 2032

Between 5% and 69% p.a.

2.0%

18.0%

Assessment of the CGU’s fair value reflects long-term assumptions around changing distribution models for new car sales, including new 
electric vehicles, and an increased proportion of vehicles being leased. The key driver of the forecast is the number of new vehicles transacted 
by Autorama onto lease plans, with revenues, including ancillary sales, consequent on each vehicle lease transaction completed. The 
forecasts do not assume a larger new car registration market than in 2019, before the disruption to supply that commenced during the 
COVID-19 pandemic. The key assumption is rather an increase in the current proportion of vehicles which are currently leased through 
brokers and the share of this market achieved by Autorama. In making these estimates, management have had regard to market data 
published by SMMT and BVRLA. In the nine months since the acquisition, Autorama has delivered 6,895 vehicles. Both vans and pickups 
were particularly impacted by supply challenges in the current year.

Revenue growth is spread over the forecast period in line with the new car market outlook. The risk arising from the duration of the 
forecast period and the risk of growth assumptions over new vehicles transacted in this period not being achieved are reflected in the 
higher level of post-tax discount rate applied. 

Whilst an estimate, the comparison between the CGU’s fair value less cost to sell and its book carrying value has headroom at 31 March 2023. 
This headroom arises because of the accounting requirement to expense £50m of the consideration paid to the former owners of Autorama 
as an employee share-based payment over the 12-month period after the acquisition to 22 June 2023 (see note 31). £38.8m of this charge 
has been expensed as at 31 March 2023. 

This headroom results in no impairment charge under the following sensitivity scenarios, all of which reflect the key sources of estimation 
uncertainty in the calculation of fair value:

Lower number of vehicle transactions: The growth in vehicle transactions executed by Autorama, and therefore earnings before interest 
and tax, is at risk of growing at a level lower than the forecast. This sensitivity reduces volumes by 20% for financial year 2024 and financial 
year 2025 to reflect the impact of the risk of lower new vehicle supply caused by manufacturing delays; and

Delay in timing: The timing of growth in vehicle transactions may take longer to realise than the base case forecast due to a slower take 
up of electric vehicles and lease financing; continued disruption to new car supply; and/or a delay in the phasing out timetable of new petrol 
and diesel cars which is currently scheduled for 2030. This sensitivity assumes growth is deferred by one year from financial year 2024; and

Change in discount rate: The post-tax discount rate could increase to a maximum of 21% before the carrying value of the Autorama CGU 
exceeded its recoverable amount.

A maturity analysis of contractual undiscounted cash flows relating to lease liabilities is presented within note 32. The term recognised 
for certain leases has assumed lease break options are exercised. Certain lease rentals are subject to periodic market rental reviews.

During the year, the Group relocated its London office to a new premises and exited its existing lease. In accordance with IFRS 16,  
the difference between the carrying value of the right of use asset and the lease liability at the date of the lease termination (£0.1m)  
was recognised in the Consolidated income statement as a gain on disposal.

In the prior year, the Group entered into a new lease arrangement to rent an additional 16,000 square feet in our Manchester office to 
support the needs of our growing workforce. The Group also extended the term of the existing lease of our Manchester office space. 
These changes resulted in a lease modification under IFRS 16. The right of use assets were increased by £5.1m with corresponding 
adjustments to the lease liability and dilapidations provision.

Joint ventures are contractual arrangements over which the Group exercises joint control with partners and where the parties have rights 
to the net assets of the arrangement, irrespective of the Group’s shareholding in the entity.

The Group owns 49% of the ordinary share capital of Dealer Auction Limited (previously Dealer Auction (Holdings) Limited). The basis of 
the Group’s joint control is through a shareholder agreement and an assessment of the substantive rights of each shareholder, including 
operational barriers or incentives that would prevent or deter rights being exercised.

Net investments in joint ventures at the reporting date include the Group’s equity investment in joint ventures and the Group’s share of the 
joint ventures’ post acquisition net assets. The table below reconciles the movement in the Group’s net investment in joint ventures in the year:

The Group designated the investment in iAUTOS Company Limited as an equity security at FVOCI as the Group intends to hold the shares 
for long-term purposes. iAUTOS Company Limited is an intermediate holding company through which trading companies incorporated  
in the People’s Republic of China are held. The fair value of the investment has been valued at £nil since 2014 as the Chinese trading 
companies are marginally loss-making with forecast future cash outflows.

As at 31 March 2023, the Group’s wholly owned subsidiary, Autorama Holding (Malta) Limited, had an interest in two protected insurance 
cells. During the year, the Group entered into a new arrangement with Atlas Insurance PCC Limited, with the intention of closing the 
existing cell with Advent Insurance PCC Limited once the portfolio transfer had been made to the new cell. This process was not fully 
complete by 31 March 2023, therefore two investments have been recognised. It has designated its investments as equity securities  
at FVOCI as the Group intends to hold the investment in the protected insurance cell for long-term purposes.

The protected insurance cell writes insurance business which relates to Guaranteed Asset Protection insurance and business equipment 
in transit. The interest in the protected insurance cell is not consolidated in these financial statements as a silo, as the cell company has 
retained residual obligations in respect of the cell’s liabilities. Autorama UK Limited is listed as a guarantor to an agreement between the 
cell company and Autorama Holding (Malta) Limited.

Trade receivables are amounts due from customers for services performed in the ordinary course of business. They are generally due 
for settlement within 30 days and therefore are all classified as current. Trade receivables are recognised initially at the amount of 
consideration that is unconditional and has been invoiced at the reporting date. The Group holds the trade receivables with the objective 
to collect the contractual cash flows and therefore measures them subsequently at amortised cost using the effective interest method. 
Included within trade receivables (invoiced) is a provision for the impairment of financial assets of £3.0m (2022: £2.5m).

Accrued income relates to the Group’s rights to consideration for services provided but not invoiced at the reporting date. Accrued income 
is transferred to receivables when invoiced. Included within net accrued income is provision for the impairment of financial assets of £1.5m 
(2022: £1.2m).

Exposure to credit risk and expected credit losses relating to trade and other receivables are disclosed in note 32.

Auto Trader Group plc  Annual Report and Financial Statements 2023

Notes to the consolidated financial statements continuedSyndicated revolving credit facility (‘Syndicated RCF’)
The Group has access to an unsecured Syndicated revolving credit facility (the ‘Syndicated RCF’). Associated debt transaction costs 
total £5.9m, with £3.3m being incurred at initiation and £2.6m of additional costs associated with extension requests.

With effect from 1 February 2023 the Group entered into an Amendment and Restatement Agreement to extend the term of the facility for 
five years from the date of signing and to reduce the capacity of the facility to £200.0m. There is no requirement to settle all or part of the 
facility before the termination date of February 2028.The associated debt transaction costs were £1.6m, of which £1.4m was paid in the 
period to 31 March 2023.

Individual tranches are drawn down, in sterling, for periods of up to six months at the compounded reference rate (being the aggregate 
of SONIA for that interest period) plus a margin of between 1.2% and 2.1% depending on the consolidated leverage ratio of the Group.  
A commitment fee of 35% of the margin applicable to the Syndicated RCF is payable quarterly in arrears on unutilised amounts of the  
total facility.

The Syndicated RCF has financial covenants linked to interest cover and the consolidated debt cover of the Group:

•  Net bank debt to EBITDA must not exceed 3.5:1.
•  EBITDA to net interest payable must not be less than 3.0:1. 

EBITDA is defined as earnings before interest, taxation, depreciation and amortisation, share-based payments and associated NI,  
share of profit from joint ventures and exceptional items. 

All financial covenants of the facility have been complied with through the period.

Loan from other investment
During the year, the Group’s wholly owned subsidiary, Autorama Holding (Malta) Limited, elected to transfer the insurance portfolio held 
in a protected insurance cell with Advent Insurance PCC Limited to Atlas Insurance PCC Limited. As part of this process, Advent Insurance 
PCC Limited issued a loan to Autorama Holding (Malta) Limited to fund the investment in the new protected insurance cell until the portfolio 
transfer was complete. This process is likely to be completed within the next 12 months. As at 31 March 2023, £1.1m was recognised on the 
Consolidated balance sheet (2022: £nil). 

Exposure to interest rate changes

The Group has estimated that £1.5m (2022: £0.9m) of the Group’s net deferred income tax liability will be realised in the next 12 months. 
This is management’s current best estimate and may not reflect the actual outcome in the next 12 months. 

Deferred tax assets acquired through business combinations totalled £6.8m (2022: £nil). This includes £7.7m relating to tax losses offset 
by a £0.9m deferred tax liability linked to a fair value adjustment on freehold property. Recognition is on the basis that there are sufficient 
taxable temporary liability differences at the balance sheet date arising from acquired intangibles which are expected to reverse over 
the same time period that losses are expected to be used.

25. Retirement benefit obligations

(i) Defined contribution scheme
The Group operates a number of defined contribution schemes. In the year to 31 March 2023, the pension contributions to the Group’s 
defined contribution schemes amounted to £3.5m (2022: £3.2m). At 31 March 2023, there were £0.6m (31 March 2022: £0.5m) of pension 
contributions outstanding relating to the Group’s defined contribution schemes.

(ii) Defined benefit scheme
The Company sponsors a funded defined benefit pension scheme for qualifying UK employees, the Wiltshire (Bristol) Limited Retirement 
Benefits Scheme (‘the Scheme’). The Scheme is administered by a separate board of Trustees, which is legally separate from the Company. 
The Trustees are composed of representatives of both the Company and members. The Trustees are required by law to act in the interest  
of all relevant beneficiaries and are responsible for the investment policy for the assets and the day-to-day administration of the benefits.

The Scheme has been closed to future members since 30 April 2006 and there are no remaining active members within the Scheme.  
No other post-retirement benefits are provided to these employees.

Profile of the Scheme
As at 31 March 2023, approximately 42% of the defined benefit obligation (‘DBO’) is attributable to former employees who have yet to 
reach retirement (2022: 57%) and 58% to current pensioners (2022: 43%). The Scheme duration is an indicator of the weighted-average  
time until benefit payments are made. For the Scheme as a whole, the duration is approximately 16 years (2022: 20 years).

Buy-in
In October 2022, the Scheme purchased a bulk annuity policy (known as a buy-in) from Just Retirement Limited (‘Just Retirement’) for £15.4m, which 
was funded by a £1.0m contribution by the Company along with existing Scheme assets. This policy secured the full benefits of all Scheme 
members, which as at the remeasurement date amounted to £13.7m. Given the financial strength of Just Retirement, this buy-in substantively 
removes the risk of further contributions being required from the Company to provide benefits to members, beyond those noted below.

138

Auto Trader Group plc  Annual Report and Financial Statements 2023

Notes to the consolidated financial statements continuedFollowing the buy-in, the Scheme’s assets largely comprise the bulk annuity policy held with Just Retirement, along with a small amount  
of additional assets currently held with LGIM. The Scheme trustees are now working to progress towards a full buy-out, which will involve 
various data and benefits exercises. It is anticipated that the Scheme buy-out will be completed in 2024. Once the buy-out is complete, 
the Scheme has no further purpose and will be wound up.

Funding requirements
UK legislation requires that pension schemes are funded prudently. The ongoing funding valuation of the Scheme was carried out by  
a qualified actuary as at 30 April 2021 and showed a surplus of £1.5m. The Company paid deficit contributions of £0.1m per annum to  
31 January 2022, plus an additional £1.0m in October 2022 in respect of the shortfall versus the buy-in premium. The next funding valuation  
is due no later than 30 April 2024, although it is anticipated that the Scheme will be bought-out and wound-up before the statutory 
deadline for this valuation. The Company expects that a further contribution may be required in the year ending 31 March 2024 in respect 
of the balancing premium, once the data cleansing and benefit rectification is completed. The Company also pays expenses and PPF 
levies incurred by the Scheme.

Risks associated with the Scheme
The Scheme exposes the Company to some risks, although the purchase of a buy-in policy substantially mitigates these.

Asset volatility

Inflation risk

Change in bond yields

The liabilities are calculated using a discount rate set with reference to corporate bond yields. If assets 
underperform this yield, this will create a deficit. The Scheme previously held a significant proportion of 
gilt and bond assets which limits volatility and risk in the short term. The allocation of assets is monitored 
to ensure it remains appropriate given the Scheme’s long-term objectives.

A proportion of the Scheme’s benefit obligations are linked to inflation, and higher inflation leads to  
higher liabilities (although, in most cases, caps on the level of inflationary increases are in place to protect 
against extreme inflation). The majority of the assets are either unaffected by or only loosely correlated 
with inflation, meaning that an increase in inflation will also increase the deficit.

A decrease in corporate bond yields will increase the value placed on the Scheme’s liabilities for 
accounting purposes, although this will be partially offset by an increase in the value of the Scheme’s 
bond holdings.

Life expectancy

The majority of the Scheme’s obligations are to provide benefits for the lifetime of the member,  
so increases in life expectancy will result in an increase in the liabilities.

Assumptions used
The results of the latest funding valuation at 30 April 2021 have been adjusted to the new balance sheet date, taking account of 
experience over the period since 30 April 2021, changes in market conditions, and differences in the financial and demographic 
assumptions. The present value of the defined benefit obligation, and the related current service cost, were measured using the 
projected unit credit method.

The principal assumptions used to calculate the liabilities under IAS 19 are as follows:

Discount rate for scheme liabilities

CPI inflation

RPI inflation

Pension increases

Pre 2004 non GMP

The financial assumptions reflect the nature and term of the Scheme’s liabilities. The weighted average duration of the Scheme liabilities 
at the year end is 16 years (2022: 20 years). This reduction is due to the discount rate increase which is the principal reason for the 
decrease in the value of Scheme liabilities compared with the prior year.

The Group has assumed that mortality will be in line with nationally published mortality table SAPS S3 Heavy tables with CMI 2021 
projections related to members’ years of birth with long-term rate of improvement of 1.5% per annum. No adjustment has been made  
for the possible effects of COVID-19. These tables translate into an average life expectancy for a pensioner retiring at age 65 as follows:

It is assumed that 50% of non-retired members of the Scheme will commute the maximum amount of cash at retirement (2022: 50% of 
non-retired members of the Scheme will commute the maximum amount of cash at retirement).

Past service cost
As part of the data cleansing exercise ahead of the Scheme’s buy-in, two items relating to the Barber window in relation to transferred in 
assets and a slightly later effective date for pension increases were identified. As a result, a £0.5m past service cost has been recognised 
in the Consolidated income statement (2022: £nil). 

Current service costs and past service costs are charged to the income statement in arriving at Operating profit. Interest income  
on Scheme assets and the interest cost on Scheme liabilities are included within finance costs.

Settlement cost
Given the intention is to convert the buy-in policy purchased during the year to a buy-out as soon as possible, a settlement cost of  
£2.2m has been recognised in the Consolidated income statement for the year ended 31 March 2023. The settlement cost represents  
the difference between the value of the liabilities under IAS 19 at the remeasurement date, 31 October 2022, (£13.2m) and the price paid  
to settle the liabilities (£15.4m).

The following amounts have been recognised in the Consolidated statement of comprehensive income:

Return on Scheme assets (in excess of)/below that recognised in net interest

Actuarial gains due to changes in assumptions

Actuarial losses/(gains) due to liability experience

Effect of the surplus cap

Deferred tax on surplus

The Trustees of the Scheme sought legal advice which concluded that the Group has an unconditional right to a refund of surplus from 
the Scheme, if the Scheme were to be run-off until the final beneficiary died. As a result, the Group has concluded that IFRIC 14 does not 
apply, and therefore has recognised the accounting surplus of £0.5m (2022: £3.7m) and an associated deferred tax liability of £0.2m 
(2022: £1.3m) in the Consolidated balance sheet.

Sensitivity to key assumptions
The key financial assumptions used for IAS 19 are the discount and inflation rates. Given that the Scheme’s buy-in policy is valued exactly 
equal to the DBO, changes in the key assumptions no longer have any impact on the net funded status position.

In the year ended 31 March 2017, the Company commenced a share buyback programme. By resolutions passed at the 2022 AGM,  
the Company’s shareholders generally authorised the Company to make market purchases of up to 96,678,535 of its ordinary shares, 
subject to minimum and maximum price restrictions. In the year ended 31 March 2023, a total of 25,261,584 ordinary shares of £0.01  
were purchased. The average price paid was 582.1p with a total consideration paid (including fees of £0.7m) of £148.0m. Of all shares 
purchased, 1,430,372 were held in treasury with 23,831,212 being cancelled. In the year ended 31 March 2023, 12,893 ordinary shares were 
issued for the settlement of share-based payments.

Included within shares in issue at 31 March 2023 are 340,196 (2022: 358,158) shares held by the ESOT and 4,371,505 (2022: 3,826,928) shares

The Group currently operates five share plans: the Share Incentive Plan, Performance Share Plan, Deferred Annual Bonus, Single Incentive 
Plan Award and the Sharesave scheme. All share-based incentives are subject to a service condition. Such conditions are not taken 
into account in the fair value of the service received. The fair value of services received in return for share-based incentives is measured 
by reference to the fair value of share-based incentives granted. Black-Scholes and Monte Carlo models have been used where 
appropriate to calculate the fair value of share-based incentives with market conditions. 

The total charge in the period relating to the five schemes was £6.6m (2022: £6.1m). This included associated national insurance (‘NI’) 
at the rate at which management expects to be effective when the awards are exercised (13.80%), and apprenticeship levy at 0.5%, 
based on the share price at the reporting date.

In addition to this charge, the share-based payment charge reported in this period includes £38.8m relating to deferred share-based 
payment consideration relating to the acquisition of Autorama (see note 31), making a total combined charge of £44.6m (excluding 
associated NI).

During the year, the Directors in office in total had gains of £1.4m (2022: £2.8m) arising on the exercise of share-based incentive awards.

Share Incentive Plan
In 2015, the Group established a Share Incentive Plan (‘SIP’). All eligible employees were awarded free shares (or nil-cost options in the 
case of employees in Ireland) valued at £3,600 each based on the share price at the time of the Company’s admission to the Stock 
Exchange in March 2015.

The weighted average market value per ordinary share for SIP awards released was 578.0p (2022: 622.5p). The SIP shares outstanding at 
31 March 2023 have fully vested (2022: fully vested). Shares released prior to the vesting date relate to those attributable to good leavers 
as defined by the Scheme rules. 

Performance Share Plan
The Group operates a Performance Share Plan (‘PSP’) for Executive Directors, the Operational Leadership Team and certain key 
employees. The extent to which awards vest will depend upon the Group’s performance over the three-year period following the award 
date. Both market based and non-market based performance conditions may be attached to the options, for which an appropriate 
adjustment is made when calculating the fair value of an option. If the options remain unexercised after a period of 10 years from the date 
of grant, the options expire. Furthermore, options are forfeited if the employee leaves the Group before the options vest, unless under 
exceptional circumstances.

On 23 June 2022, the Group awarded 360,695 nil cost options under the PSP scheme. For the 2022 awards, the Group’s performance is measured 
by reference to growth in Operating profit (70% of the award), Revenue (20% of the award) and Carbon reduction (10% of the award) over a 
three-year period to March 2025. 

For other previous awards, the Group’s performance had been measured by reference to growth in Operating profit and Revenue over a 
three-year period, total shareholder return relative to the FTSE 350 share index (2017 and 2020 awards), and diversity progress (2021 awards).

144

Auto Trader Group plc  Annual Report and Financial Statements 2023

Notes to the consolidated financial statements continuedThe fair value of the 2022 award was determined to be the share price at grant date. In previous years, the total shareholder return 
element was valued using the Monte Carlo model. The resulting share-based payments charge is being spread evenly over the period 
between the grant date and the vesting date.

PSP award holders are entitled to receive dividends accruing between the grant date and the vesting date and this value will be delivered 
in shares. The assumptions used in the measurement of the fair value at grant date of the PSP awards are as follows:

Deferred Annual Bonus and Single Incentive Plan Award
The Group operates the Deferred Annual Bonus and Single Incentive Plan Award for Executive Directors, the Operational Leadership Team 
and certain key employees. The plan consists of two schemes, the Deferred Annual Bonus Plan (‘DABP’) and the Single Incentive Plan Award 
(‘SIPA’).

Deferred Annual Bonus
The Group operates a Deferred Annual Bonus Plan (‘DABP’) for Executive Directors. Awards under the plan are contingent on the 
satisfaction of pre-set internal targets relating to financial and operational objectives. The extent to which the awards vest will depend 
upon the satisfaction of the Group’s financial and operational performance in the financial year of the award date (the ‘Performance 
Conditions’). The awards will vest on the second anniversary of the date the Remuneration Committee determines that the Performance 
Conditions have been satisfied (the ‘Vesting Period’). Awards are potentially forfeitable during that period should the employee leave 
employment. The DABP awards have been valued using the Black-Scholes method where appropriate and the resulting share-based 
payments charge is being spread evenly over the combined Performance Period and Vesting Period of the shares, being three years.

On 23 June 2022, the Group awarded 108,704 nil cost options under the DABP scheme (2022: nil). DABP award holders are entitled to 
receive dividends accruing between the grant date and the vesting date and this value will be delivered in shares. The assumptions used 
in the measurement of the fair value at grant date of the DABP awards are as follows:

Single Incentive Plan Award
The Group operates a Single Incentive Plan Award (‘SIPA’) for the Operational Leadership Team and certain key employees. The extent  
to which awards vest will depend upon the satisfaction of the Group’s financial and operational performance in the financial year of  
the award date (the ‘Performance Conditions’). The awards will vest in tranches, with the first tranche vesting on the date on which the 
Remuneration Committee determines that the Performance Conditions have been satisfied, and subsequent tranches vesting on the first 
and second anniversary of this date, subject to continuing employment.

On 23 June 2022, the Group awarded 681,586 nil cost options under the SIPA scheme. For the 2022 awards, 75% of the award value is 
dependent on FY23 Operating profit and the remaining 25% is subject to successful implementation of digital retailing related products 
by 31 March 2023. The fair value of the 2022 award was determined to be £5.31 per option, being the share price at grant date.

The resulting share-based payments charge is being spread evenly over the period between the grant date and the vesting date. SIPA 
holders are entitled to receive dividends accruing between the grant date and the vesting date and this value will be delivered in shares.

The assumptions used in the measurement of the fair value at grant date of the SIPA awards are as follows:

The weighted average market value per ordinary share for SIPA options exercised in 2023 was 601.1p (2022: 646.2p). The SIPA awards 
outstanding at 31 March 2023 have a weighted average remaining vesting period of 1.2 years (2022: 0.8 years) and a weighted average 
contractual life of 8.2 years (2022: 8.6 years). The charge for the year includes an estimate of the awards to be granted after the balance 
sheet date in respect of achievement of 2021 targets.

Sharesave scheme
The Group operates a Sharesave (‘SAYE’) scheme for all employees under which employees are granted an option to purchase ordinary 
shares in the Company at up to 20% less than the market price at invitation, in three years’ time, dependent on their entering into a 
contract to make monthly contributions into a savings account over the relevant period. Options are granted and are linked to a savings 
contract with a term of three years. These funds are used to fund the option exercise. No performance criteria are applied to the exercise 
of Sharesave options. The assumptions used in the measurement of the fair value at grant date of the Sharesave plan are as follows:

Expected volatility is estimated by considering historic average share price volatility at the grant date. The requirement that an employee 
has to save in order to purchase shares under the Sharesave plan is a non-vesting condition. This feature has been incorporated into the 
fair value at grant date by applying a discount to the valuation obtained from the Black-Scholes pricing model.

Purchase of Autorama UK Limited
On 22 June 2022, the Group acquired the entire share capital of Autorama UK Limited (‘Autorama’) for initial consideration of £150.0m,  
with an additional £50.0m deferred until 22 June 2023 and settled in shares to the value of £50.0m, subject to employment and customary 
performance conditions. 

Autorama, one of the UK’s largest marketplaces for leasing new vehicles, is a leading end-to-end digital platform, which aggregates leasing 
deals from multiple funders and OEMs (under its ‘Vanarama‘ brand), enabling buyers to transact online across a wide range of vehicles.

The total consideration of £150.0m excludes acquisition costs of £2.1m which were recognised within costs in the Consolidated income 
statement. The following table provides a reconciliation of the amounts included in the Consolidated statement of cash flows for the period:

Cash paid for subsidiary

Less: cash acquired

Payment for acquisition of subsidiary, net of cash acquired

2023 
£m

150.0

(5.8)

144.2

As the settlement of the deferred £50.0m consideration is subject to a condition for continuing employment to 22 June 2023, the amount  
is not included in the business combination but is recorded as a post-acquisition income statement expense over the period of service, which 
extends to the first anniversary of the acquisition. A charge of £38.8m has been recorded in the period from acquisition to 31 March 2023.

From the period of acquisition to 31 March 2023, Autorama contributed revenue of £27.2m, and a loss of £11.2m to the Group’s results. 
Further analysis is within note 2.

Auto Trader Group plc  Annual Report and Financial Statements 2023

Notes to the consolidated financial statements continuedThe purchase has been accounted for as a business combination under the acquisition method in accordance with IFRS 3. The fair value  
of net assets acquired was assessed and, other than in respect of the intangible assets and related deferred tax, described below,  
no material adjustments from book value were made to existing assets and liabilities. The goodwill calculation is summarised below:

The brand, technology, customer relationships and order book obtained through the acquisition met the requirements to be separately 
identifiable under IFRS 3. Refer to note 2 for further details on fair value techniques for valuing intangibles. 

The business operates under the Vanarama brand name and is one of the UK’s longest running e-commerce brands. The asset was valued 
using the Multi-period Excess Earnings Method and cross-checked using relief from royalty. A useful economic life and obsolescence 
decline period of 10 years was assumed. Revenue forecasts during this period were consistent with those described for Autorama in  
note 13, before adjustment for brand obsolescence. A post-tax discount rate of 14% was applied. This discount rate is lower than that for 
Autorama as a whole at the date of acquisition and reflects factors including the finite brand forecast period, compared to cash flows 
into perpetuity used to support the goodwill. 

The technology is Autorama’s propriety technology which helps manage a complex vehicle lease purchasing process into a streamlined 
online transaction via a customer friendly user interface, which has been developed in-house. The asset was valued using the cost 
approach specifically replacement costs and crosschecked using relief from royalty. The order book is customer orders not yet delivered, 
which is expected to unwind.

The goodwill recognised on acquisition principally relates to value arising from intangible assets that are not separately identifiable 
under IFRS 3. Such assets include the value of the acquired workforce (including technical experience), returning customers, supplier 
relationships with funders and car manufacturers and future market growth opportunities. Customer lists have not been valued separately 
on the basis they are inseparable in their own right from the brand. Supplier relationships are not separately valued on the basis that their 
terms are in line with industry standards of what would be typically agreed with a market participant.

Auto Trader Group plc  Annual Report and Financial Statements 2023

149

Strategic reportGovernanceFinancial statements31. Business combinations continued 

The valuation of the Vanarama brand name is sensitive to a change in the obsolescence rate assumption. An obsolescence profile has 
been assumed which is considered to be a representative curve for a consumer asset in the absence of continued marketing spend, 
showing a slow decline in the early years due to the benefit of historic spend, then decline accelerating in the middle years as consumer 
brand consciousness falls, before slowing in the final years to reflect a slower drop off of residual awareness. Slowing or accelerating 
the assumed rate of obsolescence by one year, with all other factors being unchanged, would increase or decrease the valuation of the 
brand by £14m or £16m respectively. Residual goodwill would be adjusted by an equal and opposite amount, net of taxation. The discount 
rate used in the brand valuation is less sensitive to change, reflecting the finite useful economic life of 10 years and the lower positive cash 
flows in the latter years due to the obsolescence decline.

None of the acquired intangible assets or goodwill is expected to be deductible for tax purposes. A deferred tax liability has been recorded 
on the fair value of the intangible assets recognised, other than goodwill, measured at the substantively enacted UK rate of corporation tax 
from April 2023 of 25%. This deferred tax liability has been debited against and increased the value of goodwill recognised.

Settlement of deferred consideration in relation to Blue Owl Network Limited
In addition, in July 2022, the deferred consideration of £8.1m was settled in respect of the acquisition of Blue Owl Network Limited (‘Blue 
Owl’). On 31 July 2020, the Group acquired the entire share capital of Blue Owl for consideration of £18.2m, of which £8.1m was deferred 
until 31 July 2022.

Notes to the consolidated financial statements continuedExpected credit loss assessment
Expected credit losses are measured using a provisioning matrix based on actual credit loss experience over the past three years and 
adjusted, when required, to take into account current macro-economic factors. For certain customers the Group applies experienced 
credit judgement that is determined to be predictive of the risk of loss to assess the expected credit loss, taking into account external 
ratings, financial statements and other available information. The following table provides information about the exposure to credit  
risk and expected credit losses for trade receivables and accrued income from individual customers as at 31 March 2023.

At 31 March 2022, ECLs were adjusted for the macro-economic uncertainty around retailer profitability driven by used car price volatility. 
A consistent level of ECLs has been recorded at 31 March 2023. Sensitivity analysis has been performed in assessing the expected credit 
loss rate. There are no changes to the rate that are considered by the Directors to be reasonably possible, which give rise to a material 
difference in the loss allowance.

The Group has identified specific balances for which it has provided an impairment allowance on a line by line basis across all ledgers,  
in both years. The allowance accounts in respect of trade receivables are used to record impairment losses unless the Group is satisfied 
that no recovery of the amount owing is possible; at that point the amounts considered irrecoverable are written off against the financial 
asset directly.

The movement in the allowance for impairment in respect of trade receivables during the year was as follows.

Trade and other payables are as disclosed within note 21, excluding vehicle stocking loan, other taxation and social security liabilities and 
deferred income.

IFRS 7 requires the contractual future interest cost of a financial liability to be included within the above table. As disclosed in note 22 of 
these Consolidated financial statements, borrowings are currently drawn under a syndicated debt arrangement and repayments can be 
made at any time without penalty. As such there is no contractual future interest cost. Interest is payable on borrowings’ drawn amounts 
at a rate of SONIA prevailing at the time of drawdown plus the applicable margin, which ranges from 1.2% to 2.1%. Interest paid in the year 
in relation to borrowings amounted to £3.0m (2022: £1.4m).

The Company had no derivative financial liabilities in either year. It is not expected that the cash flows included in the maturity analysis 
could occur earlier or at significantly different amounts.

Liquidity risk
The maturity of financial liabilities based on contracted cash flows is shown in the table below. This table has been drawn up using the 
undiscounted cash flows of financial liabilities based on the earliest date on which the Group is obliged to pay. The table includes both 
interest and principal cash flows. Floating rate interest payments have been calculated using the relevant interest rates prevailing at the 
year end, where applicable.

Analysis of net debt
Net debt is calculated as total borrowings, vehicle stocking loan and lease liabilities, less cash and cash equivalents. Non-cash changes 
represent the effects of the recognition and subsequent amortisation of fees relating to the bank facility, changing maturity profiles,

Strategic reportGovernanceFinancial statementsNotes to the Company financial statements

1. Accounting policies

Auto Trader Group plc is a public limited company which is listed on the London Stock Exchange and is domiciled and incorporated  
in the United Kingdom under the Companies Act 2006. The Company was incorporated on 13 February 2015.

Statement of compliance and basis of preparation
The Company financial statements of Auto Trader Group plc have been prepared in compliance with United Kingdom Accounting 
Standards, including Financial Reporting Standard 101 ‘Reduced Disclosure Framework’ applicable in the United Kingdom and the 
Republic of Ireland (‘FRS 101’) and the Companies Act 2006.

In preparing these financial statements, the Company applies recognition, measurement and disclosure requirements of UK-adopted 
international accounting standards (‘Adopted IFRSs’), but makes amendments where necessary in order to comply with the Companies 
Act 2006 and has set out below where advantage of the FRS 101 disclosure exemptions has been taken.

The Company has applied the exemptions available under FRS 101 in respect of the following disclosures:

•  no separate parent company cash flow statement with related notes has been included;
•  no separate parent company statement of comprehensive income with related notes has been included; and
•  Key Management personnel compensation has not been included a second time.

As the Group financial statements include the equivalent disclosures, the Company has also taken the exemptions under FRS 101  
available in respect of the certain disclosures required by IFRS 2 Share-Based Payments in respect of group settled share-based 
payments, IFRS 13 ‘Fair Value Measurement’ and the disclosures required by IFRS 7 ‘Financial Instruments: Disclosures’.

The Company financial statements have been prepared under the historical cost convention, as modified for the revaluation of  
certain financial assets and liabilities through profit or loss. The current year financial information presented is at and for the year  
ended 31 March 2023. The comparative financial information presented is at and for the year ended 31 March 2022.

The Company’s accounting policies are the same as those set out in note 1 to the Consolidated financial statements.

The Directors have used the going concern principle on the basis that the current profitable financial projections and facilities  
of the consolidated Group will continue in operation for a period not less than 12 months from the date of this report.

The Company financial statements have been prepared in sterling (£), which is the functional and presentational currency of the 
Company, and have been rounded to the nearest hundred thousand (£0.1m) except where otherwise indicated.

As permitted by Section 408 of the Companies Act 2006, an entity profit and loss account is not included as part of the published 
Consolidated financial statements of Auto Trader Group plc. The loss for the financial period dealt with in the financial statements  
of the parent company was £9.0m (2022: loss of £3.2m).

Amounts paid to the Company’s auditor in respect of the statutory audit were £200,000 (2022: £77,000). The charge was borne  
by a subsidiary company and not recharged.

Estimation techniques
The preparation of financial statements in conformity with FRS 101 requires the use of certain critical accounting estimates. It also 
requires management to exercise their judgement in the process of applying the Company’s accounting policies. The area involving  
a higher degree of judgement or complexity, or areas where assumptions and estimates are significant to the financial statements,  
is the carrying value of investments.

The Group considers annually whether there is an indicator that the carrying value of investments may have suffered an impairment,  
in accordance with the accounting policy stated. Where an indicator is identified, the recoverable amounts of investments are 
determined based on value-in-use calculations, which require the use of estimates.

Share-based payments
Share-based payment arrangements in which the Group receives goods or services as consideration for its own equity instruments are 
accounted for as equity-settled share-based payment transactions. The accounting policies of such arrangements are disclosed in note 1 
to the Consolidated financial statements. The fair value of services received in return for share options is calculated with reference to  
the fair value of the award on the date of grant. Black-Scholes and Monte Carlo models have been used where appropriate to calculate 
the fair value and the Directors have therefore made estimates with regard to the inputs to these models. Estimation also arises over the 
number of share awards that are expected to vest, which is based on whether non-market conditions are expected to be met (see note 30 
to the Consolidated financial statements).

Investments in subsidiaries
Investments in subsidiaries are held at cost, less any provision for impairment. Annually, the Directors consider whether any events  
or circumstances have occurred that could indicate that the carrying amount of fixed asset investments may not be recoverable. If such 
circumstances do exist, a full impairment review is undertaken to establish whether the carrying amount exceeds the higher of net realisable 
value or value in use. If this is the case, an impairment charge is recorded to reduce the carrying value of the related investment.

158

Auto Trader Group plc  Annual Report and Financial Statements 2023

Share capital
Ordinary shares are classified as equity. Incremental costs directly attributable to the issue of new shares are shown in equity  
as a deduction from the proceeds.

Where the Group purchases its own equity share capital, the consideration paid is deducted from equity attributable to the Group’s 
shareholders. Where such shares are subsequently cancelled, the nominal value of the shares repurchased is deducted from share 
capital and transferred to a capital redemption reserve. Where the Group purchases its own equity share capital to hold in treasury,  
the consideration paid for the shares is shown as own shares held within equity.

Shares held by the Employee Share Option Trust
Shares in the Company held by the Employee Share Option Trust (‘ESOT’) are included in the balance sheet at cost as a deduction from equity.

Taxation
UK corporation tax is provided at amounts expected to be paid or recovered using the tax rates and laws that have been enacted  
or substantively enacted by the balance sheet date.

Deferred tax is recognised in respect of all temporary differences that have originated but not reversed at the balance sheet date,  
where transactions or events that result in an obligation to pay more tax in the future or a right to pay less tax in the future have occurred  
on the balance sheet date.

A net deferred tax asset is regarded as recoverable and therefore recognised only when, on the basis of all evidence available, it can be 
regarded as more likely than not that there will be suitable taxable profits against which to recover carried-forward tax losses and from 
which the future reversal of underlying temporary differences can be deducted.

Deferred tax is measured at the average rates that are expected to apply in the periods in which the temporary differences are expected 
to reverse based on the tax rates and laws that have been enacted or substantively enacted by the balance sheet date. Deferred tax  
is measured on an undiscounted basis.

Financial instruments
A financial asset (unless it is a trade receivable without a significant financing component) or financial liability is initially measured at  
fair value plus, for an item not at fair value through profit or loss, transaction costs that are directly attributable to its acquisition or issue. 
A trade receivable without a significant financing component is initially measured at the transaction price.

Under IFRS 9, trade receivables including accrued income, without a significant financing component, are classified and held at amortised 
cost, being initially measured at the transaction price and subsequently measured at amortised cost less any impairment loss.

The Company recognises lifetime expected credit losses (‘ECLs’) for trade receivables and accrued income. The expected credit losses 
are estimated using a provision matrix based on the Company’s historical credit loss experience, adjusted for any macro-economic 
factors. At 31 March 2022, ECLs were adjusted for the macro-economic uncertainty around retailer profitability driven by used car price 
volatility. A consistent level of ECLs has been recorded at 31 March 2023.

The Company assesses whether a financial asset is in default on a case by case basis when it becomes probable that the customer is 
unlikely to pay its credit obligations. The gross carrying amount of a financial asset is written off when the Company has no reasonable 
expectations of recovering a financial asset in its entirety or a portion thereof. For all customers, the Company individually makes  
an assessment with respect to the timing and amount of write-off based on whether there is a reasonable expectation of recovery.  
The Company expects no significant recovery from the amount written off. However, financial assets that are written off could still be 
subject to enforcement activities in order to comply with the Company’s procedures for recovery of amounts due.

At each reporting date, the Company assesses whether financial assets carried at amortised cost are credit-impaired. A financial asset  
is ‘credit-impaired’ when one or more events that have a detrimental impact on the estimated future cash flows of the financial asset  
have occurred.

Financial liabilities are classified as measured at amortised cost or fair value through profit and loss. A financial liability is classified as at 
fair value through profit and loss if it is classified as held-for-trading, it is a derivative, or it is designated as such on initial recognition and 
measured at fair value and net gains and losses, including any interest expense, are recognised in profit or loss. Other financial liabilities, 
including trade payables, are subsequently measured at amortised cost using the effective interest method. Interest expense and foreign 
exchange gains and losses are recognised in profit or loss. Any gain or loss on derecognition is also recognised in profit or loss.

Dividend distribution
Dividends to the Company’s shareholders are recognised as a liability in the Company’s financial statements in the period in which the 
dividends are approved by the Company’s shareholders in the case of final dividends. In respect of interim dividends, these are recognised 
once paid.

Subsidiary undertakings are disclosed within note 35 to the Consolidated financial statements. The Company directly owns shares in two 
subsidiaries, Auto Trader Holding Limited and Autorama UK Limited. 

The additions in the year relating to the acquisition of a subsidiary principally relate to the purchase of 100% of the share capital of Autorama 
UK Limited (‘Autorama’) of £150.0m, and a further investment of £10.0m. The remaining additions in the current and prior year relate to 
equity-settled share-based payments granted to the employees of subsidiary companies. 

The recoverable amount of the investment in Autorama has been determined using the methodology and assumptions disclosed in note 13 
to the Consolidated financial statements. There is limited headroom between the recoverable amount and the carrying value of the Autorama 
investment in the parent company due to the requirement to capitalise the £38.8m share-based payment charge relating to deferred 
consideration in the parent company.

No impairment indicators were identified for the investment in Auto Trader Holding Limited.

Cautionary note regarding forward-looking statements
Certain statements in this announcement constitute forward-looking 
statements (including beliefs or opinions). ‘Forward-looking 
statements’ are sometimes identified by the use of forward-looking 
terminology, including the terms ‘believes’, ‘estimates’, ‘aims’, 
‘anticipates’, ‘expects’, ‘intends’, ‘plans’, ‘predicts’, ‘may’, ‘will’,  
‘could’, ‘shall’, ‘risk’, ‘targets’, ‘forecasts’, ‘should’, ‘guidance’, 
‘continues’, ‘assumes’ or ‘positioned’ or, in each case, their negative  
or other variations or comparable terminology. Any statement in this 
announcement that is not a statement of historical fact including, 
without limitation, those regarding the Company’s future expectations, 
operations, financial performance, financial condition and business  
is a forward-looking statement. Such forward-looking statements are 
subject to known and unknown risks and uncertainties, because they 
relate to events that may or may not occur in the future, that may cause 
actual results to differ materially from those expressed or implied  
by such forward-looking statements. These risks and uncertainties 
include, among other factors, changing economic, financial, business 
or other market conditions. These and other factors could adversely 
affect the outcome and financial effects of the plans and events 
described in this results announcement. As a result, you are cautioned 
not to place reliance on such forward looking statements, which are not 
guarantees of future performance and the actual results of operations, 
financial condition and liquidity, and the development of the industry  
in which the Group operates may differ materially from those made  
in or suggested by the forward-looking statements set out in this 
announcement. Except as is required by applicable laws and regulatory 
obligations, no undertaking is given to update the forward-looking 
statements contained in this announcement, whether as a result of new 
information, future events or otherwise. Nothing in this announcement 
should be construed as a profit forecast. This announcement has  
been prepared for the Company’s group as a whole and, therefore, 
gives greater emphasis to those matters which are significant to the 
Company and its subsidiary undertakings when viewed as a whole.
